The rest of our bills are as follows:\n\nMortgage - $800\/per month\nVerizon phone bill - $150\/month\nElectric - $150\/month\nWater - $25\/month\nTV - $125\/month\nInternet - $80\/month (its the only internet provider in our area and I have to have internet for work)\nGas - $150\/month in the winter but only $40\/month in spring\/summer\/fall\nCar insurance - $212\/month\nMy car - $389\/month (We owe about 25 grand on it)\nWifes car - $229\/month (it was a mistake to buy this car and I realize that now because my wife and I rarely drive it and we still owe about 10 grand on it.)\n\nWe only pay the minimum balance on our credit cards and other debt and they are:\n\nVisa #1 - $25\/month Balance $2,000\nVisa #2 -$25\/month Balance $600\nDiscover - $25\/month Balance $800\nAmazon card - $25\/month Balance $600\nBest Buy Card - $30\/month Balance $3,000\nCapital One card #1 - $25\/month Balance $500\nCapital One card #2 - $25\/month Balance $500\nPaypal Credit - $30\/month Balance $1,000\n\nOur only monthly expenses are $500 for groceries and $200-$300 for gas as I have to drive a lot for my job. \n\nAs I was typing all of that I became very embarrassed by the way we have handled our money in the past but we are serious about changing things. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n","12":"[H] Amazon 50$ gc [W] Paypal","13":"Hey guys.\n\nI've lurked here often enough but thought I would post.\n\nI will soon be moving to the uber-expensive silicon valley to start my first ever full-time job. (Huzzah!). I am looking to keep costs low as I pay off debt, so any and all advice is recommended. The job pays about 60k, which I gather is on the low end, but not unreasonably low for silicon valley. ~25k student debt, so I'd like to start chipping away at that ASAP.\n\nAnything related to starting life as a \"real person\", living in the overpriced Silicon Valley area, or general finances are welcome. I am also posting to personalfinance and sanjose subreddits for advice.\n\nI've been a poor college student for years. So no issue with doing that for a few more while I work my way out of debt.\n\nOne specific question. I used to use, and love Amazon Prime. Since the price went up so much (I had the student discount), I no longer use it. However I'm thinking it might be worth it again since I will be buying stuff for a new apartment. Thoughts? On one end I have plenty of things I'd will need to get (and subsequently have shipped)... but perhaps it might be easier just to do one big trip to Target. \n\nSo... Is $100 for Amazon prime worthwhile considering I'm getting a new place?\n\nAlso any \"driving across the country\" frugal tips are welcome. But my company is giving relocation funds, so I'm not awfully worried about that.","14":"45 dollars of Amazon codes, split into 20 and 25.  \n[My GCX rep profile is here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2rda8l\/uroworwade_gcx_rep_profile\/).","15":"[H] $25 Amazon [W] $20 Paypal","16":"Basically, amazon's app is way too slow: I need a real scanner.

I told him that I was buying things to resell on amazon.  If something scanned was profitable I'd buy it from him.\n\nImmediately his face lit up and he turned out to be the nicest guy in the world.  He was actually showing me things that sold really well in his store, \"this is really popular with young guys nowadays, etc.\"  He didn't know much about Amazon, but after some explanation of FBA he understood it was like internet consignment and got really interested.  With his help, I found quite a bit of stuff and had really good profits.  I ended up buying $166 worth of stuff and sent it all to FBA that day.\n\nI feel like I made a good connection.  Now, he might do what I'm doing next year, but I think he's content with getting it off his hands and letting someone else worry about it.\n\nI know people have different reactions.  Some people, I'm sure, think I'm shoplifting, until I end up buying stuff, some are indifferent, others are really helpful.\n\nTrips like that make me excited to keep it up.","18":"[H] up to $200 Amazon [W] Square Cash, Paypal","19":"[H] $10 Amazon [W] $9.50 Paypal or Steam","20":"[H] $15 Columbia Giftcard [W] $11 Amazon GC, Paypal, or Towerfall Ascension","21":"I buy big price drops on Amazon and flip them on eBay almost daily...

If you'd like to read the original, here's a link: http:\/\/www.regpaq.com\/averaged-317-per-month-amazon-niche-sites-last-year-heres-2014-income-report\/\n\n-------\n\nI have two niche sites monetized with the Amazon Associate program. These two sites were hit with Google penalties early in their life (explained in the original post), but are still making some money today.\n\nHere is a screenshot of 2014 revenue total from Amazon.\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AdcsKKU.png\n\nAveraged over twelve months, $3,809.47 comes to $317\/month. I built these sites hoping one of them could make $2,000\/month one day so you can see how my expectations disappointed me.\n\nBut reflecting on everything now, $317 extra each month from doing basically nothing is actually a pretty good side income. **It covers my car payment completely.** Or it covers my monthly grocery bill. Or instead of using it to pay bills, I could invest the earnings into another Amazon niche site, which is something I\u2019m considering heavily.\n\nSo while I had always thought these two sites were failures, I think I can change my attitude and call them mild successes. A stepping stone to a better Amazon niche site. If I continue to make more sites, I\u2019m bound to finally hit one out of the park and at the least, create multiple sites of the same success compounding my income.\n\n**A Quick Recap of How I Did It**\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started a niche site before, just start one. It\u2019s not very complicated. There aren\u2019t many hidden secrets you must know in order to succeed. All it really takes is some hard and consistent work in the right direction. Just start. If your first site makes just $100\/month (easy to do) then great! Keep working on it if you think it has legs and if not use that money to invest in content for your next site.\n\nThis is going to be a quick guide with links to helpful resources and some of my notes where needed. I\u2019m going to refrain from talking about things that have already been said elsewhere and just link to it.\n\n**Step 1: Topic Selection and Keyword Research**\n\nProper research is very important before you start doing anything and buying a domain. But don\u2019t research too much, only just as much as you need to.\n\nTung Tran has a brilliantly thorough and [straight to the point guide on keyword research](http:\/\/www.cloudliving.com\/keyword-research\/). Looking over his post again, I don\u2019t think you need any other guide on how to do keyword research. He recommends a paid software, Long Tail Pro. I have it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary even though it does save time. Just use the free Google Keyword Planner tool.\n\n**Step 2: Buy a Domain and Set Up Hosting**\n\nCan\u2019t go too wrong with anything here. Just pick a \u201cbrandable\u201d domain and not a spammy sounding name with your keyword in it. When I bought my vacuum niche site, the domain name was bestcanistervacuums.net and I since changed it to consumervacuums.com.\n\nThe major benefit of these kinds of domain names is it makes it easy to build links without receiving a penalty. You will be allowed to build links with your brand\u2019s name as the anchor text, but if your domain has your main keyword in it (ex: \u201cbest canister vacuum\u201d) you can\u2019t use that too much in your anchor text or you could risk getting a penalty for it.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll want to grab all the social media handles for your site. That means, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to use all the channels. I recommend just using one \u2013 the one that you\u2019ve found your target audience uses the most. Be where your target audience is.\n\n**Step 3: Create a Content Calendar**\n\nContent is the most important thing with building a niche site. Good content will bring you readers, will keep people reading, will convince people to buy the products you use\/recommend, and cause people to link to it.\n\nThe niche sites that last a long time will have good content that people want to read. To get help, find online communities where your niche\u2019s target audience is. For example, if you\u2019re niche site is centered around cooking products, your content should be about recipes with great photos.  It would help if you actually made the recipes and took the pictures yourself. You could also make YouTube videos and subtly linking to the products you use to make the recipe.\n\nWhen you discover what good content in your niche is, you\u2019ll need to create it. A content calendar helps. A content calendar is simply a calendar of when you\u2019ll be publishing content on your site. Quality is always important, but typically the more the better. More content means you have more chances to be found or linked to.\n\nI use Evernote to take notes and the calendar on Basecamp to keep me moving. However, I know a lot of people use gmail and other Google services so I thought I\u2019d link to this [great guide on how to use Google Calendar to create a content calendar](http:\/\/www.amyporterfield.com\/2012\/10\/google-calendar-editorial-calendar\/).\n\nBegin writing the content yourself. At least once a week is something I recommend. If you have the capital, investing in a good content writer (native speaker with considerable knowledge on your topic) is good.\n\n**How To Discover What Content to Create**\n\n* Reddit is usually my number one place to see what kind of content my target audience likes. If you can find a subreddit on your exact topic, look at the top posts of all time and make your way down. If there is no subreddit on your exact topic, look for overlapping subreddits. Going back to our cooking topic, find subreddits where cooking is important. r\/fitness, r\/bodybuilding, r\/keto, r\/paleo, etc.\n* Search online for forums or communities around your topic. See what they post about and find common questions\n* Search Yahoo Answers\n* Look at magazines at your grocery store\n* Look on Pinterest or other social media channels\n\n**Step 4: Make Your Website Look Nice**\n\nDesign should not be neglected. A lot of people skip over this, but it\u2019s a big differentiator if your site looks nice and is easy to read when there are many other sites writing on the same topics. Again, high quality pictures (Instagram\/Pinterest worthy) is almost a must.\n\nUse a responsive design so it\u2019s nice for mobile users. Use a relatively small content width (like on this site and BuzzFeed) to make content more inviting to read. Relatively bigger fonts (around 16px) also help. Get a good logo by either using 99 designs or find someone to make you one on reddit.com\/r\/forhire, r\/graphic_design, or r\/entrepreneur (sometimes you will see posts on these last two subreddits offering logo work for or for cheap to help build their portfolio). Also consider Fiverr if you want to keep costs low.\n\nIf you\u2019re using WordPress, check out themeforest.net for great themes. Make sure the theme you pick is responsive and makes it easy to use Google Fonts.\n\n**Step 5: Build an Email List from Day One**\n\nSomething I wish I did was start creating an email list when I launched my niche sites. I just didn\u2019t think anyone would sign up so I never did it. But now looking back, I wish I did because I\u2019m sure people would have signed up if I had the option available.\n\nAn email list will be really beneficial if your content is good. Don\u2019t always think about making a sale from your email list, but more building a brand and a readership. You can put your sign up forms in the sidebar, at the end of posts, or in a popup (I use OptinMonster). For email service providers, I like to use Campaign Monitor.\n\nTo help build your list, it\u2019s good to give something away for signing up like a short ebook or a link to a private page. Both need to have excellent content and something readers actually want in order for this to be effective. Always test different optin headlines to see what works. Sometimes no bonus works better.\n\n**Step 6: Get Your Content Noticed**\n\nIn other words, you will need traffic. There are three main ways to get traffic: organic search, paid search, and social. Big mistake #1: Relying on only one way to get traffic.\n\nThe big two are organic and social, while paid may not be cost effective for an Amazon niche site. Creating content that people want to read is number one, but you\u2019ll want your posts and pages to be search engine friendly, too.\n\nI made the mistake of relying all on organic traffic, so when my domains got penalized, I was left with a mere trickle of traffic. I will use social more next time, but I haven\u2019t had too much experience with it yet for niche sites.\n\n**Organic Search Tips**\n\n* Use Brian Dean\u2019s [guide for on page SEO](http:\/\/backlinko.com\/on-page-seo) \u2013 it\u2019s all you need to know and do.\n* Do lots of blog comments. I used [Doug Cunnington\u2019s guide on this](http:\/\/nichesiteproject.com\/blog-commenting\/). I outsourced this to my assistant. Also comment on high traffic pages where comments are allowed and link to your better resource. This surprisingly works really well for targeted traffic.\n* Use the below social strategies to gain natural links\n* Generally, building links manually here and there is typically a waste of time unless you really know what you\u2019re doing\n* Don\u2019t buy links, unless you really know what you\u2019re doing\n\n**Social Tips**\n\nSocial is great because not only can it get you targeted traffic, but it can also lead to natural links. The more people see it, the more it has a chance to be linked to by a reader who liked it. So social also helps with your organic search traffic over time.\n\n* Submit every post to Reddit to the appropriate subreddit. Be careful with this and read the subreddit rules. Sometimes submitting a text only post with the content all there and then just a link to the source (your niche site) works better. Get a feel for the subreddit first and don\u2019t start spamming.\n* Submit every post to Digg\n* Buy cheap StumbleUpon traffic (still looking for a guide on this)\n* Use Pinterest (here is a [short guide](http:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/pinterest-blog-traffic\/), but still looking for something better)\n* Upload videos to YouTube with optimized titles and descriptions. Go on Fiverr to have someone make a transcript to post on there, too.\n\n**Other Content Marketing Tips**\n\nRequirement: Good content.\n\n* Brian Dean\u2019s [Skyscraper technique](http:\/\/backlinko.com\/white-hat-seo)\n* Brian Dean\u2019s [Guest Posting Guide](http:\/\/backlinko.com\/the-definitive-guide-to-guest-blogging)\n\n**Step 7: Optimize Your Site for Conversions**\n\nWith an Amazon niche site, a conversion is someone buying something on Amazon using your affiliate link so you get a commission. This is the number one thing you want people to do on your site. Some people could make the argument that getting someone\u2019s email is more important as you\u2019d be able to make multiple sales over time from the same person. Not saying that is wrong, but I did not do that with my niche sites.\n\n**Here are some quick optimization tips:**\n\n* Create a quick \u201cTop 3 [Main Amazon Item],\u201d \u201c[Main Amazon Item] Comparison Chart,\u201d etc that is linked in the navigation or sidebar so it\u2019s on every page. I always get the most conversions from these pages.\n* Use multiple Amazon affiliate tracking codes for the same site. I use different ones on all my main pages so I can get an easier look to see which pages are the big earners. Calculate the conversion rates of these pages (clicks to Amazon\/unique visitors AND orders\/unique visitors). Use this data to improve low performing pages and link more often to the top performing pages in other pages of your content.\n* Use product images and link them to the Amazon product (with your affiliate link of course)\n* Build comparison tables using the WP plugin, Tablepress. Here\u2019s an example of [mine on my vacuum niche site](http:\/\/www.consumervacuums.com\/best-canister-vacuum\/best-canister-vacuum-2014\/).\n* Get the plugin EasyAzon by Chris Guthrie. This plugin is amazing and makes getting your affiliate links AND images super fast.\n* Limit (or don\u2019t use at all) any other monetization methods (adsense for example). You don\u2019t want to take away from your main goal, getting people on Amazon. However, you could test multiple methods and see if it earns you more, but I don\u2019t hear much of people having more success by using both Adsense and Amazon.\n* Reinvest earnings for more content to create more conversion opportunities\n\n----\n\nOnce you get your site up and running with these basics, you should be expanding your knowledge and skills with more research.\n\nThe most important takeaway from this post is that you don\u2019t need to know everything before you get started. Just use these basics, get your site started and earning some money, then look to expand your site and skills further (email marketing, better design, interactive content, etc).\n\nNiche sites are simple, it just takes time for them to \u201ctake off.\u201d If this is your first site, and your site ends up failing, don\u2019t be too upset. Learn from what went right and what went wrong and start another site. Don\u2019t expect to earn a 1$ sooner than 3 months. I didn\u2019t make real money until my third niche site.","36":"20 Pounds Amazon For PayPal","37":"Amazon Gift Card - \u00a320 [W] PayPal","38":" [H] \u00a320 UK Amazon Gift Card [W] \u00a320 UK PayPal - Please PM me for my Paypal E-mail if interested.

There are going to be changes in my budget come July, but I'll get to that at the end. The x factor is groceries, which I do not track but probably should. However I will note that I hardly spend a hundred a month in groceries and do not eat out.\n\nI currently have $4073.67 in a regular savings account at my bank.\n\nEach month I can save exactly $1200 a month. However in July I will only be saving $800 a month because I will no longer have a roommate paying half the rent.\n\nMy personal goal is to reach $10,000 in savings before July, but I do carry debt.\n\nMy debt is as follows:\n\n* Student Loans - I owe $9,289.00 (Monthly payments of $120.00, Interest rate 6.55% on one the other is 6.8%)\n* Car Loan - I owe $2,835.00 (Monthly payments of $145, Interest rate is 6.8%)\n* Capital One Visa - I owe $1,597.45 (Monthly payments of $44.00, Interest rate is 23.15%)\n* Capital One MasterCard - I owe $262.52 (Monthly payments of $26.00, Interest rate is 19.90%)\n* Amazon.com Store Card - I owe $1,128.16 (Monthly payments of $38.00, Interest rate is 25.99%)\n* J Crew Store Card - I owe $182.06 (Monthly payments of $26.00, Interest rate is 24.99%)\n* Chase amazon.com - I owe $329.85 (Monthly payments of $26.00, Interest rate is 21.24%)\n* Bill Me Later - I owe $530.17 (Monthly payments of $26.00, 22%)\n\nMy monthly expenses:\n\n* CAR LOAN\t$145.00\n* CAPITAL ONE VISA\t$44.00\n* CAPITAL ONE MASTERCARD\t$26.00\n* RENT\t$400.00\n* amazon.com Store Card\t$38.00\n* J Crew Store Card\t$26.00\n* Chase amazon.com\t$26.00\n* Student Loans\t$120.00\n* Cell Phone\t$30.00\n* Electric\t$50.69\n* Car Insurance\t$93.00\n* Bill Me Later\t$26.00\n* Internet\t$115.00\n* Gas\t$65.99\n\nTOTAL EXPENSES: $1,205.68  \nPAYCHECKS (After taxes): $2,500  \nLEFT OVER EACH MONTH: $1294.32  \n\nIf I need to start using my savings to pay off the debt, then so be it.

The item was in perfect condition when I shipped it to the buyer. I have photos of the item prior to it shipping. \n\nAfter using it for a couple of days a piece of the kindle broke off. The buyer said that the kindle was defective as a piece should not break off after a couple of days of using it. The buyer admits that he is the one who broke the piece after using it for a couple of days. \n\nThey filed an a-to-z claim. Amazon agreed with them. And now they are shipping me the broken kindle back. \n\nAm I screwed here? I think I am at least entitled the a 50% refund of the purchase price as shown here http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=200708240. Amazon seems to think I sent them a 'defective product' even though I showed them photos that the item was in perfect condition upon sending it. \n\nAfter reading deeper it seems that if amazon says that the item was defective upon receiving it, then the seller has to refund the buyer the full amount. \n\nDealing with amazon support throughout all of this is impossible as its all via email and its just copy and pasted nonsense and they don't even read what I write. \n\n$325 is a lot of money! What can I do here? If anything?\n\nIt is just crazy to think about. I sent them a perfectly working product. They break it. And now send it back to me and I have to refund them in full?

Whoever suggested trying to talk to the buyer and explaining the situation, thank you. For I simply expressed my side of the story to him, to his basic human morality, and he seemed to agree with me completely. \n\nFrom the looks of it now he is closing the refund request and we are working something out as he wants to keep it himself. \n\nI suppose this could be a lesson to everyone who deals with amazon as a seller just how bad things can get and just how little leeway you have. \n\nAll the best and thank you for your replies everybody!

Just wanted to give $0.02 for anyone interested in the thought process of deciding between Amzn and eBay.\n\nThis one's obvious but check both first to see where you can get more profit. Check eBay sold listings, and current Amazon prices to decide which is better. The basic rule of thumb I use for eBay is I take the expected revenue and multiply by 0.85 to get a vague idea of what I'll net. I put up a few items on Amazon worth $250+ that I really should have put on eBay. It's more work for me to label and lug over to the post office but the selling price on eBay is $50 more than Amazon. The pricing on Amazon for this particular item was way more competitive... rookie mistake on my part. D'oh.\n\nIn general, I prefer selling expensive items on eBay. Why? Less returns. People tend to treat Amazon like a retail store and because of their A-Z guarantee, customers feel more comfortable returning. I think I've had maybe 1 return on eBay, and there was a time on Amazon where 2\/6 brand new tablets I sold were returned as open box. If you are at a level where you can absorb the potential returns then this might not be an issue for you. Amazon and Amazon customers will treat you like a retailer, eBay is more like a garage sale where once you buy it you're pretty much stuck with it. I'm sure someone out there has had worse luck on eBay but I'm just drawing from my exp.\n\nFor smaller items, especially ones where you have a large quantity with relatively thin profits, I think Amazon FBA is the way to go because of the convenience factor. You don't want to spend hours individually labeling and packing small packages where you're only making a few bucks profit. It's time consuming and time is better spent prospecting for more potential sales.\n\nCheck the item sales rank on Amazon to get an idea of liquidity. If the sales rank number is high then be prepared to let the item sit for a while. If the sales rank number is low, it'll probably fly off the shelf. For eBay it's harder to tell but you can see completed listings to see actual sold listings in green vs. unsold listings in red.\n\nHope this helps a tiny bit,  wanted to give back to the community for the FBA advice that I received over the past year!\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nFor eBay I think the most important things are to understand paypal's policies AND to describe your item correctly. If there's a scratch then admit it... you don't want the buyers getting any bad surprises.\n\nFor items less than $250, then make sure you get delivery confirm, and if it's more then get signature confirmation. This is probably one of the most important aspects of selling as safely as possible on eBay.","83":"[H] 12 month xbox live gold card [W] 50 $ Amazon or Ebay Gift card code(s)","84":"hello everyone got Accents kingdom Gc which i got at my place of work during this xmas holiday and is a jewelry stores which i dont really like since am not the jewelry type,so i would like to exchange for Amazon Gc or Bitcoin,if anyone is interested kind comment here before Pming Me.\n\nThanks.","85":"[H] $140 Amazon GC [W] $126 PayPal","86":"Have $25 Amazon.com code, asking $22 Paypal.

It doesn't pay cash, but you can earn credits from doing surveys, completing offers such as installing specific mobile apps, and listing auctions yourself. Credits are essentially Listia's own digital currency, and you can use it to bid on items in a broad range of categories. If you need credits in a pinch, you can purchase them from Listia directly, but they are way overpriced and you would be better off buying an Amazon gift card and listing it as an auction. You can spend your credits on anything from digital game codes to electronics to gift cards for... just about anywhere. Think of it like if eBay and SwagBucks had a baby.\n\nI find that I can profit several different ways from Listia: when I am bored I will complete surveys, but I don't do that very often because at the moment I am a stay-at-home dad and I find that I tend to disqualify myself from most surveys simply by answering the questions honestly. I like completing offers but these are hit and miss because sometimes you don't get the credits you should and you have to open a support ticket with a screenshot or other proof that you actually completed the offer. Not to mention with the mobile games I usually get distracted playing them and lose time there, lol. But generally I prefer doing offers &amp; surveys on Lista as opposed to SwagBucks just because of the wealth of things I can spend my credits on.\n\nBy far the best way to profit from Listia imo are the auctions, if you are good at buying low and selling high. I've seen several other people talk about great profits to be made buying things from Listia and selling on eBay. A lot of things can go under the radar like a poorly worded auction or something ending in the middle of the night, etc. Also if you wait until the last moment and \"snipe\" bids just before the auction ends you can get *great* deals on just about anything. The price varies day to day, but a $10 Amazon gift card goes for about ~26,000 credits, so by my math $1 is about 2,600 credits.\n\nIf you use my referral link you get an extra 250 credits, which isn't much, but after I signed up, linked my Facebook\/Twitter profiles and listed my first auction, I had around ~4,000 credits.

It's a lot like eBay, but instead of USD\/CAD\/etc, auctions use something called Listia Credits. Listia Credits are essentially Listia's own digital currency, and you can use it to bid on items in a broad range of categories. If you need credits in a pinch, you can purchase them from Listia directly, but they are way overpriced and you would be better off buying an Amazon gift card and listing it as an auction. You can spend your credits on anything from jewelry to coins to digital game codes to electronics to gift cards for... just about anywhere. Think of it like if eBay and SwagBucks had a baby.\n\nI find that I can profit several different ways from Listia: when I am bored I will complete surveys, but I don't do that very often because at the moment I am a stay-at-home dad and I find that I tend to disqualify myself from most surveys simply by answering the questions honestly. I like completing offers but these are hit and miss because sometimes you don't get the credits you should and you have to open a support ticket with a screenshot or other proof that you actually completed the offer. Not to mention with the mobile games I usually get distracted playing them and lose time there, lol. Generally I prefer doing offers &amp; surveys on Lista as opposed to SwagBucks just because of the wealth of things I can spend my credits on, but most of that stuff is \/r\/beermoney territory anyway.\n\nBy far the best way to profit from Listia imo are the auctions, if you are good at buying low and selling high, and that's why I thought \/r\/flipping might be interested. I've seen several other people talk about great profits to be made buying things from Listia and selling on eBay. A lot of things can go under the radar like a poorly worded auction or something ending in the middle of the night, etc. Also if you wait until the last moment and \"snipe\" bids just before the auction ends you can get *great* deals on just about anything. The price varies day to day, but a $10 Amazon gift card goes for about ~26,000 credits, so by my math $1 is about 2,600 credits.\n\nIf you use my referral link you get an extra 250 credits, which isn't much, but after I signed up, linked my Facebook\/Twitter profiles and listed my first auction, I had around ~4,000 credits. In a couple hours I had ~12,000 credits from doing surveys and offers. I've spent most of the credits I've made so far (mostly on Steam games, in the digital games section) but I've started to list auctions myself and I'm starting to accumulate credits now... my plan is to buy gift cards on a regular basis and use my Listia activity to fund my dinners out with the wife.

Partially because this helps me set my budgets and plan for retirement. For this reason, I want to know the value of products I am purchasing, not just the number of dollars that come out of my account.\n\n**Giftcards** - For things like VISA giftcards, I always track all expenses I make with them as if they were normal expenses. For most stores like Lowe's or Target, I also track it as if it were a normal expense. I'm often using the card to purchase things I normally would anyways. The only exception here would be if I got a giftcard for an obscure place or fancy restaurant that I would not normally purchase from. In this case I will *not* track it as a normal expense, since I am treating it as if I received the product or service itself as a gift.\n\n**Coupons** I certainly don't take the time to track the true price of my goods before any coupons. I just reflect my whole grocery store final purchase price after sales and coupons as a \"Groceries\" expense. It would simply be too much work, and I assume that my shopping will always have some average amount of sales and coupons included. \n\n**Credit Card Cash Back rewards** I never treat this money as free money, so I always want to continue making sure I am still tracking the full value of my expenses. This is easy when the rewards are applied as a statement credit, because all of your expense transactions still stand as they are. It's a little more difficult for things like the Amazon card, with which you use the reward points as a discount on your purchase. In these cases, I make sure to modify the expense in my tracking spreadsheet to reflect the whole purchase price of the item before the rewards discount.","232":"Hi everyone,\n\nI am working on starting a business (or rather, greatly expanding an existing one) that involves the need to sync a physical POS system with online\/E-Commerce inventory and management.\n\nEssentially, we are planning to sell the same items (hand-crafted items with limited availability) in a retail store, as well as online marketplaces such as Amazon and\/or Etsy. We're wanting to ensure that we have a system that will minimize user input, and remove online inventory if its sold at retail, and vice-versa.\n\nFrom what I see, Vend + Stitch Labs allows for this, among other integrations.

Additionally, it looks like we can integrate a few other things to make management easy.\n\nHowever, am I missing something?

Apologies for the wall of text.\n\nI have been ghosting about this sub for quite some time and would very much like the insight of those gathered here.\n\n\nI am a planner. I do little without a lot of forethought. Once I decide on a course I find a way to make it happen ensuring that my situation is either the same or better.  I am a curious type. I like to dabble in a lot of things until I feel that I understand them enough to have a passable conversation, but I have not something that I would turn into a business venture.\n\nHere are some basic facts:\n\n- My wife and I both have undergrad degrees. Mine is in Business Administration: Finance. \n\n- I am a former enlisted Marine and eagle scout.\n\n- I have 2 children (4 and 6) who are home schooled by my now stay at home wife.\n\n- I am 38 y\/o male from southeast currently living in the Seattle area\n\n- Both mine and my wife's families are located in the southeast.\n\nNow a little resume:\n I have had what others have told me is an amazing career. I came out of high school and went into the USMC. After being discharged I got my associates degree and took a job as a temp in the mail room at a Home Depot regional office where over the course of 8 years I worked my way up to a merchant job. I went to work for a local family owned personal care manufacturing company for a few years where I helped them polish their planning enough to allow for a buy out by a very large firm. Which leads us to my current position at Amazon where I have been for about 7 years. \n\nNow over the course of these roles I have held a lot of different positions, but here are the main themes:\n\n- Short and long term forecasting and inventory planning for both small and large business segments $100M to Multi-Billion. \n\n- People Management\n\n- Process review and improvement, including working directly with Software developers to spec and design systems and processes.\n\n- Program Management where I have complete ownership of critical business requirements.\n\n- Supply chain management from both an operations and business team point of view.\n\nThere is more but those are this highest profile. Given my line of work and my personal interests I have a pretty heavy tech background and have spent no small amount of time writing SQL queries and being a Jedi master in excel (at least compared to most folks I know)\n\nMy current financial situation is not bad, but in my opinion is not fantastic. Between my base salary and restricted stock options I make between $140K and $150K a year. The only debt I carry is my house and the bills get paid every month. In 2014 I finally admitted that I do not have the time I need to manage my retirement and investments properly and have handed them to my (do not beat me up for this) local Edward Jones representative. Things have already started improving.\n\nNow the average employment period of an Amazonian is about 14 Months. As I am rolling into 7 years I have safely bucked the trend. The reality though is that I cannot do it much longer. As I think back on the last 7 years I constantly come back to one thought:\n\n 'It is amazing what you can get used to..' \n\nAs you may guess by reading this I am beginning to feel the strain. Please do not get me wrong. I could keep on doing this for years. I am not desperate and I am not running away. However, if there is one thing I have learned in my career it is to get out before you feel like you have to. Trying to hide desperation at an interview is a hard task indeed.\n\nAt this point I am thinking about my next moves. I feel that I know at least a few things:\n- I would like to move my family back to the Southeast.\n\n- I want to traverse the divide and get out of the consumer retail sector.\n\n- I need to ensure that I leverage my resume to get a job that is at least one to two levels above where I am currently. Amazon is a fairly flat but large company and the size of what I manage is larger than most medium sized companies.\n\n- I would like to be able to begin dabbling in my own ventures while I maintain my role as sole bread winner.\n\nWhat am I uncertain about:\n\n- I work with a lot, and I do mean a lot, of incredibly smart people. Most of us are type A's. It is easy to begin to feel like a mediocre performer. I feel like there are any number of places I could go and be an absolute rock star. But I do not feel like I can sell myself properly. I know this sounds like a self confidence issue, but it is really a product of being in the latter environment for as long as I have.\n\n- What industry can I move to that can provide me with the base pay that I want and is agnostic to where my expertise came from. In my mind a unit is a unit and a dollar is a dollar. \n\n- How should I go about it? I have spent a lot of time building my LinkedIn network. I have severally really great mentors. Should I try to find a way to use the network or should I set up shop with multiple head hunters?\n\nI am not in a rush to do this. At this point I am comfortable sitting tight with a goal of making a move within the next 2 years.\n\nI realize as I read back over this that I am not really asking a specific question, but expressing a lot of internal dialogue to a bunch of perfect strangers. That's just the place I find myself at the moment. What I know for sure it is really helpful to get it out in writing in order to help me gather my own thoughts on the matter. \n\nSo tell me my dedicated reader.

Of course the caveat was that it needed bathrooms and kitchens redone. So I got two 0% apr card and cards from Home Depot and Amazon as they offer 0% financing for some purchases from their own stores. So I've promptly run up about $12k of credit debt. I pay no interest and pay minimums on the cards that are still in the 0% promotional period. I've set up my own \"sinking fund\", a high interest savings account that I contribute (amount owed)\/(months of 0%promotional period remaining).\n\nSo after mortgage and applying for different card at different times, my credit score nose dived from 720 to 650 (I killed my avg account age, ran the two 0% cards to near max, got several independent hard inquiries). My payment history and all is flawless, but the other things are obviously going to hurt me at least until June, which is when my first 0% promotional period ends and I'll use income tax returns to pay off about 25% of my total outstanding debt (I graduated last year and worked 6 months but stupidly withheld at the normal rate as if I was working all year, so this is a reasonable expectation). \n\nI have no concern for my personal well being. Absolute worst case I end up having to pay interest on one or both of the promotional accounts if I get hit by a bus tomorrow. My concern is that I'm going to get declined for the corporate card application and look like a broke dumbass at work which could potentially hurt me because I work in a fixed income group and if it looks like I can't deal with my own debt that will look very bad. \n\nI am asking because I had to give my ssn for this card..

Gave them my frames and they sent them in and had the whole frame replaced.\n\nThese are just the ones I can remember. I'd like to hear your stories about good and bad customer service.

I follow the highly diversified, low-cost indexing approach. When people ask what I'm holding I usually just tell them the five funds I have and something like \"it's not exciting, but it works well.\" Beyond that there isn't much to talk about, so I try to leave it at that. \n\nI have a few family members who use it as a conversation point. Most of them are stock pickers and market timers nearing retirement, and their accounts are fairly under-funded and very poorly diversified. I am 21 years old, for context. As such I get a lot of the \"I know best, so let me try and one-up you because I'm wiser\" stuff that older family members tend to do. I've tried not even starting conversations remotely related to investing, but it still gets brought up anyway. \n\nJust a sample of things I've heard\/seen in the last couple weeks I've spent with family:\n\n- \"I can't believe you aren't in on TSLA. I've been in since $175 and you're going to feel really stupid for not buying at these prices!\"\n\n- Fox News analysts being taken seriously on whether Google, Amazon, or Apple stock will have higher returns in 2015. When asked what I thought, I was laughed at after responding, \"I don't know, and anyone who claims to is just guessing.\"\n\n- People trying to convince me to sign up for Timothy Sykes' penny stock pumping newsletter or whatever it is. Told I was being stupid after simply saying, \"No thanks, I don't like penny stocks.\"\n\n- Being snubbed after people were discussing their best investments of 2014. Tried to stay out, was prompted for input several times. My simple LT US Treasuries ETF blew all of their picks out of the water. \n\n- One relative telling me he's been in the game long enough that he *just knows* the right times to get out and in. Proceeds to sell his Dow index at almost the exact low of 17,300 yesterday (as well as try to advise me to sell my indices) and he managed to miss out on today's gain of over 1.8%. \n\nI don't care that they treat the stock market like a casino, but it irritates me when they try to make me look like a fool for not following that mentality. Obviously I could be a complete dick and rub it in their faces in situations like the last two, and after a few times of that they probably wouldn't bring it up again.

I've also been lurking here a few weeks. \n\nAnyway, like many I am a college student looking to earn some extra money. I am a workholic who is also currently running an online business, but as revenue has gone up I've found myself with a lot of extra time that was previously unavailable to me. I love making money (who doesn't?) so I thought flipping would be a good addition to my work routine, because it's something that will allow me to continue to work from home, allowing me to operate my online business when necessary. \n\nAt this time I have only $1000 that I can dedicate to this project. My long-term goal would be to continously reinvesting all profits into more items, and to sell on Amazon (FBA) because from what I understand it requires far less maintenance.\n\nSo my questions are,\n\n1. Is $1000 enough to begin on Amazon?\n2. If not, how much should I aim for to begin?\n3. If so, how can I minimize risk of losing my money? If I find items with a good margin and sales rank, should I limit myself on how many I buy in exchange for an increased diversification of items?\n4. What price range of items should I aim for given my budget? I have seen people suggest not to flip anything below X dollars.\n5. Is sourcing really just as simple as scanning items until I find a good one? It feels like there's something I'm missing. \n\nIf it makes any difference, I live in Washington state right near the Canadian border.

Just sometimes I find it difficult to justify buying additional little pleasures. Like video games, or booze. \n\nSo I thought I'd take a look on this subreddit.

It's still really early days, but it looks like it could be really profitable. I'm hardly expecting to rake in millions in a few hours, but over the month it looks like I could earn enough to justify the odd game or two.\n\nEssentially, from the research I've looked at, it looks like you can earn up to 55% of any initial investment made. The minimum investment is $1, which I didn't think was too bad. However, being the cheap ass I am, I had a look to see if you could make any money without that initial investment. As it turns out, you can. You can made money over time with smaller priced ads. So far I've made a whopping *7 cents*! So, yeah, not a huge amount, I know. But given that I only started yesterday, I have hope that this can put a little extra cash in my pocket, on top any Amazon cards from Perk.\n\nI thought I'd at least pass the information on, and if things pick up, i'll be sure to let you guys know. All I can do now is wish you guys luck in your quest for that bit extra cash.\n\nRef link - https:\/\/www.paidverts.com\/ref\/Arrario\n\nNon-Ref link - https:\/\/www.paidverts.com","288":"This is my first try at a start-up.

I believe I have found an ideal product to buy wholesale from Alibaba, and then to flip on Amazon.  It's a small product, a best seller, and goes for roughly $100 on Amazon.  Potential for about $40-$50 in profit per item.  However it does have a minimum order of 100, meaning an initial investment of about $4,000.  My plan is to buy one from alibaba and one from amazon, compare, then if there are no noticeable differences, purchase a large order.  My questions are thence:\n\n-Is it possible to negotiate to buy a single item from Alibaba companies with minimum order quantities?  I don't care if I have to pay a premium, but I don't want to purchase a large order to discover that the item is poorly made.  Will legit companies allow me to buy one product to sort of \"test drive\" it for quality comparison if I show interest in placing a larger order?\n\n-What will my competition be like?  So it goes for $100 on Amazon, and I will lower it to $95 or $90 to sell on both Amazon and Ebay.  My worry is that other vendors will do this also and undercut me, and very quickly the profit margin will slim to something insubstantial.  How likely is this to occur?  FYI, I have good seller ratings on Amazon and Ebay, I just haven't sold as much quantity as some vendors.\n\n-Are there any legal things to concern me?  This product is hot and relatively new.  Of course I would report this as income if I do end up making substantial money, but is this type of business model legal?  I plan on packing and shipping to the US myself.\n\n-Anything I overlooked?\n\nThanks in advance.","343":"Hi\n\nI am looking for 2 partners who would like to sell my products on Amazon\/Ebay.

Im not the kind of person that buys name brands much, or needs the latest hi-tech toys etc. Im single and have no kids as well. I also have 0 debt anywhere.

Sure enough, when a dent and scratch turned into a $600 bill, Visa's claim branch processed my paperwork in a friendly, communicative and relatively hassle-free manner, and in less than a month they had settled the bill with the rental company, and even sent me a check for the deposit that hadn't been returned.\n\nThis past christmas, I foolishly left some packages from Amazon and Zappo's on the porch, and they vanished. $750 of stuff! I was  bummed, but then a friend pointed out that the Visa and Mastercard I had used for those purchases offered 'Purchase Protection', which includes up to $500 reimbursement for theft or damage within 60 days of a purchase.

The interest on the Slate is 10 and Amazon and Discover about 18 and 21.

My grandfather left that money for me and my sister to enjoy our lives not to pay off our irresponsible spending. However I decided to use some of it as a spring board and head start. \n\nI've resolved to pay off one of the cards all at once, and the rest of the inheritance is to be saved for a new computer (which I need anyway) and to save for an emergency or engagement ring or something other big. For the other two cards I'd like to get a personal loan to pay them off at once and consolidate the payments under a smaller interest amount.\n\nMy mother has agreed to co-sign my loan. Despite my poor spending I've never defaulted in my life, I've always paid my bills on time and my credit history is good.

That's what your trading history looks looks like.\n\nThink I'll look for a different buyer.","487":"L.L.Bean.  What you are describing, is L.L.Bean.  That being said....\n\nHave you ever purchased from these types of manufacturers?  \n\nQuality is a massive issue - they will consistently try to shave off every penny worth of materials or labor that they can get away with.  You can hit up Patagonia's manufacturer directly, request *exact* replicas, and still recieve a total shit-quality product.  It does take time and effort (and money) to establish reliable and trustworthy connections.  \n\nThen you need to take into account volume pricing.  In your example, a Patagonia coat only costs $40 because Patagonia is ordering 10k of them, and then similar quantities of 200 other products.  Unless you have the ability to hit the ground running with a few million to invest in initial orders + a manufacturer with proven quality products - your cost will be several times higher than $40. Probably closer to $100-120 if you are only ordering &lt;1000 of one product.\n\nThen you need to invest in your product design, and have exact specifications for the manufacturer.  Hopefully you have a background in garment design.  If not, you will need to outsource that process and build the cost into your pricing.\n\nNow you need inventory storage and order fulfillment.  Don't plan on keeping everything in your basement and filling boxes yourself - you'll drive yourself crazy.  Let Amazon take their cut, and do the work for you.  Build that into your pricing.\n\nThen you need marketing.  Why the *fuck* would anyone buy your no-name gear instead of North Face or Patagonia?  Most of those buyer's are *not* climbing Mt.Rainier - they're hopping in their Range Rover, driving to Starbucks, and using their Macbook Pro.  They care more about branding\/image than raw bottom-line pricing.  For those that don't care, there are already bargain-basement brands, and factory rejects of the big brands.  So you'll have your work cut out for you, I would imagine this project\/company would be almost entirely marketing focused, and budget more for initial marketing than initial inventory.  Build that into your pricing....\n\nI am seeing very quickly how a coat that you think should be $40, would actually end up *costing you* closer to $180-200, before you even sold it to the customer.  Throw on a 20% profit margin - which is crazy low for the industry - and you are at the same damn price point as North Face and Patagonia.\n\nThen you're still up against your manufacturer, who probably made extras of your order, and is selling your shit straight on eBay with free shipping for $80 - and you don't have enough of a legal team to make eBay pull the listings.\n\nSounds like a massive fucking headache, IMO.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if any of these manufacturers have white-label outdoor goods product lines that they are willing to put your labels on, and dropship for you.  If you can do the legwork to make that happen - throwing up an ecommerce store and starting to experiment with PPC campaigns is a weekend project.","488":"Fulfillment By Amazon.

Companies like Google and Amazon and Netflix which have defined revenue streams and have invested in new product offerings to secure their future (ie Amazon in digital media and Netflix in media production). Priced into these shares is the expectation of a lot of growth and years of continued financial success. Netflix is trading at 88 P\/E, and Amazon has negative EPS for example.\n\nThen you have some companies like Twitter, which to me represent the next tech bubble. They don't make money and have a market cap in the billions, because they are popular. WhatsApp, Snapchat, all these little companies popping up worth billions of dollars and they don't make money or have any loyal following.\n\nCompanies that make products, like Intel, have an assumption that they're going to grow and make chips as technology gets into everything and developing countries start buying things like computers and phones.\n\nSo my personal take is that there are some companies worth holding, but that there is a lot of overvaluing going on right now and certain companies are going to bomb hard when people realize they don't and will not ever make enough money to support their current valuations. When that happens, all the techs are going to take a pounding, a la 2000.\n\nThere is no easy money, if something was obvious, everyone would invest in it.","492":"Hey, you aren't approved to trade your gift card balance as per the rules of the sub. **[Message the mods using this link](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgiftcardexchange)** with screenshots of your Amazon gift card balance page, with no information cropped out or otherwise omitted.

No refunds on downloaded products, either.\n\nThis doesn't affect me personally, because I need the feature set of Home &amp; Business, which is $90 this year. Amazon Prime has it for $65.\n\nActually, Amazon Prime has decent discounts this year, between $20-30 for each product. Many banks will have similar discounts. I've even gotten TT free from Fidelity in the past.\n\nIt saves me several hours of work every year, so it's worth the price, but Intuit just feels slimy to me. I haven't seriously tried H&amp;R Block...I looked at it a couple years ago and was put off by how clunky it felt. TurboTax is pretty rough software too, but H&amp;RB was rougher, at least that year. I've never seen anyone complain that H&amp;RB was any less functional or capable, and it's certainly less expensive.\n","494":"Amazon Seller's App, even the Amazon app will give you prices, it just won't give you calculated return","495":"For maternity clothes, check out children's resale shops. Kid to Kid (chain of children's resale shops) actually has a lot of maternity clothing there. I got my maternity pants for $3-4 each that were regularly $40 in Motherhood Maternity.\n\nOnly go with a used car seat if you know the history of it and it's not expired. I'm talking like you know the person who previously owned it, they're trustworthy and you know they haven't had a car accident in the time their baby was in the seat. There isn't any real way of knowing if the ones at thrift stores or resale shops were in an accident from looking at them and that's one thing you do NOT want to gamble with.\n\nRegister at Target, Amazon, Babies R Us, everywhere, even if you don't intend on letting people know you're registered at that store. About a month before your due date, the places you register will give you 10-15% off coupons towards completing your registry. Check prices of what you have left on your list at that time and buy it from wherever it's cheapest on a discount.\n\nCheck your health insurance for a free breast pump if you're planning on breastfeeding. Thanks to the ACA, most insurances will give you a double electric for free. Some will cheap out and give you a manual, but it's still a free pump and in my experience, having a manual is nice for the rare times your electric pump craps out on you.\n\n","496":"I like Turbo Tax solely because of the 10% bonus you get on your return for the portion of it you use on Amazon gift cards. Obviously this is only helpful if you use Amazon and if you don't change your spending habits because you have money sitting in a gift card. I didn't use up my gift card balance from my previous tax return until September.\n\nThis works for me and my family but YMMV.","497":"Most manufacturers in China offer end price including shipping to USA\/EU\/directly to Amazon warehouses, where they handle shipping and customs.

Retailers are still building bigger and more popular stores all over the country. Here is why: \n\n1) Real estate: Malls were once built in new and up and coming areas. Over decades, those areas become older, homes in those areas grow older. Instead of young families they are filled with retirees. Newer and bigger homes are being built in new neighborhoods, and suddenly those far-flung locations are now the most popular.\n\n2) Shopping center preferences: The mall was once the center of the universe for retailers, now it is \"lifestyle centers\" anchored by Target, Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc. Customers want to drive to locations instead of enduring long walks in malls. The rise of the one-stop shop big box changed the industry. These options didn't exist two decades ago on a national scale. Now Target is the most popular apparel shopping option for a huge chunk of people. Lump warehouse clubs into this too.\n\n3) Malls appeal to teens: Because teens and pre-teens often don't have access to transportation, it's easy to drop a kid off at the mall. Stores at malls tend to steer towards youth. Many retailers that cater to adults have moved out of malls.\n\n4) Outlets: Mega mall developers such as Simon have invested in huge, brand specific shopping centers using brands such as Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, etc. Many of those brands were once almost exclusive to malls. Now you can find an entire store full of Calvin Klein products.\n\n5) Decline of department stores: Department stores like Mervyn's were once the centerpiece of malls. As big box retailers like Kohl's, Target and Burlington Coat Factory have grown, many brands have disappeared or merged, leaving a much smaller pool of anchor tenants at malls. Many malls have replaced department stores with workout facilities and other tenants that don't have the same draw.\n\nAt some point the trend will probably swing back to malls, in the same way that town homes are once again vogue. It's a mix of factors due to urban planning and retail trends.","500":"I'm reading the FAQs on their site and am slightly confused.

If you plan to do volume, you will need a shipping software.  Amazon can fulfill your orders with ease.  It just depends if you will be running all your sales through Amazon or not.  If you send to Amazon's warehouse, they manage your inventory and shipments  Bigger items will be cheaper with Amazon since you can leverage their discounted shipping rates.  Smaller items will be cheaper for you to fulfill.  It just depends what you are trying to accomplish, what MPs you want to sell on, and if you want to take on a warehouse or not.","507":"As a long time user of this subreddit, I'm also not a fan of people buying low and selling high here. Sure, it makes good business sense, but I just feel like it kind of rips of the person who traded at a lower rate. I have bought Amazon here pretty much exclusively at 80%, and while it's tempting for me to trade my balance for 90%+, I don't, because I appreciate the people who have traded with me at 80%. So I don't disagree with you from that perspective.\n\nThat being said, as a moderator of this subreddit, it's not against any rules to buy low and sell high here, so I would advise you not to make comments like this. If you're going to look for a different buyer, then look for a different buyer, and leave this post alone. One of the rules of the sub is \"Do not post your opinion of another offer.\" You didn't quite break that rule since you didn't tell anyone not to trade with OP, but for situations like this, you can always just send us a modmail if you feel something is amiss, or PM the OP. Just don't do it in public like this, that's all. I will not remove your comment or anything like that. You're all good on that front.\n\nTLDR: I don't disagree with you on a personal level, but as a mod, I recommend you keep these things out of public eye, even if they aren't against the rules.","508":"I won't speculate on timing or the ultimate trigger. It might be as simple as the market overall is not doing well and people reassess where there money is. They look at a company like Twitter and say \"hmmm this company hasn't made a dollar since it started, I'm going to pull out.\"\n\nI give Facebook some credit because they took investor pressure and used it to come up with new ways to monetize, which they weren't doing well before going public. However, all of these companies have a limited shelf life. Facebook for the masses is less than a decade old. And kids today aren't even using it. New tech companies just aren't going to have the loyalty that older blue chips did. When the new \"thing\" comes out, young people will have no qualms about switching over.\n\nCompanies like Apple and Amazon and Facebook to some extent have some hedge in that switching out of their ecosystem has an inconvenience factor. But do you really think people would give a shit if they switched from WhatsApp to Kik? Or Twitter to some other social media site that hasn't been invented yet? Or from Uber to Lyft?\n\nAnyone who thinks Twitter is worth billions of dollars should remember a company called Myspace, or AltaVista, or AOL. Those were all ridiculously popular services that are graveyards today.","509":"While I appreciate your integrity this is just bad business my friend. You are driving traffic to Amazon, which is benefiting them, why not receive compensation for that service you are providing them? If you are worried about making your website the best it can be reinvest that revenue stream back into the website but don't leave honest and perfectly legitimate money on the table for no reason. That doesn't help anyone.","510":"I'd have to disagree, I'm sure at any given point there aren't a lot of hot items that can give you large, after-fee returns that will sell quickly. When you put those filters on your list it shrinks the pool of potential flips drastically. And to just offer it up to a sub with 60k subscribers for free where they can literally sit in their chair drinking coffee and compete directly against you? I think you underestimate your competition, online Amazon to ebay arbitrage is as easy as it gets and your competition is now national (if not worldwide!) not just local like a hot tip on the best thrift store in your hometown.","511":"One other question do you spider ebay and Amazon directly? I've had some ideas of building web crawlers and I'm sure other flippers have done it too despite the legalities but ebay worries me, hence why I abandoned my old project of crawling completed sales in certain subcategories, storing completed sales data in my own DB then using math algorithms to determine maximum bids and which items to buyout on live listings for my own project. If I made it I would have kept it secret but I didn't want to get a cease and desist notice (or worse) from ebay and I didn't want to run it behind their backs through proxies either. That was a few years ago though and I've lost interest since so not sure if maybe you are taking another method.","512":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n If you are requesting Amazon, [W] Amazon, please do not include a dollar amount.

I rarely buy mass-market products, aside from consumables.  Soap and shampoo from Wal-Mart or Target are just fine.\n\nI always pick up clothing online, usually waiting for sales.  Recently, I bought several shirts from a brand not sold in my town.  They were marked down to $15-$20 each.  Which is the same price or lower than shops in town.  I got a better quality product at a lower price.  And I didn't have to fight crowds or find parking, either.  This is why I don't think I'll ever go to a mall regularly again.","514":"Yeah, I meant Amazon as the biggest example, but \"online shopping\" is probably a better answer.","515":"Google is secure because they are going to invent the next \"thing\", and if they don't invent it, they'll have a clone of it.

They aren't one thing anymore, so they aren't at risk of being supplanted by the next big thing.\n\nOne of the reasons I don't like Apple as a company right now, because they seem to be content with where they stand and aren't really innovating.  Google and Amazon are probably the two best examples I can think of for staying fresh and relevant in an extremely fast-paced sector. I used Netflix on purpose. They were a company that had it's days numbered, especially in the wake of new and abundant competition (hulu, amazon prime, crackle, YouTube rentals, Redbox, etc etc). They reinvented themselves by offering premium content that they produced, taking their fate into their own hands instead of being reliant on the good graces of the entertainment industry that hated them. That's paid off and I wouldn't be surprised to see Netflix become the next big entertainment giant.","516":"The Mall of America has expanded in recent years and shows no signs of slowing down despite competition from Amazon, some revolving anchor tenants, etc. Whatever is happening to this particular mall is not common to every big mall.","517":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n If you are requesting Amazon, [W] Amazon, please do not include a dollar amount.

Reading through the reviews you will notice many people repeat the same points. These can form the basis of your review. Now, reviews are your own personal opinion.

But I but 90% of Americans know very little about it.  It's not for everyone.\n\nIf you do want to learn, here are a few thoughts:\n\n1.  Pick up a copy of \"Investing for Dummies.\"  You can get it at the library or on Amazon.  Great book, written so anyone can understand.  I learned about investing with this book.\n\n2.  Learn about personal finance.  (investing and personal finance go hand-in-hand)  Watch the Suze Orman Show on CNBC every Saturday for a couple months.  She makes it pretty to understand things like retirement investments, credit card debt, emergency funds, etc.\n\n3.  Do you have a thousand dollars of money you can \"play\" with?  (money you can afford to lose?)  Set up an account on Vanguard or eTrade or Sharebuilder.  Just jump in and learn to buy investments.  Buy an index fund like DIA or QQQ.  These are a safe bet over time.  They will go up and down, but you won't lose all your money.  You might even make a few bucks.\n\ntwo things to remember:\n\n- Most people don't know how to invest their own money.  They use financial planners.  And there's nothing wrong with that, if investing isn't something you are interested in.  (However, many people, including people in this subreddit, find investing money yourself fun and rewarding.)\n\n- The stock market game does not teach you anout real investing.  The goal is to make lits of money in a short amount of time.  This encourages risky investments.  In the real world, most people invest for the long term.

It's more of a regular workhorse kind of credit card where as the Amazon card splits their earnings in 3, 2 and 1% categories. 2% on everything will earn you much more in the long run if most of your spending happens outside of Amazon.com. There is no signup bonus, but you get 15 months of 0% interest.\n\nWhichever card you end up getting, there is no annual fee, so don't ever close them! But pay them off of course.

Clean out your house\/garage types.","596":"Easy to set up, hard to drive traffic and convert to Amazon sales","597":"Have you ever tried to return something to Amazon? It's easy, and that is why buyers trust the marketplace.  It sucks for us sellers, but buyers don't need a reason to return things, with few exceptions that your item doesn't fall into.  He could say he didn't like his reflection in your Kindle, and that would be a valid reason for a return because your return policy MUST be as favorable as Amazon's own, or more.  \n\nYou should read Amazon's return policy, but in the future, do not sell high value items on Amazon if you cannot absorb the cost of returns. Craigslist or even ebay are better venues.  I also see you are a fellow bitcoiner.  Check out openbazaar or bitcointalk goods forums which are way more seller friendly.\n\n It is a cost of doing business that sucks, but we all have to do it.  Sorry for your loss.  \n\nEdit:  also check with Amazon to see if they will let you charge a restocking fee.  According to their web site, you can if it is returned to you in a condition other than how you shipped it.  I would paste the link but my phone is being a little bitch right now, so google the return policy and restocking fees and it is there.","598":"$10 Amazon for CSGO?","599":"You won't get worthwhile returns without playing the market. However, there's more risk.\n\nHave you thought about a rewards checking account? They usually offer better returns than CDs and savings accounts up to a certain amount of money.\n\nYou'll usually have to meet some requirements such as direct deposit, online bill pay, electronic statements, so many debit card transactions per month, and\/or ACH.\n\nTo meet the debit card transactions, I usually purchase $1\/$2 Amazon giftcards, since I'm a frequent shopper.\n\nFor example, the Consumer Credit Union offers 5.09% and 4.09% back on balances up to $20k. Keep $20k and a little extra for your debit\/credit card transactions and bill pay. Anything higher, withdraw. So, withdraw your paychecks and monthly dividends whenever you get them.\n\n\nI would also recommend maybe a reverse CD ladder. Start with a longer term CD and work your way down. Don't start CDs that offer less interest than savings accounts.\n\nLook at depositaccounts.com and bankrate.com for interest rates. ","600":"Based on the description of the business you gave, I'd advise you take a few steps to ensure potential for scale and profit first before going out of pocket on registering, etc. I say this because ultimately, you don't want to be out of $X amount of dollars on an idea that wasn't going to go anywhere anyway. \n\nTest your idea via Google's Keyword Research tool (what is volume and competition like?), scout out critical Amazon reviews on similar products to gauge feedback from your market, take that feedback and use it to ensure your product won't just end up being a copy of anyone else's, get active on forums or blogs relevant to your market and get feedback in real time from potential customers, message people in your personal network with a link to your PayPal and ask them to buy via a pre-order option. Find a way to generate cash flow as quick as possible.  \n\nAgain, you may think your idea is the coolest thing in the world but you'll want to keep your costs as low as possible in the beginning so you don't waste resources on something you'll have to change. For accessories like yours, test and validate first, register later. I say this only because I sell accessories and did the opposite.\n\nOne other option is meeting with a SCORE advisor.

Personally, it's not the best card, higher interest and low rewards. We use it more than any other card, pay more than min balance every month and only got $52 in rewards this year, interest was more than that for a under 1k balance. My other card that I don't use as often, through a credit union has a lower interest rate and gets better rewards. I got no bonus for signing up and it does have a lower limit...but in the 2-3 years we have had both the credit union one is overall better. Our deal for signing up with Amazon was $100 back. Honestly...credit at 18 is better avoided. Get a card for someplace you rarely shop, then every 6 months or so go buy something small on the card and pay it off completely when you get the statement. That will boost your credit so you can get a car\/house when you need. Otherwise, stick to good bank with loyality programs. Credit unions tend to have better service, especially small ones but most lack rewards programs that large banks have. Otherwise to build credit keep up on utility bills(if you have them) as most will send you proof of credit if you need it. Utility companies, phones, cable, etc typically don't report to credit unless your delinquent. Getting too many cards, racking up a balance, late payments, etc will all hurt your credit. Your already behind the game since you have \"no history\" so be very careful or you will end up in a bind in your 20's-30's...you won't really see this till you need it though, getting a house or car will be very difficult if you screw it up now.

However, I didn't listen to my parents when they gave sound advice about saving and investing. Luckily, I managed to turn things around by the time I was about 25. Now, I've got over $200K invested and saved and my wife and I just got back from an eastern Europe road trip over the xmas break and didn't have to think twice about money. We still make a budget for everything and spend as little as we can.\n\nHere are the 4 pillars of finance. They are all equally important and you need to know what part they all play.\n\n* Banking\n* Savings\n* Budgeting\n* Investing\n\n[This book](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich\/dp\/0761147489) will be a great introduction for you. You can get it used on Amazon for $10, or better yet, try to find it at your local library, or your school library.\n\nWhen I was 15, I made minimum wage by working at a fast food restaurant, great way to get money. I usually spent all that money on taking my girlfriend out on dates to restaurants and movies, and on gas for the car and the car payment itself. It will be difficult, but staying single will save you a lot of money. Or, splitting the bill on dates will at least help. If you have to buy stuff, try to buy it used. The best way to accumulate money is to only spend it when you absolutely have to.\n\n* You don't need an awesome car, just a cheap one that will get you around or a bike if your town is conducive. Take the bus, or car pool with friends as much as you can to save on gas.\n* If you're out with friends, don't spend money if you don't have to, or at least only spend a little on cheap stuff, like just a cheeseburger and water, not the $8 value meal. Your friends may look at you weird now, but they'll look back on it later and see how smart you were.\n* You don't need awesome clothes, so don't waste your money on that. Same goes for gadgets, or at least try to buy them used, only if you must have it.\n* Stay home as long as your parents will allow, even in college if you can.\n* Before you start investing, become familiar with investing. You can read all you want for free at [Investopedia](http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/). They have great videos too. The Motley Fool is not a great place for beginners, but [this page](http:\/\/www.fool.com\/teens\/teens05.htm) is ok. Seriously, don't read anything else on that website, it's mostly BS.\n* I'm not trying to ruin your childhood with these suggestions, but there are tons of free things you can do with friends or inexpensive things. You don't have to spend money to have a good time.\n* Ask your parents if there are things you can do around the house for allowance. Ask them if they will give you your week of lunch money up front and let you keep it, even if you spend it on bread and lunch meat and take a sandwich everyday. Save that left over money! DON'T spend it on crap foods and candy in vending machines. It's not \"extra\" money to waste, it all adds up.\n\nAs you get older:\n\n* Credit cards can deplete you of all your money, very fast. **DO NOT GO INTO DEBT**. If you do get a credit card, do not use it unless you have the money to pay it off right away. This will ruin your life, not kidding. No amount of rewards points or \"cash back\" is worth going into even $1 of debt. When I was 15, I couldn't get a cell phone plan unless I had good credit. However, they did let me get the account if I could pay a deposit of $150. Hopefully, your parents will do this for you though.\n* If you don't get a scholarship and your parents can't pay for college, **DO NOT GO INTO DEBT** by taking out student loans. Go to a local state college or community college and try to pay your tuition with cash. You might miss out on some of the cultural aspects of a university, but you'll still get your education and I've never been turned down for a job because I went to a community college instead of an expensive university.\n* Once you've read up on the basics of investing, read [this book](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street\/dp\/0393325350\/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420554566&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=a+random+walk+down+wall+street), you can get it used for under $5 or free at your local library.\n* Another great book that taught me a ton about accumulating wealth is [The Millionaire Next Door](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/file\/d\/0By08aJi3b331ZFRUc0JvQzlRWnV6TnZGQVR0V2plUQ\/edit?pli=1). It might not all make complete sense right now, but it will demystify what it really means to be rich.\n\nWow, this post got a little long winded. I've got plenty of other ~~advice~~ information that I've learned over the years. I'll try to post it later when I get a chance. Last bit of advice, as for investing, take your time, don't be in a hurry. Make sure you know what you're doing before investing your money in anything. Good luck!\n\n**Edit:** I just read the bit about you living in Finland and having free school. Rock on! I'll leave the advice about student loans and community college for others.","619":"Sent in 330 units of chapstick to Amazon without using their inventory placement service, which costs $99 (.30 each).

Sent the inventory back to be liquidated, which costs $165 (.50 each).\n\nNow in $330+shipping expenses+cost of goods in the hole due to my poor execution.\n\nLuckily the add-on restriction went away on Amazon and I resent in the inventory. Made $2 per unit afterwards even after factoring in my screwups. Either way, still wasted $330.","620":"Impulse purchases on Amazon. :(","621":"Those are good points.  I'd add to yours:\n\n* For Amazon if using them for fulfillment of small items, make sure they sell for more than $10, otherwise most of your profit will be sucked up in fees. \n\n* For ebay, make sure you factor in shipping costs.  That .85 becomes .75 or even .65.  You can pass the shipping costs to buyer, but ebay charges fees on shipping when you do that. \n\n* Low sales rank on Amazon is actually better than high.

Amazon is well known by everyone and they feel comfortable buying something from them, so the conversion rate is higher\n2. Shipping is great especially with Prime membership, this means people will often buy other stuff once they hit Amazon\n\nYou just have to test out what works best in your niche, but chances are Amazon will be the best option when considering the bottom line.","625":"Depends, because if you're selling items on Ebay, you get a bit  of a discount, and Ebay has a software program you use to estimate cost of shipping. \n\nForgetting Ebay or Amazon, USPS, UPS, FedEx all have calculators online that you can use to estimate shipping costs. You need the final weight and dimensions of the package you're shipping to enter into the calculator. \n\nThat's the simple answer, but all the shipping companies have pretty good websites that explain their shipping rates and policies. Search reddit for past questions about shipping in r\/flipping, r\/amazon, r\/ebay, and there's more subreddits where questions about shipping have been answered in depth. \n\nIf you have a specific question about a specific item, and you know the weight, dimensions,  from and to where you're shipping, you could probably get a more specific answer.

I make a killing on most of these on Amazon FBA.  Some vintage camera gear (not all, do your research) as well. I've gotten vintage bellows type Kodaks and Polaroids for like $4 and sold for near $100. NOTE: You will do much better on Amazon FBA with this than on eBay. That's my experience at least.\n\n","636":"I get my socks and undies from Costco. They may not be the cheapest, but I like them and they serve me well. Those Kirkland undies hug the veggies nicely.

You **need** to knock out those high interest debts (all the credit cards and the Bill Me Later) **now**.\n\nYou should probably use the avalanche method (highest interest rate first), so here's your priority list:\n\n1.

I would probably keep a small buffer set aside as a \"cash float\" to keep make sure everything goes smoothly while you do this (equal to the max you may need to pay with a single paycheck) and put the rest of your savings into this debt. This will let you have a small buffer while knocking your debt out in a rapid manner.\n\nBased on the amounts shown, you've got a total of just about $4k in high interest (double digit APR) debt. You should be able to knock this all out in the next month or so, based on your savings and left over numbers (though some things are missing from your budget- where does your food come from?). \n\nAt that point, you can build up your \\savings again, and have an extra $186\/month to do it with. Aim for 3-6 months savings in an emergency fund, place it in the highest interest savings account you can get your hands on at that time, and let it stay there for now. Also keep that cash float I mentioned earlier in your checking account- that lets you not worry about when your check hits the bank in order to pay your bills.\n\nYour student loans and car loan aren't great interest rates, but they're bearable while you build the e-fund. Assuming you ignore them, and target the high interest debt, you can hit your $10k savings target by the end of the year, probably around November.

If you wait long enough you can see that movie for free on TV, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime video... there's just so much content coming out all the time, I don't feel the need to pay a \"rental charge\" for a movie any more.","690":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I just put it down as laziness and consider that most of the things I am buying are things I would need to buy somewhere anyway, like dish detergent, laundry detergent, Clorox wipes, etc. I just don't feel like driving to the store to buy shampoo when it can be on my doorstep in two days with FREE SHIPPING.","694":"Solution: budget + gift card balance.\n\nAmazon allows you to guy gift card balance directly. I allocate $20 a week towards it. When I have enough to buy something I want, I buy it and not unless.\n\nThat and the 30 day rule - when you want to buy something, write it down and put todays date next to it. Don't buy anything untill 30 days have passed. 2-3 days is usually enough to take off heat.\n\nAdd: exploit Prime. Ask for no-rush shipping.

They were never super high (maybe 4k at the most), but I never felt comfortable paying them completely off. I had been underemployed for the second half of 2013 and never quite felt caught up.

Their profits are scarce and the valuation is so ludicrous that I can't consider Amazon a good investment. \n\nAlso, speaking from experience, Amazon's customer service is so good mostly because they practically give things away if you speak up. I got a free pair of speakers once just because one speaker didn't work - I didn't have to send it back or anything. Another time, they refunded one of my lost packages (and it was an item worth over $100), no questions or proof of theft asked for. Is that a great way to building customer loyalty? Absolutely. But does it kill already scarce margins? Also true. \n\nAnd lastly, Amazon's dominance in online retail is far from assured - for example, I have been buying increasingly fewer things from Amazon as they have started charging sales tax in my state. \n\nI speak mostly from personal experience, but while I like Amazon, I don't find them to be as compelling of a choice as they used to be - I even opt to buy things from brick and mortar on occasion if I need it badly enough.

What we see are categories, not items.\n\nI'm going to try to keep this as high level and brief as possible:\n\nThere are three types of merchants.  The only ones that report anything to us are called managed merchants.  They would be the WalMarts, Targets, Amazon, American Airlines, etc. Basically any major international retailer or service provider is managed.  \n\nManaged merchants are unique in the fact that they send us submission files at specific times every day and those files are absolutely massive and contain tons of information in them.  There are things you would expect in those files such as the name of the customer, the amount they charged, and the taxes charged.  What they don't send us is itemized list of every item that you charged up because quite frankly we don't care and wouldn't know what to do with all of that data (you'd be shocked at how inefficient and inept the credit card companies are with taking advantage of big data).  \n\nThe special things we see in a file are pre-negotiated between the credit card companies and the merchants.  In your specific example, AmEx has their client manager talk with Staples and they work out a way to build in a unique identifier that gets 'flagged' as a special transaction that they need to look at.\n\nWhen AmEx gets that submission file from Staples with your charge inside it, AmEx systems read that file and say \"Oh we see a code45 and a code22 (I made those up), that's $5.95 and $6.95 additional that we need to charge the card, but not settle with the merchant.\" (AmEx is keeping that money - or at least some large portion of it)\n\nThese negotiations and codes and whatnot are always talked about when a merchant grows from level one (regional) to level two (national) to level three (managed).  At each step the credit card company will ask more and more from the company and give a bigger and bigger discount off their fee in order to get better data.\n\nHappy to answer any more questions if that wasn't clear.","737":"How many keys do you have and how much Amazon per?","738":"I order big bags of dog food from Amazon (30 lbs. for about $30, cheapest anywhere for good quality food), but most other grocery items are substantially more expensive online than in local stores.

Because VOD is secure and the internet is not.  If the money is there, businesses will come.  If the market means less money (including theft issues), they don't come.  That's why you don't have nice movie theaters in bad neighborhoods. The eggheads pay to analyze the internet show that people who would pay don't pay if they can figure out how to get it for free on the internet.

This is generally how Goodwill works, but obviously every state operates differently.\n\n* 1) Items get donated and the obviously very valuable things are sorted out and set aside for auction.\n* 2) Over the last couple years Goodwill has been building 'vintage' stores. They also began building video game stores called 'The Grid' last year. Sorters have a list of brand names for clothes, makers marks for house wares, and other identifying information. All items that are on the list get pulled and sent to the vintage or video game stores where they are priced much higher.\n* 3) If items make it through the first 2 stages of sorting they're priced and put out on the shelf (obviously some items slip through so you can still find gems at regular stores but it gets harder every year). Every state has a hierarchy of stores, if something doesn't sell for a long time it is shipped to a new store, generally moving down the chain. Once it doesn't sell for many many months it's sent to a Goodwill outlet.\n* 4) For this reason Goodwill outlets have mostly garbage that is sold by the pound. Again, you can find good items there but the odds of something not selling in 6+ months at multiple Goodwills before it reaches the outlet is slim. The money to be made at outlet stores is usually due to volume. You can get clothes, shoes, and other items incredibly cheap since it's all sold by the pound. It's not hard to pick up dozens of shirts or shoes cheaply and bang out a $5 profit on the items, which requires you to buy hundreds of things to make any real money.\n\nEvery year Goodwill gets better and better at squeezing the value out of their donations. For instance in my state, sorters use an Amazon scanner on every single book that comes through, and they mark up any valuable ones like textbooks or automotive manuals close to Amazon prices. This will most likely become a national standard in the next year or two. My Goodwills also have multiple professional appraisers on staff that are able to identify most antiques easily. These people have some pretty deep and obscure knowledge and rarely do they let stuff slip through. I'm pretty good friends with the district manager in my state and she says that more states are moving to do this as the appraisers are able to pay for themselves 1000x over with the items they catch.","788":"&gt; people grumble about Apple and Walmart not paying their fair share to help those in need\n\nNot me.

If you're selling NIB retail goods then Ebay really isn't the place for it anymore, Amazon is (although Amazon sides with buyers way more than even Ebay does). I'd say Ebay's stock price, revenue, and traffic aren't terrible considering the explosion of Amazon over the last 5 years. Ebay will probably decline in the next 5 years or make more changes as they've been trying to do, but I don't see another auction website being able to displace them anytime soon. It's not easy building a platform with 300 million unique visitors a month, plus all the backend tools that exist for sellers.\n\nPeople seem to forget why Ebay is so buyer friendly, and it's because regardless of how many anecdotes sellers have of buyers scamming them, there are WAY WAY more sellers that try to scam buyers. Go on Alibaba or some of the popular Chinese auction sites and see how many items are completely different than what was advertised and when you try to get your money back they simply disappear only to start selling again under a different name.\n\nAlso the amount of buyers out there scamming is drastically over-stated by melodramatic sellers. I have thousands of completed sales on Ebay and have only had issues with &lt;1% of those. Compare that to a retail store where shoplifting is incredibly common and almost impossible to stop. Not to mention often times Ebay\/Paypal will just eat the cost and refund both the seller and buyer if something obviously sketchy is going on (like tracking number shows delivered but customer claims they never got it. Or customer claims INAD but contradicts what was clearly listed in the 'condition' section).","798":"He means far more bad buying experiences compared to bad selling [due to scamming buyers]. Which I would believe because for every buyer trying to scam someone, there's 10 sellers trying to scam their buyers. If you look at the statistics for online sales platforms, the vast majority of scams and complaints originate from the sellers end, this is why Amazon and Ebay side so heavily with buyers because more often than not they're right. There's way more money to be made putting up a misleading listing and selling hundreds of products to buyers than there is to be made manually scamming sellers one by one.\n\nOf course some legitimate sellers get caught in the crossfire, which is unfortunate, but you can blame the bad eggs who ruined it for everyone. It's just like back in the day before Ebay started charging FVF's on shipping.

Like you said, retail conversion rates are high because people already came in your store purposefully to buy something. The problem is even retail locations have tons of competition so while you're converting 20% of customers, maybe only 5% of potential customers are coming through your door while the other 95% go down the street to your competitor. This is why Ebay is so valuable because they already get 300 million people onto your sales platform, instead of going to some other website where you're not selling.\n\nAlso as someone who has experience with running brick and mortar locations, it's WAY more expensive than selling online (this is why so many retailers are having a hard time competing with Amazon and other online vendors). Rent is incredibly expensive, insurance costs are high, then you have utilities and employees to pay, maintenance costs, and one of the biggest expenses - **shoplifting**. Theft in a retail setting is a huge deal, and will probably cost you more than fees, shipping, mail fraud (which is incredibly rare) and everything else combined.","803":"Because it's cheaper.

However, with priority, you can use their free boxes that come in many sizes, so that factors in to the calculation.

Always round up to the next ounce (as per USPS policy). If you underpay for shipping, the person receiving the package will owe postage and that's a huge nono for customer satisfaction. Also you cannot use free Priority boxes for anything *but* Priority mail. If you try sending first class package using a priority mail box, USPS will charge the receiver the Priority mail rate, which is much higher, which again is a big nono.","897":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Aside from my company I also work a full time job and right from the start orders started getting out of hand so I had to recruit my semi-retired dad to run shipping and operations.\n\nTo date we have done just under 30k in sales fulfilling about 1350 orders. We are constantly adding new inventory and hope to double if not triple this number for 2015.","940":"I was told the same thing a couple months ago when I opened CSP, Southwest Plus and IHG in a span of a month.

How often do they add new offers?","943":"From the way it sounds, it's really all up to oneself to generate a quality product.  It sounds like there are no actual walls in place to prevent people from publishing complete junk.  Other than the rating system, there really is nothing else.  Correct?  Does Amazon have a review process?  Any forced guidelines?  Or, is it really just peer review only?\n\nI've never really looked into book writing seriously, but I've been told by many of my friends that I should.  There are topics I know quite a bit about, and I have a reasonable writing skill.  I would enjoy writing some short books on various topics, but I've never looked seriously before due to difficulty of the process.  If something like Amazon allows anyone with any content to self publish, then there's really very little in the way for anyone to start writing content.  From the way it sounds, there is also very little risk other than wasting your own time if the book flops and descends into the blackest void of e-book hell.  Even then it's only a failure just from a monetary standpoint and nothing else as even a flop is a learning process.","944":"Aside from Square, you can also use Amazon Local (the app is pretty clunky though) or PayPal.

If there's no competition then that's not really a good thing either. If there is competition see what things they aren't doing that you can do to differentiate yourself. By that, it could be as little as starting an instagram page to sell on, where other competitors don't have one.

You can specify the number of servers and how powerful they need to be. Or, to make it easy for you to access the computers' 'horsepower', and not have to worry about what Operating System &amp;amp;amp; version, Amazon have written a bunch of software tools (Amazon Web Services) to make it easy to 'do work'.\n\nThe tools Amazon have written do things like store lots of data (e.g. a bit like dropbox you make private or public), process large volumes of calculations (i.e. number crunching), send bulk emails, distribute software, act as the backend of your mobile apps, etc.\n\nAs you may have guessed, these aren't tools that just anyone can easily pickup and use - you need to be a a student or professional software developer. They're tools designed by programmers, for programmers.\n\nYou pay 'rent' based on your usage (e.g. how many GB you store, how much processing\/number crunching hours you use, how much data you send out). This is what the $1,000 credit pays for. How far your $1,000 goes depends on how much 'horsepower' you need, but its easy to spend $100 per month for just 1 little server.\n\nThere is a complex calculator that will help you figure it out https:\/\/calculator.s3.amazonaws.com\/index.html but if you're unfamiliar with the terminology, this service isn't for you.\n\nMicrosoft have a similar offering called Windows Azure, and Google has AppEngine. \n\n","955":"$15 Amazon for 2x$10 cards? :) ","956":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

The problem, in my opinion, with FBA is it's the easier way to make money. This means there's a whole lot more people competing and the margins are often lower; if your margins are too low it's actually possible you'll work harder than me because too much time will be spent sourcing items vs. finding a balance that generates income.\n\n2) N\/A\n\n3) Deal in what you know. That's the best possible way you can reduce your risk, if you know loads about old type writers, sell those. If you know about model trains, sell those. I know electronics, people say it's high risk and what not, but I sell electronics.\n\n4) Dollars doesn't matter, percentage does. Who cares if you double your money on 10 $100 items or 2 $500 items? Ultimately it's up to you to figure out how much margin is fair but be realistic. You aren't going to make 4,000x the money you put in but on the same token you shouldn't be making so little where it's not worth the time.\n\nEdit: Some people suggest not going below a certain dollar amount because of fees. Like you aren't going to make much, if anything, selling dollar items.\n\n5) It's really that easy, however in my experience the best margin has been from items that aren't barcoded, aren't scanable. The used items that aren't wanted anymore.\n\nIn my opinion, and it's only because it's what worked for me, if you want to make real money flipping you either need to A) Get a whole lot more than $1,000 of new inventory to flip and make the money with volume or B) Deal in used items, get your hands dirty, and use eBay instead. Amazon FBA can be good for some businesses, it might be best for you I don't know, but look at all your options.

Congrats!  Please don't take any of the questions personally - getting grilled when starting a new business is a great way to understand your weaknesses and grow from them.  Now on to the tough questions.\n\nYou mention that you are really good on the business side multiple times in this thread but I am not seeing it.  \n\nDo you have a business plan?  Children's clothing is highly competitive and marketing will be a huge portion of the business.  Are you saying that your lack of creativity is preventing you from figuring out how to market your product?  Or is your lack of creativity preventing you from creating your product(s)?  Not that I expect you to give a lot of detail but what you have told us so far it sounds like you want to start a children's t-shirt company.  Are you essentially starting a company selling t-shirts for children but lack creativity to design the product line?  \n\nYou mention that you lack a knack for knowing what will appeal to the masses - how do you know your product will appeal to the masses?  \n\nI am confused as to what you are looking for in a business partner.  You want someone creative that can do what for you?  Design your idea into an actual product?  Market your product?  You do not want to pay this partner?  Do you plan to give up a % of the business or do you expect someone to do the most difficult part of business development for free?  Why would this person commit to you or your business?  If all you bring to the table is an 'idea' and 'business development' whats to stop this individual from stealing your idea and doing the difficult work on their own?  \n\nCan I ask, what business development have you done for this business?  You have 15 years in business development doing what?  \n\nBefore you can really get to the 'find a business partner' phase I think you need to have a complete business plan.\n\nThis business plan should include expected costs in manufacturing, product design, marketing, website\/website design, etc.  Additionally it should lay out a funding strategy for purchasing inventory and surviving the initial year or two of expenses.  Included in this should be a sourcing strategy.\n\n1. All the legal requirements including the formation of the business, contracts, terms of service, etc. \n\n2. A clear focus and goals that are laid out and explained along side the overall business strategy.  You mention a companion app to grow the identity of your concept.  Really?  Stay focused you have much more important things to think about that are right in front of you - not an app pipe dream.\n\nMarketing isn't 'here is my idea now sell it'.  In clothing the product design and the marketing strategy go hand in hand. \n\nHave you done research on your competition?  Do you know how their business works and how they make money?  You are going to market online have you searched high and low around the net to see what type of businesses are in that space?  Is your idea unique enough that you can carve your niche?  Can a competitor, using their established business and manufacturing sources, take your idea and create your product for cheaper?  Do you know the expected costs of marketing your company?  The costs to build an e-commerce site?  Do you know the cost to sell on sites like Amazon?  Do you have a strategy to handle inventory and shipping?  Do you have a strategy for your technology needs that is ready to be implemented?  Business software, inventory, sales software, shipping and logistics, etc?  \n\nI am quite curious as to how far along the process you are.\n\n","983":"Kinda a self serving philosophy.

We buy PLENTY of beer and wine.  This was without us cutting back (which I'm re-budgeting now).\n\nA) Have a grocery list.  If you and your spouse both do grocery shopping, find one you can share over your phones.  Since I do 100% of the grocery shopping, I use the out of milk app.  If it's not on the app, don't buy it. I do some impulsive shopping here and there, but having a list makes it less likely, plus shopping is faster and easier.\n\nB) For toiletries, check out Amazon Subscribe and Save.

I have TP, PT, Coffee, Cotton Balls, Razors come once every 3 months.

I bought him sliced turkey and ended up throwing away an entire package unopened. So he got cut off from getting turkey - if you aren't going to eat it, I'm not going to waste money on it.\n\n4) Cheese is expensive, but it has a long shelf life (generally).  Many people want to keep the lifestyle they have, and that's great. Cheese is a pretty expensive item, but it keeps for a long time - so if you want to continue eating your cheeses, make sure to pay attention when they are on sale.  It may make sense to buy x3 string cheese at -1.00 off, opposed to full price more frequently.\n\n5) ALWAYS check the unit price, not the total price.  You'll be surprised how smaller packaged items are actually cheaper than their bulk counter parts, as well as charger per unit. It always blows my mind. \n\n6) Try to clear out the inventory. If you've been spending a lot, and your pantry is expanding, catalog what you have and try to build meals around this.

I definitely recommend it if you have bookstores near you--thrift stores might buy clothing, but usually take household items and books as donations. \n\nIf any books are of particular value or rarity, like a complete set for example, you could try listing on Amazon or eBay first.

Don't pay any attention to the list value-- you won't get anywhere near that for a used book except in rare cases.

I also don't think they will be able to succeed with proprietary APIs that would allow them to charge a premium.  \n\nBut the biggest issue for MS is their brand.   They are well behind Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.   Xbox is only positive here.   Maybe they should rename the company Xbox :).\n\nI think what is going to happen is that they are going to waste a ton of money trying to catch up.

No such thing on eBay ","1073":"I find items and import from Alibaba and sell on Amazon pretty often.  Actually, that is all my company is based on.  Since you sell on Amazon, I assume you know how to check item ranking.  That is your first step.  It would also be a good idea to use 3camels to get an idea how the price has moved over the last 6 months.  Another thing to consider is how big are the other sellers on the listing?  Do you think they bought 1K of this item or brought the item over on a container?  if so, they are going to be able to undercut you when needed.  They will also have cheaper rates unless you plan to FBA your units.\n\nIs this a name brand item?  If you find an item on Alibaba that has a huge margin on Amazon and is very popular, there may be a reason others are not selling it.  The margin you speak of is pretty good and if I found the item you are talking about and could sell 5 units a day on Amazon, I would have no issue purchasing 500+ units.  Since this product is new and \"Hot\" the bottom is going to fall out on the pricing - especially if it is any kind of tech item.  What happens is the factories in China start doing small manufacturing runs so the price is higher.  At some point, the item takes off and the factories start purchasing the parts in larger qtys and the price will be murdered.  I have sold items in this category before and it is very risky.  A popular product I did this with that comes to mind is the MK802.  It came about about 2 years ago and I was buying 1K units at a time for about 60.00 per unit when they were selling for 100.00.  Item is on Amazon now for 39.99.  When I purchased my 1K units, it allowed the factory to offer a better price to the next guy.  If you want to PM me a link to the product for a 2nd opinion, I would be happy to let you know what I think.  I am not looking to steal your idea.

All my kids now use Chromebooks at school and they all do their documents on Google Docs.   Yes, big enterprises will take a long time to change but more and more startups will be using Google solutions, IMO.   BTW, the youth are our future :).   I don't see anyway MS wins back schools.  It actually is not about price but rather Google has a much better solution.\n\nTalk to some kids.   Having a Outlook or Hotmail email address is not hip.   Check out your own kids.   Has any of them previously had a MS email address and now have a Gmail account?   This actually happen a few years ago.   I have 7 kids, I know pretty crazy, zero have a MS email account.   They all have a Gmail account and older ones also have their .edu account.   They did this completely on their own.      \n\nBTW, to a certain extent email is somewhat dead for kids but when they must I have noticed it is Gmail.   Even Yahoo! is not hip.  \n\n2)  .NET is dead.   No one does native development on Windows desktop.   Has not happen for a pretty long time.   Big problem with .NET is that not as well supported in cloud by Amazon, Google, Heroku, etc.   There is so little proprietary Windows development happening.   Pretty incredible when you compare to 15 years ago.   But quietly it has completely ended.\n\nHead winds is that proprietary is dead including the associated margins.   Nothing is going to change this.   You have to change model.   Huge hit to MS in changing models with little going for them with any new models.  Who visits any MS sites?   I never do.  My kids don't.\n\n3)  MS is debating on offering Windows 10 for free?   Free consumers?  etc.   Any which way this is pressure on pricing and MS loses.   I can not imagine anyone thinks Windows 10 is offense.   It is completely defense.   Just try to slow it down.   No one is going to switch from Apple or Google to Windows.   But a lot more the other direction.\n\n4)  I have not seen MS gain traction in anything new.   Only see spending tons and tons of money.   If they are going to get less in Office and operating systems the shortfall has to be made up somewhere.   Cloud is going to be high capital investment with low margins returns for a very, very long time.  I believe MS has to have a couple of new wins.   Just do not see it happening.\n\n5)  Continued pressure on the brand.   Kids across the world were cussing out MS over Christmas.   Who in this day and age has their network down for 24+ hours?   How are you going to win cloud when you have such a high profile failure?   MS thinking of changing name of IE or running away.   They have huge brand issues and this affects everything, hiring, partnerships, etc.   \n\n6)  We have lots of places for computer interactions today.   Quick list\n      1)  Desktop\n      2)  Smart phones\n      3)  Wearables\n      4)  Tablets\n      5)  Cars\n      6)  TVs\n      7)  IoT beyond wearables\n\nI can not see MS making ground in any of these areas.   Looks like the players are already set.    \n\n7)  MS has too many old tech engineers.   Yes, they have some of the correct engineers but more than a competitor like Google of the wrong kind.   The future is Java, JavaScript, Linux, Node, Angular, NoSQL, Open source, etc.   Plus, they do not get the top engineers any longer.   They go to Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.  \n\nThis entire .NET going open source is such a jump the shark move.   It does not mean anything.  MS themselves are running away from their own back-end.   They paid for Node.js to be ported.\n\n8)  Baggage, baggage, baggage.   All over the place.\n\nI want to stress that MS is not going to happen overnight and it will not be sudden.  They also have the luxury to use financial engineering to hide reality.  aka. IBM.   Plus there will be many pundits that do not want to face reality and will continue to support MS.   My experience has been people are not comfortable with tech change and tend to put their head in the sand and say it is not happening.   I have seen it over and over again over the last 30 years.

If you choose an over saturated niche like male grooming products you'll be in for a not so great surprise a few months down the road when your site generates hardly any traffic and &lt;$10 a day. \n\nYou choose a niche that is well researched, put the effort into making it successful, and you're going to have a hard time NOT making money from having an Amazon affiliate site.\n\nTLDR depends on the niche, depends on the content ","1077":"2. I pay rent to a private owner using Serve (soon Prepaid Redcard, which is basically the same thing.) The online interface allows you to type in a name and address, and it mails them a check. As Lumpy said, search \"Why Amex Serve.\"\n\n4. You have the Southwest Premium card, right? Because if you fly Southwest and have the Premium, the 6000 annual anniversary points *might* make it worth holding onto. I've been looking at fares, and the points have been worth between 1.7 - 1.8 cents each for my destinations\/dates of travel, so 6000 points is about $105. That's how I will justify the $99 annual fee.\n\n3. You can apply for the Plus for the bonus while you hold the Premium. I applied for both in the same day back in November and was approved for both.\n\n13. You can \"churn\" the Southwest Premium as well. Cancel it, then reapply (hours, days, or weeks later - I'm not sure) if it's been at least two years since you got the bonus for it last time.\n\n1. If you decide to cancel, know that the line of credit stays on your report and continues to age for 10 years. So, the biggest change will be your overall percent utilization.  I don't know how high your typical balance is or your credit limits, but if each of your other cards stays below 30% you should be fine. In ten years it will drop off, hurting your average age of accounts (AAoA). Hopefully your score will be more robust by then. Which leads me to....\n\n3. If you're not in a hurry to make that trip, I would prioritize getting a couple more no-annual fee cards that you never intend to cancel in order to \"anchor\" your AAoA in the future. The best go-tos are the Discover It and Chase Freedom cards. I've seen $75 Amazon gift cards for Discover (apply through Amazon) and $200 bonuses for Freedom (right now only $100.) The 5% categories are really worth having as well (right now gas, grocery stores, and movie theaters between the two of them.) You can also get the Bank of America Better Balance Rewards card, which gives you $25 or $30 of free money per quarter for having at least one charge and paying it off every month. Or, get the Amazon for 3% back on Amazon purchases when you can't get 5% through the first two I mentioned.\n\n32. You can also just sign up for the high-bonus cards right now, but still, get some more no-AF cards in the next year or so.\n\n8. My Credit Karma score is about 45 higher than my FICO as reported by Discover It and Barclaycard. (Another perk of the Discover It card - free FICO score every month.) Of course, each person will be different but don't put 100% faith into the CK score.\n\n24798428724. Check out \/r\/awardtravel","1078":"Interesting.

I don't really want to deal with Ebay and have to ship everything myself every time I make a sale, even if it means bigger margins. So I just use the FBA calculator on their site to see what the fees are going to be. So with FBA, the only shipping fee you pay is when you ship your box of stuff to Amazon, which I don't include in the Fees column, because how would you assign each item a portion of the entire shipping cost lol. So I just add the shipping in later, especially since it's so cheap. My first box was only like $8 to ship, despite being almost 25 pounds.\n\nThen, in the Expected Profit column, I use a simple formula that references the Revenue, Cost, and Fees cells, so that it does the math for me. The advantage of doing this is that if you go back and change the Revenue, the Expected Profit will automatically update to the correct amount. I can elaborate a bit more if you're not familiar with Excel formulas and whatnot.\n\nEdit: I should also add that the green cell denotes that the item has sold.

The camelcamelcamel browser plugin will show you price history for things on Amazon.\n\nWhen you get ready to buy your house, don't buy too much even if the bank will loan you the money for a mcmansion.  It's very easy to find yourself \"house poor\" if you go crazy with it.\n\n\nSource:  regular middle class guy, retired in my forties by practicing thrift.","1166":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

If it's not even close, then I'm going to order it off eBay, CL, or Amazon. Now, there is a case for GS to have a \"premium\" because of the \"customer service\" they offer, and rightfully so, but the key here is customer service.\n\nThat being said, I had a very poor experience with GS in like 2010 or so. I was a college student who had lots of extra time so I'd go in and buy new games regularly. My friends and I would smoke pot and play video games all day between classes \/ at night \/ on the weekends. I walk in and there was a new, hipster-looking girl at the register that looked like she knew about video games, and she was the only one available. I was trying to see if Dante's Inferno was anything like God of War, like if it was a hack-and-slash with a decent story line, and if it was selling a lot \/ given good reviews. She seemed really confused and didn't really know what I was talking about, which is fine. Well, in the mean time the manager comes out of the back and for a few minutes he was scoping me out. Was I talking to his girlfriend? His crush? She finally says maybe he can help me so I start asking him the same questions and the guy is acting like he's pissed off, and being absolutely short with me. This was in between classes on a weekday so it's not like it was super busy. So I just kind of ended the conversation, walked out to my car, got on my phone, looked up reviews for Dante's Inferno on my phone, and ordered it off Amazon (for a way better price), and then drove out of the mall parking lot, and I haven't really been there since. Definitely haven't bought anything.","1168":"Well, you can take any increment of $100 you like. If you don't spend a lot at Amazon it doesn't make sense. But as my post said, we buy tons of everyday stuff there. Looking at our monthly spend there, It didn't really change our shopping habits.\n\nYMMV.","1169":"Yeah, sure! And I get 5% back on Amazon purchases anyway (up to $750\/mo, Sallie Mae card). I spend a lot less than $750\/mo at Amazon, so the gift card is really only an additional 5% back for me.","1170":"I recently watched a long interview with Jack Bogle, (the founder of Vanguard) where an enlisted person asked him a question about their savings. He started off by thanking them for there service and noted that we owe each of you great debt in terms of the freedom and security of this country, so I should do the same. Thank you.\n\nHe then went on to say that the TSP is one of the only places where you can find funds that have lower expenses than anything Vanguard can offer. He recommended the TSP over a Vanguard account.\n\nThe video was on Amazon Prime:\n[source](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/An-Evening-John-Bogle-Street\/dp\/B005JI0JZE)","1171":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.
