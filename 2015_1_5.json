At the on-set of the website, I contacted a company within my niche that has a program where developers can embed their program and receive a % of any sales that result. The program looked good and it was highly relevant to the people that would be visiting my site, so I incorporated it into almost every page of my site.\n\nI recently contacted them to let them know that after thousands of targeted visits over the last few months and not one sale, I felt that I was either being scammed or simply people didn't want what they had to offer. Regardless, I told them that that I would be removing their program. They quickly responded that they are testing to see if anything is wrong and that they just completed a transaction through their embedded program on my site. So I checked the admin page they set up to check on any sales, well the purchase they mentioned was not to be found. I can assume that this means that for the past few months, the sales that were resulting from my website were not being recorded.\n\nThey said they were \"looking into it\", and after 2 weeks we have not progressed much further. Through the email conversations we've had, I get the feeling they messed up and just want me to go away. They even went so far as to say that because they didn't see any large increase in sales over the holiday months, that my site just didn't generate any sales.\nThis is ridiculous, there's no way to accurately determine if my website was making any sales by comparing their companies sales record over the holiday months.

Even with a drastically low conversion %, I should still see at least 1 sale.

I was a 2009 college graduate, so I didn't even have a chance to join the workforce in any meaningful way.  Entrepreneurship is just natural to me and I hope I can sustain it over a lifetime\n\nMy entrepreneur journey began selling football tickets during college at U of Florida.  Imagine an 18-year old white kid standing next to the veteran scalpers and hawking tickets.  It was the best experience I could imagine.  I think of it as [rejection therapy](http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/articles\/2013-01-07\/rejection-therapy-a-hundred-days-of-no)  Learning to not be afraid of a 'no' is a very important part of being an entrepreneur.  After college, I started buying and selling tickets online using TicketMaster and Stubhub.  Selling tickets could be its own thread, it's such an interesting space.  There are fortunes being made buying tickets to in-demand events online.  It's just rather tedious (imagine entering 50,000 captcha phrases a year) Also, scalping tickets online doesn't provide 'value' to anyone. I read the domain parking thread today and it makes me proud to be making money by delivering value, not withholding it for profit. \n\nI grew tired of tickets and decided to visit a friend in China.  I stayed for 6 weeks and bought some watches to bring back for gifts.  One watch was especially cool and people asked about it everywhere I went. I got back in touch with my friend in China (who was just teaching English at the time) and he traced it back to a supplier.  I thought I needed an investor\/partner so I contacted the only rich guy I knew and he gave me $4,000 to be my 50\/50 partner.  I ordered 800 watches for $3 each, and paid some guy $3,000 to make me a website.  \n\n*Lesson 1* DON'T SPEND MORE THAN $300 ON YOUR FIRST WEB PRESENCE\n\nI scrapped that site in less than a month and built my own on Shopify. If you can operate your facebook page, you can setup a Shopify account, it's stupid easy.  I set the price at $65.  \n\n*Lesson 2* PRICE HIGH  \n\nIt gives you so many advantages.  Better customers, less returns, room for wholesale\/distributors, and a higher perceived value.  Anyway, I created a fun brand around this. We did fun photoshoots, ran contests in the community (facebook ads were really cheap back then), and we really gained some customers. In a stroke of good luck, I got in touch with a Groupon rep and they agreed to run a deal for my watches.  I was one of the first products to run on Groupon.  (Remember, Groupon was mainly for services like spas and meals at the time)  This went well initially, and they slated me for a Black Friday national deal.  They sold 7,000 of my 'deals' in 3 days.  Turns out my supplier back in China was just a trade company, and he couldn't pull off a deal of my size on his 'credit'  He almost completely screwed up the whole deal, and it was literally one of the lowest points of my life.  In the end, I fulfilled about 70% of the orders successfully, and the other 30% basically told me I ruined their Christmas and got refunds. Funny thing was, Groupon still paid me out the entire amount even though there were almost 2,000 really upset customers (an omen that Groupon did not have their house in order and had their own crash coming)  This company was called [TIKKR](http:\/\/tikkrwatch.com) by the way.  The site is still up but I'm not really in business anymore. I might try to revive it someday.  But I could see the writing on the wall.  There were at least 50 companies I knew of that sold the exact same watch, including Walgreens which sold it without a brand name for $4.99.  I dropped my price and got what I could out of it, but I needed a new idea. Also I had returns and warranties like mad and it cost me a ton of cash, the watches were just cheap...\n\nI honestly don't remember how it came about, but I became aware of bamboo sunglasses being a thing. I was approached by my China friends to start something together. We were hanging out in Chicago that summer (2012 I think) which happened to be Groupon headquarters. I had a friend who worked there, and he got me [access to their sales floor](http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/UCOlTflgvc) so I just kind of hung around and bothered people until I found the girl who sold fashion accessories. \n\n*Lesson 3* To get that big break, sometimes you just have to hang around until something happens to you.  Not sure if that really qualifies as a legit 'lesson' but whatever. \n\nI got her to agree to run us on a national scale. She told us to prepare 10,000 units for sale. I don't know how, but we got $180,000 together between 3 partners . The China guys, the Groupon insider, and me. (Actually I do know how, I used my TIKKR money with a big boost from Bank of Mom. Hi mom!) The China guys handled production, I handled branding, marketing, and everything else and the Groupon guy was the Groupon guy. I came up with [Woodies](http:\/\/Woodies.com) (and I even bought Woodies.com for $4,000 from some Canadian dude who was selling hockey stick chairs) The idea came from the old Woodie station wagons where the frame was made from wood. [I rented a few cars for the photoshoots](http:\/\/woodies.com\/blogs\/summerallyear\/14200769-woodie-classic-cars) I was obsessed with [Ashley Sky](http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/Zazgc3uItO) at the time and I had the crazy idea to hire her for a photoshoot.  I contacted her people and to my amazement, she was only like $600 for a day and she had 100k instagram followers! I figured we would make that money back with one post from her. The Groupon sale went live and we sold like 4,000 instead of 10,000. \n\n*Lesson 4* Be optimistic in general, but be realistic when it comes to forecasts. \n\nI can't remember how many times I had a deal setup where I was like, yea I'm going to pay off all my student loans with this deal. It was usually mildly successful, but after all the bills were paid off, I wasn't as far ahead as I thought I would be. It reminds me of the Old Man and the Sea. You land this HUGE deal, but by the time you drag it to shore, a bunch of little things have brought it back to size. Overhead, customer service time, returns\/warranties, new orders, customs fees, shipping really add up. So with that 'poor' sales showing, the China guys ran into their own cash-flow problems. Groupon guy and I were forced to buy them out basically. But we had a real business with real customers and we were rolling. We now had $140,000 capital base after paying off the China guys, not enough for a big order, so I noticed Kickstarter was really blowing up, and thought I could bridge our cash-flow with a blockbuster kickstarter campaign. This is where things get pretty interesting. I got it in my head I wanted to hire Kendall Jenner for this campaign. Somehow I tracked down her modeling agency and eventually her direct manager. They quoted me $100,000 for the day. I created a Pinterest board and sent it to her and asked if she would do it for $25,000 plus a bunch of incentives and they said YES! I was completely thrown off and not sure what to do. I ran some projections and thought that I could make up most of that money if we raised a lot of kickstarter money. I hired [Ashley Sky](http:\/\/instagram.com\/ashleysky), [Damaris Aguiar](http:\/\/instagram.com\/damarisaguiar), [Kendall Jenner](http:\/\/instagram.com\/kendalljenner), [Aygemang Clay](http:\/\/instagram.com\/aygemang), [Lyall Aston](http:\/\/instagram.com\/lyallaston) photographed it, [Sagette Van Embden](http:\/\/instagram.com\/sagetteveproductions) videoed it, [Lina Palacios](http:\/\/instagram.com\/linagosh) styled it, Mary Guthrie was hair and makeup. It was a giant production. I couldn't believe it. I flew everyone out to Malibu, CA using Southwest Airlines buddy passes! Imagine Ashley Sky and Damaris Aguiar (so hot) standing at the Southwest ticket counter like wtf is standby? I'm over here sweating bullets hoping we don't get stuck in New Orleans and I look like a fraud. Actually I fought those type of feelings a lot during this period. \n\n*Lesson 5* Don't ever put yourself down. \n\nEntrepreneurship is a crazy, improvisational dance. Sometimes I would look around at my competition and think they had it figured out, they were following a plan, they were 'professionals' and I was just doing my best to pretend. That's BS, we're ALL making it up as we go! Don't put this process on a pedestal, fake it til you make it! Anywho, I rent out a Malibu HQ using Airbnb and rented a van for the day. I still can't help but laughing when I remember this scene: I'm driving a large van with Kendall Jenner, Ashley Sky, Damaris Aguiar, and some bros, in the mountains of Malibu, I'm driving kind of fast around the curves because we're late for the call time I set for us. [I'm wearing a captain's hat because that was my thing during that time.](http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/d6-KcVlgpC) and Kendall's manager scolded me for taking the turns too fast. Fun times\n\n[Here is how the campaign turned out](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=54_T8XCGKFM) \n\nSo, I got Kendall to agree to Instagram\/tweet\/facebook the kickstarter campaign, but what I didn't realize is kickstarter is not mainstream and it just didn't convert. I raised like $30,000 in revenue against a cost of like $70,000. I can't say whether I would do it again given hindsight. It has led to great brand recognition because Kendall has kind of blew up and become a mega celebrity. AND her management let me write that contract so I have rights to those photos forever. One tweet by her got me close to 20,000 email subscribers which has been a stream of income ever since. [(Shoutout Mailchimp!)](http:\/\/eepurl.com\/9WGcD) *Monkeyrewards fyi Since then, I've been trying to come up with new designs, build on the brand, and leverage the list that came from Kendall Jenner's gravity to make sales. It's pretty seasonal, coming mostly during the summer and Christmas season. I have some big plans for 2015, but I have to keep them quiet for the time being, maybe there will be a follow-up post this next year\n\nAll that was a year ago and [Woodies](http:\/\/Woodies.com) has had some good times and some slow times. I got into wood watches which have been really good sellers. I started [selling on Amazon](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00LAG0LCU\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LAG0LCU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=woodies-20&amp;linkId=MI5AMC2Y5CWMF7K4) *affiliate, which has been a great boost to the bottom line. \n\nKeep in mind that during this whole time I barely took a paycheck, and moved back in with mom in Tulsa, OK during a dry spell. I don't spend a lot of money, I have zero savings (except for a few Bitcoins) I actually travel most of the year, I'm in Thailand right now writing this to you. So to summarize, I've been an entrepreneur for a long time, and my success is best characterized by a few BIG wins, and mostly small, gradual losses. In between, my life has been great, I get to travel, work remotely, perform autonomous, creative work, do photoshoots with hot models, and learn a lot about myself and the world around me. I wouldn't trade it back and I'm optimistic about he future \n\nTech that makes all this possible:\n\nShipwire &amp; Amazon FBA (Amazon FBA &gt; Shipwire if you're wondering)\n\nAll Google Products: Gmail, Google Drive, Google Forms, Analytics\n\n[Xero](http:\/\/xero.com) for accounting\n\n[Shopify](http:\/\/shopify.com) for e-commerce\n\n[Fiverr](Fiverr.com) to boost online reviews\n\nAlibaba for finding suppliers.

Should I rent an apartment for another year and buy early next year? I also have worries of interest rates going up over the next few years. I'm also considering keeping more in reserves and going with an FHA loan\n","21":"I think we've all seen trends come and go in business. For example, business process re-engineering in the 90's, outsourcing in the 00's, TQM in the late 70's, Kaizen and so on. And then there are project management trends, Agile for example. And don't get me started on tech trends: it seems like anybody with 10gb of data to sort has a Big Data problem on their hands now. \n\n\nBut all of these make sense to me, in terms of the economies of the time, in terms of market demands, in terms of marketing efforts, etc, and obviously, all of these can be applied in an appropriate manner. What I can't get my head around is this drive towards business innovation, and entrepreneurship. It seems that it's become universally desirable, but much in the same way that many companies rave about Big Data regardless of whether they need it, the vague principles of innovation and corporate entrepreneurship seem to be applied regardless of their appropriateness.\n\n\nNow I think I understand the reasons generally cited for this drive. For example, investment into R&amp;D is bearing less fruit as product life cycles decrease, as customer demands change more quickly, as the cost of product development increases, as competitive pressures from emerging economies increases, etc etc. So the costs for R&amp;D are increasing more quickly than revenues are. So companies have to innovate, open up their business models, adopt entrepreneurial postures and so on. This makes sense. At the same time, companies are cost cutting through massive layoffs or restructuring, to reduce the cost of internal R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has laid off 300k in the last decade as it increases academic partnerships, with companies like GSK calling it 'externalisation of R&amp;D'. Cringely is reporting that IBM are laying off 26% of their workforce, while simultaneously making numerous cloud solution acquisitions to compete against Amazon etc. Fine.\n\n\nWhy are governments and academia all restructuring and legislating to promote this? My alma mater is closing down their business school to open a new \"innovation hub\", is aiming to increase the number of private\/public partnerships, and is increasing the number of business innovation and entrepreneurship courses. It's a major restructuring, and I think every university in my country has published similar 'innovation initiatives' in the last year.\n\n\nAt the same time, governments are increasing the amount of public funding directed towards public private partnerships, with the [EU earmarking \u20ac80b for it in the next few years](http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/programmes\/horizon2020\/en\/what-horizon-2020), for example. The number of conferences and talks in my country aimed at private companies taking advantage of academic research is increasing quickly.\n\n\nIs this a trend? Is 'open innovation' a euphemism for \"outsourcing innovation\", with \"acquire and develop\" becoming predominant, internally, over R&amp;D? Are governments 'complicit' in private cost-cutting by directing public funds towards private research? If it is a trend, will it continue? Is it a sensible trend? If it's happening, why is it happening?\n\n\nI'd love to hear anybody's opinions, but particularly people who might have experience of cost cutting on the industry side, or academic restructuring on the other side.","22":"Major week in terms of earnings reports...MSFT, AAPL, FB, GOOGL, AMZN","23":"**updated with more detail on Visa card and shaving saving**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGood morning, I thought I would post a list of things from my recent shift to a more frugal approach, both to compile a list of things that others may want to try out and also to see if anyone had any further suggestions. I've found reading other people's lists like this can be really helpful, as you can just kind of use it as a checklist to see if you've done all the things that person is doing. I'm based in Canada, but presumably these tips should work anywhere. *Please let me know if you have any other simple ideas to cut costs!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**1\\. Cell Phones:** My fiance was already on a very economic cell phone plan, as she's not a big user of data (she pays ~$37\/mth on Koodo mobile), but I was a much larger expense. My typical cell phone bill was about $140\/month (Rogers, 6 GB data, etc.) I switched over to a much cheaper company (Wind mobile) for $35\/mth, albeit with slower (but unlimited) data and poorer connectivity, but considerable value. As well, I sold my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for $400 and used the free\/subsidized phone I got from my new provider. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n*Savings: $1,260\/year (plus $400 for old cellphone!)*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**2\\. Cheaper provider for natural gas and electricity:** We previously got roped-in on some scam from a door-to-door company that combined our natural gas and electricity bill into one bill, at guaranteed rates for 3 years -the catch? the guaranteed rates were WAY higher than the spot rates (I felt sorry for the door-to-door Willy Loman character who came to our door). I did some research and found a different electricity distributor that offers power for $0.065\/kwH vs. the $0.0839\/kwH we were paying before, saving a whopping 29% on power! On the natural gas side, I just switched over to the spot price of $3.019\/Gj as our contracted price was actually about double the spot rate at $5.99\/Gj, even in the Winter!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n*Savings: We still have about another 20 days before the new rates kick in, but we used to pay about $80\/month in power (including all the convenience fees and transmission fees, blah blah) but with the new power provider we should be down to $55-60\/mth for annual savings of ~$300 on power. I don't have my old gas bill in front for me, but paying half of what we did before should lead to similar savings, so let's say ~$300 there as well, for total savings of $600 on utilities alone (I'll update this post with the exact number when I have the bill).*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**3\\. Reduced power and gas consumption:** I went down into the basement and turned down my hot water heater to the recommended level where it still eliminates legionella (you must leave your hot water heater adequately hot to prevent the possibility of infection with legionella, which causes Legionaires disease, I believe the cutoff is 64C). As well, I turned up the temperature in my fridge to 5C, the minimum temperature to keep food fresh, reducing how often my fridge will have to run. We also have a programmable thermostat, so we've set it not to run while we are gone, which will also reduce gas consumption. I unplugged all of our vampire devices and put some of them on a power strip so that I know exactly what is drawing power. Additionally, I put our wifi router and cable modem on a timed power strip that turns off from midnight to 6 AM, when we don't need wifi.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Savings: tough to gauge, I kind of did all this at once and we haven't seen our power and gas bill yet, but these should all have an impact. I'll try to hook up my Kill-a-watt meter to some of these things later and do a calculation on the savings for your benefit. I would conservatively estimate that these would save about $20-$30\/mth combined (biggest impact being the reductions in natural gas consumption and the fridge). So we'll go with the low end of the spectrum and say $240\/yr for argument's sake*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**4\\. LED Bulbs:** So by this point I've become quite addicted to savings, especially on our utilities. How did I keep my fix? Well, I spent a few days researching and found some good deals on LED lights to replace the incandescents and CFLs in my house. I found a good deal for Canadians from a vendor called AMAZINGLED on Amazon.ca and bought a bunch of bulbs in bulk to replace all my lights at home. The efficiencies are pretty astounding as ten 10w LED bulbs use the same amount of power as just one of my old 100w bulbs, plus, the LED bulbs are expected to last 25-40 years! So not only do we save on electricity expenses, but also on replacement bulbs. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Savings: again, a little hard to gauge, because I did this all at once, but doing some quick and dirty arithmetic, the savings come out to $150\/year on the LED bulbs, which cost about $280, so payback period is a little under two years on the bulbs, but actually quite a bit shorter when you deduct the cost of new bulbs, which I would estimate puts the payback at just over a year.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**5\\. Groceries:** We've been shopping at Superstore for quite a while and the savings have been pretty solid. On the whole, It's been about 25% cheaper than when we shopped at co-op or safeway. We're going to hit up No Frills tonight, as I hear it's even better. My fiance has been making my lunches, chicken thighs and potatoes for a while now and that saves us about $12\/day from me not buying lunch. Additionally, I no longer buy coffee, which is a $4\/day savings. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Savings: We probably spent about $500\/mth on groceries, so now we're about $400\/mth, so $100\/mth savings, $1,200\/year. On the lunches and coffees, that's $2,350\/year saved on lunches and $940\/year saved on coffees, so the three of these combined amount to $4,500 in savings per year. I think we can get the grocery bill even lower at No Frills, so we'll see if we can't do even better!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**6\\. Cancelled Netflix, dropbox, amazon prime, switched to cheaper internet provider, cancelled Rdio, got rid of my fancy visa card, switched from mach 3 razor to a simple double-edged safety razor. I was probably overpaying for the mach 3s as I didn't previously buy them in considerable bulk or anything** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**getting some static on the netflix and amazon prime cancellations, I think this is largely attributable to the divergence in services\/selection in Canada vs. the U.S. the value proposition just isn't as good up here, from my perspective, but as always, YMMV**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Savings: $108\/yr netflix, $132\/yr dropbox, $79\/yr amazon prime, $300\/yr cheaper internet (Techsavvy), $120\/yr Rdio, $120\/yr Visa fee, $200\/yr. total: $1,060.* On the visa (quoting from my response to moezilla below), I had the RBC Visa Infinite card and an additional card for my fiance. I did some reading and found that the Scotiabank Visa Infinite Momentum card was the best value for us, with 4% cash back on gas and groceries , 2% on pharmacy purchases and recurring bills and 1% on other eligible purchases. We were able to get them to waive the initial fee and my plan when the next fee comes up is to call them and see if they would waive the fee if we transfer some funds and open an account with Scotiabank, as currently I don't have one with them (which should give me a bit of leverage). We put everything on the visa and pay for it the same month. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**7\\. Heat Loss:** As you can tell, by this point, we're running out of ways to increase efficiencies, so I have to get creative. I ordered a Seek thermal camera attachment for my smartphone off of ebay for ~$200. When it arrives I'm going to analyze all of our windows and doors to see where we are losing heat to the elements and then we will use some cheap solutions to improve insulation, without having to spring for a professional to re-seal them. People are sometimes critical of \"band-aid\" solutions, but logically speaking sometimes a band-aid solution is the best solution as it is BOTH cheap and effective. To get some extra mileage out of the thermal camera, I plan to go door to door in my neighborhood and offer to do a quick thermal scan of windows and doors for my neighbors for a flat $20 charge. Once I've exhausted all of those options, I will list the used camera back on ebay and should easily be able to recoup the cost, provided I keep it in good condition. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Savings: Well, it's tough to say on this one, but the heat escapes from my house EXTREMELY quickly, like 1 degree every 30 minutes, so I expect the savings to be meaningful. Any extra cash I can generate from offering thermal scans to my neighbors is a nice bonus! Let's say conservatively that I save $15\/mth in heating from my thermal and resealing efforts, for $180\/year.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Total Savings:$8,000!! Again, I used many conservative estimates above, so I suspect the real savings would be a fair margin higher. The other nice thing is there has been no REAL sacrifice to quality of life here.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Future goals:** Riding a bike to work. I'm going to see if I can get a free bike off of Freecycle.org and use that to get to work. Right now I use car2go, which is cheap, but it ain't free! We could potentially save $8\/day there, which would be another $1900\/yr. We're going to take a look at cheaper insurance options for the car and house (incl. higher deductibles), but I'm pretty sure we're about as cheap as possible, but still worth checking out. Looking at maxing out our RRSP contributions (similar to a 401k for those of you south of the border) to deffer our taxes. We are refinancing our mortgage again in a couple of months, so we're looking at a nice, low floating rate option, hopefully somewhere in 2.0% territory, if we can find it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's about it! Let me know if you can think of anything else that might help!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nedit: formatting","24":"[H] $75 Amazon.com gift card [W] $70 paypal","25":"They have a deal going on for a $10 Amazon GC to the referrer and the person signing up. Since a lot of us use Mint, this might be a good alternative.","26":"Hey guys,\n\nMy company sells on Ebay and Amazon and I have come across a couple companies moving 1,000+ orders a day on Ebay by using Amazon as a Drop Shipper.  To find these sellers go to Ebay and search \"Cards Against Humanity\" and look for sellers priced between 27-30.  You will notice ALL of their items are top sellers on Amazon. You will also notice they carry 15K - 20K feedback each month which equals about 40K orders.\n\nI used [Salecalc.com](https:\/\/salecalc.com\/) to run profit numbers.  You can see those numbers [here](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/W6coH)\n\nI took all the settings on Ebay and made sure to calculate the lowest possible fee. This includes assuming their Paypal is at 1.9% + .30 per transaction which is the 100,000+ a month rate.  This also assumes they are a top rated seller, have an anchor store, and are paying no listing fee.  The profit calculated on this item is -0.37 based off the 25.00 price Amazon sells this item for.  Almost ALL of the items by these sellers show a profit at break even or negative.  Since they are obviously not losing money, I have a couple ways they could be making this work.\n\n* Credit Cards -  They are taking the orders from Ebay and putting them on Credit cards that give 2% back when ordering on Amazon.  That would be 0.50 on a 25.00 item which makes this item profitable (0.13).\n\n* Affiliate Links -  This is against the Amazon ToS but so is using your Prime membership for drop shipping and they seem to get away with that.  If they take an order placed on Ebay and push that information to an affiliate site they own, they are getting 8.5% back or 2.12 for a 25.00 item.  That would take this item to 1.75 profit per order.\n\nSay these sellers are getting away with breaking the Amazon ToS, how are they possibly placing 1,000+ orders a day with 1.75 profit per order?  If 50 customers order the same widget on Ebay with different addresses, how are those orders placed on Amazon?  There is no way to import large qtys of address information in to Amazon.  Are they paying someone in India 0.25 per order?  This would convert to around 7.00 an hour which is not bad money.  Even if that is the case, I am surprised Amazon would not ban these accounts for breaking the ToS.  There are a ton of other issues that would also be involved with this process like uploading tracking back to Ebay, dealing with customer service, changing pricing, monitoring inventory, etc.  \n\nI just wanted to post this to see if anyone else has some insight into this method of selling.  Maybe I am missing something and these sellers are not breaking the Amazon ToS?  2 sellers that I know of are moving about 800K and 600K a month in product using this method.","27":"[H] $10 Amazon (two codes) [W] $10 Paypal","28":"&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon Gift Cards | Quantity\n------------|--------\n$10 | 1\n$20 | 0\n$25 | 1\n$50 | 0\n**Total** | **$35**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPayment Method | Rate\n------------|--------\nVenmo | 90%\nGoogle Wallet | 90%\nPaypal | 90%\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TRADING TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS**\n\n**1) Anyone trading via Venmo *MUST* provide a generic purpose for payments.**\n\n**2) Anyone trading via Google Wallet or Paypal *CANNOT* provide a purpose for payment that is related to Amazon, gift cards, gift codes, sales, rates, ratios, reddit, reddit usernames, or otherwise.**\n\nThe above is due to the freezing and suspension of payment accounts (see [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/giftcardexchange\/comments\/2tfiy3\/psa_venmopaypalgoogle_walletpayment_merchant\/)).

Chime is basically a prepaid debit card that gives you INSTANT cash back for using their card at participating vendors.\n\nFor the whole month of January if you sign up for Chime and deposit $50 they will give you $10 instantly. Many people claimed the offer and got the $10 then immediately cashed out their card back to their bank account, and there is plenty of proof that it works just fine, but instead of doing that i have been continuing to use Chime because i was interested in how it works after being disappointed with sites like befrugal and topcashback that hardly credited for me. Chime is unique because you are INSTANTLY credited your cash back to your CARD at the register. The offers are clear and concise and are either spend X amount of dollars at a certain store to earn X back (usually spend $30 get $5 at restaurants or department stores) or they are \"store credit offers\" for electronic stores like Radio Shack and Best Buy, hobby shops, fast food restaurants, Starbucks, mostly day to day small purchases, etc. The store credit offers have **no minimum purchase requirement** and can be used to get essentially **free** stuff at these stores if you are savvy enough. Here is a list of items I have purchased in the last 2 months since signing up for Chime:\n\n \"Free $5 Amazon Store Credit\"\n=\nI purchased an Amazon Gift Card and deposited it into my giftcard balance. I received $5 cash back onto my card instantly and had $5 Amazon balance at no cost :)\n\n\"Free $5 Radio Shack Store Credit\n=\nI purchased an aux cable for my car stereo that cost $4.25. Note: you  are **NOT** credited with \"extra\" for purchasing an item that costs less than the offer states. My item cost $4.25 so I received $4.25 cash back. Cost to me: $0\n\n\"Free $5 Verizon Store Credit\"\n=\nI purchased some screen protectors for my android phone that cost $3.29. Received my cash back instantly so it was free (shipping was too.)\n\n\"Free $5 AT&amp;T Store Credit\n=\nI paid for $5 worth of my phone bill before it was due with my chime card and received cash back instantly.\n\nFree $3 Starbucks Store Credit\n=\nBought a cake pop. It was free.

I am really in to programming these sheets and especially love google sheets as it lets me access my info from the phone while on the road. \n\nA little far from my capabilities right now though, and something that I would really love, is an auto updating spreadsheet with all of my inventory on it from each website. I would have one for ebay, one for Amazon, and one for FBA. As I list inventory, change prices, etc, the sheet would scrape the page for this data. \n\nI know that I can do this one by one for every listing and just paste a link in one cell and have the rest of the cells pull the info. Is there a way though that I can just paste the link to my inventory page of amazon and it can pull ALL the titles and ALL the information from everything? Before I look into this more or see if someone can do it on fiverr, I thought I'd ask you all. \n\nThanks","100":"Traditional colleges leave people with HUGE debt, take advantage of people for profit, provide little to no help in getting people jobs, and cannot keep up with the new and fast changing possibilities that are out there right now. Online education websites have done a ton to validate the idea that a person can get real training on their schedule that they can use to enhance their life and career. But I believe that places like Udemy, iTunes U, Amazon, U of Phoenix have both provided viable answers AND have opened up holes in the market that can be filled. \n\n Long story short(ened), I think that it carries more worth if a person is taught how to start a business by someone that is actually in the business. I realize the idea is not revolutionary, but what site really puts great education and helping people first? I am building a site that can only succeed by doing putting others first. \n  \n  So how's this: a freelance photographer who has built a wonderful life and loves to blog and talk to other people about everything photography creates a course that specifically how that person would get a photography business off the ground and puts it out there. Everyone who went through the course have a real person that they could go back to and follow and grow their business with. \n\nThat process can be used in countless businesses. And no two people's experiences are the same. \n\nThere are a few more particulars to what my site will call for, but I want to speak to anyone ready to teach and share their experiences, and grow their audiences. \n\nComment, Pm me, or ask any questions you have and let us get this started!","101":"Hi all,\n\nSo I'm a 20 year old in Illinois and in 2013 I worked retail. In 2014 I did something different and decided to flip items online and sell them on Ebay\/Amazon.\n\nI just finished tallying up everything and am ready to pay my taxes for income earned this year, which works out to $27,000 after business expenses.\n\nMy family had recently taken care of my tax info (thanks Mom) until now, where I'm on my own with this.\n\nI have absolutely zero idea where to start. I would very much appreciate if someone could tell me in very layman terms at least the direction I have to go in, as I need to get this done so I can apply for the FAFSA and go back to school.\n\nSome points of concern I have:\n\n* I may have had to give this payment by January 15th? Is this true and if it is, how will I pay penalties on something like this if there are any?\n* Any good resources for calculating how much I owe them? [This is correct for calculating, is it not?](http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1040es.pdf)\n* I have logged my expenses and deducted all of them except for miles traveled. I traveled 832 miles. I am not registered as an LLC or a sole proprietorship, can I still deduct this as a business expense from my income (I believe it's $.52\/mile)?\n* I don't know where to make payments.\n* I don't know tax forms. Period. Is there a tax form specifically I should use? Is that for actually paying them or for reporting? Can I pay the IRS with things like TurboTax and other software? Do payment sites include where I need to pay the state AND the fed or do I need to make them seperately?\n* I received a W-2 from my old retailer. Apparently I also received $300 in early Jan 2014. Is this going to create a headache in reporting down the line?\n\nAs you can see, I'm *very* confused. I'll probably take my mom out for dinner after dealing with this big headache for me for these past few years.

A few of you asked me to circle back and share the stats from the book, so here I am :)\n\n**Quick Background**\n\nI wrote the book as a test to see what went into self-publishing on Amazon and to promote my [video course](http:\/\/www.googleadwordsforbeginners.com). My course is also hosted on Udemy, but I wanted to create my own site so that I didn't have to split revenue with Udemy. The book would act as a content marketing piece that pointed directly to the course and would provide readers more in-depth learning resources if they needed it.\n\n**The Launch**\n\nPrior to launching I read [this post](http:\/\/okdork.com\/2014\/05\/07\/10-marketing-tactics-to-net-41000-downloads-on-amazon\/) and decided to make the book free for the first 5 days after publishing. Once the promo started I posted the book link on \/r\/Entrepreneur, \/r\/FreeEBOOKS, and \/r\/eFreebies. Outside of Reddit I posted on several free eBook Facebook groups.\n\nAdditionally, I used [ConvertKit](http:\/\/convertkit.com) to build a pre-launch list. I messaged my students in Udemy and told them to add their email address if they'd like free access when it was launched. I also linked to the landing page in social posts. All in all, I got 736 people signed up to the pre-launch list which was much higher than I anticipated. \n\nHere's the [landing page](https:\/\/app.convertkit.com\/landing_pages\/931\/) I used. \n\n**The Results**\n\nThere were almost 5,000 downloads during the first 5 days when the book was free. Because of the way Amazon reports, it's impossible to tell what sources drove the most downloads. Anecodatly, I think \/r\/Entrepreneur and the email list sent the most based on response. \n\nPost-freebie the book has 52 paid downloads and 36 Kindle Unlimited downloads. Here's a [screenshot](https:\/\/www.evernote.com\/shard\/s193\/sh\/7d779b18-6582-401a-aac8-86f2508c21bc\/c344a44ecce6baac2bec8db13d04717c\/deep\/0\/Amazon-Kindle-Direct-Publishing--Get-royalty-reports-for-your-KDP-books.png) of the data from KDP\n\nThe book resulted in 3 sales of my course and traffic seems to picking up from it. It is still available for free [on Gumroad](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/weZhs) if you are interested.\n\n***My question to you***\n\nWhere do you think I should go next? I never had the intention of making a lot of money from the book, but think Kindle may be hindering sales potential. Books like [Discover Meteor](https:\/\/www.discovermeteor.com) and Nathan Berry's [Designing Web Application](http:\/\/nathanbarry.com\/webapps\/) have done very well and sell their books for much higher than they could on Amazon. Also, they use their video courses as upsell packages on the sale page. \n\nDo you think I should keep the book where it is, or create a page that has multiple packages available for purchase?\n\nIf you have any questions that I didn't cover about creating or marketing the book, just comment below. I happy to answer. ","119":"Hello! I'm interested in trading PayPal for Amazon.

In the course of next few years I think many homes and offices will be interconnected because of IoT.\n\n(1: http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/1\/5\/7497537\/samsung-iot-internet-of-things-vision-presented-at-ces-2015-keynote\n\n2: http:\/\/creativestrategies.com\/iot-bigger-think\/ )\n\nBut here's the problem:\n1: There's no unified standard for all these IoT devices to communicate to each other. Ex: Apple Watch talks only to iOS devices, Android wear talks only to Android devices, Homekit devices talk only to iOS etc.\n\n2: IoT devices pump a lot of data out but there isn't a way to contextualize, make sense out of the data and use them. Ex: Apple Watch may able to tell you that your heart beats per minute is 210 but that doesn't make sense to a average user's the average user doesn't know what's he\/she is supposed understand by the heart beat data.\n\n3: IoT are pain to manage and are dumb. Every IoT out there had an app for iOS and Android which makes them difficult to manage. The key driving force for IoT is integration but the modular structures of the app make it difficult to manage these devices. Ex: When the user comes to back to home on a cold night, to the change the temperature of his nest thermostat he had unlock the phone, search for the app, open the app and then set the temperature manually. It's lot of effort. A person wants to unlock the car's door and start his car, once again he has to go through the task of manually operating his car from his phone. (I'm talking about the latest IoT enabled self driving cars.)\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/lukew\/status\/552136109275111424\/photo\/1\n\nSo here's how my product solves the problem. For the sake of convenience I'll name my smartphone product as 'PX':\n1: Have an compatible inbuilt software stack that can interact with other IoT devices. In case of proprietary devices like Apple Watch, build an iOS app that can pull the data from Apple Watch and Health app and send it to PX.\n\n2: Collect data from IoT and contextualize the data. Ex: The data from Apple Watch informs PX that the users heart bpm is 210. The data from the user's smart tv informs that the user is watching a horror movie on the tv. So PX contextualizes the data and understands that the rise of the heart bpm of the user is due to watching horror movie. Then it alerts the user regarding the status of his\/her heart and recommend a different movie, or recommend to play a calm music that will clam down the user.\n\n3: Automatically manage IoT devices based on situation. Ex: When the user comes to back to home on a cold night, PX will automatically detect the user's body temperature, the room temperature and will tell the nest thermostat to increase the temperature without any user intervention. PX will put the nest controls on the lock screen if the user wants to adjust the settings of nest. In the another example when the user walks towards his car, PX will detect the distance between the car and the user, ice the user reaches near the car's door PX will tell the car to unlock the door and once the user is inside the car, PX will ask where does the user want to go. The user will select a destination then PX will tell the car where to go and then the car will start on it's own and drive itself to the destination.\n\nSo this is just the basic examples of how my product will work and what problem does it solve. Regarding the apps and ecosystem, PX can run Android apps and I'm planning to bundle Amazon app store. PX can also dual boot to Stock Android, Android ROMs like CyanogenMod and other ROMs, Windows 10, FireFox OS and other OS's provided they are compatible with the hardware. \n\nHTC HD2 is a old device that has been able to run multiple OS due to developer support and has been pretty popular with developers. Since my smartphone supports dual booting by default I'm confident that many developers will like it which will result to developers writing apps for my platform. \nhttp:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-5-0-lollipop-gets-ported-htc-hd2-578626\/\n\nSo this is my idea. What do you think about it ? Is it a plausible idea with potential or is it doomed to fail. Please provide constructive analysis, I know for some of you my post might sound noob and amateurish, please pardon me for that but I want to know whether my idea has a potential. In case anyone is wondering whether I'll be able to execute this project, I'd like you to know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to bring this project to reality provided it has the potential. I've been working on the design prototypes from many weeks and I've been working for 14+ hours everyday. Usually 10-11 AM to night 2-3 AM.\n\nSo please let me know your views.\n\nEdit ! Edit !: I don't plan to do all this stuff by my own. I intend to hire engineers. Regarding the OS I intend to fork Android and customize it for this project.","157":"Amazon introduces WorkMail; the email service focuses on replacing the back-end technology while keeping the same front-end experience that people are familiar with.

I am currently working with 3 different programs.  The one that I do not see mentioned on here very much is AppTrailers (available on IOS and Android).  \n\n\nIf you are not familiar, basically you click and watch ads or videos (ranging from 5 sec - 30 sec average, but some can go 2 min+) and earn points.  Points can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards (smallest increment in $1.00 with instant delivery), Paypal, etc.  You can also upload a certain number of videos a day, and you receive points for people \"liking\" your uploads.\n\nI think it would be great to start a beermoney group for AppTrailers users so we can all continuously like each others videos each day.  This could potentially give a nice boost to daily earnings.  I generally earn around $1.5 a day with AppTrailers, so it is not the best source, but it is mindless and extremely easy to click while I am at work or doing other things.  Anyway, if you are interested, lets try to work something out that is mutually beneficial for all users of this sub.\n\nIf interested, my AppTrailers username is: @a_ham_sandwich  (The @ is only used for their search feature)","159":"After combing through the comments on the **[Best books for investors](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/investing\/comments\/2tef7m\/best_books_for_investors_long_read\/)** post a few days ago, I\u2019ve finally got together the top investing books - brought to you by the redditors of our investing  subreddit. \n\nIn the initial post on must-read investing books, the response was overwhelming.

Signing up through my referral will give me 20% of everything you earn through offers and 10% of everything you earn through Crowdflower Tasks, PeanutLabs, RadiumOne, AdscendMedia. I don't find this site useful to redeem Amazon GCs, it's just that I can spend the coins to get in-game stuff or a complete game itself. \n\nIf you play Team Fortress 2 like I do then this site is a good place to exchange coins for scrap metal or any available item, really. I recently redeemed scrap metal for 22 tremor coins to check it out if it's legit and they have a bot which you add as a friend and trade and you get the metal. easy as that. Check out the FAQ to see how you can exchange tf2 items for tremor coins.\n\nThis next part is from the forums and FAQ\n\n*Everyone can earn coins by just logging in. You will get some coins bonus once per day for logging in. The bonus coins will depend on the age of your account and will be as follows.*\n\n* Between 0-30 days old : 1 coin\n* Between 31-90 days old account : 2 coins\n* Between 91-180 days old account : 3 coins\n* Between 180-365 days old account : 4 coins\n* More than 365 days old account : 5 coins\n\n*So just log in daily and collect your coins !*\n\n*Also don't forget to collect the First Competed Offer Of The Day Daily Bonus. Completing the first offer of the day will now grant you a bonus of 5 Tremor Coins. Bonus can be collected once a day everyday.*\n\n*Achievements are targets set in games that you need to achieve. All achievements have descriptions which will tell you what is required to get the achievement.* \n\n*Achivements give you Points and Tremor Coins. Points determine your Level and ranking on the site. Tremor Coins can be used to redeem in-game items, enter Giveaways and to redeem items from the Tremor Rewards page. You can see your Points and Coins details if you click on the links next to Points and Coins in your profile.*\n \nStuff you can redeem. I'll just show you an [Imgur](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BOsoyQS.png?1). That is just a few of the games you can redeem. Also you can just get Steam GCs or Amazon GCs if you don't want a game on there.\n\nAnother really good thing about this site is that it has a very active forum. So you can communicate with others about the site and gaming in general.\n\n--\n\n**Featurepoints (US,UK,EU,India)** [Website](http:\/\/featurepoints.com\/web\/) \n\nREF - Use the code B5SW68 while signing up to get a headstart of 50 points. That is my code, and when you sign up, you will get a code of your own.\n\n[NON-REF](http:\/\/featurepoints.com\/web\/)\n\nOk I know everyone already knows about this by now, but for those who don't, read on!\n\nFeaturepoints is an app for android (and iphone and ipad) where you earn points for downloading apps. I use this while travelling and got nothing to do except stuff on my phone. Download an app and try it out, you get points. Can redeem points for Amazon GC (3000 points for $5), Steam GCs (12000 points for $20), Google Play cards, Starbucks Cards, Paypal and more. There is also an iPad mini Retina 16GB wifi for 258000 points if you want to get one ;). You get 35-50 points for downloading apps. There are also apps where you get 250 points so its flexible like that. The best part about this app is the referall program. If you refer a friend, you get half the points he\/she earns, forever. It's good to get a few people going on this and earn lots of points quickly. Take note that majority of the GCs are available only in the US. Worldwide just has the paypal option. \n\n--\nwhoa that was long. \n\nAt first it was only swagbucks and bing rewards. GlobalTestMarket is only during weekends or holidays. Featurepoints and Tremor games are what I use in addition to swagbucks and bing rewards now.\n\n If anyone knows any more websites where you can redeem steam wallet cards, please let me know I will add them here! :D \n\nThankyou. Hope this was an informative post.\n\nEDIT: By the way, if any of you are interested in playing stuff like TF2, BL2, L4D2, Terraria etc. shoot me a pm.

As an example he gave some exception, a 7 year old who decided a field of activity for his future and kept it.

Cole\n\n\n\nThe most recent tech boom has been compared to a modern day gold rush. Similarly to the Gold Rush of 1849 there will be winners and losers. In the gold rush it wasn\u2019t the gold miners that got rich, but it was the people who sold the shovels. These people understood that their best chance to strike it rich was not to get lucky and find a rare commodity, but to build a sustainable business. One that made money.\n\nEvery week I get pitched on ideas from friends, colleagues and random people. I love it. People know that I\u2019ll give them my honest opinion on their business ideas. I\u2019ve noticed three common themes in these conversations so I thought I\u2019d share them:\n\n1) Your idea is worth less than the piece of paper you wrote it down on.\n\nThe worst thing you can do as an entrepreneur is to protect your idea as if somebody\u2019s going to steal it. It\u2019s a long road from an idea to a successful company so focus on what YOU can do to build the business. Don\u2019t worry if others enter your space because having competition is a good thing. It means that you\u2019re chasing a valuable enough market that others also want a piece of the same pie. If you have zero competition, then your idea probably isn\u2019t that big of an opportunity.\n\nDon\u2019t make anybody sign a non-disclosure agreement. Most likely, you don\u2019t have any proprietary information that you need to protect. You\u2019re not the only one that has your idea. There are probably 100 people that have thought of the same idea, 20 of those people are entrepreneurial enough to research it, eight of them actually create a product, five of them go to market and one or two might survive.\n\nAt this stage the best thing you can do is share your idea and get feedback from your target market. Talk to 100 of your potential customers and see if you\u2019re solving a problem of theirs. You will find that there will be a discrepancy between your perception of their problems and the reality of their problems. This means that your idea should adapt to solve their real problems.\n\nTo prove that I\u2019m not afraid of sharing ideas, here are a few app ideas: an app that helps you find your significant other inside of a grocery store, Uber for pens at the post office (@boredelonmusk), Rinsetagram\u200a\u2014\u200aan app that shows you how to get the shower temperature perfect when using different faucets away from home, and an app that adds bass to really high pitched music that\u2019s played while you\u2019re on hold for customer service.\n\nThey\u2019re all cute ideas, but will they ever make money? Probably not. If you don\u2019t make money, then you go out of business. If you go out of business, then your cute idea isn\u2019t so cute anymore. Let me repeat this one more time for emphasis; your idea is worthless.\n\nQ. Well if an idea is worthless, then what is valuable?\n\nA. Your team, execution of your product, traction with users\/customers and revenue.\n\n\n\n2) \u201cCan you introduce me to some investors?\u201d\n\nOne of the most popular requests that I get from companies in their infancy is to introduce them to investors. Before you raise money you need to evaluate where you stand in the startup ecosystem. Don\u2019t raise money because everybody else is doing it. Raise money when you know the direction of the company so that you can step on the accelerator and grow.\n\nThere are four basic items on an investor checklist: team, product, users\/customers and revenue. Each time an investor can check an item off of their list, then their risk is significantly mitigated and your likelihood of raising capital increases. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of how your conversation might go:\n\nStep 1) You have an idea. You pitch. The investor says, \u201cCome back to me when you have a team.\u201d\n\nStep 2) You have a team. You pitch. The investor says, \u201cCome back to me when you have a product.\u201d\n\nStep 3) You have a product. You pitch. The investor says, \u201cCome back to me when you have users\/customers.\u201d\n\nStep 4) You have users\/customers. You pitch. The investor says, \u201cCome back to me when you have revenue.\u201d\n\nStep 5) You have revenue. You pitch. The investor says, \u201cHow much?\u201d Now you\u2019re having a conversation that they\u2019re interested in hearing more about.\n\nHow do I know these steps? I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve wasted a lot of time pitching at steps 1 thru 4. Unless you\u2019re the co-founder of Twitter, then you won\u2019t be able to raise any money from traditional investors at step 1 or 2. If you\u2019re very well connected or you\u2019re aiming for a really huge market, then you might be able to raise capital at step 3 or 4. If you don\u2019t fall into either of those categories (i.e. most people), then stop getting distracted and try to get to step 5 as quickly as possible. Raising money takes time. What\u2019s the opportunity cost for trying to raise money? Building your company.\n\n3) \u201cWe don\u2019t need to know how we will make money because we\u2019re going to get acquired, like Instagram.\u201d\n\nContrary to popular belief, companies take a long time to build. The media says, \u201cInstagram sold for $1B in 18 months with zero revenue!\u201d However, they don\u2019t talk about how rare of an instance that actually is. Instagram is an extreme outlier. Most successful tech companies of our generation (i.e. Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.) were not overnight successes. They were not get rich quick schemes. They actually made money.\n\nAccording to a quarterly newsletter I get from Berkery Noyes, there are between 2,000 to 2,500 mergers and acquisitions each year in the tech space. In half of those transactions I\u2019d bet the sale price is less than the amount of capital the company has raised. This means that the investors get paid back, but the founders earn nothing. I wouldn\u2019t want to be a founder of a company that was banking on being one of the 1,000 companies that actually have a meaningful exit each year without having a \u201cPlan B\u201d (i.e. a plan to make money). You shouldn\u2019t either. You have to build a company the good ol\u2019 fashioned way \u2026 by building your revenue streams (sell shovels). Making money on a rare acquisition is like finding a golden nugget.\n\nThoughts for moving forward.\n\nIf you\u2019re early in the game, then just put your head down and grind. Stop worrying about protecting your idea. Stop thinking about fundraising. Stop believing that you\u2019ll get acquired. For now, grab a shovel (or sell one), dig in and build something that people want. Try to make somebody pay for it. The worst that can happen is that you learn a lot and end up writing blog posts about why it didn\u2019t work out. As my Grandpa once told me, \u201cColombus took a chance.\u201d\n\n\n\nDo you have an idea that you\u2019d like my input on?\n\nEmail me: imzackparker@gmail.com\n\nFind out more about my work and me at: www.imzackparker.com","215":"Some key notes\n\n$5 amazon gift card jumps up to 500 from 450, but the 5x a month limit is removed.\n\n$3 amazon gift will be added and will be processed and delivered faster.\n\nYour first $25 gift card redeem of the month will only be 2200 so big savings there.\n\n\nFull notes from them\n\n&gt;Starting March 2nd, you will be able to redeem 2,200 Swag Bucks for one $25 Gift Card OF YOUR CHOICE once a month.

If anyone has flown short hauls on OW alliance in South America and have tips for navigating TAM\/LAN that would be appreciated!

I applied on 10\/28\/14 and was immediately given a \"pending\" notification after submission.  I have banked with Chase since 2007, and hold a checking\/savings account there.  My CSP has CL 13K, my Freedom has CL 15K.  I called the application status line the next few days and received the message \"Thank you for calling, you application is pending review.  You will receive a written notice in 7-10 business days\".  A few days later, I received a notification that Chase could not verify the information in my application.  I had applied using the EIN from my recently created e-commerce business (selling on Amazon and a Shopify store), and the IRS had given me the tax number a couple weeks before.   I guess this was a bit too recent to propagate into Chase's systems.  Chase requested that I submit the name of my company, verification of my tax ID number, and proof of current business physical address.  I replied with the Articles of Organization for my LLC and an IRS Form CP 575.  I also wrote about how I needed the business card to keep personal\/business expenses separate and that I wanted to grow my partnership with Chase as I developed my business.  After mailing in this information, I check periodically by calling the status line and it remained pending until 11\/21\/14.  At this time the status changed and I received an email stating that I was approved for 10K CL.  I was debating the whole month whether to call recon or not, but ended up just waiting it out and was able to get the approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n","224":"I have two Amazon GC's (2 $5) I want $9 for both or $4.20 for one.

In order of application:\n\n\n\n* US Airways Premier World MasterCard - 50K after 1st purchase and $89 AF - Instant approval 15K CL\n* Citi \/ AAdvantage Platinum Select World MasterCard - 50K after 2K spend\/3 months, $95 AF waived - Instant approval 8.5K CL\n* British Airways Visa Signature - 50K after 2K spend\/3 months, $95 AF waived - Instant approval 2K CL\n* Amex Premier Rewards Gold Card - 50K after 1K spend\/3 months, $175 AF waived - Instant Approval\n\n\n\nFor a bit of context, I am 26 working as a tech consultant and my Credit Karma showed Equifax 772 and TU 790 before applying.  The current cards I am holding are Chase Freedom since 2008, CSP since 6\/2014, and Chase Ink Plus since 11\/2014 (data point below) with 110K UR points banked.  \n\n\n\nMy intention with this AOR was to collect miles redeemable on the OneWorld alliance in order to help with an upcoming South America trip this fall.  If anyone has flown short hauls on OW alliance in South America and have tips for navigating TAM\/LAN that would be appreciated!  Target month is August 2015, potential cities are Rio, Buenos Aires, Lima, with out-of-the-way stops at Iguazu Falls, Machu Picchu, and Easter Island or Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.  I will be traveling with my SO and plan on helping her get some of these bonuses as well (esp US Air before the merger).  We would likely be flying out from DFW.\n\n\n\nOn another note, here's my experience applying for the Chase Ink Plus.  I applied on 10\/28\/14 and was immediately given a \"pending\" notification after submission.  I have banked with Chase since 2007, and hold a checking\/savings account there.  My CSP has CL 13K, my Freedom has CL 15K.  I called the application status line the next few days and received the message \"Thank you for calling, you application is pending review.  You will receive a written notice in 7-10 business days\".  A few days later, I received a notification that Chase could not verify the information in my application.  I had applied using the EIN from my recently created e-commerce business (selling on Amazon and a Shopify store), and the IRS had given me the tax number a couple weeks before.   I guess this was a bit too recent to propagate into Chase's systems.  Chase requested that I submit the name of my company, verification of my tax ID number, and proof of current business physical address.  \n\n\n\nI replied with the Articles of Organization for my LLC and an IRS Form CP 575.  I also wrote about how I needed the business card to keep personal\/business expenses separate and that I wanted to grow my partnership with Chase as I developed my business.  After mailing in this information, I check periodically by calling the status line and it remained pending until 11\/21\/14.  At this time the status changed and I received an email stating that I was approved for 10K CL.  I was debating the whole month whether to call recon or not, but ended up just waiting it out and was able to get the approval.\n","227":"[H] Microsoft $15 card [W] Paypal, Amazon","228":"First time posting here guys, and I need some advice.\n\nI recently paid off ALL credit cards that I had opened, I have an Amazon store card, LensCrafters, jcpenny, and a guitar center credit card, used it up and my now credit score is bad, around 550. Reason is, dumb teenager stuff, unnecessary spending (saw something that I wanted to have, swiped, late payments, collections, late payments again, vicious cycle) I worked a shit job and not having enough to pay every card that I used racked up interest, more debt, missing more payments, ugh!\n\nRight now, I don't work but I go to school full time.

What i'm curious is if people found it to be worth the investment to use the Fresh service over doing Instacart? I know Instacart upcharges each item a hefty amounth, and also expect you to tip the deliveryman, but I'm not really familiar with how Amazon Fresh stacks up again them. Any insight? Keep in mind that I don't have a car and honestly feel the need to have groceries delivered from time to time, so I would prefer to stray away from answers that tell me to not do either and just to suck it up (unless this literally is way more feasible).\n\nI had a few questions too if anyone with the knowledge could answer:\n\n1) When Amazon Fresh delivers, do they expect you to also tip the deliveryman?

A new report analyzed more than 1,000 breaches that involved personally identifiable information. It found that 40% of breaches stemmed from external intrusions; 29% were caused by employees; 18% stemmed from lost or stolen devices or documents; 11% were the result of social engineering. \n\n\n\n**How to Make Your Debit Card Safer**\n\n\n\nAlthough debit cards remain our most preferred payment method, their popularity continues to shrink, likely due to the fraud and risk concerns of consumers. In 2014, 43% of consumers said they preferred to buy with debit cards, compared with 49% the previous year, and an overwhelming majority in the past decade. Meanwhile, consumers preferring credit cards held steady at 35% both years and now include those 65 and older by a 2-to-1 margin. Credit cards may offer more protections beyond the risk of fraud, and there are certain scenarios where you should never use debit cards. But debit cards help you avoid debt and possible interest charges. Here are ways to make them safer. \n\n\n\n**The Need for a National Data Breach Notification Law**\n\n\n\nCurrently, 47 states have their own data breach notification laws. So if a company doing business in multiple states faces a large [breach of personal information](http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/moneybuilder\/2015\/01\/23\/this-week-in-credit-card-news-making-your-debit-card-safer-data-breaches-were-avoidable\/), that company will immediately be obligated to identify and comply with a patchwork of state laws. These laws may impose different requirements on when and under what circumstances notification is required, and on the method and the content of the notification. In some states, failure to follow these specifications can result in fines, penalties or lawsuits. The result: at a time when immediate response and remediation is critical, these organizations and their counsel must first ascertain and negotiate compliance with any and all state laws that may be applicable to that specific breach. \n\n\n\n**Amazon Abandons Digital Payments, Leaving Fight to Apple, Google**\n\n\n\nAmazon said that it is killing its mobile wallet. Amazon Wallet let consumers store gift cards and loyalty cards on their phone to use for in-store and online purchase. But unlike digital wallets from Apple and Google, Amazon\u2019s application didn\u2019t store credit or debit cards. \n\n\n\n**Supreme Court Rejects Retailers\u2019 Bid to Lower Debit Card Fees**\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court handed banks a victory when it declined to consider a challenge by retailers to Federal Reserve regulations setting fees for processing debit card transactions. The high court\u2019s action removes uncertainty for the banking industry by ending a three-year federal court battle over fees associated with tens of billions of debit card transactions annually.\n\n\n\n**Mobile Payments Quickly Changing the Transaction Industry**\n\n\n\nMobile payments are no longer just a trendy way to make a payment. They are quickly becoming the major force in the transaction industry. Mobile payment volume in the United States is projected to increase at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 172%. By 2019, mobile payments will make up nearly 15% of the total payment volume in the United States, accounting for $818 billion in transactions. Apple Pay and its early success is a significant part of this growth. But another factor is the use of mobile payments by the underbanked. Unbanked and underbanked spenders have easily adapted to mobile payments because they allow for fast transaction processing and easy financial management. \n\n\n\n**MasterCard Announces a Credit Card Even A Security Fanatic Can Love**\n\n\n\nIf there was a ever credit card that could ease your anxiety about credit card fraud, the new MasterCard (MC) \u201cHidden,\u201d coming to market later this year, would be it. Hidden is a computer masquerading as a fully functional payment card that works everywhere via swipe, tap, or online entry. The card features several layers of protection you won\u2019t find on your run-of-the-mill credit card, including a light that indicates when the card is \u201con\u201d and usable. \n\n\n\n**Apple Pay Helps Security, But it\u2019s Not Foolproof**\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of Apple Pay, mobile wallet payment systems promise to disrupt long stagnant payment card industry. But will these new services make our data and transactions safer? On paper, Apple Pay greatly improves data and transaction security, but it\u2019s not foolproof. As usual, hackers are not standing still. A researcher in Germany recently demonstrated how to replicate fingerprints with a high-quality photo of a user\u2019s fingers, which could presumably be used to gain access to anything protected by biometric data. \n\n\n\n**Is Google Set to Acquire Mobile Payments Service Softcard?**\n\n\n\nGoogle may be in talks to acquire Softcard, a mobile-payments service, in a bid to boost its Wallet and compete against Apple Pay. Softcard, formerly known as Isis, was started jointly by AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile USA in 2010. The company claims that it can be used at over 200,000 merchants, including McDonalds and Subway. Softcard allows consumers to make payments through connected debit and credit cards from American Express, Chase, Wells Fargo and others banks. Reports indicate Google recently entered exclusive discussions with Softcard by offering to buy the service for at least $50 million. \n\n\n\n**LowCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate Report**\n\n\n\nBased on the 1,000+ cards in the LowCards.com Complete Credit Card Index, the average advertised APR for credit cards is 14.41%, slightly lower than last week\u2019s average of 14.44%. Six months ago, the average was 14.49%. One year ago, the average was 14.46%.\n\n\n\nSource: http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/moneybuilder\/2015\/01\/23\/this-week-in-credit-card-news-making-your-debit-card-safer-data-breaches-were-avoidable\/\n\n\n\n","249":"So, I bought \u00a32100 of Ti Sento sterling Silver charms for \u00a3100..\n\nThe problem is, I am after a quick flip..

And I want to invite anyone else to join me or craft their own version of Frugal February.  We can all share our triumphs and failures in the comments and inspire each other. \n\n\n**My personal rules**:  to spend as little money as possible.  \n\n**Goal**: to curb some bad spending habits and make it easier to go forward with good spending habits. \n\n**Exceptions:** Utility bills will get paid like normal. Gasoline may be purchased if I manage to go through a full tank.  Though I will be traveling as little as possible.  Emergency purchases that can't be put off... if I lose my gloves or something. Anything work related that can't be avoided, printer toner or something. Though I have enough toner and paper I think. \n\n*If it weren't February, I  would incorporate rules to govern any upcoming events or even a spontaneous outing with friends.  Then I would have PLANNED a capped expense - $20 or $40 dollars. But it's February in Maine for me, I don't do winter sports and I don't see any events coming up. The challenge is to curb spontaneous spending, to which I am prone.* \n\n**Preparations:**  I have stocked up on anything I may run out of during the month which may cause me to GO into a grocery store, thus opening me up to spontaneous shopping.  Normally I have a of small stockpile of food, but I made sure i had plenty of normal consumables: raisin bran, shelf stable milk, shampoo, headache pills, cold meds in case i get sick and so forth.  I usually have 2 weeks of pet food and such, but I picked up more. generally if I can get on a monthly purchase cycle that would be great anyway. \n\nI have turned off all search notifications from ebay, or craigslist, and emptied my Want lists and wish lists from ebay and amazon. I will not be doing what I call 'drunk shopping' when I surf my way through Amazon, Ebay or Craigslist...just to see what's there. Usually i'm not drunk at all, but I'm sort of drunk on the act of shopping.  Only Freecycle and Craigslist FREE notifications are allowed. \n\nI will avoid actually GOING into stores unless I have a very good reason...today I need to buy trashbags and some more all purpose cleaner to last the month.  If i wait until I run out, it is too easy to get distracted by sale items and the 'well i would have bought that anyway' syndrome. \n\nBesides my regular job I just happen to have been handed a freelance side job that is due at the end of the month anyway, so i will be keeping my head down and my nose to the grindstone, which will be a different experience for me.  \n\n**PENALTIES** - If I fall off the wagon and buy something that really couldn't wait until the end of the month, then I will add another DAY to my month of February and so forth. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThose are my plans.\n\nI invite others to join me with their own personalized challenges for February. \n\nPlease share your ideas! \n\n","255":"I do have some questions that I would for any of you to answer.

A few months ago there was a kid here trying to do the same thing - dropshipping from Amazon - an FBA, I think. The sales tax from the vendor was cutting into his already slim margins, so he was charging his eBay customers sales tax to recoup, and...then not remitting it to the applicable states. \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAnd then there's the sales tax issue. \n\n\nWill you be buying this product from Amazon directly or FBA or a 3rd Party who does their own fulfillment (don't know the buzz word for that) located in a different state?\n\n\nBecause YOU, as the buyer, will be getting charged sales tax on each order shipped to a state where the seller (not you) has nexus - and that's different for each of those 3 types of Amazon sellers. Amazon currently charges ST in [23 states](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=4685120). \n\n\nYou can pass that cost along to your buyers by charging them sales tax on their entire eBay order. Which means then that you need to register for a sales tax certificate in the applicable states, and REMIT the sales tax collected on a quarterly basis, along with the report breaking down the sales in that state by county. Also, if your home state collects sales tax but is not on Amazon's list, you probably should add it as well.\n\n\nOr, you could just eat the sales tax cost, and make a little bit less on those orders that happen to ship to those states. \n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\neta: Of course, some of those states might not appreciate you NOT charging sales tax on your eBay sale. And I doubt your vendor (Amazon or FBA or 3rdParty) will appreciate you submitting a resale certificate.

The reality is everyone has to accept returns because of Ebay's buyer protection. Unless a buyer is an idiot and outs themselves in a message all they have to do is say it's not as described and there is essentially no way to fight it. Example: They buy a peripheral and want to return it because it wasn't compatible with their setup, they send you a message saying it's not working on their 'X' when it clearly says it's for 'Y' in the title and description. Ebay might not make you take the return, but it's still gonna cost you hours on the phone with customer service. If they're like most buyers they'll just make up something about the condition \"It has scratches etc etc\" and you have no way to prove they're lying and Ebay will side with them 100%.\n\nStating you accept returns increases buyers confidence (I know I'm suspect of a seller who states no returns because I feel like a reasonable seller would offer that and they're trying to pass off something in sub-par condition hoping their no returns is gonna cover their ass). It also adds legitimacy to your \"buyer pays return shipping\" and makes people think twice about returning something out of remorse. If you don't have a return policy you can't have a \"buyer pays return shipping\" option, and when they file a INAD you're either going to have to pay for their shipping or Paypal will refund them and you're not gonna get your item back. In fact I would venture to say not having returns and a return policy turned on increases the likelihood of a scammer trying to get a refund and your item. Plus if you're a TRS the increase search results is way, way worth it. The TRS badge is a bit like 'fulfilled by Amazon', it means people will purchase from you over someone without the badge and they will pay a premium.

These feedbacks state what they are doing but they have so many positives to top post them. \n\nYes, i'm betting they are outsourcing the data entry along with having a couple additional software to track Amazon vs Ebay price discrepancies. \n\nAmazon isn't going to ban someone bringing in a 500k + in monthly revenue. ","330":"I ask a lot of questions and some people are open but I am pretty sure these sellers are not going to give away their secrets.

Just my opinion.","350":"I agree with you that Amazon can 100% track these and that is why I am wondering why they did not ban the accounts.  I have friends in the industry that do much more volume than I do on Amazon and they have had banned accounts.  These were seller accounts doing 500-1M per month.  For me the goal would be to scale this model and I would def worry about a lawsuit or I would worry about building a business like this up to 600K per month and then having it all evaporate in 1 day.  I have seen people kicked off Amazon for much less than this and that is why I am surprised that these sellers are getting away with it.  I guess I am finding it hard to believe that this is how they are operating and I am looking for another way they make it work.  Also, the 8.5% these sellers would get for affiliate links is exactly what they would get if they are running sales through an affiliate.  Since they easily meet the sales volume, their is not any way that this number could be lower unless the category is or item is capped.","351":"I should have provided a little more detail on the Prime cancellation. I had originally purchased Prime thinking I would take advantage of the free two day shipping, some of their Amazon instant (where you can watch shows a la Netflix) and maybe the occasional one day shipping upgrade when I just HAD to have something in one day. Unfortunately, literally none of my Amazon purchases have qualified for any Prime features and when I tried to watch shows on Amazon instant I was always informed that this show was not available in my area. I think in your situation Amazon Prime makes more sense, but for me, with my purchases I was getting zero benefit and it was really starting to piss me off when all of my purchases said \"does not qualify for Amazon Prime\" haha. But I agree, this may only make sense in certain geographies, and in the US Amazon Prime may more than pay for itself, for me that simply wasn't the case. ","352":"I guess my question would then be \"How did these other sellers manage to scale?\"  This has been proven to work 40,000+ times per month for some sellers.  I agree that it could be unsustainable if an account is banned but I assume these sellers have their livelihood riding on this and would somehow have their asses covered.

I have a bad habit of forgetting to check upromise before I order anything lately. I get $ every time I order clothes or buy a Groupon. When my mom's fridge died,  I made sure we ordered our new one from a store that would give me the most money back. I've never been able to figure out how it works for gas or restaurants, but it's great for online shopping. I earned $1.52 last month,  but $56 last year.

Those lasted me for quite a few weeks (this is all a year ago, so forgive me if the details seem fuzzy.) After I decided my favorite from the sample pack, I ordered a 200 pack of that brand. Each raiser last 2 to 3 days, so for a very low price, I'm getting over a years worth of shades. they can all be bought on eBay at very low prices.

For example you like fitness and you want to focus on the yoga industry. You can create a custom yoga mat that you did a focus group study on and found that people would like a map that is a little wider and soft cushion. --- Cost for Manufacturing can be for the order .45 - $1 per mat. Order Size 250 ---- Sell for 25-30 bucks\n--- While getting your product ready build a facebook brand page and produce content around that product. Leverage the low cost of social media advertising . About .25 to .75 a click\/like - Try getting a few thousand likes. -- For a product like yoga mats Pinterest content would be golden.\nProduct is ready to go and your audience is built and ready for a launch. Now you introduce your product to the social networks you created and use $100-$200 bucks or so for aggressive short term PPC Social Media advertising.\nNext use Amazons PPC model too ( The trick though is to spend as much as you can to break even on the sale) - Reason being is because you want to rack up the reviews and quantity of sales. Your main mission is to play with Amazon Algorithm to have your product show up highest on their search for let's say yoga mats.\n-- Once your producing sales and you keep building up your order from the sales you been making and then start making other products that complement your existing product.

But I am creating an Udemy with SOUL! The problem with platforms like this or Amazon, or even book publishing, Youtube and Twitch is that they are merely platforms.

I connect people, and will incorporate different ways of being transparency to validate the content and earn trust from the potential student. I see too often how people game the system in order to fake popularity and rank higher, therefore tricking people into thinking the content is really that good.\n\nAnother plus for the content creator is that they will get create a passive income stream for themselves as well as someone who is actively selling their product (me), which will free their time because they no longer have to trade dollars for hours, and their courses will make money in their sleep.\n\nI can go on and on about this if the interest is there, but I'll end my part right there if fear of being too long winded lol :)\n\nAny more questions?\n\n ","518":"I own some FB and would never invest in Amazon.

I want to do this automatically based on the settings of the consumer\". Really? Is turning on your phone really that difficult?\n\nIt's not about the difficulty of turning on your phone, it's about automating tasks where user intervention is not required and thus saving time for users. These are small conveniences that overall end up being major conveniences. It's like all the devices working together to help users to get stuff done. I hope I'm able to convey my idea correctly to you.\n\n\n&gt;Sure, this is an ideal. I would love to have a world like this. But the amount of effort you need to put into this product is ridiculous for a single 18 year old, especially for a product that isn't even that useful.\n\nThank you. As I said I plan to hire engineers to do this and regarding value factor, it's overall convenience rather isolated use cases.\n\n\n&gt;I suggest if you do like this idea, maybe just focus on a single portion of it. You are never going to manage to make a smartphone OS that \"developers will like\". Look at Firefox OS. It's got features to help developers greatly. Does anyone use it? No. Maybe you should just do one idea. Like if you think the temperature thing is cool, then make a phone app that allows you to link your iWatch to your phone to detect what the temperature should be changed to.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. As I said it's not just isolated use case. It's about the overall convenience of getting all the IoT device work for the user. The scenarios I've mentioned in my post are just one of examples of how it works. You're probably right, it's difficult to make a smartphone OS that developers like that's why I plan to add the option of dual booting to other OS's so that users can use Android or other compatible OS's for their convenience which I hope will also lead to developers being interested in my product. Moreover there will be Android compatibility layer built in. So that users can install Android apps.\n\n\n&gt;Overall, take my words with a grain of salt. Obviously you know more about your plan than I do. But I'm highly worried that you're trying to plan out a program that is far more intensive than anything a single person could do. What you're planning is kinda like the equivalent of trying to program android on your own. (hint: android was programmed using a huge department at google, one of the top companies in the world).\n\nI don't plan to build the OS from scratch. That's very difficult. I plan to fork and customize it for self automation. Sort of like how Cyanogen, Amazon and Xiaomi has done by forking Android.\n\nThank you for taking time to read my lengthy post. It means a lot to me.

As [\u00a7109(d)](http:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/uscode\/text\/17\/109) prescribes, first sale doctrine does not apply if the possession of the copy is \"by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise without acquiring ownership of it.\"\n\n&gt;Some software and digital content publishers claim in their [end-user license agreements](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/End-user_license_agreement) (EULA) that their software or content is licensed, not sold, and thus the first sale doctrine does not apply to their works. These publishers have had some success in contracting around first sale doctrine through various [clickwrap](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clickwrap), [shrink wrap](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shrink_wrap), and other license agreements. For example, if you buy [MP3](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MP3) songs from Amazon.com, the MP3 files are merely licensed to you and hence you may not be able to resell those MP3 files. However, MP3 songs bought through [iTunes Store](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ITunes_Store) may be characterized as \"sales\" because of Apple's language in its EULA and hence they may be resell-able, if other requirements of first sale doctrine are met.\n\n&gt;Courts have struggled and taken dramatically different approaches to sort out when only a license was granted to the end user as compared to ownership. Most of these cases involved software-licensing agreements. In general, courts look beneath the surface of the agreements to conclude whether the agreements create licensing relationship or if they amount to, in substance, sales subject to first sale doctrine under \u00a7109(a). Thus, specifying that the agreement grants only a \"license\" is necessary to create the licensing relationship, but not sufficient. Other terms of the agreement should be consistent with such a licensing relationship.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Copyright](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copyright) ^| [^Doctrine](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doctrine) ^| [^Exhaustion ^doctrine](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exhaustion_doctrine) ^| [^Vernor ^v. ^Autodesk, ^Inc.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vernor_v._Autodesk,_Inc.) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](\/message\/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+co4wyhm) ^or[](#or) [^delete](\/message\/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+co4wyhm)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http:\/\/www.np.reddit.com\/r\/autowikibot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Mods](http:\/\/www.np.reddit.com\/r\/autowikibot\/comments\/1x013o\/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css\/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http:\/\/www.np.reddit.com\/r\/autowikibot\/comments\/1ux484\/ask_wikibot\/)","575":"Make sure to double check the sales rank and CCC to make sure they are actually selling on Amazon.

That being said, you can't buy Full fat Rosarita refried beans at any of the Costco's I've been to, and at $1.00 per can, you can get 38 of them for 5.99 shipping, which is the best price on those I have seen.\n\nI also really hate shopping at Costco.","592":"It's not dumb. Amazon giving out the last 4 of your credit card back to you to verify lead to a very widespread scam. There are extremely good reasons not to give personal information over the phone even if you verify your identity, especially in cases like this one where you know someone has successfully been using OP's identity","593":"Flipping books at Goodwill is gonna be tough, because there are so many people doing this that the books are heavily picked over.  \n\nAt my Goodwill, there are tons of textbooks but every single one I've looked at has been a worthless old edition.  I think any good ones are grabbed immediately by people who are hovering at the exact moment they restock the shelves.  \n\nThe only good nonfiction finds I've picked up there are religious books and some academic type texts on subjects like history, political science, and literature.  Look for things that people would use as research sources for a master's thesis or Ph.D.  \n\nIf you want to get into collectible books (especially modern first editions), these are not hard to find, as most flippers skip fiction entirely.  There's a big learning curve with this market, though, and it would be easy to waste your money on things that look like first editions but that are really book club editions, secondary printings, etc.  And don't bother with anything that's not in really good shape.  \n\nHowever, I really don't see how anyone would ever amass a large enough inventory of collectible books just from thrift stores to sell enough collectible books on a daily basis to make a living.   Most of the ones I find are only going to be $10-30 when and if they do sell.  Not a bad ROI if you only spent $1, but you'd have to be selling tons of copies daily to make a living off it.   \n\nIf I didn't enjoy it and collect books myself, I would say it was mostly a waste of time.  Plus, I have a tendency to want to keep all the really good ones for my personal collection.\n\nAlso, be aware that collectible books on Amazon is a gated category so your selling options are limited (I clicked the button to apply and was instantly rejected, probably because I'm a new seller and they want some history of book sales first).  I've been selling them on Ebay and when I get a large enough inventory will look into getting an Abe account. \n\n","594":"It's up 11% now. Pretty insane. I thought it was going to tank with the recent run up from $280 to $300 and with negative news from Alibaba I figured investors would take a bearish look at any numbers that Amazon put out. Luckily I didn't buy any puts otherwise I'd be pretty unhappy now. ","595":"Quick question on this... so you're going to send them all into Amazon, pay the charges for holding them in the warehouse, and if they don't sell then have them process them to ship to your buyers on eBay? \n\nIf so, and I don't know this is why I'm asking, what do the fees look like per item to package up multiples to send to your buyer? I was pretty disappointed with the shipping\/handling charges I paid on one item Amazon shipped for me through multi-channel fulfillment. Just something to watch on your end.","596":"Could I ask which credit card you use? I have an Amazon rewards card (and love it) but am looking for one that helps to add up travel points fairly quickly. \n\nI also need one that makes it pretty easy to use the points. I've heard stories of people wracking up a ton of points but then being hit with a ton of \"blackout dates\" that make planning their trips nearly impossible. ","597":"The point of it is that you have a $5.99 flat rate for a huge, sturdy box, and then you fill it with items that are priced retail or less (not inflated with shipping costs), especially once you consider that you most likely don't pay tax on your Amazon purchase, the $6 might be a better deal than the cost of driving your car to the store + time saved.\n\nI personally don't use it because I get all my pantry stuff from Aldi since I don't find brand names worth it usually.","598":"I mostly go for books... \n\nCURRENT textbooks are very good. I like to search Craigslist for those. Search \"books\" in whole 'for sale' section and see what shows up (I recently found a library closing down and bought about 600 books for cheap). Usually some people are trying to get rid of college textbooks. If they provide ISBN do a quick search on Amazon. They can easily sell for $100+ with low seller ranks\n\nI avoid the \"New York Times Bestseller\" books because there's millions of them out there, and usually penny books.\n\nI usually avoid older book (if antique old I'll look into them) because, if they've been reprinted, the newer copies seem to be more popular.\n\nI sell all merchant fulfilled on Amazon (I want to try FBA though) and I don't bother with anything that sells less than $3.99 (I find my books usually no more than 50 cents each). If it's got a very low rank, and a penny book, I might grab it if there isn't 50+ for sale and still list at $3.99. For example, I sold [THIS ONE](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/offer-listing\/0671666150\/ref=tmm_other_meta_binding_used_olp_sr?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=used&amp;sr=&amp;qid=) today for $3.99 even though some are listed for a penny but you'll notice the price increases quickly.\n\nI've sold a variety of books. Music books, marriage books, childrens, fiction, biographies. I mostly stand in the store for a good hour or two scanning everything. Some books you think aren't worth much, can be, [like this one that sells for $388 that I got for 15 cents](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0871892960)\n\nIt's just a grind.

I haven't looked too much into it, so have no advice on that front.\n\nWhen I was just starting out, I solely used Amazon. It was the easiest one to get a grasp on. However, as more sales rolled in and I began taking flipping more seriously, I realized how much money I was missing out on by using Amazon. In case you were unaware, Amazon has default shipping prices they allocate to sale categories. In the States it seems to cover the shipping cost of items, or if not the majority of the cost. In Canada, you're lucky if it covers half. I ship from Ontario as well, and rue the day I print a shipping label to BC if it's not able to go as letter mail. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Amazon is probably the easiest and best way to get started. Just be aware of the shipping cost differences and plan accordingly. eBay works great for ensuring you get the entire cost of you shipment paid. You will definitely lose out in having to either drop your sale price or drop your shipping cost and hide it in the sale price. Regardless, you will not make as much money as our American counterparts. \n\nKijiji can be great for local sales. Saving you on both fees and shipping cost. However, locals aren't willing to pay half as much as the folks on eBay and Amazon. Facebook groups work well too, once again, you'll have to lower you sale pricing considerably. In my area Craigslist is not popular whatsoever so it's basically useless for me. Toronto appears to have a more active community. \n\nAs for scanning apps, I use eBay's app to scan and look at completed items. Amazon is a good tool as well, but won't tell you how many have sold and for what price. \n\nMake sure you offer shipping to at least the United States on both eBay and Amazon. If using eBay, always put your pricing in USD. You'll be pleasantly surprised with the USD to CAD conversion. \n\nI buy from locals off Kijiji, Value Village &amp; liquidation stores.

As \/u\/SwellJoe mentions, a WordPress site or site powered by WP plugins wouldn't be a bad idea. Check out Noah Kegan (sp?) and his AppSumo and Sumo King stuff for helping to build everything around the site marketing related. \n\nI think the scary thing about your site would be the lack of exclusivity, going up against Amazon and others SEO wise and lack of control in terms of inventory. It's bit a like saying \"I want to open a restaurant... that only gives directions to other restaurants... you can't buy any food there, just directions to other restaurants.\" ","657":"Well, you're more than welcome to have a look over at \/r\/beermoneyuk  i did a guide for clickworker, which is by far my best earner.  Here it is \n\n[Clickworker\/UHRS](http:\/\/www.clickworker.com\/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=629851&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email) | [non-ref](http:\/\/www.clickworker.com)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nClickworker is by far the best method I\u2019ve discovered (so far) to earn money online.  I regularly make between \u00a320-\u00a350 a week for a few hours a day.  It\u2019s very similar to Amazon\u2019s MTURK (which is unfortunately U.S. only) \nClickworker is a company based out of Germany, they pay you cash to do small online tasks, such as rate if a website has adult content, verify information on individuals &amp; organizations and a massive range of others tasks.  Although there are some jobs available on the Clickworker website.  The real money is made on their UHRS project\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n*Note:  Clickworker requires that you use Internet Explorer to complete tasks from them*\n\nFirst, you need to [Sign Up] (http:\/\/www.clickworker.com\/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=629851&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email).   Once you have done this, it\u2019s time to start filling out your profile.   A few key things to remember when filling our your profile:  When they ask you for a tax number select \u201cNo, I am freelance\/commercial\u201d.  You\u2019ll need to add English as your native language for Both written and Verbal.  And don\u2019t forget to fill out your paypal address under payment details\n\nOnce your profile is completed it\u2019s time to do some assessments.  The first two assessments are:\n\n-\t**Placement Test \u2013 English**: This is a simple Grammar test with around 35 multiple choice questions.  Very simple to complete and should only take you about 10 minutes\n\n-\t**Qualify for Address**: This is a test to check your research skills.  You will be given a Company name, you need to google that company and find out their contact info.  You\u2019ll need to list the Company name, address &amp; phone number.  With this test  **READ THE GUIDELINES!!**  As it\u2019s very important you input the data exactly as they expect it.  This will take about 10-15 minutes.\n\nAfter you have completed these tests, another set of tests will be unlocked for you.  These are:\n\n\n-\t**Qualification for UHRS I**:   This is a combination of the first two tests,  you\u2019ll get about 50 multiple choice grammar questions and about 5 find the address questions.\n\n-\t**Qualification for UHRS II**:  This is simple.  You have to create the Live I.D. you will be using to access UHRS.  Just follow the instructions and sign up for the unique Live I.D. they tell you (You Should save or write this down somewhere) \u2013 Well Done!  You\u2019ve now got access to UHRS.\n\n**UHRS**\n\nUHRS or Unique Human Resources System is where the money\u2019s at.  You can login by clicking \u201cCompare Web Search Results\u201d under jobs.  Or you can log in directly at \nhttps:\/\/prod.uhrs.playmsn.com\/Judge\/Views\/Login\n\nEach Job (or HIT as Clickworker calls them) requires you to do a qualification test, this is normally the same as the actual HIT, but Clickworker knows the answers and checks to make sure you got it correct, as long as you read the guidelines and pay attention you should pass first time (normaly you get 3 chances, but this isn\u2019t always the case, and if you fail qualification you can\u2019t do that HIT) Once you have passed the qualification test, simply click \u201cStart Judging\u201d to begin working.  \n\n**Payment**\n\nPayment is made via paypal.  Your first payment is quite slow, and takes 21 days.  However after the first payment has been made you are paid weekly. \n\n[Clickworker\/UHRS](http:\/\/www.clickworker.com\/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=629851&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email) | [non-ref](http:\/\/www.clickworker.com)\n","658":"I started with ebay and Amazon. eBay listed often directed traffic to my website where people would buy so I didn\u2019t have to pay eBay fees.

Your future self will regret this decision.","676":"My tip would be to check the description on Amazon Warehouse.\n\nI often buy from Amazon Warehouse but only if it meets these two descriptions:\n\n&gt;New - If an item is being sold as \"new\" on Amazon Warehouse Deals, this means that the item has never been removed from the packaging but the packaging has superficial damage.\n\n&gt;Like New - A \"like new\"\" item sold on Amazon Warehouse Deals is in perfect condition, but due to the condition of the packaging, it does not meet Amazon.com standards for new product. For customer-returned product, it's possible that the previous customer opened and removed the product from the original packaging. If a returned item comes back in perfect physical condition and through our testing process we determine the working condition is perfect, the item may be deemed \"like new.\" Physical damage to the outer box of a factory-sealed item in our warehouse can also lead to the condition being taken from Amazon.com \"new\" to Amazon Warehouse Deals \"like new.\" \n\nNever had a problem with an item that met those two descriptions.

Even small PDA scanners are not very discreet. You're gonna be sitting in a book aisle with a laptop with Amazon open? \n\nNot really an option. Barcode scanners are not required, but by my math, will quickly pay for itself. Imagine each time you pull out your phone, scan, go through the internet, internet to Amazon, Amazon back to you, there's delay. Bare minimum with a phone, you're looking at 15 seconds per scan, if not more. \n\nHaving a scanner greatly increases what I like to call \"scans per hour\". You're working smarter and faster, basically saving time and making more money for your time. Let's say you find an extra 20 books a day because of the scanner, and each has $10 profit. It could literally pay for itself in a day(not considering time it takes to sell the books, but still)","706":"Made $10 in Amazon GC's off this.

People are terrified of him.\n\nHe might be a great CEO, but it's hard for to respect someone who treats people like garbage.","768":"Yes, it would be against Amazon's ToS.  So would using a Prime account to drop ship orders which these sellers are for sure doing.","769":"That's interesting... I had heard that anecdotally as well, but sometimes you don't know why people say things (that is, what is their motivation).  Jobs was a spectacular ass, although it's not widely known.  Gates was apparently a huge ass in meetings, too.  Although, I think age has mellowed him out a lot, and I really respect what he's doing with his foundation immensely.  I don't think people would say the same of Schultz.  From what I know, he's very widely admired and very charismatic (albeit, still quite driven).\n\nI guess the thing I admire about Bezos is that he kept telling everyone that they could dial in earnings any time they wanted, and people thought they knew Amazon's business better than Amazon did.  Also, he was quite prescient in going ahead with building out AWS.  So, he makes good decisions, I think.  That doesn't excuse treating people without dignity though.  You'll get more out of people when you treat them with respect and humility.  I liken it to growing up with a shitty parent.  My parents were awesome, but I had friends whose parents would belittle them all the time.  They all ended up hating their parents.\n\n","770":"I use Reply Manager.  It is under 50 a month.

Selling closeouts or just 1 unit of a product is time consuming.  It makes for good practice though.  Closeout items are tough since your inventory always revolves.  It sounds like you are learning and moving in the right direction.  If you are drop shipping direct from their warehouse, then you have basically no risk and low margins are standard.","772":"I've briefly looked into FBA, but am still unsure fully how it works. What did it cost you to ship that to Amazon? Do they also take a cut when I sell? Can't you pay a small amount to get things back if they're not selling?","773":"Amazon discounts your shipping costs if you ship through UPS.\n\nYes, they will take a cut when you sell. It's more for FBA items than MF, but FBA items sell faster.\n\nYes, you can pay to get things back, but Amazon's storage fees are only a few pennies a month so it's not generally worth it unless you have long-term fees coming up.","774":"Most of the time things on Amazon are really sold at a profit,  never let their low prices fool you.  Some good resources if you're thinking about the manufacturing route is www.alibaba.com, most of these guys you can contact and then negotiate prices outside of Alibaba.  It'd also be a good idea to get a liaison in China to help handle the deal for you to make sure everything is on the up and up.  \n\nIf you're serious, start a website or at least a mailing list and get preorders.  Everyone has a lot of great ideas that people don't want.  And also, don't wait for people to tell you what they want, because by the time you make it, they'll have changed their minds.  Get the $ first, THEN make the product.  You definitely wanna make sure that it'll be worth you time and effort, and also do some calculations after costs.  How much will it cost to make, ship to America, and sell while still being competitive in the market place? \n\nEdit - spelling","775":"Those three boxes weighed 5\/7\/8 lbs. Amazon's shipping through UPS was $16.50.  Pretty good pricing.\n\nThere are 34 items in those three boxes I'm selling for just over $15 each.

If it goes well, I'll look into doing it more hardcore.  These items are awkwardly shaped and weighed as well so selling them myself would be a pain in the ass making custom boxes and someone buying even two would bump the shipping to priority wiping out any shipping savings.\n\nAnyways... Rambling. I'll probably update in one of the weekly threads.\n\nEdit: fixed bad maffs.","776":"The commission is independent of whether you sell with FBA, that is the price to sell on Amazon.

My guys pack about 45 orders an hour so it is the cheapest possible way for us to pack.  Since we do daily deal sites, pricing matters a lot so we cannot raise our pricing to make up for fulfillment costs.  Pricing is also very important on Ebay and Amazon where pennies make a huge difference when it comes to sales.  \n\nWhen I started this it just kind of snowballed.  If I lost everything today and had to start over with no money, I would look at possibly launching a product and having someone fulfill it while I focus on the marketing of the product.

Not only is the pricing cheap but I really think the quality of work is better.  Anytime I have outsourced work to India, it is always done on time.  When I outsource work here in the states it takes forever and a lot of the freelancers always seem to have an excuse for not getting it done.

I think pages would work better, and then you could have a little more navigation along the bottom.\n\n+I like that the navigation bar at the top gets a little smaller when scrolling down, but seeing the background text and images behind the nav bar is distracting and takes away from the \"clean\" look you're going for.\n\n+You use the term \"We\" and \"I\" irregularly throughout the site...stick with one or the other.\n\n+The \"About\" and \"Contact\" links at the top nav bar shouldn't lead to the same page, in my opinion. If you really want to combine them, then list and link once at the top. Maybe include a \"Connect\" page with all links to social media?\n\n+Super nitpicky correction: on the description for the phone sanitizer, I think you mean that phones can't be washed with soap rather than soup ;)\n\n+I agree with other commenters that when I clicked on a product I expected to see more of your page rather than a direct link to Amazon.

Amazon survived the dot-com bubble of the late 90s because unlike the other internet companies he told investors to expect little to no return. His actual written plan for the company was to plug all available revenue into expansion and reinvestment in the company and not into shareholder service. And by god he's stuck to his guns on that. Amazon may or may not be a profitable investment, jury is still out, but no one is under any illusions at all that it's anything other then a very long term investment to see that potential pay off. Part of why investors have been willing to put up with their strategy is because it seems to be working in terms of company growth, and there aren't any smoke and mirrors about the promises, Bezos has been as upfront as its possible to be about what you should expect if you buy into Amazon.","871":"As a sub-affiliater (f.e. : Publishing House -&gt; Amazon -&gt; You), it is very difficult to get any good margin with any affiliater.

We are launching a website this year so I will see if we can generate some sales through that channel.

Our Amazon sales fluctuate between 60-160K a month so we have not had any velocity limits.  I have a friend who got limited and he just called in and they removed the limit.

It lasted for 30 days and was for selling an item as new when it did not include retail packaging.  It was pretty ridiculous since I was purchasing the items new direct from the manufacturer and chose bulk packaging to save money on shipping.  But they make the rules and it is a lot easier to abide by them instead of fighting them.","889":"Cool Site.  From a pricing perspective does it make sense for you to offer more expensive items?  I ask because there are some items on your site that are priced much higher than other listings on Amazon.  The dry erase board and dancing water speakers are an example.

We do around 1K orders a day and I am really happy with our WMS.  They still have under 400 customers so it is nice to request a feature and actually see it implemented a month later.
