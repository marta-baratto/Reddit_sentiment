Codes for the paper: Modeling Sentiment Spread in Redditâ€™s Financial Communities through Epidemiological and Deep Learning Approaches

To assign positive or negative sentiment to Reddit sumbissions and comments we used the codes in 1_step.ipynb, 2_step.ipynb, 3_step.ipynb.

In 1_step.ipynb we upload and filter data, then we perform the first classification using the zero-shot approach.

In 2_step.ipynb we do the training using labels obtained by the zero-shot approach.

In 3_step.ipynb we do the final classification using the model trained in 2_step.ipynb.
