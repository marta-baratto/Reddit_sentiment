Just a little background in my situation.  \n\nI currently have a $66 southwest credit because I booked a round trip to Panama City Beach, Florida, a while back and the price dropped for one of the flights, so I rebooked that particular flight and got a credit.  I currently have the Discover it card, Barclay Sallie Mae MasterCard and the Capital One Quicksilver Visa Signature Card.  I was thinking about buy a $200 or so southwest airlines card on Amazon with the Sallie Mae card, because it gets 5% cash back.  \n\nSo let's say I buy a round trip flight to like New Orleans and it's $400.

If you missed the first update you can see my reddit post here - http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/3098kg\/follow_along_as_i_private_label_a_product_from\/\n\nI got some awesome feedback from you all and it seems like many of you are interested in following along which is awesome!\n\nI just posted a new update on my site today so I decided it would be a good idea to update everyone here on Reddit. This update mainly discusses my overall game plan for this new business, my goals and why I have decided to keep my product private for tis case study. I also talk about why I love the Amazon FBA business model and what you can expect in the next update. \n\nI will copy most of the update from my site and post it here minus the fluff that isn't necessary. If you would like to see the full post you can do so [here](http:\/\/www.passionintopaychecks.com\/amazon-fba-case-study-part-2-the-gameplan).\n\n\n**I will NOT be Sharing my Exact Product**\n\nThis was a really tough decision to make but the kind people over at reddit helped me figure it out. From all of the people that left comments and their feedback I have decided to keep my product that I will be selling private. As many people mentioned, choosing a good product is the most important part to being successful on Amazon and if I was to share it there would be about 20 copycats pop into that niche within a month.\n\nBy keeping the product private the results from this case study will not be skewed by anyone reading this blog. Which I think is important since I want to try and prove that it is possible to be successful on Amazon without expensive courses.\n\nI will be sharing as much information about the product as possible without giving it away. I want you to know all of the details such as unit cost, shipping cost, all of the fees, weight, size, niche, price, profit margin and everything else important because that is all good information to know and learn from.\n\nI know that some of you really wanted me to share the product and use it as the example throughout the whole case study but I hope you all understand where I am coming from. I am sure that you will still be able to get some useful stuff out of this case study nonetheless.\n\n**My Budget(Roughly)**\n\nMe personally I am not too worried about sticking to a budget as I have some free capital to work with. For the sake of the case study I want to establish some sort of budget so you all know what to expect to spend when you are starting up.\n\nI would think that you would be able to get started for around $1,500-$2,000 very easily. Since I have already picked out my product and have a general idea of how much the cost will be I can say that mine is a little bit more than that. \n\nI have set a budget for myself of around $5,000 which is a good amount of money so that I can get started. One thing people don't realize is how expensive shipping is and they tend to forget to think about that cost when looking for a product. \n\nI will breakdown the costs of my product in depth in the next update but for now I just wanted to give you all a rough idea on my budget. $5k is way more than you would need if wanted to start smaller but I'm not messing around. I am going to do things right from the beginning and not short change myself.\n\n**How Long Will The Case Study Last?**\n\nGood question. The case study will last as long as I own the business. The updates for the case study will be coming out at a fairly rapid pace for the next couple of months but after I get my product up on Amazon and selling there will be less to update you all on.\n\nIf I had to guess I would say that the case study will be at least a year but with the bulk of the updates coming out within the first couple of months.\n\n**My Goals**\n\nIn short, my end goal is to be able to sell my business for a boatload of money after 1-2 years but let\u2019s break this large goal down into smaller parts.\n\n0-3 Month Goals\n\n* Get my product onto Amazon and selling\n* Have the product be profitable after all of the expenses\n* Get 25 reviews\n\n3-6 Month Goals\n\n* Have successfully completed a couple orders with my supplier\n* Get my product on the first page within its category\n* Reach $2,000 in revenue(tentative goal)\n\n6-24 Month Goals\n\n* Add a couple related products to my brand\n* Have the related products making money and profitable\n* Making at least $3,000 in profit each month\n* Sell the company for $100,000\n\nThese are really broad goals and they are tentative for now because I don\u2019t have any idea how successful or profitable my product is going to be. It could be a total flop(hoping not!) or I could completely crush it, time will tell. For now these are my goals for the business and I will be working towards them everyday.\n\n**Why Sell?**\n\nYou might be wondering why I am planning on selling the business before I even start. Well, because I don\u2019t see this new business as something that I would want to for a living. \n\nI would rather build it up as an asset then offload it to an investor or buyer and get my money because I can do a lot of things business wise with $100k. If I wanted I could start a new Amazon FBA business, which is very likely, and repeat the whole process again and again or something totally different. To sum it up, having $100,000 would open up a lot of opportunities for me and I could start a new business venture if I wanted.\n\n**Why I Love this Business Model**\n\nThe business of getting a product imported from China and branding it as your own then selling it on Amazon is a great business model and I will tell you why.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s scalable. This means that if I find some initial success on a small scale with a product then I simply do more of it, but on a larger scale. For example let\u2019s say I have good profit margins on my product from spending $10 a day on Amazon and Facebook ads. I can then scale this to $50 a day and hopefully see the same profit margin which would in turn increase the profits.\n\nThat is just one angle where it could be scaled, there are a ton of different marketing techniques that can be scaled as well.\n\nSecond, I love building assets that can be sold. Amazon FBA businesses routinely get sold for 3x their yearly profit which is a lot better than what niche sites sell for. This means that if I can make around $3,000 in profit each month, which is very doable, I could sell the business for over 100k. That is some big money for a kid my age.\n\nThe best part about building up an asset to sell is that you can reinvest all of your profits each month to keep growing the bottom line at a rapid pace.\n\nAnother reason I like this business model is because you can build up your own brand and dominate a niche. You wouldn\u2019t be able to do that anywhere else besides on Amazon.\n\nThe last reason why I love this model is because it is insanely lucrative. If you can get your product right you could easily do $10k a month in profit. That is a lot of money! I am trying to cash in on this opportunity while the competition is low and barrier to entry is low as well because both of them will only continue to rise as time goes on. \n\n**When Is the Next Update?**\n\nIn the next update for the case study I will start going over the actual details of my business and product. This will include letting you all know how I chose my product and the reasons why. It will also provide you with a good resource that you can use to find your own products to sell on Amazon.\n\nI am going to compile all of the information I have gathered across the web and boil it down into easy to follow guidelines to finding a product. This way you can follow the guidelines and be able to choose a product that will be profitable for you.\n\nI want to really dig deep into the product selection process because it is the most important factor to having success on Amazon. Since it is so important I am going to be spending a lot of time putting together an in depth update for that part of the process. That includes videos covering the whole process, cheat sheets for you to follow, and a step by step guide on how I picked my product. I really want to give you all of the information you need to pick a good product and make money.\n\nI am hoping to have the next update out within a week but it depends on when I can come home from college and make the videos. I can only make videos on my desktop computer which is at my home and I only have my laptop with me at school. I will try and come home and make the videos for you all so that I can get the next update out as soon as possible!\n\n**My Plans for a Webinar that Covers the Product Selection**\n\nI have never conducted my own webinar before but I have watched a ton of them and I know how useful they can be for everyone. That is why I want to host a webinar for you where I will try and find good products live on the webinar and walk you through each part of it. The best part is that I can interact with you all and answer\/ask any questions.\n\nI think it would be very beneficial and something that would help a lot of people. This is still in the planning stage and there is no date for this webinar as of now. You can expect more info about this in the next update. Oh, and don\u2019t worry I will not be pitching or trying to sell anything on this webinar(I know that is unheard nowadays but its true).\n\n**Come Hangout in my Facebook Group!**\n\nI thought it would be a good idea to create a place for aspiring Amazon sellers like myself to ask questions, bounce ideas off of each other, help one another out and basically provide a support system for people to go to when they are stuck.\n\nYou can join the Facebook group here \u2013 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1406311533018365\/\n\nIt is a private group but just ask to join and I will accept you right away. I am hoping we can get a decent amount of people in there. I encourage everyone join and I think it will be helpful to everyone in the group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThank you all for taking time out of your day to read the second update. The next update I will be getting into the actual process of starting this business. I will continue to post the updates here on Reddit but if you want to keep up with everything I am doing then you can visit my site [here](http:\/\/www.passionintopaychecks.com). \n\nThanks again, you guys are awesome!

Many of you may forget, but just like the place you purchased your breakfast from this morning, this is a business.  We operate it to turn a profit.  When one person gives you a price of $200 and another one of $400, there is generally several things that come into play.  The five mentioned above are the most common however there are other contributing factors.\n  \n**Location**  \n1.  If you live in an area where housing prices are high, guess what... commercial warehousing isn't any different.  So that's going to reflect the labor cost.  Labor could be $100 where you live and $80 40 minutes away.  It's all relative to the real estate.  \n2.  Location will also affect the amount of time it takes to work on a car.  I live in what's known as the \"Rust Belt\" of the United States, the NorthEast.  When it takes us 2 extra hours to perform a service because we had to heat, cut, and tap out stubborn bolts... that costs extra.  I can't tell you how many times a 2 hour job has taken 5 hours because bolts snap as you are removing them.  We had front upper control arms on a 2011 GMC Yukon take us nearly 5 hours the other day solely because the bolts were so seized we had to make them glow orange just to get them to move.  Meanwhile the same truck in California would be in and out of the shop in 2 and half hours with an experienced tech.  \n  \n**Overhead**  \nLights, Insurance, Employees... They all cost money.  A lot of it.  It's gotta get paid somehow.  \n  \n**Experience**  \nWhen a tech that has 40 years experience (and the tools that come with that experience), he doesn't get paid what the guy fresh out of tech school gets paid.  So when he is the one performing open surgery on your car, he will likely be earning most of the money you're paying for in labor.  Why is that important?  Because if he is truly a good experienced tech, the odds of you returning for any issues that stem from the original problem are so small, they are almost non-existent.  You are paying for a professional, not an amateur.  \n  \n**Quality of Parts**  \nThis is the most important one.  There is a HUGE difference in quality of parts.  The $40 part and the $80 part usually have reasons for being so large in price differentiation.  BMW anti freeze and the crap you buy at Autozone that is 'Universal' are worlds apart.  When you eat through your engine gaskets because you used the wrong coolant, you'll understand what this means.  \n  \n**Availability of Parts**  \nWhen you buy something off of Amazon for $100, 9 times out of 10 we can't buy that same part for even remotely close to that price.  Why?  Well for one, we buy from a local warehouse.  One that employs local people in surrounding areas where the real estate prices are likely similar to that of the houses and the shop you are at.  Which means they have bills to pay to.  So that $100 part that you buy from Amazon that does nothing to support the people in your surrounding area, likely costs me $150+.  Then there's this thing called business, where you need a profit to sustain your presence and facility.  So I have to charge you slightly more so I can maintain a clean facility with professional employees.   \n  \n**It's ok to not know.**  But it's not ok to walk into a place and balk at the price they likely need to perform your service.  'So and so' down the street might be working with a completely different set of circumstances.  He might own his building and only pay taxes.  He might have inexperienced tech working there.  He might buy no name parts and charge you for brand name.  He might bill you for new parts and install used parts.  He might not even have insurance.  You don't know.  So when you are quote shopping around, stop worrying about price and start worrying about finding a reliable and honest person to take your car to.  \n  \nSome shops in my area don't mind taking a minute to explain to people what is going on and why.  However when the price shoppers walk in the door armed with their forum knowledge... you generally disrespect the good shops and bring your work to the butchers who work for half price.  Till you need help because the butchers ruined your car and now you want me to have pity on you and cut you a break.  Build a relationship with your local shop and it'll save you more money than price shopping ever could.  \n  \nI've read reddit for years and recently started posting, but I've run an auto repair business for 8 years and have over 20 years of industry experience.

Today the REI member program is little more than a very savvy customer loyalty program, like Amazon Prime.  The products are marked up higher than online to make up the dividend cost. ","122":"I don't really have any assets for them to buy at this point. I'm in the early stages of building a brand in an unrelated product category, and have just begun the process of setting up my own sales channel (my own website).\n\nI do have extensive knowledge on how to market and sell successfully on sales channels like eBay and Amazon, which is where the major source of my revenue at this point.\n\nWhat would I offer them to buy?","123":"Craigslist.  If there's a big \"moving day\" in your city, the month prior to that would be the best time to look.  For example, ~70% of apartments in Boston are on a Sept. 1 lease cycle, so the greatest amount of Craigslist stuff is available in August.  This is obviously for the stuff you can wait on (end tables, desk, etc.) and don't need immediately.\n\nFor things you need immediately, check Craigslist, and if you don't find anything right away, IKEA is awesome and astoundingly cheap sometimes.  You can get a mattress from Amazon as well for under $200.  ","124":"The information I know they could probably find out on their own. I don't really have any assets for them to buy... I just know how to execute selling on sales channels like eBay and Amazon very successfully.","125":"Just FBA it. At worst, you've spent .25 cents and whatever it costs to ship it.

I feel like doing it poorly and getting okay results is easy, but doing it correctly and getting very good results requires a lot of trial and error and research. All of which I have already done.\n\nThe problem is that the barrier to entry is very low on Amazon and if they are happy with getting okay results they can sell the same products and crush me with their competitive pricing.\n\nAm I right to be concerned about revealing my primary source of revenue (for now) to them?","129":"Shipwire, eFulfillment Center, Fulfillrite are all 3rd party solutions. The trick is figuring out which one is suitable for you. Your average monthly fee will be anywhere from $40-$75 depending on who you go with, how much palette space you take, and the pick and pack fees. \n\nFor solutions with a lower monthly fee, you will generally pay more in per unit pick and pack. So it will be useful to have a certain level of volume you are confident that can be sustained before going to a 3rd party solution. \n\nIf you also move in too early and have too much inventory sitting there, you could get charged long-term storage fees as their main business is to move product, not store your inventory. Amazon FBA also has this policy around the 6-month mark I believe.\n\nAll fulfillment centers generally have a salesperson that can give you information on quotes and just collect a few to get a better idea. Good luck!","130":"This, got one almost like that about three years ago and have had to change the toner once. It cost $20.

A $40 bottle has lasted me 2 years so far, and is about 3\/4 full still. \n\nI spray around the foundation of my house every 3-4 months. It's been far more effective against ants, plus all the spiders and other critters we used to have around the garden, but still way cheaper than most other options. \n\nI suppose if ants are your only problem and you have a lot of patience, Borax works. For me at least, getting rid of ants, spiders and other bugs immediately was worth spending a little more on. It's still far cheaper than most other options.","132":"Yes I would.

I'm not asking for money at all actually.  Just some stuff needed to finish my project.  It's a car that will eventually be passed down to my son.  I've just been stopped of course.  I would like to get it done so I can enjoy and my son can as he gets older taking him for rides and car shows and all that wonderful daddy stuff.  \n\nThe link is to my wish list on Amazon of some stuff I need to finish doing everything to the car.  Not a link to my PayPal asking for money I do believe people can view and buy similar to a registry.  But I've never done something like this before as well so needless to say thank you for the help","135":"Before we get into your questions, make sure you are not paying the credit card accounts way too early. Wait until you receive a statement notice email or snail mail envelope.  Otherwise, the credit bureaus wouldn't see activity even though it may seem to you that you're paying them off ahead of time. So, yes, definitely wait a few months to open a subsequent card. Applying for too many at any given time will get you denied and also bring down your credit score. It is good to maintain a handful of cards to increase your credit utilization ratio which eventually brings a positive to your overall FICO score. The key is to use these cards regularly, say a debit every 6-12 months if you no longer have use for them (no cash back rewards, etc.). They will be marked dormant if you don't.\n\nI believe the Amazon card is under Chase. It's a pretty good entry level to mid range card I would think. In the meantime, do your parents have good FICOs? Are they financially responsible? If so, they can add your name to their existing credit card accounts and their activity would also reflect in your credit history. Only do so if you are certain of their good to excellent scores and financial habits. This would be the easiest route to get a +700 score in less than a year.","136":"Yeah, I'm not paying it off until the statement comes in. I did read and learn at least that much around the time I got it (although everything else is still confusing). \n \nIs \"a few months\" 3 months? 6 months? 9 months?\n\nWould it harm me right now to get the card from Amazon? I was planning on ordering some things from them this week, so I actually have a use for the $50 right now. \n\nMy parent's filed for bankruptcy at some point and we're not close, so I wouldn't trust them to be responsible\/help me out. ","137":"Ask. Check their policy. You only have to do it once so you just have to get it all planned out and then you're done. Generally the only bill that almost always cannot be paid with a cc is rent, but other bills (school loans, for instance) will charge you to do it. There are also intermediate services you can use to pay with a cc and then pay those bills ie, bluebird, Amazon payments, PayPal credit card.","138":"I just order Levis and a t-shirt from Amazon. Sometimes I get daring and order a different shade of blue.","139":"I bought a pair of shoes there for kayaking and maybe wore them five times over three years. The glue gave out on the soles and they were out of the warranty range. They took them back anyway. \n\nCustomer. For. Life.\n\nGood service must be rewarded. Yeah, I paid about 15% too much for my kayak, but I got the exact one for my needs based on their knowledge, and I got a 10% kickback. So by paying effectively 5% over Amazon I get awesome service and some peace of mind about being able to return it of it isn't a good fit for me.","140":"This is too messy and kind of a slow process. If you want something safe, fast acting and durable protection for a few weeks, you need to spray D-limonene. It is just citrus oil and it is the only thing I have found to instantly stop an ant invasion. \n\n[ Here is an Amazon Link ] ( http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blubonic-Industries%C2%AE-d-Limonene-Limonene-Terpenes\/dp\/B009SSGW48\/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427708497&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=d-limonene )","141":"You may not need a different car; narrow car seats like Diono can fit 3 kids in a lot of things. We have 6yr\/3yr\/7mo old kids in a Kia Soul (which is a *tiny* vehicle). It was *way* cheaper to spend $400 on car seats than $20k on a minivan. And the Soul gets fantastic gas mileage, to boot.\n\nYour cable TV can be cut. Get a pair of bunny ears if you want TV (it's all digital now, no snow, looks like cable). A Chromecast ($30), Fire TV stick ($40) or Roku Stick ($50) gets you Netflix, Youtube, and a bunch of other stuff if you can't give up TV.\n\nYour internet and cell phone bills can probably be reduced to less than half their current costs; T-Mobile has a popular $30\/mo plan, and there are prepaid options (like Cricket) that run $35\/mo. These are usually bring-your-own-phone, but there are plenty of inexpensive phones if you don't own your current ones; many great Android and Windows phones can be had for under $100 unlocked. You can also try purchasing used phones on Craigslist or whatnot. You can probably reduce your cable + internet from $140 to the $50ish range, and your monthly phone from $140 to the $60-70ish range. That would get you an extra $160\/month (that's like getting a 5% raise!).\n\nSince you're homeowners, consider getting an energy efficiency evaluation done on your house. Your power company may offer these for free or for a very small fee. Many times, some simple and cheap changes (replacing weather stripping on doors, solar film or screens on windows) can put a substantial dent in your energy usage. We live in Arizona, where AC bills can be brutal during the summer. We installed solar screens on the windows that get sun (which cost about $800) and our power bill dropped about 25% (the screens paid for themselves in less than a year!) If you're both out of the house during the day, consider getting a programmable thermostat; you can save a lot of money by not heating or cooling an unoccupied house. Turn your hot water heater's temperature down - rule of thumb is that every 10 degrees you turn it down will save you 5% on your bill. Replace your air filters regularly; they're cheap, and dirty filters make your AC work harder (which will be a large chunk of your energy bill in the hot parts of the year).\n\nIf you're paying for Netflix, consider dropping it, and pay for a year of Amazon Prime instead. This gets you streaming video to replace Netflix, but it also gets you access to Amazon Mom, which is Amazon's subscription service. You'll get discounted prices on items which you have delivered on a regular schedule - we use it for diapers, wipes, coffee, and other non-perishables we need to restock regularly, and the savings do add up. This may not make financial sense if you aren't already paying for Netflix ($107.88\/year), but if you are, Prime is $99\/year, which gets you streaming video + streaming music + discounts on subscription items + free shipping.\n\nWRT groceries, if you get really aggressive about it, you can get a lot of food for not too much money. Buy only fruits and vegetables which are in season. Buy generic brands over name brands. Learn to compute *all* of your purchases in terms of cost per unit (and then buy the lowest cost-per-unit items). Use coupons. One thing that may really help is to set a fixed weekly grocery budget (rather than just spending what's left over), and then shop to fit within that. We do this by withdrawing the cash for that week's groceries, and then only spending cash - when it's gone, it's gone, but it made us far more cognizant of what we were spending. This will require you to do meal research and to spend time learning when and where things are on sale, but when my wife and I started doing that, our grocery spending dropped by 65%! It's really easy to overspend on groceries if you're not being really careful about what you buy, from where, and when.\n\nAs far as paying down debt goes, your best bet is to pay off the highest-interest items first, even if the total amounts are smaller than your other loans. This may seem obvious, but it's worth saying anyhow. Every dollar you can put down on debt is a dollar you aren't paying interest on that month. As you knock out each source of debt, the rate at which your other debt is paid off will accelerate, since you can then put that money towards your remaining debt.\n\nAs others have said, get rid of a vehicle. Lower monthly debt obligation + lower car insurance is a lot of money back in your pocket on a monthly basis. Consider getting car insurance with a higher deductible; this is risky in that if you're in an accident that makes the car undrivable, it may be harder to get it repaired, but you might consider doing something like taking the difference between your current premium and your lower premium and putting that into a \"cover the deductible\" account for the first few months. After that, the savings go towards your other needs. Check your car air filters and tire pressure; keeping on top of those will improve gas mileage, and help stretch that gas budget.\n\nGoodwill and garage sales can net you *all kinds* of clothing, housewares, furniture, toys, and tools for fractions of their retail prices. It takes some work to get the good stuff, but you don't need to be paying retail for most nonconsumables.","142":"There is no point is getting a secured credit card if he already has an unsecured one. Also there is nothing wrong with credit cards that are not affiliated with a bank. I have three cards from credit card companies, including the Amazon card OP is interested in, and all are fine. Also carrying a balance, as you suggested to OP further down, is a bad idea. Please don't give bad advice to people on this sub.","143":"Yea this great advice. One thing that sticks out is the comment about a store. If you have an Amazon store the fees are cheaper? Can you explain a little further","144":"When you scan an item on the Amazon Seller App click on where it says Gross proceeds. It will take you to the fee calculator with a tab for FBA and MF and they both have places for you to enter item and shipping cost. On Amazon you don't charge for shipping it's free from the warehouses or a set disbursement on MF that may or may not actually cover your shipping costs.\n\nFBA allows you to charge a bit more both because the customer doesn't pay for shipping and because they're willing to pay more for an item guaranteed to ship from Amazon quickly. Often times this can balance out the higher fees. But the reason most flippers like it more is that they can send in large boxes of items and practically forget about them instead of storing and individually shipping all of their items.","145":"It could hurt short term, but would help out in the long run. Only if you got declined would it be more of a hit but store cards are usually easier to get with higher APR.\n\n\nI would say it's best to get a card you will use or will benefit from. Otherwise if you get into rewards cards you will end up with a credit card you never use. Not a problem but can be a hassle to keep up with.\n\n\nIf you are talking about the Chase Amazon card, there are much better cards out there in terms of rewards. I would say hold out for a better card latter.\n\nThe Amazon prime store card has benefits of you shop Amazon with 5% cash back and an option for 0% APR financing for purchases above $120 or something.\n\nThe 5% is about the best you can get for Amazon shopping. But this is also not a physical card, they send you a number and a paper card. So this can only be used on Amazon.\n\nIf you use Amazon a lot then it's not a bad deal. There are other options to get this benefit though and make it more beneficial if you check out \/r\/churning, but as others said you are still a bit away from getting started there.\n\n","146":"Do you shop on Amazon? Yes? Get it. Especially now that they give 'cash back' via a statement credit if you're a prime member. ","147":"And that brings me actually to my next question. Are there any good applications you can use that cross references Ebay\/Amazon? Right now i've been doing google searches on my phone or searching for sold\/completed items on ebay using the Ebay app.","148":"Without paying every month or so for software, the Ebay and Amazon Seller apps are the best you'll get. Just starting out, they should work well enough. ","149":"A) You already owed those taxes before, you just weren't paying them apparently. \n\nB) The price difference between Amazon + taxes and in store is still usually worth the cost of prime.","150":"Just throw it all into gift cards (either Amazon or divide it up amongst other stores) to give yourself a longer time to decide.

","157":"Learn how to change your engine air filter (filters the air inside your engine) and your cabin air filter (filters the air that circulates inside your car).

The air filter is under the hood, and the cabin air filter should be easily accessible behind the glove compartment on most models. \n\nMost mechanics will always suggest changing both of these every time you come in for an oil change because they'll charge about $40-50 each for parts and labor, which is a massive markup. But you only need to change each one about once a year, and the filters are only like $12 on Amazon. \n\nLast time I got an oil change they pulled out my cabin air filter (that I had just changed a month ago) and said \"hey man, look how dirty this is, it's all dark\". I replied \"uhh, it's not dirty, I just changed it.

It looks like you need a category. A category that will allow you to brand products for every method of distribution that you already have setup. \n\nThe benefits of specializing in one type of product are tenfold. You'd only have to deal with a small number of factories in China, verses the countless ones you're dealing with now. You can buy\/manufacturer lines that fit every avenue. eBay buyers can have the non-branded cheap stuff. Daily Deals can have a branded version of the cheap stuff. Amazon can get a better quality brand. And you continue to grow so your brand(s) all stay the similar category but equally grow. \n\nFrom the buying\/manufacturing perspective, you'll get the absolute best pricing on all products because you're using the same factories for your overall purchase volume.\n\nThis strategy allows you to continue selling on all the same markets you are currently using, but precisely fine tuning your products for each. It allows you to still be positioned across multiple channels, but also give you the necessary clearance for growth. If eBay fails in the future, take those SKUs to dollar stores.

First edition can mean a book is more valuable but it doesn't even always mean it's what a collector would consider a first edition (most publishers put first edition as long as they don't change the formatting of the book but a collector will only consider the first printing of the first edition a true first edition).\n\nThere are way too many nuances to books to explain everything in this thread but if you private message me some pictures or more information I can give you an idea of what you have.","175":"The whole point of going to school is to be exposed to things you wouldn't have learned\/pursued on your own.

They'll charge around $400 for the part, and $75 for labor. You can get the part from denso on Amazon for $100, and to change it is just getting underneath your car and unscrewing it with a special wrench, which you can get at harbor freight for $8. You can try cheaper O2 sensors, but denso makes them for manufacturers so I'd suggest sticking to that brand. Has no issues on a Acura and honda with that brand even though both shops said that the replacement O2 sensor had to be OEM or you would have issues.\n\n**Edit: Ignore this unless you want to learn how to do this!** \n\nThe most labor intensive part is jacking up your car, and unclipping the o2 sensor from my experience. I'll give you a rundown.\n\nFirst thing I'd suggest is to go to autozone and figure out which o2 sensor it is. They will give you the error code for your car and you can look it up to see which one it is. There are two, one inside the engine bay (I believe) and the other near your exhaust. Then look up videos or download the manual for your car to see where it is. If it is in the engine block or something, it may be easier to just pay for it (but purchase your own part! you can save money this way if they allow it- verify with the mechanic).\nThat being said, both of mine were extremely easy. First thing I did was look up a video, saw where it was - near the exhaust underneath my car. Looked up videos on how to jack up your car. Use jack stands! I got a jack and jack stands a year back for $60. After that, I ordered the replacement part by the brand Denso (they tend to make the parts for the manufacturers) on amazon. \n\nLast I went to harbor freight and purchased a breaker bar (9.99) and a o2 sensor socket (7.99). I jacked up my car, unscrewed the old one, was careful in removing the cable plugged into the sensor (have goggles if you are under the car to keep shit out of your eyes), good lighting lets you see how to unclip it- don't pull the cable that goes into your car, you don't want to damage it. It took 15 minutes to figure out how to unclip the O2 sensor, it wasn't complicated just dirty and hard to see and I was being careful. After that, apply the include grease to the threads of the new sensor, screw it in with the socket, and then clip it in. Lower your car and you are done!\n\no2 sensor socket link:http:\/\/www.harborfreight.com\/78-in-oxygen-sensor-socket-69022.html -if this one doesn't fit snug buy the kit! Never use a socket that doesn't fit snug. I bought the kit and single socket, returned the kit after I saw that the single socket fit perfectly!\n\no2 sensor socket kit: http:\/\/www.harborfreight.com\/oxygen-sensor-and-diesel-injection-socket-set-99850.html\n\nEdit 2: \nTips:\n* I don't want anyone to mess up their cars, so if it feels difficult to remove, don't strip your threads. Look at ways to remove them without stripping threads or talk to a mechanic. \n\n* You can cut the wire right after the old O2 sensor to make it easier to remove with a regular socket wrench, and use the special socket only for installation (makes it easier). At this point, you pretty much committed to doing the work though.","180":"My 2012 Titan didn't come with one. Ordered it on Amazon, fixed.

Just an example.","222":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

It just takes some forethought and prep.  \n\nTell you what.  Sit down and write out your family's meals for the last week.  Now, look around your kitchen and write down the meals for the next few days. Look at the flyers for the local stores.  See what's on sale.  Knowing what's in the kitchen, plan a few more meals.\n\nI'm actually guessing that much of your grocery bill is household goods.  There is no reason to be buying laundry detergent or shampoo or toothpaste at full price.  Hit the sales and use coupons.  \n\nSimilarly, staples like peanut butter that last freaking forever?  Buy on sale, and in bulk and with coupons. Cereal?  On sale, coupons or store brands.  \n\nThe key is to plan. Don't just go shopping.  Shop with a plan.\n\nRight now, you can pick up ham for really good prices, and the same goes for passover foods.  Stock up now and you'll be in matzo ball soup until Rosh Hashanah.\n\nSimilarly, if you join a CSA for your organic veg this summer, you need to plan to use it all (or freeze or can) and not waste it.  You can join a CSA for $700 for 20 weeks in Seattle (I'm at $550 for 26 weeks here in MD) which is $35\/week for a full share that is good for a family.  If you make it an adventure (and I love to cook) it's an interesting way to get your veg and force you to plan.  But you have to stick with it and don't waste.\n\nPlanning is the key.  Put a little effort in and I bet you can easily whack 25% off of that grocery budget.\n\nNow, the utilities line item is hard to gauge without further breakdown (electric, gas, phones, water).  You can call out the power company for an energy audit.  Some of that might be cell phones.  Chances are things can be reduced there somewhere.  \n\nTarget\/Amazon is also hard to gauge without knowing what it is in real categories, but it seems high.\n\nSo, you've made a start!  Time to put some detail in there!","224":"I come from a HCOL area as well (SF Bay Area - Silicon Valley). I think your $1300\/month for groceries is huge. Are your children young or teenagers? For my household (it's my husband, my toddler, and myself) and we spend on average $500-600\/month on groceries. It's a mix of Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and farmers' market. We eat healthy (very minimal to no processed foods) but don't buy everything organic. Planning your meals for the week will really help versus coming up with meals on the spot (therefore having to buy more ingredients, etc).  \n  \nFor pet, since you lost your pet last year, maybe give yourselves some time before you get another one. It'll help with readjusting and also alleviate some cost for the short-term.  \n  \nTarget + Amazon - are those discretionary spending or are there essentials purchased from there?  \n  \nPrivate school: I think you can definitely afford the private school if you cut in other areas.  ","225":"I have updated the post to indicate that groceries is not just food. This was something I didn't think about when I made the post. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nPet, not planning to replace the pet actually\nTarget is anything. This is all generated from credit cards etc so its very coarse. One of the problems that has been pointed out to me. It could be groceries potentially :) Amazon is likely discretionary for the most part.","226":"My reading comprehension may be lacking, but does your wife work? I am assuming no since you pay for medical insurance through your self employment. If that is the case, I may have a solution that I haven't seen brought up. \n\nMy wife works but is a teacher, so for the summers when she is off she may as well be a stay at home mom. Here is what I have found through observation (being the frugal CPA who obsesses over our home budget as if it is the financial projection model for my work). She spends between 30% - 50% more during the summer months. And it is directly related to her free time. I am staring directly at your \"Target\/Amazon\" category. Those are the two places my wife has to be mindful of. People forget how much money working saves you from spending. You can't buy those new pair of shoes off of Amazon if you are busy working all day. So one helping solution could be getting your wife to volunteer at your child's school or get involved with the community in some other way.\n\nMaybe your wife works or has an infant at home, but just wanted to suggest. If she does work though, then you are probably better off getting on her insurance, no?\n\nP.s. - I live in a medium cost of living area and my wife has a budget of $700 to use at Target a month. This covers the groceries (me+wife+toddler) and diapers. ","227":"&gt; Also learn how to change your own windshield wipers. This is another once a year or so requirement. Ask someone at an auto parts store what size blades your car needs, or plug your model Into Amazon and it should tell you which blades fit. 5 minutes, tops.\n\nBetter yet Autozone and Advanced will change these for you.  ","228":"Still needs some work. Your budgets should be *what* you are spending on.\n\nAmazon and Target are *where* you spend your money. \"My Kids\" is *who* spends it.\n\nIf you buy a pair of gym shorts for your kid it could fit under almost every category you have a budget for -- and that's not helpful.\n\nAt some point the *who* might be important (if you think one person in your family is spending too much), but it should be a subcategory. For example, if you have a Clothing budget you could further break it down by You, Wife, Child1, Child2.","229":"I just looked at your budget categories. The categories are kind of shit, Amazon is not a budget category, Amazon it is a company you spend money at. Budget Categories should be line items that support the lifestyle you deem to manage. \n\nWhy did each Amazon transaction happen? What purpose was it serving? Hobby? Baby food? Pet flea treatment? New Vacuum? [Hobby, Grocery, Pets, Household Goods]\n\n\n\n","230":"Things like Amazon and Target are not really good budget categories either imo. Can't tell if you're buying groceries there, or clothing, or home improvement goods or entertainment, etc. ","231":"I just did that.  Haynes on Amazon.  Toyota just said i needed about 350 worth of work.  I added up the cost of parts...  about 65$..  yeah, I'll do it myself guys.  ","232":"Sorry, didn't get that the debt was paid. Then yes, it's a question of waiting and building good history of payments... A CC would help, and I still don't know about the Amazon card!\n\nAbout the envelope: sorry, I didn't get that you were literally having envelopes. Duh for me I guess!\n\nA suggestion: suppose your budget is $100. Keep that in your account, and just have an envelope labeled \"online\" with a blank piece of paper in it. Write down all your online purchases, and when you reach $100, consider the envelope empty. Do not look at your account and think \"uhuu still have xxx\", because you don't. \n\nAgain, YNAB is good for an \"envelope method\" that's not literally envelopes. You'll treat all purchases from CCs and the like as \"money gone\", since you'll register the transaction and the money will be gone from your budget (you look at the budget, not at your accounts). You should [check it out](https:\/\/www.youneedabudget.com\/), it has a free trial and is free for students. I don't really budget, but if I did it would be with YNAB.\n\nGood luck with everything! If you learn how to save and budget now, it'll be super easy to save even more and kill those loans when your income increases.","233":"Thanks for the recommendations!

Few details:\n\nIt's NOT a credit card. It's a line of credit. \n\nIt's through Synchrony which has some unsavory reviews. \n\nPurchases take a long time to show up which increase debris of accidentally being hit with interest. \n\nYou will be able to use your card immediately, but you won't be able to pay your bill until the paperwork arrives in the mail (took me about a week to get mine). Just a word of caution there. ","247":"I've personally never had any issues with Amazon Store CC from Synchrony (formerly GE Capital) I enjoy their financing options and never paid any interest.","248":"If you plan to sell in the US market, one of your only options may be looking at Amazon FBA.  I think you could hit on a niche product and actually source it from China and have it sent direct to Amazon warehouses in the US.  When you ask about the \"best items\" that depends what you are trying to do.  I would recommend finding a niche and honing in on it so you can own it.  An example of one I have seen work before is fruit infuser water bottles.  Cost out of China should be under 2.50 fob and they can be sold up to 20.00.  If you start small, stay focused.  I can't provide a ton of info on shipping except to tell you it will be cheaper to ship from China direct to the US instead of shipping from China to UK to US.  of course if you want to sell in the EU, you can do the same thing for a bit cheaper.","249":"To add to what I said earlier, the best places to start out for me was overstock companies.  Like Ollie's and Gabriel Brothers.  \n\nThese companies pay by the pallet for \"slightly imperfect\" clothing and anything else they can buy.  Most times, when a store closes, they buy the remaining stock and sell it out of their stores.  They dont bother with looking up what most of it retails for elsewhere.  They sell it so that they can make a profit.\n\nOllie's, for instance, has a huge book section.  In five minutes, I found five of the same book on wines.  Ollie's wanted $15 each.  Amazon had a rank below 100K and a FBA price of $46.  After fees and the initial purchase, I would have made $17+ per book.\n\nSince then, 30 of them have sold.  I wish I had them, but with Ollie's its take what they have and no restock.\n\nThis is good practice and gets you ready to find something with repeating restock.","250":"Please slap me if I ever spend more than $750 per month at Amazon.","251":"Buy stuff cheap.  Sell on eBay or Craigslist or Fulfillment By Amazon.","252":"Yes, I remember us speaking a couple months ago.  What you say about our personalities could be 100% correct.  I tend to be all over the place and a bit riskier than most I have met.  Sometimes it pays off and sometimes it leads to mistakes on my end.  My manager started about 6 weeks ago.  I brought her in from Amazon where she was making about 125K a year.  I offered her around 65K and she accepted.  She is a career woman  who has made money most of her life (she is late 40s) and wanted something that would be a challenge.  She has a background in management, warehousing, and fulfillment.  I am happy with her service but I still have tons of work on my plate.  Since this is the case, we are looking to bring in a US buyer (anyone here with buying exp feel free to apply:)) and an intern to manage some office duties.  One issue I have is our margins are so low, that I need to be careful hiring employees in.\n\nI agree with what you say about not being cheap but that is kind of the path I chose and now I am working on reworking it.  I currently have a manager at 65K a year and everyone else at 10-12 an hour.  I am looking to hire in a buyer that will be in the 35-45K a year range plus incentives.  Up until I hired a manager, EVERYTHING went through me.  Buying, sales, listing, relationships with deal sites and vendors.  Those are the things I am trying to get off my plate.\n\nI am 100% not focused.  I am in emails and on calls all day.  I am also pretty inpatient so I find myself making calls to get an answer right away.  At certain times I think this is good but it is also tough to succeed when I never focus on anything for over an hour.  I try to keep focused but end up off task.  One thing that would help me is not being around other people.  I still get a couple questions from my employees but I also start convos with them when I need an answer or help with something.  I have thought about renting another small office for me to do most of my work out of that way I can stay focused.  I find that when I work on Saturdays when no one is in, I get a lot done.

The Amazon five percent card is a blanket \"category\" for the site.  Also I don't know if Sallie Mae covers used books; the terms and conditions lists the book sellers need to properly code their category to get five percent, otherwise it defaults to one percent.  It's better to have the blanket card that covers all of it.\n\nThe three percent Amazon card is pointless, but it could be a good strategy to use a more aggressive card to get points, then downgrade to Amazon to avoid the annual fee.","299":"I would highly suggest Barclay's Sallie Mae credit card. It gives 5% cash back on amazon ($750\/month max), 5% cash back on groceries and gas ($250\/month max), and 1% cash back on everything else. It's a great card if you're a heavy amazon buyer for sure, the rewards are better than the Chase Amazon card.

Fantastic to know that if there is a problem with the work not getting finished, etc, all I would need to do is call Amazon and it would be corrected. However, with Amazon taking a cut, all of the services provided are going to cost more than any other contractor, so it would depend how much that security is worth to you.  I could see it being very useful if you were trying to hire someone to work in the home of an elderly relative, etc ","304":"At the very least, avoid all companies that specialize in marketing cards to people with low credit scores because they provide the worst service and charge the most in fees, including fees for services that are free almost everywhere else,  For example, last year I received a solicitation for a card that charged extra for making payments by phone or Internet and even for increasing the credit limit, plus it was mandatory to increase the limit after 60 days.   \n\n\nFor at least the first few billing cycles, pay the bill within 24 hours of receipt, to test how fast the company is at crediting your account because some companies are slow with this, probably to help them claim that the customer was late and charge a penalty.   Fleet Bank used to take at least 8 days to credit my mailed payments, while BankOne usually took 3 days and never more than 5, despite the fact that payments for both companies went to the same post office building in Wilmington, Delaware.  Nonetheless, Fleet Bank blamed the US Postal Service for the delays.  Also be sure to pay on time even if you don't receive a bill because you're still responsible for what you owe, and it seems some card issuers are sloppy about mailing statements, maybe on purpose, again to make it easier to claim that the customer was late with payment and  to collect late fees.  \n\n\nDon't sign up for auto pay, at least not at first, because you want to retain control over how money is taken out of your bank account, and it can make it harder for you to dispute charges.    \n\n\nBefore applying for any card, maybe you should anonymously phone the card issuers and ask what minimum credit score and income they generally require for qualification because it's probably better than having any rejections on your credit record.  Also ask if you do get rejected how long you should wait before applying again.  \n\n\nTry to get any freebie sign-up offers, like the $30 discount that Amazon Visa (Chase) usually offers or the $25 off a $75 purchase for Walmart's Mastercard (Synchrony).  \n","305":"Most of these MLM's do not allow selling on Amazon\/eBay etc. It goes against their business model.

Why? Because if you buy a real estate property that doesn't follow a set of fundamental rules then it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to lose money. What are the rules that I recommend for beginner real estate investors?\n\n- Properties must be cashflow positive\/neutral. What this means is that after paying off the property taxes, insurance, snow removal, grass maintenance, property management, bookkeeping, accounting, mortgage and then accounting for vacancy and repair allowances you still at the least break even.\n- Properties must be mid\/higher end, this will avoid most \"trouble tenants\"\n- Properties must be in a desirable neighborhood (e.g. near a convenient bus route is the most important; but also near a convenience store, coffee shop and a few restaurants preferably)\n- Properties must be in or beside cities with population growth trends and job growth trends\n\nThese fundamentals are key to real estate investing success. Once you choose the right properties it's vital that you follow a set of unemotional rules for your tenants as well:\n\n- Before renting to any tenant perform both a financial &amp; criminal background check. Set your own rules but we don't ever accept a tenant that doesn't have decent credit and\/or a criminal background. We use these guys: https:\/\/www.tenantverification.com\/\n- Prior to giving access to the unit photos are taken and shown to the tenant, tenant initials each photo and signs agreement that this is the condition they received the unit in and that they are responsible for damages\n- All tenants sign a key deal, identifying the # of keys given and that if they lose a key they will be charged $x for replacing the locks and new keys\n- All units are equipped with fire extinguishers and new smoke detector batteries; tenants sign forms signifying this was done and that they will maintain the battery in the smoke detector\n- Rents not received by the 4th of each month are given a written warning (even if they say they'll pay on the 5th)\n- Rents not received by the 21st of each month are informed via registered mail that you are starting the eviction process (even if they say they'll pay on the 22nd)\n- Quarterly inspections are performed; regularly and no matter what\n- Complaints are handled expeditiously and with police intervention with a police report if required (note: this happens very rarely; take it seriously when it does)\n- Repairs are done expeditiously and professionally if it impacts the tenants (toilet issues, water leak, frozen pipes, etc.). This is vital both for maintaining your tenants respect and for enforcing evictions should the need arise.\n\nThe reason for these is that you are setting the tone with your tenants that you are a serious landlord and that you care about them. Over the last 4 years I've acquired dozens of units and I've only had two problems to date, there is a reason for this and it's because of an unemotional systematic approach to real estate investing.  \n\nBy leveraging other people's money (the banks) you gain appreciation on the value of the full asset when only investing a fraction of the money (e.g. $45,000 down to buy a $300,000 building which will appreciate at a pace of 3-5% per year ). Also while your real estate appreciates your tenants are paying down your mortgage at a rate of 3-6% per year depending upon the mortgage terms. The cherry on top is that you'll reap the rewards of earning positive cashflow each and every month which you can save up for unexpected expenses outside of your repair and vacancy contingency budgets. Oh and finally you also gain tax benefits in the form of being able to depreciate your investment real estate to offset capital gains (talk to your accountant). These four benefits have helped me systematically ROI each of my investments at a rate of 25-45% per year.\n\nHope this helps, best of luck!","319":"Is there a way to see how recently an item has been selling on Amazon?","320":"I spent around $500 for the FBA merchandise , my profit margin is around 55 % ,I still have a decent inventory left with Amazon, but I'm working right now in my next shipment, not all of my sales are FBA , I decided to keep the books(textbooks) and collectable board games as MF , my profit margin is really much higher with these two categories.","321":"I use Amazon's S&amp;S for cat food and a couple other items I buy regularly.

If you're getting 5% back on Amazon purchases, you'd only need to spend $4000 to get $200 back. On top of that, if you stick by the churning rule of a hard pull being worth $200, you have to factor in the $40 statement credit with this card, so that brings the spend down to $3200.\n\nAlso, it's easy to get caught up in our world and think of everything through a churners eyes, but the truth is not all churning methods are well suited for everyone. If someone runs a small business or is in the game of Amazon flipping, you'll burn through that $750 monthly cap instantly. \n\nIs this a good card for churners? No, not really.

Also overseas has holidays right around Valentine's Day and Christmas that cause even further shipping delays around your critical sales timeframes (add up to 14 days to shipping timeframes for some dropshippers).\n- Before you use a dropshipper, order some products from them to verify the quality of their products and ensure their shipping timeframes are reasonable.\n- Start slow with dropshippers, you don't want to get 50 orders in and find out you need a new supplier because of performance issues.\n- If possible consider having a bulk of items that sell in high quantity shipped to someone who can fulfill orders quickly (I strongly recommend Amazon FBA; of course there's a cost there but it's worth the improved customer service).\n- Use 3rd parties to find good wholesalers\/dropshippers. I've used Salehoo (http:\/\/www.salehoo.com\/) a number of times successfully\n- Choose a business that is niche. Riches are in the niches and you'll sell a lot more if you cater to a very targeted audience and become a subject matter expert in that specialized area.\n\nThis is tip of the iceberg of what I can think of off the top of my head.

I would also suggest looking at the Wells Fargo Cash Back Platinum Visa. \n\nYou get 5% cash back on all Grocery, Gas, &amp;amp;amp; Drug Store purchases for the first 6 months. There's no annual fee, and no cap to the amount of cash back you can earn. And not that it should matter for a Churner, but perhaps worth mentioning it also includes 15 months 0% APR. Most grocery stores I go to have the Amazon Gift Cards that can be loaded with any specific amount up to $500, so it's very easy to figure out exactly how much your Amazon bill will be and then go get a GC for that exact amount. The random number being rung up also helps keep WF from being suspicious of whole number purchases on the card. \n\nSo while it may be 5% back for only the first 6 months, it beats every other card out there during those 6 months. Your only limit to the amount of cash back you can earn is your Credit Limit, but even then, you can just pay off the balance every so often and go again. \n\nUse it for 6 months, and then switch to another card. Who knows what else will come out in half a years time. You could also try to apply for the Visa Signature version after the 6 months runs out, since you've built a relationship with WF, and get another 6 months of the same exact thing. That's potentially a whole year of unlimited 5% cash back. \n\nAlso worth noting that Target purchases (aka Redbird loads) code as Grocery Store purchases in my area, but YMMV on that, so it's worth checking out the Visa Merchant Code website to verify.

I would also love an app that crosslists between Ebay and Amazon. (I know I can do this FBA through AZ but I want more control over my inventory so if I want to pull the item to give as a gift or sell locally through CL, FB, OU, or any other site, I can.)","342":"Had a question about boxes when sending to Amazon FBA. Can I use any box? Like my kids diaper boxes for instance? We buy the big diaper boxes from target and I'd love to reuse them. ","343":"Who do you pay your utilities through? Your bank may be a good place to start because if you pay your utilities they (may) count as a history of credit already (increasing the likelihood of approval and a better limit). If you are starting really truly fresh then you may have to go with a prepaid\/builder card and your local credit union may be a great help for that cause they tend to be kinder (or again, your regular bank if you have one).\n\nWhat I really wanted to add though since I just was looking at Amazon yesterday was some less than great reviews about Amazon's new (?) switch to a different bank.\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Credit-Cards\/b?node=1266766011\n\nI do not know if that would deter you or not. If you have any questions lemme know!","344":"Thank you, I will look into that.  Any ideas on a good domain? The BlogSpot is farmingpharmd but that doesn't really convey my business idea.  I will definitely look into Amazon, I use it all the time so that would make sense for me.\n\nUPDATE: Arkansas residents are not eligible for Amazon affiliate status... due to archaic states laws (I'm assuming that last part)","345":"You don't need a subscription to a scanning app. Amazon Seller is free and it works great.\n\nAs for starting FBA, you can do that any time you want. No need to wait for a milestone.","346":"I use the Amazon Seller app along with the Ebay app on my phone.","347":"Amazon card (at least the one I have) was Visa branded and issued through Chase Bank.\n\nMacy's cards also show on your credit report and are quite easy to get.\n\nIn both cases, you'll end up with a low limit, $200-500, but it's a good start to building credit. Avoid carrying a balance, the interest will be high.\n\nAs far as a \"real\" card, Discover IT cards are relatively easy to get, although after 6-12 months of having an Amazon\/Macy's with responsible use, you'd probably qualify for a normal Discover card or similar.","348":"I sure can!\n\nWe have a deal with them. Every Wednesday we're sent an inventory list of items in the auctions warehouse. The price we pay for items is the average price they're selling the items for on their auctions website. We were selling on Amazon and Ebay. We had things listed on our website but nothing sold on there... No traffic :(\n\nIn the end we had 57 orders through Amazon. The orders were from November 7 to December 8 not to bad. We had about 3 orders on Ebay.\n\nTotal profit? About $300. If those orders were through our website, we would have made an additional $700 if we were listing with the same prices. I hate fees.\n\nThe process was kind of a nightmare as well. When we received an order, we had to email our account manager, he had to open up a private listing. Next step was to open our address book, and manually enter our customer's info. Then we \"bid\" on the item with the customer's shipping info. After that was done we emailed the manager back and had him close the listings and ship them off.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot better ways to do it, but that was our first run at that. We may look at doing that again in the future, but for now, we're busy working on our control board repair business.\n\nThis would definitely be worth it if we could get lots of traffic to a website with these products.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","349":"Buying it with amazon.prime then reselling it on Amazon is a no-no","350":"I have seen some deals from Amazon but it's difficult to tell the quality of the grill.","351":"There is a lot more going into it than buying stuff and just magically being able to sell it. You have to market your product. Every alibaba product that isn't designed privately is absolutely flooded in the Amazon market. People have been doing this for years. Also let him know that those guys on YouTube that offer seminars, classes, etc are usually a big scam. If they truly were making the money they are making, they would not be teaching competition how to do the same thing. Doesn't make sense. If he has no experience with flipping normally, what makes him think he could take it to a commercial level? ","352":"Yeah, I did the same with iPods from Amazon, sold on eBay, way back when!  It's fun for a while but gets old real quick.","353":"All items we uploaded were already in Amazon's database. We didn't need to upload images or anything since that was done for us. All we did was set our price lower than everyone else's and it worked! \n\nI do want to mention that having the lowest price, even if it's $.01 lower than the other guy, will make a huge difference! In my opinion there isn't much of a reason to have products on there UNLESS you can price them lower than the other sellers. I say that because people will mostly buy from the lowest priced seller.\n\nAmazon doesn't distribute funds when you sell. They distribute it every two weeks or so. So you will have to fork up some capital. But how much capital is up to you. You can choose small products and work your way up!","354":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Relatively low density rolls are needed for the warehouse trade where large bundle sizes make customers feel they are getting a good deal. Grocery stores want a rollsize that doesn't take up too much space, but the rolls there have to compete with bargain brands, etc. \n\nIn some chains you'll see roll size increase and count decrease if they are getting more public transit\/walking customers versus driving.

It was around a 14 percent loss for cash and around 7 to convert it to Amazon. It will vary depending on the card you're selling. More desirable\/useful cards (Walmart, Amazon etc) get the best rates. They also generally will not buy them if they are valued less than 25 dollars. If you just want them gone now at least one site offered a wholly online and instant process for an exchange for Amazon credit, but the fee is steeper than doing it through the mail.

There's a few videos there on Amazon's page under the product photos that should explain it even better. I can attest, it cooks and works GREAT! It's also very easy to clean. When you're done cooking, you just put it on the highest setting and basically incinerate whatever is left on the grill for 15 minutes.

He had hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of inventory at stake and instead of doing basic research into the proper way to react to an issue with Amazon he just responded.\n\nJust as an example, the proper way to react to a generic copyright complaint through Amazon is admit you were at fault (to Amazon) and articulate some relatively BS way of preventing it from happening again. There may be other ways to handle it, but at the time this happened to him, this was the correct procedure if you didn't want to lose your livelihood.","374":"Its not legal advice.  Its a general \"go talk to your labor board\" advice.   Yes, the actual laws vary by state, but I find it hard to believe Amazon is going to try and enforce this thing on warehouse labor.

I ended up getting an Amazon Rewards card while I bought some textbooks. No annual fee, and it had a pretty low limit on it so my temptation to spend really didn't exist.

I'll elaborate more on it as soon as I get home.\n\nEdit - \n\nSo here's a run down on things that don't add up or I find suspicious.\n\n&gt;and finally our suppliers notified us that we had taught them how to sell used media so well that they were keeping their product that they usually sold us for themselves to sell.\n\nWhat? What kind of suppliers were these? Distributors are in the business of selling to businesses that sell to end users. The whole point of a distributor is to avoid the end users at all costs. Why would they up and change their business model out of nowhere?\n\n&gt;we are experts at detecting counterfeit\n\nBanks are experts at catching counterfeit notes. I work at a bank overseeing quite a lot of money. I catch 99% of the counterfeits, but some still get through. DVDs are probably even harder to catch.

The dude sold 169k items with minimal workers. How is he paying his customers for their items if he has no money? Sounds like he's a poor businessman.\n\n&gt;Now that I\u2019m receiving them back, guess what?  So far, the new sealed product has arrived back from 9 different warehouses.  Yep, they\u2019re sending back someone else\u2019s new sealed items to me.\n\nIt's pretty well known that Amazon shifts inventory around their warehouses. If you ship everyone to a warehouse in PA, they'll spread it across the country based on their perceived demand for said item. The items he's receiving are most likely his, but Amazon moved them around.\n\nThe biggest kicker though is this IMO. First, he says he buys items from his customers and sells them. One would assume those items are used, right? You can't comingle used items. Only new. Where is he getting these new items? I thought his business dealt with used items and not new. If it's new, then he surely must have a receipt for them somewhere to prove they are legit, unless he did \"unknowingly\" buy counterfeit items from a person and sold them. He probably though \"Oh, it's sealed.

Two Sallie Maes still give better overall returns at $6000\/yr ($300 vs. $360-75).\n\nWith a single Sallie Mae, the break-even for BCE vs BCP rises to $5,500. Two takes it to $8,500.

Small businesses or sole proprietors who use Amazon for their business could easily blow through that. Hell, I'll blow through it in some months just flipping items.

I've had an odd life, having been surrounded by minimum wage workers and the extremely wealthy for most of my life, with little contact with people in between. Of the many cultural differences, one of the most important is the relationship with the law. The minimum wage workers see any legal challenge as an existential threat; a sternly-written letter that sounds like a legal threat will often result in intense anxiety, fear, and hysteria. The wealthy, however, weigh the legal threat more even-handedly, calculating the likelihood of the opposing party pursuing the matter, its legality, etc. The poor do not and cannot think this way.\n\nThis all goes back to why Amazon and others use these non-competes. It isn't a legal agreement they plan to pursue--it is an attempt to intimidate their workers to shift the power balance in their favor. It's such a tiny, inconsequential power shift that causes intense distress with workers. This says a lot about the kind of company Amazon is.","404":"More stories about life working at Amazon please.","405":"Except he was in control the entire time.

But when I got the below email from him promoting his book, I just cringed. There must be a better way to do this. And I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas. \n\nBelow is my outline:\n\n1. A tease about the book he is working on before SXSW\n\n2. A presentation at SXSW with Q&amp;A with audience and news channels, etc covering the event.\n\n3. A once a week tease about the book via FB and Twitter - asking users to sign up to his email list for a special gift.\n\n4. March 31 - An email blast with the gift, which would be a few pages from the book? And a contest to meet up with him for dinner (just an awesome prize to get the viral world out there) And I would've done the blast on April 1 (April Fools) to have the subscribers second guess. (He just did an email blast today - March 31)\n\n5. And then a week before book launch have a list of prizes that could be won if they buy the book. All people have to do is show a copy of their receipt and their email will be included in the drawing. Run this contest for 3 weeks after book launch. (credit: Tim Ferriss book launch)\n\n6. Day before book launch announce the dinner prize winner and do something crazy like show up the person's house or work. And have a video clip about the encounter on the day before launch. Maybe even have a talk show host help out (Jimmy Kimmel)\n\n** Now I know he probably has his PR circuit for talk shows and TV.

You cannot do a \"trial run\".\n\nIt is rather disappointing to not see Profit Bandit\/SellerEngine show the fact you are required to use an Amazon PRO account at the $40 cost per month, plus you cannot sign up for that unless you have a Tax ID. \n\nMy complaint is that I simply cannot try out the scanner by dipping my toes in the water, you must jump right off the diving board regardless of your form. \n\nJust a heads up if you are considering taking the next step in reselling.  ","480":"This post was originaly posted on my blog. Read it there if you want all the [images and data](http:\/\/nicksid.com\/fyi-google-shopping-is-awesome\/).\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not using [Google Shopping](http:\/\/www.google.com\/ads\/shopping\/), you are losing money. I decided to share some adwords data from last year for a dropshipping site of mine. This site's adwords marketing is broken down into several campaigns\n\n*   One main campaign for generic keywords (Cost per sale: $16). However this campaign contains brand terms (Ex: my site name + product). So the real cost per sale is around $30 for these generic keywords (Ex: racing bike)\n*   One campaign for long tail keywords (Cost per sale: $11). (Ex:  Campagnolo Black Rear Derailleur)\n*   Display ($54 per sale!). Display ads appear on websites that show ads from Google Adsense. I never had any success with display ads. This campaign is now paused.\n*   Google Shopping ( Used to be called PLA: Product Listing Ads). As you can see Shopping ads and PLA runs at about **$6 per sale**! (Check the screencap for more details)\n\nOn this product I make about $40 in margin per sale. So google shopping is insanely good compared to the $30 cost per sale I get from generic terms.\n## Google shopping is hard\n\nThe downside is that google shopping is hard to put in place. You need to make a product feed in CSV format the pleases the Google gods. They have all kinds of rules and restrictions which are pain to implement. It took me about a week of work to get my feed right. It then took about 3 weeks for them to approve the feed. Once it went live I immediately started to get great conversion rates. I was very happy with the result.\n## Impulsive buyers make Google Shopping awesome\n\nGoogle shopping gets amazing results because it shows a picture of the product in the search result. Impulsive buyer type what they want in google and then bang they see it! They are drawn like a moth to a flame. They click it and they buy straight away. Impulsive buyers are not like you and me. They do not like to read. They do not like to analyse things. **They want it now** and they are not going to do any research. If the image fits, they buy it.These impulsive buyers are great, but there is a downside: **returns**. These not so bright people will order the wrong product at least twice as often as the other customers.  In my case it's a not a big deal, but these customers can be annoying if you pay for return shipping, . I did change my policy on returns to make these guys pay return shipping when they are 100% at fault.\n## Google Shopping will sometimes mess with you\n\nOne day last autumn I got an email from google saying my product feed was not up to their standard. They suspended my Google Shopping campaign until it was fixed. I thought my feed was 100% clean, but it seems they have some fuzzy logic going. They decided that since some of my product pictures had the word \"Rear\" or \"Front\" on them, they violated their rule. That is not what their own rules say, but you cant argue with them.The problem was that I have **20 000 unique products** on this site. About 5% of these products have some kind of text on the image. So I had to somehow (manually?) inspect and tag 20000 pictures to be able to exclude them from my feed. That is a lot of very boring work. I had other things to do and I just let them suspend this nice flow of easy money out of laziness.\n## How I fixed this issue\n\nThe first solution that came to me was to **crowdsource** this work to [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https:\/\/www.mturk.com\/mturk\/welcome). The Turk is a platform to distribute large amount of small repetitive task to real human beings. One classic example is to inspect pictures for offensive content. This task is very easy for humans, very hard for computers. Companies like Facebook do this for millions of pictures every month.I began working on my dataset to work with the Turk. Then I had a sudden realization: my american competitors had the same problem and they probably already fixed it. I went to browse on my US based competitor's website and I saw that he had a new set of product pictures without any text on them. Bingo! I scrapped the pictures and used these pictures for the Google product feed.\n## A business idea you should do\n\nThis incident gave me a business idea: make a product picture inspector [SaaS](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_as_a_service) that uses the Turk's API to churn thru a Google Product feed to find all the problem pictures. If such a service had existed, I would have used it and I would be at least a thousand dollar richer. Instead of being suspended for 30+ days, I could have fixed this issue in a day or two. I'm a small time ecommerce store. I expect that everyday a bigger site is facing the exact same problem and is probably willing to pay a lot of money for some kind of automated solution to fix the problem quickly. This is a nice market with desperate buyers. Go do this.","481":"For example, ive passed on laptops because I was afraid they were stolen.

Below is an introductory guide to saving money on groceries and other necessities with smartphone apps. You can choose to only use your favorite, but by stacking them I\u2019m often able to buy the things I need at 40-70% off. For those that offer a referral program, I don\u2019t get anything when someone signs up under me unless they actually save money while using any of these apps, so I would be extremely grateful if you used my referral links! However, for your convenience I have also included non-referral links if you don\u2019t want to help me out :\u2019( Anyway, let\u2019s get started!\nIbotta \u2013 \u201cBetter than coupons!\u201d\niOS\/Android REFERRAL[1]\niOS\/Android non-ref[2]\nWhat it does: ibotta has probably the largest selection of redeemable products, and as such is probably the easiest to get started with. Rebate categories in the app (required) range from groceries to flights. I only use it for groceries, but if you shop at stores with more expensive items, the instant rebates are higher. ($5+)\nHow to redeem:\nFind the product you\u2019d like and redeem the rebate in-app by either: learning a fact, taking a poll, or looking at a recipe (all directly from the app, ~5 seconds).\nBuy the product at any supported store.\nScan the product barcode and take a picture of your receipt.\n???\nProfit.\nOther ways to earn: Shopping online by first going through the ibotta website (to be honest though, I\u2019ve always found that ebates[3] gives much better percentages on cash back). You can also invite Facebook friends to be part of your \u201cteam.\u201d The more team members you have the easier it is to unlock bonuses, which is the last facet of earning on ibotta (signing up does not in any way put us on a team, they are for when you invite your FB friends only). Bonuses are simply things like \u201cbuy vegetables twice in a month for an extra $1\u201d or \u201cGet an extra $10 to your account when your team\u2019s total savings in a month reaches $40.\u201d\nPayout: $10 minimum.

It\u2019s a lot like ibotta, but has less rebate variety. Typically ~20-30 items at a time can be redeemed from any store. Like ibotta, deals like \u201cbuy ANY brand of milk\u201d or \u201cANY bread\u201d exist. This is why it\u2019s a great idea to stack these apps.\nHow to redeem: Buy any of the items in the rebate list. Snap a photo of the receipt.

He is a vp of a company you've probably heard of if you've ever worked in a grocery store or bakery.\n\nAnyway, I think he's having to much influence on me. He is the craziest spender I've ever seem.  He got a 3.2 million dollar bonus around last Christmas and my aunt (his wife) told me that he spent all of it   In 6 weeks.  Seriously.  He literally spent over $500k a week   He's probably made $30-40 million in his and has no savings.  He does have cool stuff:  16 or 17 cars. A high rise condo on the beach, a vacation house next to a river in the mountains, a legit home theater  with like 30 theater style aeats, a gigantic boat that stays in Florida.  \n\nHowever, he told me he will probably just work until he's too old to do is job.\n\nNow to my problem.  And I honestly think I do this because I am jealous of his lifestlye.  Anyway, I've recently purchased a watch that cost over 4 grand\na new gigantic 4k curved tv, a sound system to match it, a new macbook that cost over 2 grand, and the worst, over 12 thousand on amazon on one order.  It was 50 items  Amazon actually called me twice because the were concerned someone had hijacked my account. Heh.\n\nBut that's my problem. I spent well over $20,000 in 4 days. 96 hours.  I'm a bit ashamed.  Which leads to my question.  Where can I put money that makes it hard to access? I have degrees in the  humanities, and I know precious little about personal finance.  Otherwise I'll  get all impulsive at night and buy a bunch of stuff I don't jeed.","549":"[H] Amazon gift card 1x25$ 1x50$ [W] 60$ Btc","550":"[H] 25$ AMAZON E-CARD [W] 20$ BITCOIN","551":"I have 5 $5 Amazon gift cards, looking for $22.00 paypal.\n\n[My GCX Profile](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2v439q\/uretroblade_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n\nPM here first","552":"How to Make 6 Figures a Year on Amazon in 1 Year http:\/\/thebecomer.com\/make-money-on-amazon\/","553":"[H]Amazon.com 20$ [W] paypal","554":"[H] $25 Amazon &amp; Xbox gift card [W] $20 steam gift card for each","555":"[H] \u00a310 Amazon GC [W] PayPal 13$ (self.giftcardexchange)","556":"[H] $60 Paypal [W] Amazon $50USD Giftcard","557":"The rates are for the total amount of Amazon GCs you have to trade.\n\n**85% - $25 in Amazon GCs**\n\n**80% - $1-$24.99 in Amazon GCs**\n\nRate is firm.

Before you ask, I am in no way affiliated with this company, I just saw it recently and see massive potential for people who are willing to take action! \n\n**WooCommerce Printful Integration**\n\nFor those of you who don't know, [WooCommerce](http:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/woocommerce\/) is a really easy to use and very powerful plugin for creating eCommerce stores using WordPress as a Content Management System. \n\n[Printful](https:\/\/www.theprintful.com\/landing\/woocommerce-print-products-fulfillment) is a cool looking print-on-demand service which, with the [WooCommerce integration plugin](http:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/products\/printful\/), allows you to order bespoke printed products that are shipped directly to your customers. [This is a simple flow diagram showing in simple terms how it works](https:\/\/www.theprintful.com\/static\/images\/retina\/how_it_works@2x.png).\n\nPrintful offer a variety of products such as:\n\n* apparel: t-shirts, sweaters, kids\/youth t-shirts, baby clothes, tank tops, etc.\n* posters: framed or unframed\n* canvas totes\n* mugs: standard, or made in the USA\n* greeting cards\n\nThe *only* thing I find slightly difficult is that the [shipping times](https:\/\/www.theprintful.com\/shipping) are quite long, especially outside of the USA. However, I am sure you guys are smart enough to work with that ;) \n\nIn my mind, this is very much the way things are going. If you have ever self published a book using Amazon's infrastructure you will know that they print books on demand at a *very* fast rate. I am sure that Printful and companies like it will follow suit. \n\nAnyway. Fancy having a business where you can sell your own bespoke products online? Where you don't have to buy or hold stock? Where you don't have to deal with shipping? \n\nHere is your opportunity!

I found a bunch of Remmington hair clippers with *incredible* margins and great rankings, but Amazon said I couldn't sell them :(. Why?    \n    \n5. Rankings seem so important, but I'm having a difficult time understanding what to look for. Sub 100,000 seems good, and I obviously stayed away from rankings in the millions. Any tips?    \n\n6. Do I have to remove the Ross price tags or will Amazon put their labels over them? I'm definitely going to remove the price tags from the food containers, but how about things in boxes?

I don't plan on ever spending more in a month on the card than I can pay in full at the end of the month. I am really just going to use it as an extension of my debit card and not as a means of financing large payments. I have a stable job that pays well and I have no intention of buying a new car or house or anything else in the immediate future. This will really just be used for day to day purchases that are well within my budget.\n\nMy question is if I am using my card in this fashion does APR even matter? My understanding is that interest is only applied once you have paid your bill for the end of the month. So in my case it would be interest on $0 (although I believe there is a very small minimum interest that is charged to your account). Is this accurate? Because of that I am really just looking at the rewards programs that various credit cards offer. The Amazon Prime Card (I already pay for prime and the card has no additional fees) has caught my eye with their rewards, but the APR is 25.99% which I know is high, but they also offer 5% back as a statement credit (I assume that means 5% of your purchases are added as a credit to your account and is essentially subtracted from your next month's purchases). \n\nIs any of this right? I am a finance newbie as I have always lived very modestly and had more than enough income so I have just sort of coasted by with all my money sitting in my checking account. Are there any suggestions you guys would like to make?\n\n\nThanks so much!","571":"Buying from Amazon and reselling on Amazon.

If you think that the current situation is right, you're nothing better than a slave who accepts being \"owned\" by someone else who demands to be called \"master\".\n\nMy point is to look at the reality of how technology companies are doing their best to destroy local economies and undermining the idea of privacy in order to enrich themselves. Evangelizing such behavior as \"progress\" is mindless propaganizing for an unsustainable approach to global economy.\n\n&gt; You can't give me even one causal link between the rise of big tech companies and the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nThat was called the Financial Crisis because it was caused by the finance industry (or at least, that's what happened).

The selling point of Etsy is that they offer a marketplace of exclusively hand-made (hypothetically seller-made) goods (and vintage\/upcycled items). This  is irrelevant to the developing world because it's a developed world phenomenon to care about buying goods from the artist\/maker directly and not actually having access to a robust marketplace containing maker sold items. \n\nSo, where will etsy expand with it's IPO that it is not already? I have a friend with an Etsy shop. She keeps a map with push pins from all of the locations that she has shipped to. Incidentally, that map is basically a map of all of the places that rich white people live. \n\nAdditionally, they already have a second product line for wholesalers that seems to be growing just fine without an infusion of capital.\n\nThey have a great business model as a niche online marketplace and I'm sure that they're nicely profitable as they only have to provide the platform for transactions in order to take a cut. This leads me to wonder whether they're just trying to turn some of their equity into cash so that the main investors can either exit or enjoy some of their wealth.  In which case, that seems like a recipe for stagnant or declining value.\n\nAlternatively, Etsy could be planning to abandon its maker-seller model and turn into an online marketplace for everything, but then they would dilute their brand, lose a lot of their sellers, and end up competing directly against Amazon, Ali-Baba, and ebay without any real competitive advantage. That's a disastrous move. Even if they try to use that capital to build a separate marketplace to compete with those platforms, they will probably lose.\n\nTL;DR What are they going to use their IPO cash for that they don't already do well, organically?

Thats a 30% profit margin. In that situation, you buy something for $10 and sell it for $30. Amazon takes about 10, you get $20 back. $20 minus your $10 for cost of goods gives you $10 profit. \n\nYour profit margin will go up on higher priced items and down on lower priced items, since the $2.50 - $3.50 pick\/pack fees that Amazon charges on top of the 15% or so commissions is steady, meaning it costs the same for them to pick and pack a $200 item that is the same size as a $20 item, but $3.50 fee is a lot bigger percentage over the overall pie of a $20 item than the $200 item.\n\nSome people go for smaller margin items that turn faster, then they use that cash back to go back out and do it again. Some people want larger margins and less items, maybe because they have less time to churn through smaller margin items. Again, thats up to how you want to run your business.\n\nSales rank is up to you too. Most people fall into general areas when theyve been doing it a while. Many try to stay within the top 5 or 10% of skus for a category. \n\nTo me, its all about risk and cash flow. Im willing to tie more money up on an item that moves quicker (knowing it will come back faster and I can spend it again on something else) than I am on slower moving items. However, if I stumble across something for a small amount of money that has a huge potential return but may take a long time to sell, I may judge the risk of it sitting and tying up that money for the next X months as ok, considering the potential return. \n\nFor example, I once found an old law book with a 3 million+ ranking (barely selling) that was going for 150-200.

Yeah, you can sell a 10 cent item and get 1 dollar back after fees, a 1000% profit, but if there are other sellers they will drive you into the red fast. Real fast. For me, a good rule of thumb is to double your fees in profit. If the fees are 5 dollars, aim for a 5 dollar profit at least. That at least gives you a buffer for when some asshole decides to start a price war with you. Other than that its all how much you're willing to spend for the money. Like, Ill buy a 30 dollar item for a 15 dollar profit, but thats all how much money you want in your little gruby hands.\n\nAs for sales rank, try not to put too much stake into it. Everything I sell, sells. Everything. Every little thing. Items with a 2 million sales rank? Sells in a week or so. If the margins are too your liking, just go for it. Obviously, how much is too much of an investment is up to you, but honestly if I'm paying less than 5 dollars per item and the profit is great, Ill get it regardless of sales rank. \n\nBut if you want a number, under 100k is usually considered a \"fast sell\", but again its misleading. Is there Amazon\/FBA offers? If not that could be the reason for a low sales rank. Some people just WILL NOT buy if the word \"amazon\" isn't right there. The sales rank could be good but if a price war with amazon could put you in the red, don't touch it. If there are no sellers, but it displays a sales rank, then I always buy it.","701":"I have been using my perk rewards to get ebay gift cards which i then use when there is a deal on sears gifts cards.

Shopify believes that they\u2019ll be a \u201cdead branch of the history of retail\u201d because distribution is so ubiquitous and accessible now. (See; Amazon.)\n\n**2: The future of retail is experiential: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the product. It\u2019s about what\u2019s being represented.\u201d**\n\nTobi brought this up when talking about how Lululemon was converting its store locations to yoga studios. Products are increasingly commoditized\u2013 people can get all sorts of products at dirt-cheap prices, shipped to them almost instantly. The distinguishing factor becomes experience, which departmental stores aren\u2019t optimized for.\n\n**3: Best Buy is probably going to die.**\n\nJason candidly asked Tobi what he would do if he had to take charge of Best Buy, and Tobi conceded that they would probably die, or get carved up somehow. If it is to persist, it will have to adapt and evolve into something very different from what it has been so far.\n\n**4: There\u2019s definitely demand for more innovative pop-up stores, but it\u2019s going to be an uphill legal battle.**\n\nBoth Jason and Tobi talked about how nice it would be if you could have interesting experiences with creators right in your local area, that didn\u2019t require the stores to buy a year\u2019s lease. Tobi described how there are no options for a retailer in the middle ground between having products and signing a year\u2019s lease. (Crossing The Chasm, anybody?) They talk about how businesses don\u2019t typically get allowed by cities to stay in locations for a month or less.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to think about this in relation to the progress of things like Airbnb and Uber\u2013 microrentals are slowly becoming more widespread. Might \u201cAirbnb for Businesses\u201d be a legitimate business in itself? It seems like the bulk of the innovation required for that would be in policy, laws, etc.\n\n**5: Kickstarter\u2019s success has very little to do with crowdfunding.**\n\nRather, Tobi notes, it has to do with the fact that makers are forced to make videos explaining to people why a product matters, why it ought to exist, and all the loving attention to detail that goes into it. That contributes tremendously to the experience of the product.\n\n\u2013\n\nBeyond discussing the future of retail, Jason and Tobi also cover a lot about Shopify itself, and the challenges and opportunities the company faces ahead. There a lot of interesting nuggets worth mining, from Tobi discussing Shopify\u2019s initial misstep with their pricing strategy, to the aggressive (and cheeky) recruiting tactic they used to acquire laid-off IBM employees.","724":"My personal thoughts\u2013 it was especially interesting to see Jason ask Tobi about point-of-sale. Shopify released one just a week or so after the video was posted, which means they were already working on it at the time.\n\nAlso I really liked what Tobi said about how, ultimately, \"what a product represents\" is the logical end conclusion of what should be the focus of what you're selling, if you're not selling a commodity (eg something that Amazon can sell cheaper and more quickly.)","725":"Pb does scan faster than the Amazon app, and supports Bluetooth scanners (for an additional fee)","726":"&gt; 5% back on gas and groceries year round with my Sallie Mae\n\nJust got approved for this card.

Either that or Canadian Border Services Agency. I can't figure out which one of them keeps screwing me over. **Except for their IT department. I hear they're awesome :)**  \n   \n\n**Example 1:**  \n My wife and I moved to Canada from the US for a temporary work assignment. The first month we were here my wife had an older relative send her a birthday card with $100 cash in it. Their thought process is we would not be able to cash a check in Canada (they did not know we kept our US Bank).  At any rate, when we received the card it had been opened and of course the money was missing.  \n\n**Example 2:**  \n\nWhen we moved here I left some things at my parent's house that I did not want to put into storage. I ended up needing one of those things. I asked them to send it to me. My Dad had no idea how much it was worth (it was worth $150 tops), but he insured it for $500. They used that $500 USD as the valuation for collecting import tax, So it cost $60 to send me this thing that weighs about 5lb and is about the size of an external hard drive. When it arrived the Canadian Post would not allow me to pick up my package unless I paid them $100.  \n\nSo what were my options for recourse? Refuse the package and pay $60 to send it back to the US or try to get my package re-evaluated at customs. Ok I pick option 2. Well come to find out they don't have the form there at that post office. So I call Canadian Post customer service. They don't have the ability to send me a digital copy of the form and it's not available online. They told me to check another post office. So I checked every single post office in my area. None of them had this form. So the only option I had (if I actually wanted my package) was to pay the $100 and file for a reimbursement. So I did that and I have yet to hear back from anyone. I wasn't given a tracking number, a case number, nothing.... It's what I expected, but it still pisses me off.  \n\n**Example 3:**  \n\nIt cost me $6 to ship $3 razors from Amazon.ca. What the actual fuck? I bought these for my straight razor. The alternative is paying $15 at the only store I can find in town that sells double edge blades.  \n\n**Example 4:**  \n\nIt cost me $15 to send my Provincial Tax Return by certified mail and $30 to send four pieces of paper for my State Tax Return in the US. I mean I know they're in business to make money, but compared to the shipping rates in the US this place is ludicrous! For these prices I'd expect they deliver each package with a bottle of Johnny Walker Gold.    \n\n\/rant \n\n\nAt any rate, seeing this... I think I might just \"start a small business\".

You might as well say \"everyone\". Except \"everyone\" doesn't care about their hosting like that.\n\nThe market you're targeting is happy with the mid level providers. EIG has bought up a ton of smaller companies and \"ruined\" them but they still bring in all the mid level customers. Look at how many affiliate driven bloggers out there promote bluehost and get hundreds or thousands of signups each month.\n\nA few weeks ago I saw on our local facebook group a \"fundraiser to support &lt;name's&gt; cafe\" This cafe closed down after a bad winter drove away customers and some water damage came up they couldn't afford. So they closed and now another business wants to help them out so they are promoting a \"fundraiser\". I'll tell you what I would tell them. When a business operates by trading goods and services for money that's not fundraising. That's business. And if you can't sell enough widgets (or meals) to stay open it's because something in your business is wrong not because you need charity.\n\nMy point is if this service were actually something people wanted you could easily buy up some digital ocean (or other similar provider). Install your customized system on their hardware and get your first 100 customers. Getting people to pay ahead on indiegogo is a stupid way to try and approach this business.\n\nI'm sorry to be harsh. You're buying rice and trying to jazz it up and sell it at a premium.

So, I decided to send a few small things, which was a mistake.\n\n\n2) I did not know that \"Distributed Inventory Placement\" was the default setting.  So, if you want your small order sent to the same place, you must choose \"Inventory Placement Service\" in the Inbound Settings of your FBA account.  I don't recall having any setting options when I signed up for FBA, which is a bit frustrating, as I'm sure I would have caught this.  It would have been nice to have been able to go through all of the settings (with an explanation) during the sign up process.\n\n\nSo, fyi newbies, if you're thinking about sending just a few things to try out FBA.

You'll also wants some speakers to wire it to so you can verify it reads CD's correctly and doesn't skip or anything.\n\nYou can sell it untested as long as you specify that in your listing and make it very clear, but you'll generally only get 25%-30% of the price of a fully working and tested unit. I would not recommend listing it and just hoping that it works because in my experience CD changers tend to be donated to thrift stores for a reason, there's something wrong with them or they're broken. Also the majority of buyers for these things are mechanics who source their replacements on eBay, and they will be incredibly angry if they purchase a unit only to find out it doesn't work and now they have to tell their customer it's going to be another 3-4 days before they can do the repair.\n\nOnce you have your power source it's relatively easy to wire it up, just google 'how to wire car stereo to 12v battery' or 'wire car stereo to power supply instructions' - there should be plenty of guides and videos.  Also be careful, car batteries and power supplies can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

Going there will be too similar to high school and you'll likely be stuck with people not as academically gifted. Based off your interests, look for a school with a top computer science\/engineering program. Take a look at [this list](http:\/\/www.bestvalueschools.com\/computer-science-degrees-best-roi\/) or [this larger list](http:\/\/www.usnews.com\/education\/best-global-universities\/computer-science), find some schools that appeal to you, research scholarships available, including partial scholarships (even contact the schools yourself) and apply. Apply to a bunch of them. You'll likely have to look outside Iowa, but I believe that can actually work in your favor as schools look to broaden their student body and create campuses full of people with diverse backgrounds. Finding scholarships and applying to many schools can take a lot of work, but it's in your best interest. A good university makes getting the type of job you want much easier, even if you don't know what that job is yet. You'll have professors who have worked at top companies, a smarter student body, more resources for pretty much anything and a much stronger network for when you graduate. Not to mention it will look much better on your resume. \n\nIf you're able to get a scholarship at a good CS university, the couple hundred you'll eventually spend on flights will be a good deal considering your employment options and stronger education. And start getting some internship experience freshman year so you can work up to getting better internships your junior year, which will lead to better job opportunities your senior year. A path like this can lead you to great career opportunities making good money (CS majors often have one of the highest salaries compared to other majors).

Thats it.","849":"You made way more than me as a student. I was only doing $7.50 minimum wage in NY at the time.\n\nSo my Discover student card had $750 credit on it.\n\nI had a cosigner, my mom, and several times I wanted to increase the limit.\nEvery attempt got denied. I figured it was me. But it was actually my mom! And they won't remove a cosigner from the student card. They made me sign up for a new card. So keep that in mind. \n\nIt was still a great card! I had TONS of cashback on the thing, keep in mind the quarterly rotating ones and I think you ALWAYS get cashback on Amazon which is fantastic as a student.\n\nWhen I went in on my own Discover card after 5 years of using that old Discover student card - I got $5,000 credit instantly. 2 weeks later, it became $10,000 without me asking. Right now half a year later its $15,000.\n\nRewinding a bit, while I was a student, I also used Paypal. You sign up for a paypal account, get verified, and then you get a debit card for free. Paypal Credit is kinda newish, you apply to that separately and they give you an evolving line of credit. It was very nice, even as a student they gave me $1,000 off the bat - more than the Discover student. The debit card can be set to use that Paypal credit - so now it becomes a credit card. And you get cashback! Good program, Paypal gets too much hate imo. They've continually increased me credit over the years, and they just recently boosted me to $3,000.\n\nAmazon *just* came out with a new card. You can only use it at Amazon checkout and get 5% off everything. Fantastic as a student too. However, the Discover student card did give like 2-4% or something so kind of a toss up on the extra discount vs actual credit card to use everywhere.\n\nI also just signed up for the Target RED card on my way out of target just two days ago. I'm not a student anymore, but I'm sure if I applied then too it would've gotten approved. So far its pretty nice. You can also set this to be a debit card, but I don't know if that will help with your credit.\n\nFor my fiance, her engagement ring and various jewelry gifts, I got a credit card from Zales even as a student with minimum wage income. You can only use it at Zales though sadly. I forget how much credit they gave me, but I kept it in good use.\n\nLast but not least during my senior year I signed up for Jetblue American Express so I can cash in on their mileage bonus. They're pretty good if you plan to travel in the US alot. Bewarned though, American Express is leaving Jetblue this year and supposedly Jetblue will be moving customers to a new card so I have no idea what happens after December this year. So far, again, its been great. Chip &amp; pin too! And there is an Android NFC app (the only one that works on my damn Galaxy Note 3 incidentally, fuck)\n\nIf you're like me, and bonkers with all these cards building credit, use a program like Mint. Attach all the accounts and get notifications for all of them when payments are due. Keep constantly checking them and paying them off. Please don't let any single card get the best of you.","850":"Zappos (now owned by Amazon) has an HBS case written about their culture and it made it sound pretty awesome.

I paid $17 for 7 Habits and $13 for TGR. Tai has yet to charge me a dime.\n\nI don't know much about his 67 Steps program but just search \"Tai Lopez\" on YouTube and he like 18 bajillion free videos. Those are the ones I've been watching. So far, I love them\n\nI just read \"This guy is a fucking loser.\" Are you kidding me? You're talking about a real human being here who deserves respect. I will admit that he uses some \"creative descriptions\" for how he talks about reading a book day, but he's kind of right. Allot of books contain a ton of Fluff. His technique isn't to just read the jacket... it's to read the table of contents, and figure out what's WORTH reading in the book and skipping the rest. I do the same thing sometimes. When I don't have much time I'll read a Kindle book and there's a way to just read the stuff a lot of people highlighted so you can take away the most important points.\n\nHe does say that some books are worth reading cover to cover though, which I certainly agree with.\n\nAnyway, You guys are literally ripping a really great guy apart for nothing. He barely charges. Even his PAID courses he's like \"Listen if you really can't afford it, drop me an email and we have a scholarship program.

A few years ago, I made a good income hawking penny books through FBA,  and I would snap up any clean modern fiction with a decent sales rank that I could find for less than $0.25.  After I processed them and sent them off to FBA, I could realize a buck a book in profit.  \n\nI think Amazon got tired of building warehouses to shelve penny books, so they started upping their fees and pushing the penny book market into the loss column.  So, I stopped that practice.  It wasn't the focus of my operation, but it helped pad the bottom line.  \n\nCaveat emptor.  I would walk away from these books.  I know it seems like a great idea to get 40,000 books for a song, but there's a reason why this bookstore is not doing FBA or MF with these books.  They're probably garbage, a sucker's bet.

My advice would be as follows:\n\n1) Pick a genre. There is an enormous saturation of 10-20 page self help books on the market now from authors who will literally spend two hours researching and writing a book on a subject. Be better than that and and pick a subject you're interested in and passionate about if you're looking for non-fiction writing, otherwise you will be exposed by the 1 star reviews from people who download your book and realise your information came from the first page of a Google search result. \n\n2) Write for the fun of it, not for a profit. I view writing as an inexpensive hobby and a way to share some of my accumulated knowledge of my subject with people and this is a genre I stick to as it's one I'm passionate  about. Since September I've made about \u00a370 in royalties which doesn't even cover costs (see below) yet I'll continue to write whether I sell 1 copy or 10,000 copies because it's something I enjoy. \n\n3) Get it proofread. Depending on your level of professionalism and honest views at the success of your book the level of proofreading can vary, however this is an essential part of the process. People are (rightly) quick to slam your book if there's spelling mistakes, poor grammar or a lack of prose and readability and these reviews will dampen your chances of success. Personally for my first two books I paid a company to proofread both of them at $20 per 1,000 words even though I didn't expect much success at all but this was before I found out sites like Fiver exist. There's plenty of decent proofreaders on Fiver who will pick up these basic mistakes for you at $5 per ~1000 words and rewrite and edit for a further $5 per ~1000 words and this is a necessary expense. \n\n4) Enrol in KDP select. Unless you've got your own blog and are confident you can push sales to a broader market enrolling in KDP select gets you host of Amazon-centric benefits to help boost sales. You can run 5 days of free promotions per 90 day period and this is a good opportunity to get some downloads and reviews from people. Promote to places such as \/r\/FreeEBOOKS and \/r\/KindleFreebies.\n\n5) Set up a Createspace account. Createspace are owned by Amazon and publish a physical copy of your book on demand if someone buys a copy. While less than 1% of sales will come from physical copies seeing a physical copy priced at 3 times the price of the Kindle copy sets off those magic endorphins inside buyers heads that make your book seem like a bargain.\n\n6) Price your book according to content. If you've written a 20,000 page non fiction book on something that you're passionate about then $2.99 is a respectable price point for people to pay. If you've written 100,000 words then it's more realistic to price it at $9.99 as the extra proofreading costs and time consumed mean the book is better suited to a higher price point.\n\n7) Set up Amazon affiliate links.

I bought a winter coat from North Face this way and got 10% cash back, which is nice.\n\nAmex Blue Cash Preferred is 6% back on groceries and gas, 3% on department stores. $75 annual fee, but I got a $250 sign up bonuses and get more than the fee back in cash back.\n\nCiti has a 2% cash back card on everything (double cash I think it's called).\n\nThere are also cards out there that are specifically really good for travel.\n\nThere is a Sallie Mae card that gives you 5% cash back on Amazon and groceries and gas as well.","891":"ORCL, MSFT, CSCO are huge mega cap companies selling many different products.

Split everything you can with your roomies.\n\nAlso, buy a gorram deep freeze. You can get cheap ones off craigslist or fb bidding groups or whatever is popular in your area. Buy meat that's on discount, and freeze it. Everything in my deep freeze is 30-50% off, and it's just fine to eat. Cheap meat, frozen veggies and a giant bag of rice (and a rice cooker) and you can eat for a month, healthy, for very little.\n\nFinally, snacks. Buy good snacks in bulk. I find that's where most of my spending is. Not in \"what will I have for dinner\", but \"goddamnit I need some chocolate or a bag of chips or whatever\". That adds up quick. I can do $3 dinners all week, but then you break down and buy a $5 bag of chips and that ruins all your hard work. SO. Popcorn is great. Tortilla chips that you have to dip in salsa are good, it's hard to overeat on that. When you have the chance, buy big boxes of little snacks. I still have some of my halloween stash left. Make brownies or cupcakes from scratch. Whatever your weakness is, accept it, and work around it. Your budget will be much happier with a $5 bag of popcorn and a bit of butter in a month, than it will be with 10x$5 bags of chips or whatever.\n\nAlso, keep a stash of granola bars in your car or backpack. If you're hungry and thinking about grabbing a quick bite when you're out, have a granola bar and a bottle of water instead. Big savings there. \n\nFurniture wise, don't go crazy. You need a good bed, a good chair, a good pot, a good fry pan, and a good knife. Everything else you can get second-hand for cheap and you'll be fine. $200 ikea bookcases? How about $20 off craigslist? I see so many people blow a few grand buying shit, and then a year later they're selling it because they don't like it or it doesn't fit. Save your money. Cinder block and wood plank bookcases are fine for your first place.\n\nTry and have not only a month of bare minimum expenses stashed, but also a bit of emergency cash if things go tits up. It's hard to do, but so so worth it. If you run into a hard spot and can't pay a bill, call them and make arrangements. Often times they'll pass on the late fee if you tell them money is coming in a week or two.\n\nYou don't need a $15 a month bank account. That's 180 a year that could go somewhere better. You don't need a 5000000 deductible on your 1,000 car. Save on insurance. You don't need a 150 a month cell plan, get something cheap and find free wifi spots around town. You don't need a 100 a month cable package, get netflix or stream what you like to watch. Every time you spend money, ask yourself \"Do I need this\", and \"I need this, but can I make it cost less?\". Order things you don't need immediately online for less. Amazon Prime is pretty sweet. Are you a reader? Get a library card or a kobo, and stop going to Chapters. Are you a drinker? Pregame before the bar, get some big bottles of cheap yet good liquor and get lit before you go. Are you a smoker? Switch to vaping. Are you a pothead? Upgrade yourself to something more efficient, like a bong or a volcano. Like clothes? They be like, \"Oh, that Gucci - that's hella tight.\" I'm like, \"Yo - that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt.\" Limited edition, let's do some simple addition. Fifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch shit. I call that getting swindled and pimped shit. I call that getting tricked by a business. That shirt's hella dough. And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't. Be frugal, pick good things, don't go blowing cash on shit shirts everyone else is wearing. You'll look better, and spend less.\n\nGenerally though, if you've got 6 large saved up already, you'll be just fine. Good luck!","914":"Amazon shipped out 588 items on my behalf last month.  I feel cheated by Amazon because I wanted the satisfaction of shipping those items out myself and putting handwritten notes in all my packages.  Thanks for taking that away from me, Amazon.  Hate FBA..","915":"I don't feel comfortable offering any substantial advice but I will say that if you're looking at that Amazon card for 5% you should check out the SallieMae card. I can't remember the name but I have one and it gives me 5% back on gas and groceries up to 250 a month (a piece if I remember correctly) and 5% back on bookstore purchases up to 750 a month. Literally everything I've purchased on Amazon is processed as a bookstore purchase so I still get the 5%. I've also purchased groceries at Walmart and other stores that are usually excluded in a grocery category and still received 5% back. With the SallieMae card, I believe cash back is only issued as a statement credit of you cash your points. \n\nOther cards I have that I will recommend are the citi double cash with no restrictions and the chase freedom with revolving 5% categories. Between those three cards I'm pretty much completely covered as far as cash back goes. \n\nThat said if you do not have a card or credit history\/higher credit score (yet) you may not qualify for these cards. If you don't I'd suggest opening a share secured card through a local bank. Normally they require a 500+ dollar deposit and they will open a credit line for you and when you close the card or switch to a non secured card they will give your deposit back. Usually once you have this for a few months you can start getting other cards (like store cards etc). \n\nFinally, I personally never look at APRs because I pay my cards weekly or daily and have NEVER been charged interest. So I don't really think this is something you should worry about. Nerdwallet and similar sites can be useful for comparing cards at a glance. I prefer cash back cards because they're just easier. But cards with perks like air miles and things may be of interest to you. \n\n\nThis was typed in an iPad (very annoying to type on this thing) so there's probably tons of grammatical errors.

I think I'm going to buy a $50 Amazon card when I go back.","933":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Mostly Amazon and Ebay prices if the game is deemed of value. Systems stay around the same price and are usually worth for a flip if you are willing to take the risk to buy it.

While you owe tens of thousands of dollars,  sometimes it just makes more sense to play it safe,  rather than ruin your credit and incur penalties and fines.   Regulatory capture by existing industries in many fields has made it incredibly difficult to compete,  as has availability of business loans, and general income issues for the general public.   It's hard to sell when your competitors are Amazon. ","937":"The lazy way is to use Square\/PayPal Here\/Amazon local register to pay $1850 to yourself.
