I'm a longtime reader here, and have used the advice given here many times in the past.\n\nI'm 24, and a software engineer at a major software company in California\/Seattle (think Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook) working on a high-profile project at the company. It was my dream job out of school, and I'm paid well.  I make ~$120k\/year including bonuses.\n\nI've been working since September 2013, and have about $100k saved up, and I still go on trips, eat well, etc.  I'm fairly frugal, so it's not a challenge.\n\nI'm just not happy.\n\nI dated the same woman for practically my entire four years of college.  She's now at a med school in the midwest.  We decided to break up shortly after graduation, but after giving ourselves a few months to distance ourselves from the situation, decided to get back together.  Now I visit every few months and for holidays.  Our relationship is still quite strong--and I would love to marry her someday.\n\nI've had some troubles at work with office politics, and maybe a little disillusionment after seeing \"how the sausage is made\", I guess.  Sometimes I enjoy my job, but I'd have to say that usually I don't and feel like I did well enough in school and am talented enough to deserve to be happier somewhere.  I realize how privileged I sound right now.\n\nI've been thinking about quitting and moving to her city to be near her again.  I'm 98% sure I'd be taking a paycut with just about any job I found, but does it even matter?  In ten years will I regret not having the extra money, or regret not spending my mid-twenties with someone I love?\n\nTo answer some questions I foresee possibly popping up, she has 2.5  years of med school left, I realize she'll probably be moving again for a residency afterwards, and let's assume that I cannot continue working my position remotely.\n\nI'm sorry if this post is inappropriate here--I've tried asking a few people very close to me and some have said I'd be crazy for leaving my current job and same have said I'd be crazy to stay miserable here.  I don't really know how I feel and I'm hoping it clicks in the next few months.","7":"[H] $45 Amazon GC [W] $55 PayPal","8":"[H] $20 Amazon GC [W] $20 Steam","9":"I have $150 Amazon GCs ($25x6).

Unfortunately before I finalised that plan, I applied for a Bank of America Alaska card, and a Barclays US Airways card in mid-November, which is less than three months ago. I already have a branded US Bank card (from September 2014), an Ink Plus, Freedom, and Amazon card from Chase last May\/June, and much older CSP and Alaska cards. I have a great income, and per Barclay my current FICO is 747. The card I most want is the Barclay Arrival, but I'm pretty sure I will be able to use all the hotel and airline points I can pick up this year. \n\n\nMy current application plan for this week:\n\ncard | bank \n---|---\nArrival plus | Barclay  \nAAdvantage Gold | Citi \nHilton | Amex\nUnited | Chase \nClub Carlson | US Bank \nHyatt | Chase  \n\n\nThere's a couple cards I'd like to get but won't put in this round, so I will probably do one more 'fuck-it' round in early March before I take ~8 months mostly out of touch. In that round, I will apply for \n\ncard | bank \n--| --\nIHG | Chase\nAlaska Air | BoA \nVentureOne (no fee) | Capital One \n    \nMy main question - is it likely that I'm pushing it too much with this set of applications with my November cards? Should I hold off until February or apply for fewer cards this week? Basically I want these cards to buy things like my airline tickets, which I'd rather do ASAP. But it probably won't ruin everything to wait until February if that's a significant improvement in my chances.\n\nMy more specific questions:    \n\n* I have read that two Chase apps in a day is unlikely to be approved - I will apply for the targeted United card first and only apply for the Hyatt if that gets auto-approved, does that sound reasonable?    \n* I gather that the single day app-o-rama is less useful these days since the banks will all see the applications in real-time: should I still order it US Bank, Barclays, others, or is that no longer worth it?    \n* Am I missing any current awesome offers that I should go for instead of one of the listed cards?","24":"[H]$30 paypal [W] $25 Amazon gc","25":"http:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/36782379?www=true&amp;productRedirect=true Out of Stock online, but you might find a few in stores at $49.97\n\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nerf-A8017-Combat-Creatures-TerraDrone\/dp\/B00ILD5D7S\/ Amazon has some stock at times, but sells out quickly.

It's very similar to the plethora of apps like this that already exist with a few differences. \n\nRewards have a low $1.00 minimum payout for 500 points, and larger rewards increase in incrementd of 500. The apps pay pretty well, and the first time opening the app I counted over 700 available points from just app downloads. \n\nPay-out options are a variety of gift cards in varying amounts. Gift card retailers include: Amazon, Best Buy, Facebook, Fandango, Home Depot, iTunes, Nike, REI, Sephora, Tango, Target, and Walmart.\n\nThey have a nice referral program where you get 200 points per referall and your referrals get 100 points.\n\nThe single most unique and appealing thing about this app is the \"Appdango Best Rewards Guarantee.\" Essentially, if you do an app offer through them, and then find that same offer somewhere else with a higher payout, they will match it 110%! More info on the guarantee can be found here: https:\/\/appdango.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/200432998-What-is-the-Appdango-Best-Rewards-Guarantee-\n\nAlso, a quick tip for android users with this and other paid to download apps, once you feel an app like this has been tapped out with nothing left to offer, do a factory reset and sign back in with the same Google account info. Then simply download another one of these apps and you can start all over again! \n\nI hope I have been able to provide some useful insight into this app, and would greatly appreciate any referrals:\n\nAndroid Non-ref: https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.appdango.app\n\niOS Non-ref: www.appdango.com\n\nRef.

Here, you download the apps and run them for at least 30 seconds to get your credits. This has been working very quickly for me, and it seems to be much faster than any other method I've tried. I pretty much always get my credits instantly after the 30 seconds is up, unlike many other applications I've tried which don't give me my promised credits at all. In fact, I have this on Android which is apparently the slower one since average payout per app is like 100 credits, while it's usually apparently around 160 on iOS.\n\nBasically, all you do is open the app, sign in\/register, and then you're set to earn! Click the sponsors tab to see which apps will get you credits, download them, and leave them open for 30 seconds. Then, check if you got paid yet, then delete the app if you don't want it! You can use credits to redeem gift cards to dozens of different things, be it Amazon, Best Buy, Steam, iTunes, Xbox, even Club Penguin! You can also use it to redeem VISA prepaid cards. Payout rate is 300 credits = $1, meaning that you can earn one dollar in 2-3 apps, or around 2 minutes. Additionally, you get 200 credits for each referral that registers. Minimum payout is 1500 credits for a $5 gift card.\n\n[Referral Link](https:\/\/m.freemyapps.com\/share\/url\/fcd9e390)\n\n[Non-Referral Link](https:\/\/m.freemyapps.com\/share\/)\n\nEDIT: So apparently it turns out that Jailbroken iOS devices are not supported\n\nEDIT2: So another user says it's not the case.

I just felt I needed to document my success so far since this sub has helped me so much. Hopefully this post can help motivate some newbies looking to get in on the flipping game as well!\n\nI found this sub about 2 months ago, and man am I happy I did. The same night I found VGPC through this sub which kept me up all night researching video game prices. I already knew much about SNES and N64 games anyway since I grew up with those systems and don't really dabble in the newer stuff, so I decided to jump in right away and start flipping.\n\nI soon found myself buying games and setting up my Amazon Seller account. It wasn't too long after that my games started selling. The feeling was incredible and I knew I could make some good cash if I kept it up.\n\nMost recently I have had some pretty good luck sourcing, and even tried upping my sales by attempting some eBay\/Amazon arbitrage. Local sourcing has proven to be the best so far since sourcing on eBay takes a lot of time between finding the games and then calculating my total cost which includes converting US to CAD, shipping and import fees.\n\nSo far the games I sourced on eBay will still make me a few bucks, and Kijiji is definitely a good source, but I am having a few of problems right now. For starters, my profit margins are razor thin. Who wants to spend $80 on 4 games and have to wait possibly weeks to make $100? My second problem is that I've basically taken this as far as I can go. I have notifications as soon as new video games pop up in case I want to buy and I buy everything I can make a decent profit on. Now that I've done that, there's no where else for me to source.\n\nAnyway, after 2 months, spending about 2 hours a day or more doing this, I have spent $1880 and made $2409, for a profit of about $529. Keep in mind that this is not including the cost of mailing everything, which I believe is around $250 (I haven't put all my receipts in excel yet), plus the  misc costs which include a postal scale, poly mailers, packing tape, a printer, security bits and new batteries to replace in certain games. All said and done I've made about $200 in profit, and have roughly $1k in inventory that will sell over the next couple of months.\n\nThe way I look at it, I'm making somewhere around $10\/hour, which isn't really worth my time anymore, so today I decided to take a crack at retail arb. I've been saving boxes and have had bubble wrap in my closet since I started 2 months ago, and I'm glad to say I used them today! Today I went out for about half an hour and sourced a toy that goes for about $40 FBA, that I picked up for only $5 each. There were only 4 left and I grabbed them all. Sales rank was around 20k or so. Just hoping they sell now but either way I'm happy because even if they don't I still learned a lot.\n\nI got the shipment ready to go for FBA, and then even sourced a couple more items online. All said and done once (if) I sell it all, I'll at least double or even triple my money and I only worked about an hour. \n\nIt has been pretty fun flipping games, and I definitely learned a ton along the way, but it feels like it is now time for me to move on to something bigger, so now I am heading for retail arb. On top of that, I am also going to start sourcing rare\/vintage\/etc from the thrifts stores for stability in case retail arb ever goes south. I have already been casually thrifting during my 2 months flipping.\n\nAnyway, I guess I just felt that I should document my story so far since it was this sub that got me here in the first place, and I though a few people might benefit from reading it. I also wanted to give another HUGE thank you to this sub.\n\nTL;DR: 2 months flipping video games, ~$200 profit + $1k in inventory, not making enough for my time, heading for retail arb and rare\/vintage. Thanks r\/Flipping! ","117":"[H] GameStop GC, Amazon GC, and Psn GC [W] PayPal 87%-negotiable","118":"[H] Amazon [W] Best Buy","119":"I've been kicking around entrepreneurship for over 5 years now. This is my story and the lessons I've learned.\n\nFrom the beginning I committed to starting business. I made my objective in the beginning the pure pursuit of ideas for the outcome of learning. To me, the only way I could fail was if I didn\u2019t try anything. I can\u2019t exactly remember how I picked my first business, but I remember thinking it was brilliant and I was totally going to crush it.\n\nMy first business was a college cleaning company. I started asking girlfriends if they wanted to earn some extra money and be a part of a business opportunity. I found 3-5 that seemed very interested, they could be relied on.\n\nI threw house parties weekly for a couple years during my middle years of college. It taught me a lot about business, but it also taught me how much people hated cleaning up the mess afterwards. \n\nCollege campus cleaning service. Spit shine. I\u2019ll employ hot cleaners and dress them up in hockey uniforms with the spit shine logo on it and I\u2019ll send them to clean up after college parties when everyone is hangover and lazy with a big mess and a bunch of extra (nothing) money.\n\nI still remember how good it felt to have gotten out of the bank holding my first company credit card with \u2018Spit Shine LLC\u2019 on it. I can still walk out those doors and smell that breeze. Possibly because the door was directly above the dumpsters where the trucks loaded the trash from the union\u2019s cafeteria. Regardless.\n\nThe number one lesson I learned from starting Spit Shine\n\nI had to be passionate about what I was doing. I couldn\u2019t care less if people wanted clean houses after their party. The daunting task of the job required great motivation to keep afloat. If I didn\u2019t care about its overall message I knew it would be much harder to find the motivation to continue when things got really challenging. I exited quickly.\n\nI see the debate. \u2018Love what you\u2019re doing\u2019 goes up against \u2018you have to make money.\u2019 And the discussion seems to quickly shift into talk about \u2018working hard\u2019 and \u2018pushing through tough times.\u2019 I don\u2019t believe we should settle for a world where those two things are not compatible.\n\nAt the end of the day, you should enjoy how you are spending your time. And I would be willing to bet that your path will be a lot sharper and go a lot quicker when you\u2019re floating through something you love doing. We\u2019ve all had experiences of getting lost in an experience and time floating by effortlessly as if it were a waking dream.\n\nMy next 'entrepreneur' activity was earning money playing poker. But I let it completely absorb me. \n\nI stopped going downstairs to play halo with my roommates because I felt it was a distraction from learning about or playing poker. I neglected my health and my sleeping patterns. I stopped exercising and ate way too much fast food. I read a little bit about \u2018the poker mindset\u2019 but I didn\u2019t yet realize how profound its impact could be. That wouldn\u2019t come until a breakup made me reevaluate how I was living my life. Having 80% of my focus on poker ensured my grades wouldn\u2019t rise above a 3.3. Thankfully this stopped me from choking myself in med school.\n\n#1 lesson learned from online poker\n\nPassion, drive and hard work aren\u2019t enough if you let the other areas of your life slide. I\u2019ve since learned that the areas I neglected have huge benefits. Both to your life in general and the outcome of the task you are attempting to accomplish. Abraham hicks would say \u201cOne who is connected is more powerful than a million who are not.\u201d A profound statement.\n\nI sometimes regretted not forming better relationships with my roommates because I isolated myself in my room. I didn\u2019t know how important of an impact a couple more games of halo could have on a friendship. And that\u2019s really all it took to get to know someone better. It taught me how important it was to cultivate and maintain relationships outside of my main focus.  I shifted my desire for learning from poker to self-help books and nutrition. And I started practicing.\n\nI would put myself in situations I felt uncomfortable with. I saw firsthand how much the rest of my life benefited each time I was able to expand my comfort zone. It allowed me to meet new people, and join different groups.\n\nI began exercising every day and experimenting with different ways of eating. And I found meditation. Which is, to this day, one of the most powerful tools I have ever used to shape my life. I absolutely love it. A wonderful new addiction.\n\nMy new focus gave me new passions. One of the people who got me started on my next passion was Joe Rogan. I was deeply obsessed with things that would allow me to squeeze extra functioning or power out of my mind now that I got a glimpse of what meditation could do.\n\nMust acquire floatation tank\n\nI heard Joe Rogan talking about the floatation tank he had in his home. He described many of the same effects I had while listening to binaural beats. I became quickly obsessed with floatation tanks. My passion for entrepreneurship did not fade in the slightest during this time.\n\nThe more I looked into floatation the more it made sense as a business. It was something I could fall in love with. I desperately wanted a tank in my own home but without 40k to spend on one my business solution ensured I would be able to float daily. It was time to try and start a floatation center.\n\nI felt firsthand what it was like to present myself in a room of strong people with preconceived notions about what does and doesn\u2019t work. Being a 23 year old kid with a dream and an unproven concept looking for $300,000 tested my selling skills.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, even when you don\u2019t achieve a result you originally set out to achieve, you can often end up better off afterwards than if you had gotten the result in the first place. The process taught me that I didn\u2019t want to have to use other people\u2019s money. It taught me a lot about business and a lot about how to go about starting one. It taught me what was important and what wasn\u2019t. I learned a ton from every professional I had conversations and advanced my understanding greatly. It also taught me that it was important to work with what I already had.\n\nMy biggest lesson from Float Hub\n\nFind a business that didn\u2019t require massive amounts of startup capital. And with my new wisdom I took off again into the world. I realized also that I didn\u2019t want a business that would become a job. Something that would trap me once I started it. After visiting Vietnam and having renewed aspirations for travel I for sure didn\u2019t want to be tied down to some physical location I had to manage day in and day out. And in a town I am now so grateful to have moved away from.\n\nThe process was beautiful. I had so much fun pursuing these businesses and learning from the process I never felt like a failure when one of them ended for a period of time. I have no doubt that float hub will come back in some form in the future, but I couldn\u2019t be much happier with where putting that project on the side burner has allowed me to get in my life.\n\nThe next big thing(s)\n\nAs float hub ran into difficulties with funding I set out with new intentions. I needed a business that would align with my passions but could be started on sweat equity with very little money so I wouldn\u2019t have to rely on anyone else. I also began to realize that I didn\u2019t want to have to start over every day. I wanted to build a snowball that would began to roll downhill. Something I could put time into once but would pay me again with little or no maintenance. I found the term \u2018passive income.\u2019 I was in love.\n\nPassive income could be earned in a variety of ways I would come to find out. In visiting local entrepreneur meet-ups I was introduced to Nate who seemed to have his hand in more different streams of passive income than I could begin to wrap my mind around. The guy seemed to know everything there was to know about the internet.\n\nHe talked to me about outsourcing, SEO, building websites, affiliate marketing, PPC Advertising and finding leads. I searched his wisdom for an Idea I could put into action. After our second time meeting for coffee we had the idea to start \u2018Live Optimized.\u2019\n\nIt was to start as a website and a book series. We would attract an audience and provide them with affiliate products to purchase and monetize the traffic with Google AdWords. It was BRILLIANT!\n\nI went to work on testing the concept. Nate made the website and took care of the SEO stuff. I had been playing with a blog previously but this would give me a platform to further develop my writing. I remembered when I first started listening to philosopher notes with Brian Johnson. I was thinking about how cool it was that he just reads books for a living and makes summaries to share them with people. And how he was crushing it.\n\nI look back at this moment with fond memories. I realize how this experience set the groundwork for everything I am doing now. Nate walked me into the world holding me by the hand and since it has been up to me to figure the whole thing out.\n\nI\u2019m still soaking up the lessons from Live Optimized\n\nIt set me on my current course. After our live optimized website went down I realized how important it was to learn the web design and SEO skills myself. I was able to both outsource books and release them myself. I grew in my skills of content writing and spent months rewriting copy to learn copywriting. I began to explore the online world pretty ferociously. Each skill continues to build upon the other skills.\n\nI outsourced books, software, data scraping and ran an overseas call center that cold called leads for different companies. I\u2019ve gotten commission checks from Amazon, Google AdWords and clickbank. I created YouTube videos, started a podcast, made websites, grew followings on blogs and social media and experimented with SEO. I love how I spend my time. Every day I write content, build websites and tinker with things like UAV\u2019s and 3D printing. I\u2019m able to meditate, workout, eat healthy and enjoy my relationships.\n\nI continue to teach myself new skills and expand my abilities. I learned how to edit graphics with Photoshop, edit video with Vegas pro and I\u2019m currently teaching myself CAD using Solid Works. I continually get better at turning my ideas into reality.\n\nI may not have accomplished all of my goals yet, but I don\u2019t believe I ever will. You don\u2019t go on vacation in order to arrive back home again, and you don\u2019t become an entrepreneur just to have a business. It\u2019s the process of becoming that is enjoyable. It\u2019s the huge leaps and bounds of progress you see yourself making along the way.\n\nSetback after setback helps you to refine what your goals are. Each experience providing you with a new level of wisdom you can apply to your later pursuits. Sticking true to my intentions, never letting up on my goal. I know now, with more clear a head than ever before, the only way I will fail is if I stop trying.\n\nWhat are some of the best lessons you've learned perusing entrepreneurship?!\n\nFor the complete story with picture visit here: http:\/\/traviseric.com\/entrepreneurship\/","120":"Google Play 25$ Looking for Amazon 25$","121":"I will be trading PayPal for Amazon all day.

Between both jobs I pull in about 70k\/yr in the Tampa\/FL area. My wife is a special needs teacher and makes abut 32k\/yr. There are a few other, smaller, and infrequent sources of income (wife takes a job over the summer, etc). All in all, after taxes, we deposited 96k last year in our bank account (take home pay).\n\nWe are debt free except for the house - no credit cards, car payments, student loans, etc. We have 24k cash in the bank as an emergency fund (just finished), about 10k in retirement (Too low, I know), and about 50k equity in our house.\n\nNow that our emergency fund is complete we are planning on \"balls-to-the-wall'ing\" it on retirement and investments. Our current monthly budget looks like this:\n\nTake home pay from all sources:\n\n$6614.00\n\nTotal monthly expenses are as follows:\n\nCars - $430\/mo (includes gas and repair allowance... cars are over a decade old)\nFood - $1000\/mo (includes eating out and groceries)\nEntertainment - $250\/mo\nShopping (clothes, random items, Amazon, etc) - $250\/mo\nBills (Insurance, Cell, Internet, Electric, Water, Term Life Insurance, HOA, Mortgage, Health Insurance, Car Insurance, lawn care) - $2005.69\n\nTotal: $3935.69\n\nSpecial savings ($300\/mo towards new car... mine is a 2002 and hers is a 2007... $200\/mo set aside to repair the roof\/ac when they go, $100\/mo to keep our emergency fund ahead of inflation, and $250\/mo towards an annual vacation):\n\nTotal: $850.00\n\nOther expenses (counseling for anxiety, etc):\n\nTotal: $160.00\n\nAfter all is said and done, we deposit about $600\/mo into my 401k (company matches 25% up to 15%) and $1000\/mo towards our Roth IRA's.\n\nTotal Savings: $1600.00\n\nHere are my concerns:\n\nI feel like I am wasting my life in AC sales. I am currently teaching myself how to develop games in Unity for the Oculus Rift, but coding in C or Javascript is something that takes time and patience to learn, and with 2 jobs and a baby on the way I don't feel like I have a lot of either. I was diagnosed with adult ADHD and take Adderall very infrequently (usually when I have time to hunker down and study stuff), and it helps, but I don't feel like I am making progress fast enough. I wonder sometimes if I should sell my business and quit my job and go find something with upward mobility. I also worry all the time about where we are financially. It's been my dream to retire early, but I feel like I am way behind for someone my age and struggling to catch up.\n\nI read a lot of financial blogs and books (MMM, Kiyosaki, Ramsey, Stanley, etc), but I still feel lost when it comes to picking investments and what I can reasonably expect from those investments. Right now I am just throwing everything into Vanguards S&amp;P index fund (on the advice of Warren Buffet), but that has a historical rate of return of what... 5.4% after inflation? How am I going to retire early on that starting at 34?\n\nI feel like $70k\/yr is above average in my area, but I don't feel like its enough to get to where we need to be. Having no debt and housing costs around 12% of our take home pay (year, our mortgage is $776\/mo, PITI), I feel like we should be moving faster than we are. Am I being unreasonable in my expectations? \n\n","139":"[H] \u00a315 GBP iTunes. [W] Steam \/ Amazon \/ Google Play \/ Paypal","140":"Hello guys.

However, I have more than doubled what I made since my last post! :)  Two days ago I found a dress that I bought on LikeTwice (one of my go to websites for flipping clothes along with eBay, ThredUp, and Rue La La) for $10 and sold it on eBay for $800! :) There have been a lot of other things that I have bought and made a $100-$400+ profit off of. It takes a lot of work researching and going through sites to find worthwhile things but it obviously pays off. All you need is a little starting cash, dedication, research, and to know your way around Google. I know a lot of flippers also like to use Amazon which I have been considered branching out into.\n\nI would suggest either opening an eBay store if you get serious or do FBA.\n\nThe best places to flip clothes that I have found are LikeTwice, ThredUp, eBay (especially auctions -- a lot of people will post a high value item with a bad picture and it will sell for very little. If you just take the time to find a stock photo or take a better picture of the item yourself, you can resell for 5-10x what you bought it for), Gilt, Ideel, and Rue La La. Pick a couple of brands that you are somewhat familiar with and stick to buying\/reselling them until you gain more experience.\n\nI have a part time job but flipping is actually becoming more lucrative, especially with the more experience I am gathering.\n\nHas anyone else found anything that has turned from casual beer money into one of your main sources of income? Also, are there any other beer money-ers who flip? What's your experience been like?\n\nHere's a [link](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/beermoney\/comments\/2kl0do\/my_edited_guide_to_earning_money_and_free_things\/) to my past post that has led me to flipping. It lists a bunch of ways to earn free things! :) If you're in a pinch, it definitely will help get you going in the right direction.\n\nHere's also a [link](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/beermoney\/comments\/2pdiiz\/for_anyone_looking_for_a_relatively_easy_work_at\/) my previous post on flipping!

Fortunately, my current total utilization is $0. Also, Credit Karma shows my score as 778.\n\nSo, is it worth changing Amex cards for the benefits package that better suits my spending patterns?

Spending money on a cleaning service or housekeeper is something I am willing to splurge on.  I think I've hit on a decent strategy, but I'm interested if anybody can think of anything I've missed.\n\nObviously, though, might as well get this service as cheaply as possible.  This is a service that appears to price discriminate a ton and I've been doing well by a three-pronged strategy:\n\n1) Constantly 'trying' new sites, as most offer a first time customer discount.  Most will do it even more cheaply if you sign up for a weekly cleaning.  Do so, then cancel after the cleaning.  Make it clear that this isn't your cleaner's fault, just say something like a weekly cleaning isn't in the budget.  \n\n2) The various discounting services have deals fairly often-- at least in my neck of the woods, Amazon Local appears to run specials fairly regularly.  \n\n3) The old standby of signing up for the email lists and waiting for a discount to roll in works here as well.\n\nI've thought about hiring cleaners off Craigslist and the like, but this seems more risky-- anybody have good luck with that?","248":"Amazon back in stock on these Funko POP Disney TNBC Zero Vinyl Figures @ $10.99 ...

I'm actually not involved in this process; my bf and his parents are working together to help him get a good rate, get the loan under his name, and help us make the down payment.\n\nWe're not married and we don't have a joint account. I make $30k and he makes $50k. We've been together for a decade, the later half was spent living together in an apartment. We decided to go for a house because the rent went up dramatically in the last 2 years. \nSadly, I'm the one with student loans, which is currently at $70k (ugh). I applied for IBR a few months ago and that dropped my monthly payments from $650 to $133. Despite that, I'm still paying nearly the same amount to pay off the loans one at a time. \n\nAside from paying my half for the rent for our current apartment ($417.50 of $835) and for gas (ranging from $20 to $45), he's been covering a majority of the bills, such as Internet ($150), Streaming (about $30), Amazon Prime ($99 annually), Power (ranging from $35 to $90, depending on the weather). We split on groceries and take turns in paying for restaurants or entertainment. We pay for our own phone bills, health insurance, car insurance, and vet care for our kitties. Being frugal (at least on my side) allows me to set aside enough cash weekly for my emergency fund.\n\nMy priority is taking care of MY debt first. My BF used to have student loans but thanks to an inheritance, he is happily debt free and I don't want to burden him with paying for my loans. We'll eventually have to share it when we get married (which is a whole other tax issue). I just hope I'm on the right track.","253":"[H] $5 Amazon GC [W] $4.50 Paypal","254":"[H] $50 Best Buy gift card [W] Paypal Amazon","255":"[H] $5 Amazon GC [W] $4.50 Paypal","256":"[H] $12 Best Buy [W] $10 Amazon","257":"[H] $66 Amazon [W] Paypal","258":"http:\/\/www.frys.com\/product\/8033214\n\nAmazon Sales Rank #2,531","259":"I have $66 Amazon GC looking for paypal \n\nrep - http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2lq6v0\/utribescend_gcx_rep_profile\/","260":"First time doing this need to buy a item quickly off Amazon.","261":"(H) Amazon Gift Code $50 (2x25) (W) PayPal\/Google Wallet at 90% (22.5 each or 45 for both)","262":"H Amazon Gift Code W PayPal\/Google Wallet","263":"[H] Amazon Gift Code 2x25 [W] PayPal\/Google Wallet at 90%","264":"[H] Amazon [W] PayPal or Google Wallet","265":"[H] $5 Amazon GC [W] $4.50 Paypal","266":"Have two $25 Amazon Gift Cards, Want PayPal\/Google Wallet at 85%\nWill trade first with Experienced Traders","267":"Venmo is preferred but I also accept Paypal and Google Wallet.

It's like a virtual garage sale. A better version of Craigslist -- you have to be fast, but you can see how many other people are inquiring. I've sent some low offers to give myself some margin, and succeeded.\n\nWhat are thoughts on flipping back into the group -- NOT with the same items, but similar items?\n\nFor example, I purchased a phenomenal Wii bundle (15 games, accessories, awesome) that I originally intended to flip on eBay. I purchased a Wii mini bundle from someone in this group a few days ago.\n\nIs it a no-no to try flip the Wii (non-mini) bundle back into the group? That is, would you worry about the Mini seller being like \"WTF?\" or being outed as a flipper... or maybe they don't care? Or risking that the Craigslist person is also in this group and sees their items at a higher price than they took?\n\nIt's tempting to sell in person due to 1. ebay\/pp fees, 2. shipping, 3. risk of someone saying the console doesn't work once it gets there, etc. I'd net about $50 more going offline with this flip.\n\nThere are no specific rules against flipping. I just don't want to piss off a bunch of soccer moms that are also a decent source of items for me if that makes sense. In short, is it better to just source items to flip on eBay\/Amazon or do I risk flipping back into the group at a profit.","275":"Amazon Canada: Canadian version of fbatoolkit.com?","276":"[H] $20 Amazon GC [W] $16 PayPal\n\nI  have 20$ worth of amzon.com giftcards in different amounts $3,$5 etc etc but it equal up to $20.\n\nMy GCX (REP)\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2ozbbm\/ubigsapo602_gcx_rep_profile\/\n\nDO NO PM ME IF YOU DID NOT POST IN THIS THREAD, I WILL NOT RESPOND BACK AND REPORT YOUR ACCOUNT AS SUSPICIOUS POTENTIAL SCAMMER!","277":"[H] 5$ Amazon Code [W] 90% Paypal","278":"[H] $55 Amazon GC [W] $46 PayPal","279":"[H] Venmo [W] Amazon gift card at 90%","280":"[H] $5 Amazon GC [W] $4.50 PayPal","281":"[H] AMAZON 73$ [W] PAYPAL $65","282":"[H]$10 Amazon GC [W] $8 PayPal","283":"Hey \/r\/flipping, I need a more experienced flipper's perspective as to why an ebay'er may be utilizing multiple accounts to purchase items off of me.\n\nI have only recently been using ebay to flip - using Amazon for the majority of my sales. About a week ago I started placing my wrestling DVD collection for sale. I started off with a small chunk of my collection. Five of them to test the market, all sold as BIN. That evening two sold. When I went to print the shipping labels for the DVDs I noticed the ebayer was the same person\/address that purchased both DVDs. On my ads I encouraged people to combine orders to save on shipping for them and myself. He made no attempt to get such a discount. So I contacted him to offer the discount, at this time I saw an opportunity to make another sale. I explained the saving on combined shipping, and also offered to send him a list of my complete inventory as I hadn't had the time to post it yet. He agreed and got back to me after viewing the list and requested to purchase 11 additional DVDs from the collection. He made it clear he only wanted these specific DVDs of the lot. Awesome! \n\nSo, I created a specific auction for all the 11 DVDs at a very discounted price, as well subtracting the discount he would have received from the other 2 DVDs he purchased earlier (subtracted a portion of the BIN price and the entire shipping price) when I created this new auction. It was set BIN and he does so. Print off his shipping address and ship it off (2 original DVDs &amp; the 11 DVD lot) all in one shipment. \n\nNow this is where things start going awry. When I go to leave feedback for his account I take a closer look at his account name. They're all different accounts with the same shipping address. They are all what look like randomly generated text ie. \n* tic_ejd9384 \n* tic_tpff_394749 \n* tic_39er837\n\nIt felt very odd but I let it slide as we had very good communication beforehand so I didn't have much reason to think too much of it. Maybe a stupid rookie move, but I tend to blindly put faith into others until proven wrong. That and the DVDs were already shipped.\n\nFast forward to tonight, after more DVDs have gone up for sale since (from the same list he's looked at before). He purchases two more. Once again with two different accounts, yet same shipping name and address. \n\nShould I be concerned that a scam is incoming? Do I confront him? If it's all good and not to worry about it, do I combine the shipping or just send the two DVDs as separate shipments? Fortunately, all our conversation has taken place on eBay, and I have made very sure that the shipping names and addresses are exactly the same. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated guys, thank you very much for your time. \n\n  ","284":"[H] Venmo [W] Amazon gift card","285":"$10 Amazon.com GC (in form of 2x $5 GC's) for $9 Paypal.

It's hard to know about every genre, that's why it's good to concentrate on a few. Before you buy a book, look it up online and see what price range it's selling for, then you'll know if it's worth buying. Also, if you go to Amazon and you find a million copies, put it back and find the book where there's only a handful available, then it'll probably be worth selling. thats my 2 cents... good luck!","364":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I think they are under a lot of pressure and have some core issues that will be difficult to overcome.    \n\nThe latest market share numbers have Windows Phone dropping 20% in market share going from 3.6% to 2.9%.   Here is a link.  http:\/\/www.idc.com\/prodserv\/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp\n\n\nOne data point and some additional thoughts I have previously posted but fits.\n\n\n1) MS has completely loss the youth. All my kids now use Chromebooks at school and they all do their documents on Google Docs. Yes, big enterprises will take a long time to change but more and more startups will be using Google solutions, IMO. BTW, the youth are our future :). It would be difficult for MS to win back schools. It actually is not about price but rather Google has a much better solution.\n\nTalk to some kids. Having a Outlook or Hotmail email address is not hip. Check out your own kids. Has any of them previously had a MS email address and now have a Gmail account? This actually happen a few years ago. I have 7 kids, I know pretty crazy, zero have a MS email account. They all have a Gmail account and older ones also have their .edu account. They did this completely on their own.\nBTW, to a certain extent email is somewhat dead for kids but when they must I have noticed it is Gmail. Even Yahoo! is not hip.\n\n2) .NET is dead. Very little native development on Windows desktop. Has not happen for a pretty long time. Big problem with .NET is that not as well supported in cloud by Amazon, Google, Heroku, etc. There is so little proprietary Windows development happening. Pretty incredible when you compare to 15 years ago. But quietly it has completely ended.\nHead winds is that proprietary is dead including the associated margins. Nothing is going to change this. You have to change model. Huge hit to MS in changing models with little going for them with any new models. Who visits any MS sites? I never do. My kids don't.\n\n3) MS is debating on offering Windows 10 for free? Free consumers? etc. Any which way this is pressure on pricing and MS loses. I can not imagine anyone thinks Windows 10 is offense. It is completely defense. Just try to slow it down. No one is going to switch from Apple or Google to Windows. But a lot more the other direction.\n\n4) I have not seen MS gain traction in anything new. Only see spending\n tons and tons of money. If they are going to get less in Office and operating systems the shortfall has to be made up somewhere. Cloud is going to be high capital investment with low margins returns for a very, very long time. I believe MS has to have a couple of new wins. Just do not see it happening.\n\n5) Continued pressure on the brand. Kids across the world were cussing out MS over Christmas. Who in this day and age has their network down for 24+ hours? How are you going to win cloud when you have such a high profile failure? MS thinking of changing name of IE or running away. They have huge brand issues and this affects everything, hiring, partnerships, etc.\n\n6) We have lots of places for computer interactions today. Quick list 1) Desktop 2) Smart phones 3) Wearables 4) Tablets 5) Cars 6) TVs 7) IoT beyond wearables\nI can not see MS making ground in any of these areas. Looks like the players are already set.\n\n7) MS has too many old tech engineers. Yes, they have some of the correct engineers but more than a competitor like Google of the wrong kind. The future is Java, JavaScript, Linux, Node, Angular, NoSQL, Open source, etc. Plus, they do not get the top engineers any longer. They go to Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.\nThis entire .NET going open source is such a jump the shark move. It does not mean anything. MS themselves are running away from their own back-end. They paid for Node.js to be ported.\n\n8) Baggage, baggage, baggage. All over the place.\n\nI want to stress that MS is not going to fail overnight and it will not be sudden. They also have the luxury to use financial engineering to hide reality. aka. IBM. Plus there will be many pundits that do not want to face reality and will continue to support MS. \n\nMy experience has been people are not comfortable with tech change and tend to put their head in the sand and say it is not happening. I have seen it over and over again over the last 30 years. It will be completely over for some technology and people will honestly believe it will come back. It is so much better than what else is available it just has to come back. The world changed from a square peg to a round peg and MS is a square peg.\n\nTo me they will be a carbon copy of IBM over the last decade.\n\n","389":"Buy packaging tape, bubble wrap and brown paper.

I had my not-yet-wife look at various settings, etc - it seems crazy to spend so much money without getting some feedback. For several years I actually felt somewhat bad for not spending just a bit more money on a bigger diamond as many of my female friends who also recently got married were sporting much larger rocks.

She normally now does not wear any rings, but sometimes she will wear a fake diamond crazy sparkly ring she bought off Amazon.com that looks like the one she received from  me - but I think its like a $20 ring and the \"diamond\" is crazy big and yet people somehow think its real.

It's an amazing service. The ability to get more content, at a significantly cheaper price, without ads means this model will eventually replace traditional cable.\n\n2. They are entirely dependent on major networks never being able to get their shit together. Similar to iTunes the only reason Netflix exists is because major content producers have an incredibly hard time working together to provide all of their content in one place. At first they were happy to provide content to Netflix at rock bottom prices but they will continue to charge significantly more as Netflix grows in size and scope. That's why Netflix is starting to produce its own content.\n\n3. I am far from sold that Netflix will continue to operate unopposed in this lucrative space. Already you're starting to see competitive offerings from HBO, Amazon, ESPN and I think that traditional networks are likely to follow in due course. \n\nIt couldn't definitely end up being a massive home run but it's entirely dependent on how set major network producers are in their old ways. It's just too speculative for me.","434":"Not that your contribution is worth a hot damn.

We do this to optimize the placement of your products throughout our fulfillment network. Optimizing placement is beneficial for these reasons:**\n\n&gt;**When your products are located in multiple fulfillment centers, it means that they are closer to customers. Order cut-off times for Prime and expedited shipping can be extended by as much as three hours, so your offers will more likely be available for last-minute orders in more locations.\nProducts can be available for sale to customers sooner than if you shipped them to one fulfillment center, and we then transported them to other fulfillment centers.**\n\n&gt;**The impact of regional and local events on your products will be reduced. Events, such as snowstorms, flooding, and earthquakes can disrupt transportation in a region or local fulfillment center. Having your inventory in multiple locations during these events increases our ability to ship orders to customers on time.**\n\n&gt;**We give you the option to ship all units of a given product to one fulfillment center for Amazon to distribute throughout the network for a fee. You are still required to send certain types of products to specific fulfillment centers, but you would not have to split shipments at the unit level.**\n\nChrist the guy doesn't even understand how shipments work.\n\n&gt;They must have a massive need for orthopedic pacifiers in campbellsville kentucky then because I just sent 5000 of them there.\n\nHe's using the fucking phone app (supposedly) to create his shipments and when asked if he's using inventory placement;\n\n&gt;I dont think so.

I know I sound like a broken record on here, but it's hard to beat an allocation to ITOT, IXUS and AGG as a solid portfolio (or other equivalencies with varying brokerages).  You can change your \"aggressiveness\" based around your exposure to equities, or perhaps make sector (e.g. add some biotech if that's what drew you TWCUX) or cap size bets (e.g. pump up the small caps).  \n  \nAs others have pointed out, there's nothing inherently \"right\" about indexed products like I've suggested, nor is there anything particularly wrong about them.  I believe there are investments which are suitable for varying levels of involvement... if you're \"hands on\" and like to do some research, you can go more granular: biotech, pharma, oil, etc. or perhaps even down to the individual company level.  Or you can can be more passive and stick to indexing.

Do you have $75?\n\nNot going with 50 sorry it's not a good deal for me. \n","471":"&gt; Add in some spices, which is a true investment as they're a bit pricey, and you can make decently tasty and healthy meals that cost 1\/3 or even 1\/4 of what you would pay eating out.\n\nSo those jars of basics like powdered garlic, onion, paprika, etc that you probably just spent $4ish for 2 oz each? Yeah instead of considering that an investment in the spices, consider it an investment in the jars you can refill. \n\nEthnic grocers are a great source for extremely low cost bulk spice. There are many good deals on Amazon too ([example](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mediterranean-Gourmet-Ground-Cumin-Ounce\/dp\/B0095FB2NU\/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421153015&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=cumin))\n\nOnline sites like http:\/\/www.thespicehouse.com\/spices\/ have very high end spices still at a fraction of the cost of grocery chains, especially when you consider the fact that they're so much fresher and more potent that you don't need to use nearly as much for just as much flavor (but better flavor). They also have _amazing_ options you wouldn't normally see at a chain grocer: blends (like sriracha powder), single powders (like tomato powder), and variants (like roasted garlic powder in addition to white garlic powder).  \n\nIf you have a local [Penzeys](http:\/\/penzeys.com\/) then check that out as another source of high quality spices. They'll have a lot of jars out that are reasonable for their quality, but they'll also have bulk\/bagged spices that are a great deal. \n\nThere are a couple tricks. The first is to buy quantities you can get through in a reasonable amount of time. Spice powders are like coffee grounds, they start off great, quickly deteriorate into \"still pretty good\" territory, but eventually they'll just be flavorless. \n\nThe second trick is to make sure you match what you buy with what you cook. It's very easy to go crazy when every individual bag is cheap. I do very little baking with spices, for instance. 90+% of my dishes are based on garlic and onion (both of which I use fresh and supplement with powder), paprika, cumin, and pepper powders. Then I have lesser amounts of spices like turmeric, fenugreek, (china) ginger, coriander, and some warming spices (not a completely list). I would be an idiot to buy a bunch of dried parsley and basil because it will go dead LONG before I use it (setting set aside any debate about the wisdom of when if ever to use dried herbs, just an illustration)\n\nStore your bulk bags in a cold, dark place and refill small the small containers you paid top dollar for. If you're just getting started or need better quality bottles I recommend checking out a site [like this](http:\/\/www.specialtybottle.com\/clearfrenchsquaresmi.aspx). I recently took some Christmas money and bought a couple cases of glass spice bottles and built a couple oak trays that neatly fit the jars and my cupboards so I can easily pull out the spice equivalent of a painter's pallet while I cook and absolutely love it. \n\nYou can get into this in a pretty financially neutral manner or save a bit of money in direct terms (build up much higher quality spices for similar money, or just save money for similar quality) but having better flavor in your cupboard means you'll more easily make high quality food at home which means you'll eat at home more and of course that's where tremendous savings really pile on. \n\nWe very rarely eat out anymore in large part because we have absolutely no desire to pay 5x the cost to go to a restaurant and eat food that's absolute crap compared to what we can season &amp; smoke or grill at home. Spices like the ones I mentioned above will take you to Creole, Mexican, Indian, Thai, or many other flavors depending on ratio and supplementary spices. \n\nThanks for bringing up investment in spices - I think it's a huge part of sustainable, enjoyable eating and while dried spices may not make for 5 star dining they can be a huge factor in regular dining at home which is, for many of us, the largest area of our budget we can really save money on or not based on day to day decisions.

I've had the Oster Fast Feed (model 76023-510) for a few years now. Use it about once every month or two and it's been great. Was about $50 when I bought it, I see $54.22 today on Amazon. \n\nThey've been great. Not to heavy to hold up, feel really sturdy\/strong. Nice buzz sound but nothing too loud (sometimes a complaint with Wahls). Little pricier than others but I feel like they'll last me forever and they've already paid for themselves.

I want to move to FBA, but only have about 2 dozen items to send in. \n\nIs there a minimum of items to send in? How many do you typically send in at once? I've been trying to gather a few more items before I list everything and send it in, but I'm getting antsy.","504":"Was gonna write this but see it's here already! Plus it can look really cool. \n\nIf you do find the new mattress you're inheriting doesn't help, I'd highly recommend the Signature Sleep mattresses from Amazon. The 8-inch Full is only $180 ($213 for a Queen) and it's one of the best mattresses I've slept one. Way better than the foam Ikea ones that are in the $300s.\n\n","505":"Yes it definitely depends on the product.  It depends on the prices you can get compared to other sites, as well as how big the item is.  For pretty much anything bigger than a DVD it will be cheaper to ship using FBA than yourself.  However fees are higher on Amazon than eBay and anything else for most products, particularly video games and books.  Of course, for most of these products you can also get away with charging a much higher price.  Utilize Amazon's FBA revenue calculator and do research comparing the different ways to sell!","506":"* If it's something you have multiple of and don't want to deal with shipping individually.\n\n* If it's an item that no one else (or very few others) are selling FBA.

Even if it sits in Amazon's warehouse for two months, it'll cost you like $0.10.","507":"It was disheartening me also, but the it's already been 2 months and it felt like no time with only checking in here and there.

You would get the Amazon code pretty much instantly with how fast they have replied to my emails.","508":"No, you can ship them 1 item if you want, or you can ship them 10, or 20.  There might be an upper limit but I don't know what it is.\n\nHere's the deal though- you will save money by shipping as many items together as you want.  When you ship your items to Amazon, you get to take advantage of their heavily discounted UPS rates.\n\nNow let's say you have 1 item you are shipping out and it weighs 1 pound.  It may cost you $3.50.  Now let's say a week later you ship out 3 items and the box weighs 3 pounds.  It may cost $5 to ship.  Had you shipped them together it may have cost $5.50 or something like that.  **TL;DR- when dealing with Amazon's heavily discounted UPS rates, the price difference between a 3 and 4 lb box is negligible.**  Therefore you want to try to send out as many items as possible in as few shipments as possible.\n\nObviously if you are dealing with pricier items this means less.  If all of your items are selling for $75, then you may not care about a lost $3-4 in profit margin.  If you are shipping in a bunch of $25 items, then $3-4 becomes a more important % of your margin.","509":"[Here's](http:\/\/www.thefryecompany.com\/made-in-usa-womens\/l\/601) frye's own list of women's made in the USA stuff.  \n\nBy the way, you can often find fryes much cheaper than list price on Amazon, Zappos, and 6pm, all of which have good return policies.","510":"No problem there are two ways to get a balance from one person amazon to another.\n\n* Kindle Trick -- I send you a kindle Ebook and instead of you accepting it, you reject it and get the value of the Ebooks.\n\n[Instructions on redeeming kindle books as Amazon Giftcard Balance by Brokemember](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/DAySX)\n\n(also see [Instructions on Sending Amazon balance via Kindle Trick by LinkandLuke](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MasLU) )\n\n* Prime Trick - I send you a year of amazon prime, but you already have amazon prime, so they give you the 99 dollars instead.\n","511":"Is this an unredeemed gift card or already-redeemed Amazon balance?","512":"Did he ask for your Amazon email address?","513":"May be worthwhile to buy the hardcopy on Amazon and then re-sling it.

They are not like in the US where they're likely to be more expensive. They tend to be cheaper than hotels and nicer than hostels. When I was there, I was alone so this might differ, the owners would introduce me to other travelers too. En suite = attached bath.\n\nWherever you stay, full English breakfast is great. Ham (more like Canadian bacon), eggs, beans, etc etc. :)\n\nNo public water fountains. Buy your own bottled water. \n\nCall your credit cards and bank to let them know you're traveling to they don't out a fraud freeze in your accounts. Confirm your cards will work overseas (I think this is less of an issue these days, but it's a big pain as I found out). Change at least some currency before you leave. It's more about being able to pay for things as soon as your airplane lands than it is about exchange rates. Unless you live in a major metro (like NY), call around a find out which local banks can exchange money. Not all banks can and some have to order it, so it can take a few days or a week. Don't leave this for last minute. If your personal bank can't then you may have to pay a service fee to get it done at a bank where you don't have an account.\n\nBefore getting in a cab, ask the cabbie how much it will cost to take you to your destination. They should honor it even if it costs more. I don't know if this is still true but my flat landlord told me about this and it worked. Personally, I found a cab worth it in London for rides from the train station to the hotel. I could have used the underground but noticed there weren't always escalators and I had way too heavy luggage to want to lug that up all those stairs. \n\nI wouldn't rent a car in someplace like London, but if you're driving around the country then I'd rent a car. It's not that the trains aren't great, but I prefer the freedom and independence of being in charge of my own transportation. Whether walking or driving, keep in mind that cars are on the other side of the road. **It is very, very easy to step out as a pedestrian and almost get hit because you're not expecting a car from that direction.**\n\nFinally, pack as light as possible. You aren't going to some remote village in the Amazon, if you forget something you will be able to buy it over there if necessary. And don't forget the power converter for your electronics.

American Heritage, much like National Geographic, usually isn't worthwhile to sell unless you can sell complete runs (eg, every publication from the 1960's).\n\nFor older books, the best money is in religious and specialty nonfiction topics (medical, science, that sort of thing). General literature, poetry, etc can be good, but only under certain circumstances (first publications, unique printings, etc).\n\nEbay would be the best place to sell them.

Basically guaranteed you get what is described, super quick, free shipping, and all the stuff was included. Saved about $30.\n\n- I saved my PS3 and one controller, but brought in all the games, controllers, and other accessories, with the exception of one or two party games.

It's less than $10 a month ($10\/mo when purchasing month by month, larger time discount of a couple dollars\/mo). I haven't purchased ANY games for the PS4, and only received a couple as Xmas gifts. I just download all the free ones. There's also a couple always-free MMOs on it. The reason I said to keep the PS3 is that you can also get free games for the PS3, and PS+ is much better for the PS3 right now (way more games, and they change it more regularly, partially due to sheer number of games that have been made). Switching between keeps it pretty fresh. You can also keep the games and play them long after the \"month\" they're free is over, so there's no rush to finish them -- just download them and let them sit if you like.\n\n- Keep an eye out at Best Buy and Walmart for a second controller. They're massively expensive, but if the packaging gets damaged, they'll usually get marked down. Most PS4 games are only online multiplayer, so you shouldn't need it immediately anyway.\n\n- Get a cheapo microphone should you find you need one. I personally just repurposed the earbud microphone that came with my old iPhone. Works just fine.\n\n- If you have any friends who have physical copies of games, wait until they're done with them and ask to borrow. I'm a frequent borrower, so I take a picture of the person holding the game and save it in my phone, then give them a picture of me holding it. Then I know the owner, and they know who's borrowing.\n\n- If you have a large library near you (or your state does inter-library loans), check to see if they carry any video games. It sounds like a stretch, but I've seen a few in cities. If you know they have some, search their database and put a hold on a game that you want; they'll call you when it's your turn.

For example, for my anatomy class last semester the textbook from the bookstore is $90 for a used copy. I bought a used copy, one edition older, for $7 including shipping on Amazon. It had the exact same information, same chapters, and I never struggled because I didn't have the newer book.

I wasted two weeks dragging my hand-sewn prototypes around all over the city before I jumped on a plane to Bali, where I had a finished commercial prototype done in 24 hours.\n\n2) Australia is too small a market - if you have a product idea, you really want to sell it in the US. Find someone to make it there and if they can't ship it, then use something like Fulfillment by Amazon or another fulfillment house you can ship it out of. About 75% of my customer base is from the US.\n\nDown the track, once you have it running commercially, then I'd look at China.\n\nSpecifically I'd recommend talking to either Carolina Textile District (A not for profit that puts people like you in touch with US manufacturers) or MakersRow.com, which is a business that sorta does the same thing. Both can put you in touch with companies that can do small qty.\n\nMy main reasons for US manufacturing are:\n\n1) Logistics - keeps my manufacturing close to my customers, which saves time and money\n\n2) Cost - US is a lot cheaper than Australia, and is on par with China these days. A lot of manufacturing is returning to the US\n\n3) Work Ethic - Americans work hard.\n\n4) Experience - These guys are using the latest techniques to produce products\n\n5) Communication - The timezones can be a bit challenging (my manf is 13 hours behind me), but is more than made up for it by speaking the same language\n\n6) Consumer trust - my customers like seeing \"made in USA\".","549":"Could you make a website like this?\n\nhttp:\/\/mybookbuyer.com\/cash-for-books\/\n\nYou'd need access to Amazon MWS, which I have.

I was selling some products that require specific type of images to be used. Someone reported one of my images and so I assumed that it was because of the content. I contacted Amazon right away and explained to them the issue, they told me that they didnt know why that my images were flagged. I asked them if I could talk to someone who knew, they said that there wasnt a phone number for those people. I guess its two different departments. So I ended up contacting the forums and got what I would consider harassed and trolled to the point I blocked their emails as spam. I ended up removing all my products and adding them one at a time while only adding images that I would consider as appropriate. After about 3 months of lost revenue, and a loss of all my products search terms and connections, I was able to fix the issue which was a off white background in one of my 10,000 images that I have.

This would mean buying gift cards for various merchants in advance of needing to purchase goods. For me, this could simply mean buying $500 worth of Whole Foods gift cards on a card to take out a chunk of a signup bonus spend requirement up front. Then, I'll just use the Whole Foods gift cards to purchase groceries over the next several months. You can do this with any merchant you are sure to use. For me, these include Whole Foods, Starbucks, Amazon, and a few others. A really easy way to do this generically could be to buy Visa\/MasterCard\/Amex gift cards as they work at every store that accepts those credit\/debit card brands. However, there are usually fees with these cards which is why I like to avoid them. \n\nAnother way to shift spend is to prepay your utilities such as cable or cell phone. Verizon Wireless will let you prepay up to $500. For me, this is an easy way to shift forward $500 worth of spend into one purchase up front that would have otherwise taken 6+ months to achieve. \n\nWith this method, the one thing you really need to watch out for is making sure you can afford the up front cost. You are essentially paying ahead for your everyday expenses in order to hit your signup bonus. This is really effective if you have the extra money and know you are going to spend the $2k over the course of say 6 months instead of 3 and would just like to accelerate it.

Unless you are selling a lot of nickel dime crap, it's best to use priority mail and just roll the cost of the selling price.\n\nOn Amazon it depends on how things are going to be fulfilled. If you are doing Merchant Fulfillment, in other words shipping it yourself, you will have the same problem if you don't ship quickly and Amazon will shut you down very quickly. The other Amazon sales channel is called FBA which is Fulfilled By Amazon in which you actually ship products into them and they store them and then pick pack and ship as needed. Obviously the shipping is out of your control after that point and you won't get any dings for shipping. Amazon fees are significant but the flipside is that it frees up a lot of your time and you don't have to deal with shipping or customer service, they do it for you.

I'll admit, some of the surveys can be pretty long for little pay.  The key is to keep checking r\/ HitsWorthTurkingFor and just do the ones that people post on there.  It's a legit site, the pay the money directly to your bank account, and the minimum withdrawal is only $1 (I think).  You know before you start a survey if you are qualified for it or not.

You may also want to consider PAID Traffic such as from Google Adwords. A lot of the time the exposure resulting from paid traffic can obtain you a few worthwhile backlinks. \nSpend some time contacting other website owners in your niche. Not necessarily competitors, but review sites, blogs, youtube reviewers, etc. See what you can do to obtain a backlink or some ad space from them. Sometimes just an introduction is enough to get a shout out of some sort. \n\nLastly, don't underestimate social media. Spend the time to get all of your social media pages dialed in.

ALL entrepreneurs have two things in common:\n\n1) At least 1 person (and probably many more) told them to give up this dream and go to work for a real company (which had been started by another entrepreneur who also followed #2)\n\n2) They didn't listen any of the Dreamkillers.\n\nPeople start clothing businesses every day and most of them fail, and a few succeed. The same could be said of restaurants, retailers, tech firms, software, etc. Everything, really. So what? \n\nSo you have actually done the hard part - you have a product. Most people never get that far. I haven't seen your designs, so maybe they suck, but let's move forward under the assumption that they are the product of a singular genius graphic artist. Now what to do?\n\nNow you have to bring your shirts and your customers together, and exchange money. This is actually easier today than it has ever been in the history of commerce. In the old days, if you were lucky, or talented, or connected, or all three, you might wrangle a distribution deal, but that's unlikely right out of the box. More likely you'd have to go from store to store begging them to carry your shirts, trying to negotiate payment up front but probably settling for consignment, and you'd have to nearly kill yourself to get paid. OR You'd start your own store, which was very expensive and risky.  Or you'd sell them at fairs, carnivals, flea markets, etc. (Shudder). \n\nToday, all you need is an Internet strategy. I would do at least four things - 1) Create a website, 2) set up an Amazon store, 3) Set up an eBay store, 4) Set up an Etsy store.  None of them cost much to get started, but they give you four different avenues to expose your products to different customers. As time goes on you can see what works best for you and concentrate your efforts there.\n\nOnce you have places for your customers to buy your shirts, you have to create those customers. That's trickier, and will take the most amount of work and time. Without seeing your shirts, i can't recommend a strategy, but let the designs lead you. If they are sports oriented, then go to sports forums and talk them up, and do the same if they are music oriented, Marijuana oriented, humorous, etc. There's a sub reddit for everything so introduce yourself and your product in the subs (if the mods will allow it). \n\nOne of the most important things you absolutely have to do is wear your shirts all day, everyday, and hand out cards listing your Internet storefronts to anyone who asks, heck, even if they don't ask. Leave the cards on the counter at pizza shops, head shops, book stores, etc. Give shirts to your friends and have them wear them and hand out cards. Do YouTube videos. Go to shows, concerts, clubs while wearing your shirts. Try to set up promotions with clubs and DJS to give away your shirts. Write a press release about the new young hotshot shirt designing entrepreneur in town and send it to every TV, newspaper, and magazine in town. \n\nYou must live, eat, breathe your shirts. Passion is the most valuable capital for any entrepreneur and it will often bridge financial and technological gaps. Be truly  passionate about your shirts and you will succeed where others have failed.\n\nGood luck, amigo.","609":"I used to use profit bandit, I currently use the Amazon seller app","610":"I added a few puzzle over the pass few days, and just do it via barcode scan. The few I've looked up have all had sell buttons on them. Does anyone have experience with selling puzzle?

For the most part, FBA is best as you don't have to store it and you can sell it for higher price. The exception is hot items, like hot toys during Christmas. I MFed some toys a couple of weeks before Christmas because if I tried to FBA them, they would have got there late and the price would've dropped. I'd stick to FBA with pretty much everything.\n\n2. yes, you are correct. You can fill boxes with whatever items you have. They have to have individual labels on the item. You can do it your self or Amazon will do it for .20 an item.\n\n3. I don't remember much about the tax interview, so you may want to see what Amazon says about it on their website. But if you can list things, you can probably sell them. You will owe fed. taxes on all profits you make and you are supposed to collect at a minimum your own state sales tax via a resale cert and tax ID. I suggest doing more reading on this and consult real life tax professionals as tax advice online is bad news.\n\nPretty much all FBA questions can be answered via Amazon's own FBA help pages and videos or a quick Google search.","612":"&gt;yes, you are correct. You can fill boxes with whatever items you have. They have to have individual labels on the item. You can do it your self or Amazon will do it for .20 an item.\n\nTo clarify, what kind of labels? Like, do I bubble wrap each individual item, then tape an index card on it saying whatever that product is? Or like actual labels with barcodes that show what it is? (And where do I get those?) \n\nAlthough I'll probably have them do it for me, it's nice to know my options!\n\n","613":"Amazon is essentially the largest online retailer in the world. With that comes a benefit of having your products seen by literally millions of people. That would be impossible for an individual or small company to duplicate. Amazon buyers are very loyal and frequently don't even bother shopping anywhere else because they trust Amazon and Amazon's A-Z guarantee. A large percentage of Amazon buyers are also Amazon Prime members which entitles them to free two-day shipping. This is the era of the Internet and the \"I want it now\" mentality. Amazon caters to exactly that. Buyers are willing to pay premium prices for that free two-day shipping and the excellent customer service that Amazon provides. Because of that mentality, you are very likely to be able to ask a significantly higher price for your products then you would on other platforms. I know I do and I get it.\n\nAmazon has two ways to sell; Merchant fulfilled and Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) While people do use the MF option and do their own shipping they are at a disadvantage because most prime members will not deal with a third-party seller when they have the option of using their Prime membership and buying directly from Amazon. There are other perks to being an FBA seller as well.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that Amazon charges significant fees, typically in the range of one third of the selling price when all is said and done. For this you get better exposure for your listings, Amazon handles storage, picking and packing, shipping and customer service.  Unless you've done a lot of eBay or other platform selling and doing your own fulfillment, you don't know how time-consuming all of those functions are. Being able to pass all of that off to Amazon and just concentrate on sourcing is a major benefit. Once you understand that fee load, you can start sourcing products with a higher ROI that will support it. Amazon is not really the place to dink around with five dollar items. If an item sells for $5 and costs you one dollar to buy, you will lose money. The saying is \"You make your money on the buy, not the sale.\"\nWhat that means is that if you are buying things for a dollar that only sell for $10, you are not going to make much money. If you're smart, you buy things for one dollar or two dollars that sell for $20 or more. This is something you can only determine through research when you are sourcing your products. There are numerous apps for a smart phone that help with this. Some are free, others cost up to $50 per month.\n\nShipping: You are essentially right about gathering a bunch of products together, labeling them, packing them up in a box and shipping to Amazon. Essentially, that's exactly what happens. Amazon is partnered with UPS and offers stupid cheap inbound shipping rates to the fulfillment center, typically one half or less of what you would pay if you're shipping on your own.\n\nTaxes are a complicated and confusing area. It is still very unclear, even to professionals as far as paying for and collecting sales tax in the various places your products will end up. (called \"Nexus\") This subject is something best addressed by a professional accountant or CPA.","614":"Please go read Amazon's FBA guides and watch their videos.

","618":"We've been in our apartment for three years and are just starting to make large decorating purchases. :)\n\nTake your time and look through pinterest, home blogs, or mags from the library to decide your decorating style. Watch sales online and garage sales\/flea markets this summer for good deals on solid furniture with a style you love. If you can find well constructed solid wood furniture cheaply it doesn't matter if it's painted an awful color. You can always strip that and refinish or paint it. Don't spend your money on cheap stuff that's going to fall apart in 6 to 12 months. \nI found our dressers over about 18 months at various garage sales and thrift shops. All of them were deals because of a mar in the finish or a broken leg. Easy fixes that didn't change the quality of the piece.\n\nMake an inspiration board for your home. Do you love a certain style? Modern? Cottage? Industrial? Formal? \nWhat sort of storage do you need? Do you have closet spaces or do you need a dresser or wardrobe with hanging spaces? Do you have appliances? Any current furniture or are you starting out empty handed? \nWhat is your budget? What do you want to spend? How far up are you willing to go? How quickly do you need to furnish? If you can wait and piece together your home slowly you can find better deals rather than buying everything right away. \n\nWrite out a list of things you NEED (a bed, dishes to eat off of etc). Have another list for things you WANT (pretty pillows, art for walls etc). And another list for things you you ADORE (and couldn't possibly justify buying on a budget).\n\nI think some of the best deals on beds\/mattresses can be found this time of year. (Sales start in November to clear out for new stock so maybe wait till next year if you can't find what you need yet)\n\nLook on Craigslist and Freecycle. Generally you don't want to purchase anything upholstered or fabric from someone you don't know (unless you can clean it thoroughly and inexpensively) but you can find *free* shelves and tv stands that people just want gone. Usually it's all cheap pressboard but it will keep your stuff organized until you can afford\/find something sturdy. Join some local facebook swap\/sale groups and watch on those too.\n\nOne of the best pieces of advice I got as a newlywed trying to figure how how to stock my kitchen was two parts: live with it and figure out what kinds of things you like to cook before purchasing any sort of extra gadgets. Start with the basics: a frying pan that can go into the oven, a pot with a lid and a steaming basket for pasta, potatoes, and veggies. A crockpot and a toaster oven can replace an oven and both can be found in a thrift shop for $5-10 each. We spent most of a year without an oven and it worked with just those two appliances! If you make lots of soups and smoothies I recommend a stick blender instead of a regular one. Easier to clean and it's my kitchen workhorse :) Secondly, buy plain white dishes from the thrift store. If something breaks you have no pattern that needs matching and tables in magazines are often styled with mismatched plates. I've grown to love the look in my own kitchen.\nAfter those things you'll need some cups or glasses and some silverware. You can get cheap ones at the thrift shop or dollar stores. If you have a bit more to spend Amazon sells quality stainless steel sets at a fraction of the cost from brick and mortar stores. (Walmart's are cheap too but the quality of metal was less when I purchased ours). \n\nDIY:\nThere are many tutorials online for diy art. Buy some old frames with canvas cheaply at a thrift store and paint some modern art to brighten your space!\nAna White's website has free plans for woodworking if you want to diy furniture. I got a circular saw and drill this year so I have plans for a table, two beds, a cat tree, and a set of shelves. There are plans for all sorts of things.\nMy favorite curtains are two flat sheets I found on clearance for 80 cents each (and they're no-sew because I hung them up using curtain clips). \n\nMy last piece of advice:\nONLY buy what you LOVE! Seriously. If you don't love it, don't buy it. Even if it is only twenty bucks. You'll regret it when you do find something you love.\n","619":"Millenials buy the shit out of tech companies who are some of the biggest and highest valuations in the world.

Removal orders have minimum fees &amp; they could be completely undamaged or at least always worth taking a look at.\n\nHad sold only new, sealed copies of a OOP video game thru FBA. Customer returned one, marked damaged, I pulled it. It was an open copy of the video game but when I opened it, tucked inside the case was a sales slip from another seller for a \"Like New\" copy of the same game. The buyer could have just made an error and returned the wrong item but most likely attempted to scam by returning a used item to keep the new copy at the used price &amp; they weren't smart enough to cover their tracks all the way. Either way, Amazon refunded me in full for the return.\n\nTL; DR: Pulling my FBA \"customer damaged\" item got me a refund of almost $100.","639":"&gt; Unless you're planning to spend that much on Amazon (for stuff you would have bought anyway), why would you do this??

I don't expect to spend anywhere near that on Amazon.\n\n&gt; Also, you should take another look at your withholding.

No minimum on orders!) pays for itself in my opinion.  \n\nI also really like the prime free music that comes with it.  It doesn't have nearly the amount of music as something like spotify, but it still has music I like and can download to my phone for no extra cost.  Also, if you're in a jam and need to order something QUICK, most prime eligible items can have overnight shipping for $4.  Most of the time you'll never use it, but when you forget to order a gift that you can't find in local stores, it's come in handy for me. \n\nAlso, considering your living situation, you might like their subscribe and save program.  This program will let you purchase a monthly (or bi monthly, or other iteration) recurring order of various items, such as groceries, cleaning supplies, and other goods you typically need to get on a regular basis.  By agreeing to a recurring order they'll lower the price by 5% or so.  Not much, but it's a little something.  \n\nIf you're unsure you wanna spend the money, maybe a best friend or family member would be interested in sharing an Amazon account? You can split the cost and everyone gets the prime benefits.  I have a couple friends that do it and it works ok for them.

To be honest, there are much better cards out there, like the Sallie Mae card suggested by \/u\/pwny_","659":"This was my first card, but I replaced it with Sallie Mae shortly after learning about it. Of course, if you spend more than $750 a month on Amazon, the Amazon rewards visa should be used for any amount above that to maximize rewards. \n\nEDIT: a number","660":"If you do quite a bit of online shopping (outside of Amazon), you could get extra points through the shopping portal. Essentially, you log in, browse the stores available and see their bonus amount (usually anywhere from 2x-5x points), click a link to the store's site, purchase whatever, and then you get \"bonus points\". Not every store is on there, but there's a solid collection. I use it for in-store pickup as well and it works. The points take 6-8 weeks to post, but say a $50 Staples purchase online (Staples is at 4x points right now) is suddenly 200 points. So now instead of needing to spend $200 for those points, you've only spent $50. So, your mileage may vary getting that extra 6k in points (remember, the min spend is $2k per card, so you're already netting, at min, 4k points)   \n     \nAlso, sometimes certain shops run promotions. I can get 1000pt through the Portal by filing my tax refund through Turbo Tax. I can also get 1000pt on a $30+ 1800flowers order.    \n     \n\"MS\" doesn't always have to cost money or just be shifting funds around. Think of tools for \"manufactured earn\", it will get you to CP a bit faster on top of normal things","661":"&gt; 1) The built in insurance\/fraud aspect\n\nThis is a complete and utter myth. Any bank-issued and credit card-backed debit card has the same or similar protections. Think of a stolen debit card number as someone forging checks under your name. The bank will refund you those costs and pursue legally the individual. \n\n&gt; 2) The flexibility it offers so I don't have to go overdrawn if I need something big fixing on the car at short notice, or I want something that is more than my disposable I'll have this month but can be covered next month easily. Whilst I have saving etc for these purposes I much prefer to live within my means using credit cards as a tool to achieve a balance of the peaks and troughs that come with every day life.\n\nIf you have a large-enough emergency fund you will be far less likely to need extra money for car repairs or other emergencies that have to be paid for immediately. Additionally I advocate that if there's a large non-emergency\/necessary purchase you can't purchase with cash now then it's not something you should be buying right now. If you will have the cash next month or next paycheck, why can't you wait until then to purchase it? If this purchase has been intended or planned for more than a few weeks, why haven't you been saving for it?\n\n&gt; 3) Better credit rating for using them. This used to be my number 1, but now I'm a house owner etc it's a bit of a moot point these days.\n\nIf you don't use credit cards and generally do not have debt, why do you need a credit rating? Buying a house is my only concern in this regard, but it IS possible, at least supposedly, to purchase a house with no credit rating (credit rating of 0, which is neither good nor bad, but contains no record of credit history)\n\n&gt;4) The points I get for spending on it which cover a high proportion of xmas present costs when I cash them in for Amazon vouchers.\nI've never paid a penny of interest on credit cards, and I pay no monthly fees. Credit cards are a free tool that when used responsibility can make your life go that little bit smoother.\n\nThis can be quite true, but is often not the case. I was in your shoes for many years. Always paid my balance, never had interest charges, used up my points, etc. FREE STUFF!!! But then you let it get out of control. \"I don't have the cash right now, but I will next month and will pay it off immediately\" becomes \"What's $10? I'd rather buy more stuff with my cash than pay off this credit card this month. I'll clean it up next month.\" which obviously snowballs into leaving beyond your means with a few thousand dollars of CC debt.\"  I don't like walking down shady, unlit alleys at night because i do not enjoy putting myself in dangerous situations. Credit cards, and credit in general, are dark alleys. Only bad can come from them even despite your best intentions.\n\nIMO a much better way to live financially is to budget properly and pay cash for everything. Forcing yourself to only spend the cash you have is a great hedge against unsavory characters appearing from behind a dumpster with a knife or gun and some unpleasant thoughts in their heads.","662":"Since you have to negotiate the subway with your purchases, I would say yes, Prime is in fact a great feature for you. It would be difficult to carry a wholesale pack of toilet paper and paper towels AND anything else due to the dimensions.\n\nAdmittedly, I live in Louisiana, but here SamsClub\/Costco prices are only marginally better than Amazon's prices (I wait for Amazon to have coupons on the household goods), and that's assuming you're buying club brands over name brands. Usually the name brands are roughly the same on Amazon.\n\nFurthermore, the big question I have to ask you is: What is your time worth?  For me to drive to Sams, load up on household items, and drive back is usually about 2 hours, and I would have to do this outside of my normal 40 hour work week on my personal time. \n\nThe difference in price of everything I buy will not come anywhere close to what two hours of my time is worth. I'd rather pay an extra $1-3 per wholesale case of toilet paper and go do what I want with my time.","663":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I have it all delivered at once every three months. If you have 5 or more items delivered in the same month, Amazon will knock an extra 15% off each item instead of the regular 5%. This made it cheaper for me than Costco on all of the items when I factored in fuel and time. The great part is if you need more, you just tell them you need more and they send it. This happens with some items from time to time. \n\nAdditionally, I order anything I can off Amazon if it makes sense financially. I am fortunate to live in a state with no ties to Amazon so the savings in sales tax is nice (I know, I know I am supposed to claim it). Also, I am fairly rural so it is nice to get some of the things I miss from when I lived in the cit delivered to my door without having to drive an hour to the city. \n\nThe streaming video is great too. My favorite part is I can rent new release movies for a movie night with the family for about $2 cheaper than DISH pay per view. Plus, if you choose no-rush shipping, you get prime credits and you can rent movies for free every so often. I am renting Fury for free when it comes out. \n\nLastly, the shipping. According to my calculations, I should have paid around $450 in shipping last year for everything I ordered. I paid $14. That is because one item I ordered was not Prime eligible. It was a part for my washer and nobody within 100 miles had it. \n\nSo, the TLDR is, if you are going to use it, then absolutely, it is worth it.

I paid like $40 bucks and had Amazon Prime for a year.

I did the text Chat Support with Amazon and told them I wanted to use it now.

A Bank of America Cash Rewards and an Amazon card. \n\nCredit cards offer much better fraud protection. Since the money on the credit card isn't really yours anyway, you're not really missing out if you get your shit stolen. You file for fraud and the bank eventually gets ***their*** money back within a day or two. If this happens on your debit card, well, you're out whatever has disappeared from ***your*** money until the bank can figure it out and this can take several days if not a few weeks to a month or so.\n\nIt helps boost your credit if you use a small percentage and make payments on time or completely pay it off every month. This helps big time for lower interest rates and better loans in the future.\n\nNot to mention that it's great for emergencies and every day purchases. One time I was a day from pay day and I was broke because I paid my bills and I broke down on the side of the highway with no gas. Called AAA and I used my card to pay for the gas to get myself to a gas station to fill up. I underestimated my fuel gauge. Thank god for that or I would have been screwed.\n\nLets say my billing cycle ends on the 15th of every month. So I can buy something lets say for $200 on the card on January 15th, and I have 4 weeks to save up the money and pay it off by February 15th. I didn't have to go broke one week to buy it, and I paid no interest either since it was paid off by the end of the month. That's a great way to keep the usage up as long as you're not maxing your limit or surpassing it; Banks don't like that.\n\nWhen I use my Amazon card on amazon purchases, I get 3% points to use on future purchases (500 points = $5). Not to mention that you usually get a gift card when signing up. I got a $50 when I did it. Other cards like my BoA cards give me cash back rewards too. Other cards offer more, but be careful because some will charge you monthly and yearly fees.\n\nLike others have said, credit cards are an amazing thing when used responsibly. Never paid interest and never paid monthly fees. If I can't pay it off within the month, I don't bother purchasing it until I can.","680":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Furthermore, Amazon also handles the returns and refunds on Prime-shipped items themselves.\n\nTypically, this stuff tends to be just a little bit more expensive than the lowest available price from third-party sellers, but in the grander scheme of things it evens out when you consider the shipping price.

The bulk prices on the meds (we usually get the larger packs\/double packs of the Kirkland brands) and pet supplies (we usually get a 40lb bag of Precious Cat litter, which has been good for us even\/especially with it being unscented, and runs anywhere from $15 to $20 with price fluctuations). The meds and the litter alone has made it worth the cost of keeping Prime (the fact that that 40lb bag of litter is delivered right to my doorstep as opposed to me having to drag it from the store, with my arthritis and other health problems, is a HUGE bonus). We've also ordered bulk things like toilet paper and paper towels, and everyone once in awhile will come across a great deal on things we need for the house (home improvement stuff) or just random entertainment items (DVDs, books, etc.)\n\nIt really depends on your shopping habits, but for us, it has been well worth it.

Not sure if they vary by company, but it's bad. I'm also pretty sure you lose your grace period (I'll get into that in a second).\n\n2) PAY OFF IN FULL. The \"paying in full makes your credit score go up less fast\" is FALSE. The things that affect your credit score are history of on time payments, age of accounts (either oldest or average of all lines of credit depending on the bureau), utilization, overall credit line, number of hard inquiries, and number of new accounts.\n\n3) Intro APRs. These are cool. It means that you won't get charged interest for 1 year (or 1.5 years depending on how long the teaser is for). After that, you start accruing interest at your normal APR.\n\n4) APR stands for \"Annual Percentage Rate.\" It's the percent by which your balance will increase if you revolve it for a year. It compounds daily, meaning that your balance goes up each day you don't pay it down (unless you pay your balance off in full every month - we'll get to that in a sec). Your card terms will go into more detail about the math behind it.\n\n5) So... a bit more on how interest works. As long as you pay off your balance in full every month, you have something called a grace period. It means that any purchase you make won't accrue for the first billing cycle after your purchase. Once you revolve a balance, you lose your grace period, meaning that purchases start accruing interest immediately. You get your grace period back if you pay the statement balance a certain number of times in a row (I think it's 2, but I'm not 100% sure on this). So pay your balance in full every month, and you'll never have to pay interest.\n\nAs far as cards go, other comments have said this, but you won't get Citi DoubleCash. Discover IT student and Capital One Journey card are probably your best options - they're designed for students, and they both give rewards. You get the cash back in the form of a statement credit or as a check in the mail - you can normally choose.\n\nOnce you build up credit a bit (which Capital One and Discover both let you track online for free), Citi DoubleCash is the single best card on the market. You can pair that with rotating categories cards to optimize your rewards (Chase Freedom, Chase Amazon, Discover It, BofA Cash, partnership cards, etc). Managing your spend and paying all your bills is reasonably easy with Mint.com + autopay.\n\nOh yeah, just set up autopay to pay in full each month. Just be careful not to overspend.

That shit is super low-margin. My store is consistently top-3 in the 40-store district, and we barely sell phones. Instead we sell super-high-margin batteries and cables to old people. Why put so much effort into making maybe $40-50 all told on 1 $700 iPhone when you make $5.50 on every $6 button cell battery?  \n*Old-ass technology. Lack of moving with the times is what killed the company on the outside, but it had a severe impact internally as well. We didn't have the ability to order a specific item for a customer from our warehouse until LAST MONTH (and it's still poorly-implemented). Up until then we literally had to tell them \"we can't order it, but you can go home and get it off our website! (or for half-price on Amazon, if you're already going the online route). The networking infrastructure was absolute shit. POS systems routinely going online, taking close to 15-20 seconds to cut out from the screen saver to the system, then another 10 seconds to load, then another 10 seconds to process the credit payment...sounds like not much, bit it adds up, much to both our and the customers' frustrations.  \n*Poor emphasis on key products: several months ago we got thousands of dollars worth of DIY stuff - Arduino, MakeBlock, LittleBits, the works. You know where they had us put them? In the \"senior corner\" - the very back corner of the store, hidden from view of the windows and even the registers, wedged between the alarm clocks, AM\/FM radios and home phones. I think we've sold maybe 3 or 4 LittleBits parts, but nothing over $30-40.  \n*Conversely, overemphasis on worthless product: We recently started selling Defense Mobile, a prepaid wireless service specific to military members. That started in I think November, and there have been at least 2 company contests to sell it. Rumor has it our district hasn't sold a single one yet. (Also, despite our well-known super-low numbers of available iPhone 6s even until today, we were shipped SEVEN Defense Mobile i6s. Useless on any other network.  \n*Endless micromanagement: This morning I clocked in at 8:30, and my district manager had already sent out 13 e-mails. THIRTEEN. We endure constant conference calls spouting the same old nonsense, multiple daily checks that require the manager or person in charge to email the DM with current sales results, number of warranties sold, etc. etc. It's absolutely unbelievable how much micromanagement occurs. Messages are repeated over and over (the DM has, for the past 3 days, sent the same exact email reminding us of the fact that we must be wearing nametags at all times and cannot have food or drink on the sales floor. WE GET IT.)  \n  \nTo be honest I could go on a whole lot more, but I'll cut it for now.","829":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

","835":"Best Buy Turnaround Effort\n\n\nBest Buy continues their strong turnaround effort through 2013 so far by improving cost management, focusing on the domestic market, and optimizing their space and assortment. \u00a0The results seem to be working for shareholders as they are now trading at over $40 per share compared to roughly $12 per share last year at this time.\n\n\nThey have been successfully turning the ship around from several key strategic pillars outlined in their\u00a0Renew Blue initiative:\n\n\n- Accelerate online growth\n\n- Improve multichannel customer experience\n\n- Store space optimization\n\n- Supply chain efficiency\n\n- US real estate optimization\n\n- Reduce SG&amp;A expenses\n\n\nThe Renew Blue initiative is designed to improve customer experience and reduce costs.\n\n\nCustomer Experience:\n\n\nCustomers want to shop in different ways then even several years ago as ecommerce continues to grow and the mobile segment in particular. \u00a0The irony is that Best Buy has known about the growing mobile business because they have invested heavily into improving mobile sales, but they have not matched that investment in providing a great shopping experience to their newly created mobile users. \u00a0Best Buy has focused on improving their web and mobile experience to be more competitive in the ecommerce arena. \u00a0They are beginning to understand that\u00a0BestBuy.comis no longer just a tool to support their physical locations and it now needs to have functionality to stand alone competitively for customers who may never enter a store.\u00a0\n\n\nBest Buy has continued to create a multichannel experience by using features such as order online and pick-up in store, and extending the aisle by ordering web products from a store. \u00a0Another near future addition might be order online and ship from store which could begin turning retail stores into neighborhood distribution centers.\n\n\nCost Reduction:\n\n\nStore space optimization, supply chain efficiency, SG&amp;A expense and real estate optimization all sound great, so what does this mean operationally? \u00a0\n\n\n- Improve the product SKUs that are in their store focusing on higher sales quantity, revenue, and profit margin\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Example: Reducing the amount of media (CDs and DVDs) and focusing on new releases \/ special editions\n\n\n- Improve the supply chain efficiency to reduce the cost of goods sold for products and increase profit margin\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Example: Improve distribution center location, shipping schedules, and reduce labor necessary to load and unload merchandise\n\n\n- Reduce SG&amp;A expense (Selling, General, &amp; Administrative)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Example: Eliminate paper circulars and reduce advertising cost\/materials using only digital circular\n\n\n- Optimize the US real estate portfolio by reducing poor investments and making the most revenue per square foot\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Example: Buy out leases for under performing stores and shut down the locations\n\n\nOverall Best Buy wants to reduce costs, stock more effective product SKUs, improve utilization of physical locations, strengthen the supply chain and provide a better customer experience through multiple channels.\n\n\nThat description sounds like an evolved Best Buy with smaller, more efficient stores carrying an excellent product assortment. \u00a0These stores will leverage the strengthened supply chain and multichannel technologies to provide a great customer experience.\n\n\nThe Renew Blue strategy continues to bring success, but there may be an opportunity to enhance this through the acquisition of another struggling retailer.\n\n\nRadioShack's Road to Redemption\n\n\nRadioShack is an existing consumer electronic retailer that has a contingent of loyal customers, 4,000+ small format stores, and shares a strong focus on mobile offerings. \u00a0They are attempting to re-position their brand, improve the in-store experience, and revamp their product assortment. \u00a0Their challenges are also related to gross margin due to product optimization, expense management, and increasing online competition.\n\n\nRadioShack or the \"cockroach of retail\" as it has been called is possibly the least sexy name in the retail industry now as their share price hovers around $3 down from nearly $12 at the start of 2012. \u00a0It couldn't be any uglier as their new CEO Joseph Magnacca starts the turnaround effort. \u00a0Acknowledging the uphill battle I see opportunity in the form of an unlikely partnership with Best Buy.\n\n\nRadioShack has said it \"continues to address significant legacy issues as it engineers a comprehensive operational turnaround driven by the company's five pillars: reposition the brand, revamp the product assortment, reinvigorate the store experience, operational efficiency and financial flexibility.\"\n\n\nBest Buy can help breathe some life in to these five pillars.\n\n\n- Best Buy started to reposition themselves in the competitive landscape with the large physical and online retailers of Walmart, Target, and Amazon.\u00a0\n\n\n- Best Buy is currently undertaking the assortment optimization and has started to see traction in the domestic market with positive same store sales growth. \u00a0They will also be able to offer significantly larger assortment to find the sweet spot of customer demand, fast inventory turnover, and strong margin. \u00a0\n\n\n- Best Buy has had to completely reinvigorate their store experience while battling competitors, the macro environment, and pressure from shareholders. \u00a0This momentum could be carried over to help address a workforce with similar challenges.\n\n\n- Best Buy has taken a deep look at their expenses and have continued to show improvement in reduction quarter over quarter. \u00a0Their learnings would be invaluable to help a smaller company that may need even tighter cost controls to remain competitive.\n\n\n- Financial flexibility hasn't been corrected yet, but if Best Buy can execute their desired supply chain improvements in conjunction with their real estate optimization then it is a realistic possibility.\n\n\nWhat's the Opportunity?\n\n\nIntegrating 2 companies of this size and magnitude would represent huge challenges in any environment, but it is amplified as both are in different phases of turn around efforts. \u00a0They have had a contrasting style over the last decade, but they must continue to find ways to turn their brick and mortar stores back into strengths. \u00a0They must reverse Amazon's clever maneuvering to turn physical locations into a weakness. Focusing on brick and motor aligns the goals and strategies of Best Buy and\u00a0RadioShack more than ever. \u00a0Both companies must control their expenses to offset the challenges of physical locations not possessed by online retailers. \u00a0Both have desires to enhance assortment and supply chain. \u00a0Best Buy has dreams to turn each store location into miniature distribution centers allowing them to compete very favorably with Amazon's continuously sprawling supply chain. \u00a0I believeRadioShack stores would have the opportunity to compliment this perfectly utilizing some of the elements described by\u00a0Will Burns in this post\u00a0as he discusses the \"brand promise of\u00a0now\"\u00a0and the\u00a0\"last mile\"\u00a0in reference to the final connection point for customers.\n\n\nThis aggressive undertaking could reshape how brick and mortar competes with online stores by making one of the first truly multichannel experiences. \u00a0The blend of Best Buy and\u00a0RadioShack could offer several unique advantages that other retailers have not been able to solve in their respective fields. \u00a0The ability to successfully operate both large and small format stores. \u00a0This could provide competitive advantages by using the formats in conjunction with one another in the same market instead of one or the other. \u00a0Building a supply chain model off this physical presence in tandem with expanding technology investments for customer experience could be a differentiator. \u00a0In 5 years we may be discussing how online only retailers are struggling to compete with multichannel providers that started as just brick and mortar stores.\n\n","836":"&gt; 2) Look more carefully at your electric bill [...]\n\nIt's high in this area.

I wouldn't consider it a primary income source, especially if you are just starting out.\n\nMaking your own digital product to promote and sell, even have affiliate sell it for commission for you, is usually going to be a better money maker.  When I made my first ebook (in a Warcraft gaming niche) I made around $1500 in a few months.  Sales are still trickling in though.\n\nMy GF has been working on an amazon affiliate based site at: http:\/\/giftsforgamersandgeeks.com and she made almost $400 last month. Granted it is a gift focused site and it was December with Christmas shoppers being heavily targeted, but shes up to $65 so far this month in commissions (Jan is always a slower sales month).  Amazon can be done for money making, but often these types of sites take a lot of effort and time to build and create articles.  The pure time invested vs money returned isn't that appealing though.  It takes a lot of work each day.\n\nIf you seriously wanna get into making a site and getting Amazon or Zazzle commissions, take a look at that Easy Product Display ad on her site.  She uses that to make the nice html based sales boxes and it saves her a lot of headache and time, especially since html coding isn't a strong suit. I'd highly recommend that EPD too.\n\nHer site is strictly for making money as an affiliate by building curated lists. It's hard to grow the links as most people know its just a site to make money.  This best use of amazon is to add reviews or links periodically to an already existing site that has unique content to pull traffic, with the occasional affiliate post or occasional affiliate link weaved into content posts.\n\n\n","865":"Yep, performance cars are almost always driven hard, because, well, they're performance cars.

Also, if you need to get expensive parts like sensors, look on Amazon first.  I've found OEM spark plug coils that normally cost $200 for $47 new.\n\nAlso, if you ever but a used car again test the head gasket by (only do this on a cool engine) taking off the radiator cap and start the engine.  If the head gasket is fine, nothing will happen.  If it's bad, the pressure from the cylinders with force it's way past the gasket into the cooling system and cause the water to geyser.","866":"That was only my opinion on why I won't buy it.

Vanguard, Betterment, Wealthfront - it probably doesn't really matter, honestly. I personally use Wealthfront and like them, but with that amount of money, it's not like you're going to lose out on much upside with any fund.

Let it grow with time.\n\nThis is something true that most \"investors\" (read: day traders) will always deny but is demonstrably, repeatedly true, and research will support 99 times out of 100: you can't reliably pick individual stocks and consistently beat the market. You just can't. Not only because you're an individual without access to sophisticated research and professional brokerage, but because you just don't get the same market\/company information that the pros do. Retail investors are literally the last guys in line to get anything interesting. \n\nI have a bunch of friends in the investment banking community (Goldman, Morgan, boutiques, etc). They lol about retail \"traders.\" Just don't daytrade. It'll never work.\n\nIf you really want to pick stocks, understand that what you're doing is more like gambling. That's fine (I do it too), but that's what it is. Pick companies that you feel like you understand, that you can do some research about, and whose business models and market you clearly understand.

My guess is that console users also decreasingly shop at GameStop so since digital distribution became available to console users (Both Sony and Microsoft offer this now). It seems to me that used game market is declining as well due to the above reason.\n\nI believe digital distribution is your number one reason for considering shorting. (similar cases of digital vs. brick and mortar stores: Netflix and Blockbuster, Amazon and BestBuy). People used to say the same about BestBuy. BestBuy is still around.\n\nAnd beside digital, there is also competition with other retailers like WMT and BBY.\n\nBut looking at GameStop's financials, things look pretty solid. They had about $370 million in cash in November. They are making a profit every quarter and purchasing back their stocks. The company isn't growing (exiting unprofitable markets and reducing number of stores), but it is trying to create value for shareholders with some success.
