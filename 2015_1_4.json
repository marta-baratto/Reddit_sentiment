has little mini trivia games every Sunday night (8:30pm EST) - the top 10-20 players typically win a prize.  Tonight's 1st place winner gets a $25 Amazon GC, and 2-15th place win a $10 Amazon GC. \n\nTonight's theme is all about Vegetables. It will probably have a couple easy trivia questions, a hangman type game, a word search, a matching game, and maybe a maze.  You can play a few old games for practice. \n\nThe key to doing well is not making mistakes. It's worth it to take a few extra seconds to make a better guess, as you lose more points for guessing incorrectly. \n\nI have probably won around $200 in Amazon GCs in the past 6 months or so, as well as some random other things (like a board game, and a Love With Food box).  It's obviously not guaranteed beer money, but it only takes a few minutes, and I think it's pretty fun.\n\n[Referral Link](http:\/\/www.fleetwit.com\/race\/vegetabletrivia?ref=6faae32ab2049b1368fec232b6fe71d8)\n\n[Non-Referral Link](http:\/\/www.fleetwit.com)\n\nJust make sure to register for tonight's game before it starts!","1":"I have that much in balance and with that I can buy an Amazon Gift Card off the website and send it to your email.\n\nComment here before sending a PM","2":"{H} $125 Bestbuy [W] Amazon, Paypal, B&amp;H","3":"Basically, this one monitors your location as you go through your day.  You get points for letting them monitor (they update your balance once a day or so), and you can either use your points for sweepstakes or for guaranteed PayPal money or Amazon gift cards.  3,000 points gets you $2, and 5,000 points gets you $5 (so the $5 is the way to go, unless you need the money sooner).  Entries for sweepstakes cost anywhere between 10 points (for a weekly draw for a $2 Amazon gift card) and 100 points (for monthly drawings for $50 in Amazon cards, PayPal cash, or Visa gift cards).\n\nWithout factoring in any other ways to earn points, the earnings are a bit slow (I've gotten anywhere between 20-50 points on a normal day).  There's still a few ways to build up your points beyond what they give you for the data:\n\n* Most days, you'll get a little notification to answer a few questions about where exactly you were the day before (they show you a map and a list of options to choose from).   Once in a while, after those questions, you'll be asked more questions about a particular business (whether or not you were there on a certain day, what you were there for, what you did to prepare for your visit, etc.) for more points.  The former gives you 4 hours worth of bonus points, the latter 1 day worth of bonus points. \n*  Not sure how often this happens or if it's happened for anyone else, but they once sent me a link to download their iPad app.  Downloaded it that day, and 1,000 points went into my balance the next day.\n\nThere's a referral program as well: you earn 10% of the points your referrals earn (up to a max of 1,000 referrals), and 5% of the points earned by the people your referrals refer (up to a max of 500 referrals).  \n\n[Payment Proof](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EVQziBh.png)\n\n[Referral Link](http:\/\/www.placed.com\/panel\/panels\/711b0c40f1da\/signup?rid=7e9cbd52a9bc)\n\n[Non-Referral Link](http:\/\/www.placed.com\/panel-app)","4":"###The Exchange\nI will be sending 0.01431161 Bitcoin from my Xapo online Bitcoin wallet.

There is also a 629 for reaching a certain level on one game. I got a $2 Amazon gift card (1,000 credits) in less than 15 minutes. (And I've bought 2 iTunes gift cards)\n\nRewards: iTunes, Amazon, Steam, PlayStation, Minecraft servers, Facebook (no one cares about this one), and XBox.\n\nThe only small things I can complain about on this one is that only about 2 out of the 15 apps I installed didn't work and that they have a short range of cards (also no paypal\/real money, but I mostly online shop with amazon)\n\n**2.

A $1 amazon card costs 600 points which isn't really as good as AppBounty, but the referral system makes up for it, which I'll get to in a moment.\n\nRewards: Lots of apps on the app store, amazon, paypal, starbucks, playstation, xbox, itunes, google play, steam, and an ipad.\n\nThe thing that really sold me on this one is the referral system. It doesn't have the best payout system if your by yourself, but if you have a friend or a second device to use it with, you get 50% more points. I found using a second device, if you buy something worth $10, you can then buy something else worth $5 on your second device (or your friend ;])\n\nThe only thing I had a problem with was about a quarter of the apps I used didn't give me my reward. (this one is pretty much tied with AppBounty on my favorite).\n\nThanks a lot if you refer me. I've noticed a lot of kind people here at \/r\/beermoney. I'm currently saving up for college and \/r\/beermoney + a real part-time job = college money!

I started using the site about a month ago for the GameFly offer (first month free, $15.75 cashback after signing up and cancelling immediately). I also earned $2.10 for signing up for Amazon's MyHabit, which was free. My one payout that I've received so far was for $17.85, and I didn't have to spend a penny. There is no minimum payout.\n\nThe Audible offer was one I had wanted but had missed by a couple of days. The offer is back, where you sign up for Audible with an introductory price of $7.49\/month for the first three months, but you get $31.00 cashback for it. You get the cashback if you don't cancel within the first 30 days, so on the 31st day you cancel and you technically make a profit off of it - about $16.02, it would seem (I imagine you will technically be charged for two months' worth of Audible).\n\nI have provided proof that I've been paid by Top CashBack as I've heard varying stories. There are other offers currently on the website as well. I check the site every day to see what new offers there are. It takes a while for the payouts to clear (a few weeks) but once they're available for payout they're in my PayPal account within the next day. \n\nYou can also still get a MyHabit credit for free if you're a new member. [They're offering $2 for signing up right now](http:\/\/www.topcashback.com\/myhabit\/).\n\nThe Audible offer ends today, so if the offer is something that sounds interesting to you I'd sign up today before it's gone again! (But since this is the second time it's come around I imagine it will be back again soon.) \n\n* Proof of payment: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oA5D3jF.png\n\nYou also get $10 for referring friends, so if you guys want to start a referral train here and give beer money to all feel free. :) \n\n* My Referral Link: http:\/\/www.topcashback.com\/ref\/j_phoenix\n* Non-Referral Link: https:\/\/www.topcashback.com\/Join","9":"[H] 25$ Amazon GC [W] 20$ PayPal","10":"I took my pilgrimage to the outlet store and what I found today was just strange.  First bin we come across I find this:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ebay.com\/sch\/i.html?_from=R40%7CR40%7CR40&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_nkw=jingle+jugs&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;rt=nc\n\nYes, dancing and singing boobs that you hang on your wall.  No, I didn't buy them because they were missing the battery cover and the bra to cover them.  I did get a very unapproving glance from my wife and a good laugh from her friend when I said that to make sure they worked, they had to motorboat them first.  (yeah, I am that kinda guy to make jokes like that) but let us move on...\n\nFound a few random things to sell, some stuff for us to use and what not.  Found a couple remotes.  Nothing spectacular, so I moved on to the CDs.\n\nNow, I had to change my stragegy since Decluttr dropped their lowest price to .10 a disc and most of them to .40 a disc.  I used to buy CDs by the CART load.  I would come home with over a thousand CDs to send in to decluttr and such.  When I got there today, the outlet store changed their pricing to $2.00 a CD!  WTF!  Time to be smarter than before.  Now, I scanned the section.  If I didn't know an artist or if it was an obscure genre of music, I would scan it into decluttr.  If it showed more then .40 for the disc, I sat it aside.  Once I completed a row of discs, I would scan them with amazon seller app.  If the disc could be sold on amazon for a profit of $5 to $10 with a sales rank of 500,000 or lower, I would buy it.  If the disc sold for more than $10 and had a rank higher than 500K, I would buy it, but know I would sit on it for a good long while possibly.\n\nOn the last row of CDs, I see a disc with a black insert with light grey and barely visible print.  I pick it up to get a better look at the artist and I am surprised by the name of the disc.  \"Murder Ballads (Incest Songs)\" by M.J. Harris and Martyn Bates.  I scanned it and it met the criteria so, I bought it.  I cannot say that I wasn't curious about it.  Once I got in the car, I popped it in.  It is an ambient style of music with slowly singing vocals that tell stories featuring incest that leads to murder of some sort.  I can't say that, even as a horror fan, that I liked it, but it still should sell for a decent amount.  Amazon clocks it at about $27.  Here is the cover art and more info for those curious...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.discogs.com\/MJ-Harris-Martyn-Bates-Murder-Ballads-Incest-Songs\/release\/407708\n\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00004SWPA\n\nBack to the outlet.  I was wrapping up and found a Nerf Longstrike CS-6.  These guns are GREAT and usually sell for about $40 to $60.  I wanted it because this model of nerf gun is really easy to work with.  I sand them down and then steampunk them out.  Add copper pipes and random things to make it look the part.  I modded one of these and it turned out amazing and I wanted to do it again.  Turned my back on the cart to look in a bin and when I looked back, it was gone.  Someone took it from my cart and made off with it.  I was pissed.  Beyond pissed.  Another bin change and I found three other nerf guns, but that one was my baby...\n\nAll total spent - $88\n\nProfit expected (once all is said and done) $175\n\nA slow day, but some really creepy finds at the outlet for once.","11":"Hi!

From reviews of babysitting services on yelp, the top pains are babysitters showing up late or not at all. They are worried about reference and background checks. Babysitting agencies exist that cater to some of these pains, but not all. They also have poorly designed websites and complicated pricing plans, which is another customer pain.\n\nOur solution\n\nThe giggul website simplifies the process of finding a babysitter, requiring less than a minute to book a babysitter. This babysitter is background and reference checked, which means reliability, timeliness and above all safety. We also offer late notice bookings, and the option for the same babysitter each time. We charge a flat \u00a311\/hour with no hidden charges or retaining fees. Each babysitter will wear a bright orange t-shirt with our logo on it which will help to give parents complete peace of mind.\n\nTarget market\n\nParents that use the internet and smartphones daily, and are no strangers to online services like Amazon, Uber and Mopp. Living in heavily populated areas away from their hometown and so do not have a large base of friends that they can rely on to either babysit for them, or get referrals of babysitters from. London is our launch city, and has a large population of parents that fall into this bracket.\n\nMarket Analysis\n\ngiggul is attempting to do what www.mopp.com did to the fragmented cleaning industry. Noticing the poor services on offer through the internet, Mopp created an intuitive website, with a flat fee for cleaning persons. They increased their market share rapidly, helped by a multitude of inferior services on offer, and were acquired less than two years later. These other services proved the demand, and it is a similar case with the babysitting market at the moment: \n(http:\/\/www.likeminders.co.uk\/ , http:\/\/www.sitters.co.uk\/ , https:\/\/www.childcare.co.uk\/,, https:\/\/uk.care.com\/babysitters, http:\/\/www.tinies.com\/parents\/find-a-babysitter\/, http:\/\/www.findababysitter.com\/, http:\/\/www.nanny24h.co.uk\/)\n\nThere have been some startup successes in the babysitting industry, from companies taking the process online well. (Kindy, Tonightish, Urbansitter). None of these services have taken off in the UK yet.\n\n\nBusiness model\n\nWe charge parents a flat rate of \u00a311\/hour, and pay our babysitting contractors \u00a38-9\/hour. We will donate 5% of all profits to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","30":"So I've been doing a lot of research and I think I'm ready to jump in head first.

It will skyrocket to about 3-400 in the summer months.\n\n \nCar Insurance: $94\/month. I can't change it. Every quote I get now is at least $150 a month for some reason. \n\n\nCar Payment: $417\/mo.

Basically going to the the thrift store and anything I wasn't picking up for myself (usually when it wasn't my size), I would toss it up on eBay and sell it to cover the amount I spent at the thrift on myself, gas there and lunch for the day. I do this about 25 times over the course of a year.\n\nI decided that on 12\/20 I would try some other flipping (partly in due to this thread) and see how well I would do. \n\n- $2,492 in sales and $1,108 in profit after shipping and fees\n- I only have 1 item ($25) that I have had for more than 3 weeks and it hasn't sold yet. Everything else flipped in the first week I had it.\n- The only thing I was able to flip from thrift stores were clothing. It's what I knew and I had no success in anything else there.\n- I cleaned up at live and online auctions (my town has an awesome liquidation auction online throughout the week). This is where I got probably 70% of my items. I'm fortunate enough that I live in a top 15 city for population and it's filled with online retailer warehouses.\n- I didn't discriminate on what I bought at all. I bought and sold clothing, baseball gloves, Jeep Wrangler parts, bicycles, an xbox, legos, coffee maker. I knew very little about all but since most items were posted online early, I was able to do my research and buy smart.\n- I flipped what I could on ebay for shitty margins and took the items I knew I could sell locally on either craigslist or a facebook selling wall.\n- I had discretionary cash to buy and flip with. I've got a solid web development job. So I bought a little loose and took smaller margins on some items. But profit is profit. Most items I made about $30 - $55 on. Some sold for as little as $5 profit. Biggest flip was for $180 profit. Not as big as some of you guys, but still cash in the bank.\n\n\nWhat I wish I would have done differently:\n\n- Utilize my local selling avenues more. I could have sold a ton of the items locally and not have to eat ebay and paypal fees. I could have sold it just as quick as I could have online.\n- Ship faster. I fucking suck at shipping fast. I almost got a negative review because I was being lazy about getting it packed up and out the door.\n- Don't buy sight unseen. I lost my ass on a $100 electronic because I bought online and didn't spend the time being thorough. I was pissed. It's been 3 weeks and I'm still angry about it. I sold it for 1\/2 of what I paid for.\n\nWhat I'll try this next month:\n\n- Open an Amazon seller account. Maybe FBA? Not sure if I have the time for that yet.\n- Do more haggling for better price.\n-  More, more, more live auctions. \n- As Spring approaches, I hope I can venture out into yard and garage sales.\n- Maybe rent a storage unit. I could have flipped a ton of furniture for big $$ but I had no where to store it. I live in a 1 br apartment.\n- Set craigslist alerts\n- I've only got about $150 invested into inventory for the next month (that I purchased this evening). So I definitely need to get sourcing so I can make some extra cash.\n- Wake up early and stay up late. I know the money's out there, just need to stay focused.\n\n\n\nI didn't really write this with any specific purpose in mind outside of getting some of my thoughts and experiences out and to contribute to a thread I've learned from.

I guess I could give you guys some. \n\nWhen my previous business failed I was obviously very depressed. I talked to some friends and to some family members and it gave me some perspective. Anyway, long story short, I did not move. I put my business in standby, moved with some friends of mine (roommates), they are also entrepreneurs (architects to be more precises). I used to live with my girlfriend but the up and down of the entrepreneurial life was too much to handle for her (I guess mood swing and stress are part of this lifestyle).\n\nI would like to point out that I have a small Youtube channel that generate between 50 to 150 USD per month.

I sold my camera and a trailer. I have now around 5500 USD in my bank account. I am trying to keep that balance in my bank account in case shit hit the fan.\n\nNow concerning my new business: \n\n- I am investing 1000 USD per month into a new e-commerce venture. The project is already generating 600-700 USD per month. I have convinced a friend to invest 500 USD per month into this venture. It is going pretty well, but I have up and down and days with poor sales.  \n\nI am still using Alibaba btw. I made a post a while ago with my other username about it here: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/16lqn2\/my_first_order_on_alibaba_first_experience\/\n\n- One of my roommate and I are starting a free magazine (physical). I take care of the content and he is in charge of the design. The concept is basically a mix between buzzfeed and an Amazon affiliate marketing site (but with physical stores). The only expense here is the printing of the magazine but hopefully we will be able to secure some advertisers before printing.\n\n\n- I also have another project. I want to import nuts.

I was approved for a $300 limit, with a $60 security deposit. I regularly used the card for small purchases and always paid it off within the month. This was my first credit account. I never had a car loan, or student loans. I was 21ish when I got the card. \n\nThe second card I applied for came 6 months later, and was a simple kohls card. Same $300 limit. Use it monthly for small purchases, constantly pay it off. \n\nSomewhere close to 18 or so months later, I took a chance while Christmas shopping on Amazon, and applied for their Chase card to save money on the order, thinking there was no way I'd be approved. They approved me, and also gave me a much higher limit, of $2,600.\n\nSomewhere in the time frame after the Amazon card, I was notified by Capital one of an increase. My new limit was $750 on the secured card. \n\nProbably about 6 months after the chase card, I applied for a Citibank card, and received said card, with a $3,500 limit. \n\nI was also notified around this time that my Amazon limit was increased as well. \n\nLast month, I applied for a care credit card, to use at the dentist, for a bunch of upcoming work, and was approved for $2500. The benefit being the interest free time limit from the charged procedures. Ideally I'd like to save up to pay for something like this, but I've been told waiting would make the process a lot more work in the long run, might as well take care of it asap.   \n\nThe Amazon, Citibank, and Care credit are all no fee cards. Or I should say, as far as I know. I've yet to be charged anything for them. The Amazon and the Citibank also both came with 12-18 months 0%APR, not that it really matters in my case, as I make continual payments throughout the month on both. They also are both rewards cards. \n\nNow back to the Capital One card, it has an annual fee, I do not remember the exact amount but somewhere in the amount of 50-75. This is not a huge deal, however it seems silly to pay an annual fee for a card, that has no rewards, and such a small limit in comparison. \n\nHowever, I've also read a lot about the negative of closing an account. This is my longest open account, and according to Credit Karma I am still an F in terms of account length history. \n\nI called Capitol one today to find out if I could upgrade the account to a regular card, possibly with a larger limit, and no fee. I was told it is not possible at this time, however that I could apply for a new capital one card myself, Then close said secure account. \n\nI don't necessarily need a new card at the moment. Especially if it will end up closing one account, and opening two new ones in two months. Personally I'd rather save it for an emergency, and for that I mean a few years down the line if I have a car repair or something that would take 2-3 months to pay off, that would be the point in my mind to apply for a new 0% APR card. \n\nI know I could just keep the secured card, and pay the 50 or so a year to have the account open, if it benefits my score in the long run, and I'd hate to some how hurt my score in the process. \n\nAny suggestions, or advice? How negative is it to close an account that isn't really of any use to you? \n\n ","97":"I will go first if you have more trades than me (65) or better flair (&gt;experienced).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon Gift Cards| Quantity\n------------|--------\n$20 | 3\n$25 | 4\n$30 | 1\n**Total** | **$190**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPayment Method| Rate (non-negotiable)\n------------|--------\nPaypal | 90%\nVenmo | 90%\nGoogle Wallet| 90%\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n","98":"[H] $40 american eagle [W] PayPal, Amazon, offers","99":"[H] PayPal [W] Amazon GC @ 75%","100":"[H] $5 Starbucks [W] $5 Amazon or offers","101":"[H] Amazon GC [W] PayPal @ 87%","102":"Amazon CD(s)","103":"I'm Creating Four Amazon Affiliate Websites that I Will Soon Direct Towards an E-commerce site.","104":"[H] $400 Amazon Gift Cards [W] 80% Google Wallet","105":"Will also trade for Amazon GCs \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2rli18\/uwmh2545_gcx_rep_profile\/","106":"[H] $20 Steam Wallet [W] Paypal or Amazon","107":"Part 1: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Flipping\/comments\/2skm4d\/about_to_start_my_flipping_journey_part_1\/\n\n\nHere's what happened since the last post.

I do how ever have a lot of questions. My wife and I destroyed our credit many years ago. Myself with credit card bills, utility bills, and educational loans. My wife did hers with medical and utility bills, which we are still paying off. \n\nI\u2019ve got mine a lot more under control now. The last I checked my score was up to about 650, maybe pushing 670. I\u2019ve been with a credit union for a number of years and have qualified for car loans and personal loans under $20k. \n\nMy wife and I make a combined $91k a year and our cash flow is now in check, though I could use some more budgeting to decrease impulse spending. This has been hard as we both came from very poor families with very little financial security.  To top it off, our salary increases are pretty recent so going from making less than $15k a year to almost $100k has made it hard for us to not splurge. \n\nI want to start working on building both of our credit back up from good to great levels. I understand the concepts of secured credit cards and what they do to one\u2019s credit. My wife and I both have personal cards that we just sit on, which we were told to do by our credit union. There suggestion was presented to us as having an open line of credit that we do not need to use will help us build our credit score. I don\u2019t know how much truth there is to that, so I would like your take.\n\nI also want to know about charge cards, where the balances are paid off every month in full. Do those do the same thing or is there more\/less potential to damage my score doing that?\n\n I\u2019ve also been offered a couple unsecured Discover cards over the past few months that I don\u2019t really understand what they can do for my credit score.\n\nWhat are the best practices for all types of cards? Am I going about it right by having a line of credit that is open for use with my unsecured capital one cards, but not using them? Should I look at getting an American Express green charge card over an unsecured or secured credit card instead? \n\nOne last thing, what about things like Amazon\u2019s Store Cards or other store cards where they have fixed minimum monthly payments. Do these help with credit at all or just hurt it in the long run, even if they are paid off in a timely manner?\n\nSorry for the bombardment of questions. These are all things I should have been looking into a long time ago (not at the age of 35) or taught by my parents, but now that I am focused on building credit and saving for a down payment on a home, I really need to find reliable information on it all.\n\nEDIT: I've read over the FAQs on here and I have a general understanding of how it works, but Id like some more details answer that are specific to my experiences as of recent.","151":"Hi all. Long time lurker and aspiring entrepreneur here. I've been training myself to sense pain points in daily life and think of products\/services to serve them and have finally found one I think might be worth pursuing, but want to get your expert advice before I do something stupid. \n\n**The Product:** Qi-enabled, high-quality case for a flagship smartphone that does not have Qi charging. This phone is pretty new to market, and is sexy\/well-built. \n\n**Pain point:** No Qi charging. I frequent XDA-developers forums and subreddits for this device, and it is definitely a point of frustration for owners. It's the one thing that would make this phone perfect, for a lot of owners. \n\n**Current market solutions:** Only the manufacturer's Qi-enabled case, which no one seems to like. A few folks have take it and modified it to make it work for them, but nobody likes the form factor\/design\/etc. It is priced at $60. Also, existing Qi receivers\/adapters will not work with this phone, due to charging port location. So the need continues to go unserved. Also, there aren't a ton of case offerings on the market, and many of the ones that are are cheap\/plastic-y\/rubbery\/etc. They all instantly take away from the high-quality feel of the device. There is one case that is pretty nice, and sells for $30-$40 depending on the model. \n\n**My strategy**: Offer a case that provides Qi charging and also maintains the high-quality feel of the phone. I am thinking of a selling price of $40, but run my models on $35 in the name of conservatism. As this phone is pretty new and there aren't very many competitors, I could quickly become one of the \"go-to\" recommended cases. Would not be competing with cheap $10 commoditized plastic cases. I might set up a website\/store, but would really want to go through Amazon since I don't want to handle fulfillment. Also, being a new brand\/product, it would be easier for customers to pull the trigger via Amazon.\n\n**THE NUMBERS**\n\nEngineering costs: Quoted $10k to design the product and supply a working prototype. \n\nManufacturing costs: $20\/unit. This is a conservative estimate, realistically I think it could be more like $15, based on researching Alibaba for high-quality cases and considering the additional cost of Qi. But in the name of conservatism, $20. \n\nAmazon costs: $9.50\/unit. Includes freight\/storage\/etc. \n\n**Upfront costs:** $10,000\n**Margin\/unit**: $5.50 minimum\n**Breakeven units:** ~1800 units\n\nThis is where I start to get cold feet. 1800 units sounds like a bazillion, and the idea of dropping $10k for design and then maybe another $10k (500 units x $20\/per) on initial inventory scares the crap out of me. So this is what I want your opinion on- is 1800 unit sales something you think I would easily achieve? I'm not trying to get rich off this product, just trying to finally jump in and do *something* for the sake of learning and getting over my fear. Shoot, even if I don't break even, if I just come somewhat close and recover most of my cost, I'll be cool! Just the idea of spending $10k on engineering and then having $10k of inventory sitting around not selling terrifies the living daylights out of me. Granted, in the worst case scenario I could sell the inventory at a loss and recoup some of the inventory cost. But that $10k engineering is gone. \n\nSo you people who have launched stuff before- 1800 units, a lot or a little? Am I freaking out over nothing or should I reconsider?","152":"[H] \u00a320 Amazon voucher [W] Paypal\/Game\/Steam","153":"&gt; [rep](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2emh2e\/upotentially_awesome_gcx_rep_profile\/), Comment before PM, etc. You know the rules.

At that low, I believe, it would be a good time to buy and hold it for an extended period of time.\nTL;DR I think Amazon will have poor numbers for Q4 but, do well in the long run.\nTell me why I'm wrong or tell me why I'm right!","156":"Hiya!

I recently took my first job in over 10 years at a local internet company that ships 500-700 items a day mainly in consumer electronics. I run their amazon and ebay accounts. After only a couple months of having a real job again, I am itching to sell on my own again.\n\nMy problem now is that both my ebay accounts are suspended. Since my selling volume was very low at the end of Nov when I took the new job, the timing was bad when I just happened to sell about 25 items that had a very high defect rate.

I've written 5 books that are all on Amazon and I do science-themed events\/parties. In September 2013, I was invited to pitch my company to the Sharks on Shark Tank Season 5. I was hoping for an investment to make a DVD series for schools (similar to Bill Nye the Science Guy). I pitched in front of Lori, Barbara, Robert, Kevin, and Mark. Lori said she would've invested if I had a bigger fan base. In the end, my episode didn't even make it to air.\n\n\nI've been featured on pretty much every single local news channel, magazine, newspaper in Arizona a bunch of different times. Even with all the free publicity I've gotten, Flydoodle Science still is not growing. A few weeks ago, my 6 year old sister said one of the boys in her class said he knew who I was and that he \"hates Alec the Science Kid\" which absolutely KILLED me.\n\n\nI need advice. Obviously I'm doing something very wrong. My mom helps me a lot but only with the creative stuff (website, videos, etc). Other than that, she doesn't know how to help me. Here is a list of things I've tried but haven't worked:\n\n\n- I had an online radio show where I interviewed \"sciencelebrities\". I LOVED doing this. I interviewed Steve Spangler, Bill Wallauer, etc. I would also go to businesses and get sponsorships for $40 which would give them a commercial spot on my show. But, a lot of science guests that I requested to interview would either not respond at all or would forget that they agreed to do an interview with me. I finally had to stop because it's incredibly difficult to do a radio show without guests.\n\n- I started a Youtube channel where anyone could ask me a science question and I would answer it for them in a video. I stopped doing this because I kept getting stupid questions like \"why are you so stupid?\" instead of legit questions.\n\n- I've talked to the biggest school districts in Phoenix but none of them are interested in having me come to their schools to do science demos for the students. This makes me the saddest of all because every time I've gone to a classroom to do science demos the kids get so unbelievably excited. I can see it in their eyes when the light bulb has gone off and their view of science has been changed forever.\n\n\nI'm turning 16 in April and the thought of having to get a regular job with all of the other kids my age is so disheartening. I don't feel like I'm better than them or anything. It's just that I've worked incredibly hard for years and to not see any reward for it and to end up in the same exact position as a kid who sits around playing video games is like a slap in the face.\n\n\nMy Website: www.flydoodlescience.com\nMy Books: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Alec-the-Science-Kid\/e\/B00APKU6V8 My YouTube Channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/flydoodlescience\/videos\n\n\nTL;DR: I'm 15 yr old \"Alec the Science Kid\"- entrepreneur, author, science edutainer, blogger.

If you're approved for one &amp; not the second, it's worth calling them &amp; seeing if you can just split the credit line you did receive across both cards.\nI applied for both the Plus &amp; Premium.  I was approved online for the Plus, but received the notice saying I'd be notified by mail in 7-10 for the premium.   7-10 days later I received a letter saying I was declined.  The reason was \"duplicate application.\"\n\nI applied online for the Premium again &amp; received the same 7-10 notice.  After a few days of waiting, I decided fuck it, and gave the 800 number a call.\n\nThe agents were helpful.  I told them I wanted both the Plus &amp; Premium to track business &amp; personal expenses separately, but I was also honest that I wanted the signup bonus for both.\n\nThe agent explained my original applications came across as two applications for Plus.  I know for certain I had applied for the Plus &amp; Premium, but what happened was I shift-clicked each (so it opened in a new tab) and that agent confirmed that's probably why the second application was taken as a dup of the first.  \n\nHowever, my 2nd premium application hadn't been reviewed yet, so he pulled it up.  One other issue he noted was I also had an Amazon card with Chase.  Both the Chase &amp; Plus card had a limit of $X.  He said there were two choices:\n\n1) I could wait for additional reviews for Chase to extend me a combined credit line beyond 2 * $X.  (Since I had two cards now &amp; was asking for a third.)  This would require approvals &amp; review beyond him.\n\n2) Move some of my existing credit line around, so that each card had effectively 2X\/3.  He could do that there &amp; then and approve the premium. \n\nI typically didn't go beyond even a tenth of $X, so I said sure, let's do #2.  \n\nWithin a few minutes we were done &amp; I was approved for the Premium.\n\n","212":"[H]$40 Paypal [W] $50 Walmart\/Amazon\/PSN\/PS+","213":"80% Amazon any denomination, mainly whatever amount that adds straight to $50\n\n$50 PSN for $40\n\n1 year PS+ for $40\n\n$50 walmart for $40\n\nHope to trade with you soon (:\n\n[Profile](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2f3ymw\/upretzel729_gcx_rep_profile\/)","214":"[H] $20 PSN [W] $18 PayPal \/ Amazon GC \/ Venmo","215":"[H] Paypal [W] Amazon","216":"I'm interested in trading PayPal for Amazon.

So a $25 Amazon GC will start at $25 and decrease by a few cents for every person watching ads for that item. If 20 people are watching ads then the amount that each ad decreases the item by is doubled (I still haven't actually seen this yet). You also earn Vidfall reward points for watching the ads that can be used to instantly reduce the price by up to $1 at a time. Anyone can buy the item at anytime even after you used your rewards to reduce the price, so make sure you buy the item fast after using your points.\n\n**Q**: How cheap can you get items for?\n\n**A**: There is a minimum. A $25 GC stopped at $0.51 at which time watching more ads or applying rewards will not reduce the amount. I am still trying to figure out if this is the minimum for every item or if it varies based on the item.\n\n**Q**: What happens if you try to reduce the price of the item below the minimum?\n\n**A**: You will lose your reward points but the price will not be reduced. Do not waste them hoping you can get items for cheaper\/free.\n\n**Q**: Can I just get more reward points by leaving my internet browser watching ads on an expensive item?\n\n**A**: No, after so many ads you will need to refresh the tab in order to keep getting credit. This becomes obvious when you will see some \"10 people watching\" but can watch the price only go down 1-2 times every ~30 seconds, showing that only 1-2 people are actually there getting credit and reducing price for their ads watched.\n\n**Q**: How many items does vidfall \"auction\" at a time?\n\n**A**: Vidfall has 6 categories and sells 1 item in each category at a time. Tech &amp; Innovation, Entertainment, Video Games, Cooking &amp; Wine, Fitness &amp; Fashion, and New Hampshire (where vidfall is based).\n\n**Q**: Can I look ahead for specific items I may want?\n\n**A**: Yes. If you select the current item in a category, you can look ahead at the next 10 items to be sold in that category. You can also setup email alerts for when a specific future item goes up for auction.\n\n**Q**: Can I get alerted when an item reaches a specific price?\n\n**A**: Not that I have seen yet. You can jump in to buy an item at any time, but they encourage people to watch the ads.\n\n**Q**: How long does it take to receive your order?\n\n**A**: Of the giftcard codes I have bought so far, I received 1 within ~5 minutes, while another 1 I still haven't received yet about 20 hours later.\n\nOverall I really like this site. I feel like you really need to wait for the right opportunity to get an item for cheap. I suggest when watching an item to watch an ad then look at how many times the price went down to see how many people are actually watching the item. Remember though that anyone can jump in and buy the item even though only one other may actually watching the ads.\n\nI also want to warn you that not all items on vidfall are worth what they are being sold for. Just because an item is $40 off the starting value, doesn't mean its even worth that value. For example there is currently an iPad Air 2 which retails and starts at $499, but when its down to $450, you aren't saving $40, you are actually spending $10 more than you can get it for on Amazon.

It\u2019s currently on the KDP free 5 day promo so I've yet to make any money yet but I figured I\u2019d share my experience with you all up to this point as well as what I've done to rank the eBook. Lawn care and info products are both very cheap businesses that almost anyone can get started with. I know that a lot of you are looking for low cost businesses to try out so I hope this is a worthwhile read.\n\n**The Lawn Care Business**\n\nAfter reading countless posts on here about all the different types of businesses people working on, I figured I had to try something out for myself.  Instead of looking for a regular job last summer I decided to start a lawn care business with a buddy of mine.  We found a program with our city that was offering $1,500 to student to start their own business and it looked like a perfect opportunity for us so we sent in an application. We got accepted to the program and away we went.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t have a truck so we ended up attaching my dad\u2019s old trailer to my car with a trailer hitch attachment that cost around $250. Although it\u2019s less professional looking than a truck, we made do with what we had.\n\nBefore we started marketing, I made sure to read as much as I possibly could about small business marketing techniques for lawn care so my time and money would be well spent.  Even though there is tons of information on the subject, it\u2019s pretty clear that there is no one marketing technique that beats all the rest so we just decided we would try everything and see for ourselves what worked. Finding customers was a lot harder than we thought and we had to hustle pretty hard but once we had a few loyal customers that trusted us, we started getting more and more referrals.  If you want to learn more about running a lawn care business you can download my guide for free on Amazon until Saturday.\n\n**The Kindle Book**\n\nWhen the season finished, we closed the business for the year and went back to school but I felt like I needed something to continue working on.  I needed something that was cheap to start that I could do in my spare time.  I\u2019ve heard of a lot of people making a decent amount of money through Kindle and Udemy so I figured I would give info products a try. \n\nIf I had to pick someone who inspired me the most it would definitely be Pat Flynn from The Smart Passive Income Blog. After seeing how he created an entire site around becoming a security guard without ever being one and ended up making tons of money off it, I figured I could do something similar in a niche where I actually had experience in.  \n\nAm I a lawn care guru with 25 years of experience? No. Do I have enough knowledge that I could help out others who will be starting their own lawn care business? Absolutely.  After reading a few lawn care guides, I felt like I definitely had some new valuable information to bring to the table. The great thing about running my lawn care business was that it allowed me to test out different marketing techniques and see which worked best and how to do them properly.  A lot of the books in the lawn care niche seemed a bit dated so I wanted to include some newer online marketing methods as well.  \n\nMy main priority was to write the book that I wish I had before I started my lawn care business and to help people avoid the making same mistakes that I made. I also wanted the books to have a focus on keeping costs as low as possible when getting the business started so that almost anyone can give it a try. I spent about 2 months writing the book because I wanted to be thorough and I really wanted it to be a good book. I spent a lot of time researching the industry as I went along and wrote the whole thing myself.  \n\nAfter hours of writing and editing it was finally done. I posted a contest on Freelancer for $30 to have a cover designed and picked the one I liked the best.  I got the book formatted properly on Fiverr for $5. I decided to launch it on Kindle since Amazon has almost completely taken over the eBook market and they had the option to promote it for free to get the word out about the book. The Kindle application process is pretty simple and the book was up on the site pretty quick.\n\nTo market the book, I\u2019ve been trying out a few different methods. The way the free promo works is that you try to get as many free downloads as possible to boost your ranking in the kindle store which will partially carry over when the book is switched back to paid.\n\n**1. Choosing keywords** \nI spent about an hour researching good keyword for my niche in Google\u2019s keyword planner to use for my book and made sure to put a few of them in the title and subtitle to help the book rank better. I looked for keywords that were not being used by my competitors on Amazon as well so I could rank first for them in the Amazon search.\n\n**2. Promoting on free eBook sites**\nThere are plenty of free sites and blogs where free eBooks are promoted so I started there first.  A few of the sites charge money for promoting your free book and I did end up spending a bit to have a few sites post it (about $5). Before spending any money to have it promoted on a site, I would quickly run the url through trafficestimate.com to see how much traffic they were generating and if it would be worth the investment. It took a long time to submit it to all the sites since there\u2019s so many of them.  I\u2019ve heard of people hiring virtual assistants to submit it for you so if you\u2019re thinking of launching your book you can consider trying that but I just really wanted to spend as little money as possible.\n\n**3. Social media promotions**\nI also took to Facebook and Twitter to promote the book.  There are plenty of communities of people who love getting free books to read so I made sure that they could download it as well.  Even if some of them never end up reading it, their downloads definitely helped the sales rank.\n\n**4. Amazon categories**\nFor each book on Amazon there\u2019s a bestseller rank that will determine how far up your book will be placed in each category. I wanted my book to be in the top 5 for each category I listed it under and I wanted the book to be in the category with the most searches.  To do this, I first listed the book under the \u201cLawns\u201d category.  Since there isn\u2019t too much competition in this category, my free book hit #1 pretty quick. Although it was in the #1 spot, I figured there wasn\u2019t many searches in \u201cLawns\u201d so I moved it into the \u201cStarting a New Business\u201d section once I had a high enough bestseller rank to be placed in the top 5. From there, it climbed to #1. Amazon allows you to choose 2 categories so I put it under \u201cEntrepreneurship\u201d as well where it hit #2.\n\n**5. Reviews**\nReviews are one of the most important things on Amazon so I gave the book out to a few friends and family members and asked them to leave a review.\n\nIf I end up writing another book I would start marketing waaaay earlier. For this book, I only started submitting it to free book sites a day before it was launched.  There are plenty of sites that promote free ebooks that I missed out on because they required that books be submitted a week or even a month in advance. \nSo far, the book has got around 600 free downloads in the last 3 days but I\u2019ll have to wait until Saturday when it gets switched back to paid to see how many real sales it will get.  Once the promo is over, I\u2019ll switch it to $.99 which will allow me to post it on more sites that only promote books that are a dollar. \n\n**TL;DR** \u2013 Started a lawn care business last summer and wrote and eBook about how to do it for under $2,000\n\nThe book will be free until Saturday and you can get it [here](http:\/\/amzn.to\/1CUPKLn)\n\nIf you enjoy the content of the book please consider leaving it an honest review through this [link](http:\/\/amzn.to\/1wqZgAO), I would really appreciate it\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to keep you all updated with how it goes.  If you have any questions about lawn care or info products I\u2019d be happy to answer them!\n","239":"(H) $15 Amazon Gift Card (W) $15 Riot Points","240":"I have two $5 Amazon Codes that I'll trade for $9 Paypal, obo.\n\nMy rep\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2rs44o\/udaithe_gcx_rep_profile\/","241":"Hello.

I learned a lot of lessons in that month of business but decided to shelf my future ideas due to my second daughter coming into the world.\n\nFast forward to mid summer of 2014 and my daughter was getting older and things were starting to go back to normal. I started to get that itch again to start something. I got it because I am underpaid in what I currently do full time. Now, don't get me wrong I make an ok income... but it's not enough to support a family of four.\n\nI tried applying to various jobs, even some with relocation potential. I've had various interviews but they never quite land, or they don't want to pay me enough. Everytime I get a potential lead on a new job and I get turned down I get furious. I think to myself I'll show those fuckers. I'm going to be bigger. I'm going to be better. \n\nIn 2014 I started a website. Originally it's goal was to be an affiliate marketing site using Amazon's services. But, as I got more and more frustrated I decided to turn it into a wholesale supply site as well for my product. I decided to make this switch in September and since then I have been creating two-three blog entries a week with hopes of getting ranked high in SEO.\n\nWell, I feel like I'm starting to get some traction this month. I've been contacted 8 times asking for quotes on wholesale product. Problem being 7 of them were outside the country. I don't feel that I am ready for export at this time. But, I have one customer who I'm supposed to hear back tomorrow on a $32,000 dollar sale. If I get the deal I stand to make $2,800 in profit. (I know the margin sucks.) But, I think he will be a repeat customer.\n\nI had an Amazon recruiter contact me today out of the blue. She said she found my LinkedIn profile and really liked what she saw. She asked if I'd be willing to relocated to Seattle. I responded HELL YES and sent her my resume. She responds a few minutes later saying I didn't see any college on your resume, so I cannot continue your interview. Just like that, all of my qualifications are thrown out the window because I didn't attend a college. Never-mind that I run operations for a $30 million dollar company and that she was impressed by my resume. \n\nI was and am still angry. The liquor has calmed me down, but now I am even more motivated to pursue my business. Words cannot describe how angry I am. The only outlet I have now is to build my business. Maybe I'll get twenty more customers this year who will buy $30,000 worth of product. \n\nWhen I was younger my outlet was weight lifting, now thanks to time constraints and back issues that is out of the question. I can't let my anger out. Now the only way I can is with this business. Building a giant fuck you to everyone who rejected me.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm doing this for the right reasons.\n\n","243":"i have a $25 itunes gift card as well as an $15 gift card for a combined $40. i'm looking to swap it for either a Gamestop, Bestbuy, or an Amazon Gift Card.

TurboTax isn\u2019t just apologizing, but will refund your money.\n\n&gt;Beginning Friday, TurboTax\u2019 maker Intuit (INTU) will issue $25 refunds back to any TurboTax customer forced to buy the most expensive version of the company\u2019s software this year after buying the less-costly Deluxe version last year. Intuit has put a link up on its Web site (turbotax.intuit.com\/25back) where TurboTax customers can claim their refund.\n\n&gt;There\u2019s been a uproar among TurboTax users this year after Intuit announced a major change that amounted to a price hike on investors. Starting this tax year, any investor who sold even a single share of stock was forced to buy TurboTax Premier, which is the most expensive consumer version of the desktop software. In years past, the Deluxe version would handle capital gains calculations.\n\n&gt;TurboTax users have taken to the Web to protest the change, including writing scathing reviews at Amazon.com. Some even were switching to H&amp;R Block\u2019s competing software \u2013 as H&amp;R Block (HRB) was luring the customers away.\n\n&gt;In addition to refunding $25 to affected customers, TurboTax General Manager Sasan Goodarzi is issuing a lengthy written apology to TurboTax customers for the change. \u201cWe messed up. We made a change this year to TurboTax desktop software and we didn\u2019t do enough to communicate this change to you as proactively and broadly as we could or should have. I am very sorry for the anger and frustration we may have caused you,\u201d says Goodarzi in a letter to customers that was shared with USA TODAY by Intuit.\n\n&gt;The $25 refund will be offered to customers who bought TurboTax Deluxe desktop software and filed their 2013 return \u2013 and have to upgrade to TurboTax Premier or Home &amp; Business to file their 2014 return.\n\n&gt;\u201cI deeply regret the anger and distress we have caused those of you affected by this change,\u201d Goodarzi wrote in the statement. \u201cOur hope is that we can regain your trust and demonstrate that our commitment to you has never been stronger.\u201d\n","267":"I purchased a jumper recently which went on sale for \u00a355.

I returned my \u00a355 Jumper, and repurchased it for \u00a340, saving myself around \u00a310 (after delivery costs).\n\nSo, the moral of my story:\n\nAlways monitor the price of anything you purchase, two weeks after you purchase it.\n\nI say two weeks because in the UK that is how long stores usually give you to return an item for a refund.

I\u2019m not incredibly intelligent, and I\u2019m not even that good at programming. I didn\u2019t even work very hard. If it sounds too good to be true, thats because it basically was. Well was is in the past tense, and sadly the times have changed.\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EM5h4TV.jpg - iphone sales\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GQpFeuC.png - getting $3,000 in a January month on Amazon (January is the best month, all the kids have gift cards) \n\niTunes Profile - \n\nA story first, then I\u2019ll tell you how to do it. Sometime a long ass time ago, lets just say 2009 or so, our family laptop died. I begged and begged my parents to get a mac so I could try to develop an app. I guess I was like 12 or so at the time. Eventually we did purchase a mac and I soon installed Xcode (the software required to code iPhone apps, native to mac only). Me and my pops love sports so I decided to make an app about the New York Yankees. Biographies of their famous ball players. I sent my app into apple for their review process, and they accepted my app on to the store. It went for sale, and that night felt like the excitement of Christmas morning, waiting to see how many sales it would get. I got 5 sales for a profit of $3.50. I was so excited!! Still remember the feeling and exactly where I was when it happened, me mom and dad all checked together and were so excited to see it sold. Sounds lame, but one of the happiest moments of my life. https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/yankee-biographies\/id359562630?mt=8 The app is still on the store today, and while simple it\u2019s made over $1,000 in its time on the store. \n\nBut it started out very slowly, this isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme more then likely, unless you happen to make the next version of flappy bird. It\u2019s not about building customer base or a emailing list, its about just putting out apps. I continued to do this and eventually published one of my first free apps onto iPhone 4. The app is called Annoying Frequencies and is just loud as fuck dog whistle sounds. https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/annoying-frequencies-hearing\/id408266253?mt=8 It was cool I guess but not that cool. Regardless we were on vacation and I decided to change the price of the app to free. It somehow climbed the chart all the way up to top 50 free on the app store. Just dumb luck, but it received over 20,000 downloads in a day. It was free, but it drove tons of traffic to my other apps, and sales were amazing after that.\n\nI kept making more and more apps, and one of them I\u2019m most proud of is this one. https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/the-ultimate-no-life-test\/id475221291?mt=8 It received some actual press from articles written about the absurdity of it. Simple, yet fun. Perfect for a mobile device. While its made me a total of $0.00 its been fun and maybe driven business to my other apps.\n\n **But you guys missed the fucking boat kinda** 2010 to 2011 to 2012 in the app store was the American Frontier, the Wild West if you will. We were all those guys selling magic elixir at the side of the road, and people sure were buying it up. I made a boat load of money those years. iPhones saw massive rises in numbers, while the amount of apps on the store stayed relatively small. It was heaven. I made more then my parents one month.\n\nFast forward to the future. The ship has sailed. The market is saturated. This isn't guaranteed $200 a week for every new app now a day.But this isn't a tale of depression, you can still make money albeit less then before. Still, this is a great business at start up costs are so little. Heres how you do it. \n\n\n**How to do it**\n\nNo coding will be needed so don't sprint to walmart to buy an objective c book.\n\n**Step 1.** Download Gamesalad (iphone\/ipad\/android\/amazon publishing tool)\n\n**Step 2**. Go here. https:\/\/help.gamesalad.com\/hc\/en-us\/categories\/200134158-Cookbook-Tutorials\n\n**Step 3**. Do the tutorials.\n\n**Step 4**. Now that you have a basic understanding of gamesalad, you can probably modify a template. Go here. http:\/\/www.deepblueapps.com and gshelper.com These will allow you to purchase templates to modify.\n\n**Step 5**. Choose a template where all you have to do is change the graphics.\n\n**Step 6.** Replace the graphics.\n\n**Step 7**. Create icons and all the submission shit.\n\n**Step 8**. CHARGE A FUCKING DOLLAR FOR THE APP. you can make it free if you want, but it won't pay off. Unless its really damn good and will make other users say \"this guys a fucking boss, I'll check out his other apps.\"\n\n**Step 9**. Publish to either Amazon or iOS platforms.\n\n**Step 10**. Start all over.\n\nOkay so why did I share this, well it's no fun anymore. The market is getting saturated and theres a bunch of BS will people claiming copyrights. Top moments of my app career were.\n\nBeing on vacation and finding out, \"Holy Shit\", I'm in the top 50 free apps, I just made over $100 a day with traffic from this. I remember walking around the parking garage I was in on cloud fucking 9. A wonderful feeling.\n\nGetting banned from the Android store for copyright infringement due to Minecrafts mean lawyers and me not checking my email.\n\nBuying myself a nice bike with the money, and I ride it every day.\n\n\n\n**SOME TIPS**\n\nMake what sells. I tried hard to make apps \"good\" and I got fucked by it every time. Basically making an app that appeals to mature people is a good way to make $0. \n\nQuantity over quality. Yup, you won't here that from many people, but thats cause the world is full of bullshitters.\n\nSo get going, I've made apps in 2 hours before. Quantity over quality.

If you decide to skip, please still check the business model out**\n\n**Back story feel free to skip**: A little while ago I was 'diagnosed' with a digestive disorder. The exact type is yet to be discovered so they did what every *great* doctor does and put me in the blanket category that is IBS. No matter what I did (including eating ONLY chicken, rice and carrots for 20 days continuously (an extreme version of FODMAP diet)) helped.\n\nSo I used my research and analysis skills gained at Uni (woohoo a use for Uni!) and scanned the internet archives for as many scientific journals, articles, books and thesis I could find. I then decided to write documents to help me narrow down the possibilities of what I could have. I then asked my Dad (a seasoned medical practitioner) to read through them and he thought they were great. ***Queue Light Bulb***. Other people might be interested in these, maybe I'll turn them into mini-books and sell them via Amazon Kindle.\n\n**Business Model:** Can be found here https:\/\/canvanizer.com\/canvas\/lxF38JBlFqE\n\n**Mission Statement:** Help people understand their diagnosis and learn how to live with them through short, affordable, scientifically-accurate yet Eli5 style information.\n\n**Products:** If you buy a $0.99 book for the sole purpose of providing feedback I'll send you a $0.99 Amazon voucher :) http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00NNS5HHM\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00ODBAGD8\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00OQ6XGOG\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00RNZ7BMK\n\n**Site:** http:\/\/www.adamwebberhealth.com\/\n\n**Basic Financials**\n\n**Monthly Income Per Book (with no marketing)**: $5 (obviously fluctuated significantly)\n\n**Fixed Costs:** Site - $100 Annually\n\n**Variable Costs:** $10.50 Per Book\n\n**Break-even prediction:** 5 months after startup (I'm 4 months in)\n\n****\n\n**2.

I was looking through the FAQ about credit cards, but I'm still having a hard time grasping what is right for me. Any advice would be great. \n\nI am about to graduate college and have never had a credit card. I am 22 years old. I know I really needed to start building credit, like, yesterday. I'm moderately frugal and never spend anywhere close to my means. Therefore I'm not really worried about not being able to pay anything back as I already have quite a large savings (around 15k) and have a well paying job for next year. \n\nI live in NYC, so I don't spend money on gas basically ever. I do use Amazon a lot. I spend a lot on groceries, as I try not to eat out and cook for myself. I love to travel, and it would be cool if my credit card made that easier for me. \n\nSo that's a basic summary of myself. I got a Chase Freedom credit card in the mail and it seems fine, but I don't like the 5% rotating cash back. I will basically *never* use the gas rotation, and although I do go to restaurants I try not to very often. That is two of the four rotations. However, Chase is the bank I use for all of my finances, so it would be nice to stay with them. I think. I genuinely have no idea if it would make a difference to use another bank's card.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nTLDR: I am a very frugal and financially secure college student who wants advice on a credit card. I do not spend money on gas. I spend most on groceries and Amazon. I like to travel. I would prefer to stay with Chase, I think.

I did not include some that I have not heard enough about to be sure they are legitimate or worthwhile. I have an Android phone, so nothing iPhone only.

Then you open the links (I think you have to leave them open for 30 seconds to count), and get $0.02. It took mine a few days to give me anything, but the \"emails\" have come steadily since then.

They can pull these tactics much better than BestBuy, Costco, or any B&amp;M store with an online entity. \n\nWith a B&amp;M store you cant have prices changing as rapidly as Amazon. Let's take BestBuy for example. To quickly change they're prices, they would do it online and must sent out a message to all of its B&amp;M to change the prices on the shelves. This takes time and manpower. *Ohh wait, Amazon just bumped it back up!* Send out message and change the prices again. Amazon can coordinate this very easily, once they change the price it will only be affecting one place; they're online store.\n\nAmazon has also put in place a price checker. If you find it lower on a different site, just submit a ticket. This gives Amazon on hot items that people want. If BestBuy is having a TV on sale, submit a ticket. Anyone else who is interested will submit on too. Amazon can quickly see that this item is *hot*, and quickly price match BestBuy. \n\nAs far as tricking go, its all subconscious. There are millions of people shopping on Amazon 24\/7. And there are thousands looking for deals. When you get on Amazon at 1:00 in the afternoon, you see a great deal on a TV. The Amazon team has already done they're job in putting the TV at a competitive price.

If you have a lot of liquid available, I'd just by an online gift card to Amazon.  I mean, you know that you'll spend it eventually, right?  If you don't have $2k to spend up front, you might have to resort to MS.","468":"I sometimes do home made noodle bowls. fill a closeable dish with left over thin spaghetti or dry ramen, seasonings, dehydrated veggies from Amazon, maybe some beef jerky or tofu cubes. then just add water and zap in the micro at work.\n\nalso, ploughmans lunches are nice. a few boiled eggs, crusty bread, cheese slices, pickled veggies if you're into those. alternatively, you can Korean spin it with kimchi and noodles.","469":"Our company implemented a peer awards program with some social aspect where you can compliment employees on a job well done.  They also limited the awards to $25 and put a limit of only a few a quarter.  In addition they changed our awards from a cash award to gift cards, which our company moved to on some misguided study by the gift award association showing that people prefer gift cards to cash.\n\nOverall I'd say it's probably reduced our morale and satisfaction.  The program has been downgraded and many people I know don't want to deal with a gift card.   It could just be our program was poorly setup with limited gift cards and pre-set amounts on those cards.  I haven't seen too many people happy about the program but I've seen many who feel the awards are more of a pain in the ass and are upset by the change.\n\nI hate the social aspect of it too.  Perhaps it's just me but I don't want public acknowledgement of a job well done on some social wall that all my peers can see.  Tell me rather than putting it on some stupid social wall.  \n\nI haven't bothered using it because it's almost offensive to give someone a measly $25.  Managers can authorize more and all the awards I've personally gotten are a larger amount (~$250-$500) and I have to get that in multiple gift cards.  Luckily I can get Amazon and I just transfer them right away.\n\nIt feels like less of an award now. I've disabled the social aspects as I don't see value in them, and feel they are more likely to make other employees upset when you get one and they don't.\n\nIt's not a perk.  It's a way for the company to save money in the end.  A massive downgrade from the previous system.","470":"&gt; Darkcoin has the unique ability to obfuscate transactions so that they can\u2019t be traced back to an individual. As far as I know this is the only cryptocurrency that has the potential for truly anonymous transactions and transaction history built into it.  \n\nI don't really agree with your libertarian diatribe in general, but the quote above is factually incorrect. Monero and every other Bytecoin fork offer privacy features using ring signatures and one-time stealth addresses that are built into the protocol (Darkcoin is a Bitcoin clone with some mixing services tacked on; Monero\/Bytecoin are a completely new code base). If you're worried about Uncle Sam peeking at your transactions, then you should be aware that many of the masternodes that perform the mixing for Darkcoin are hosted on Amazon and other large corporate VPSs. You don't think a major corporation would reject a three-letter agency from snooping on the traffic of these masternode servers. Even if they were all privately hosted, I'm pretty sure said three-letter agencies are more than capable of snooping on the traffic of nearly any IP address.  \n\nHere is a link to a question on stackoverflow addressing this:  \nhttp:\/\/bitcoin.stackexchange.com\/questions\/29471\/are-there-any-true-anonymous-cryptocurrencies  \n\nA snippet from the answer by Andrew Poelstra:  \n&gt; And by the way, Darkcoin does not provide anonymity. They attached a (broken) implementation of CoinJoin to the ordinary Bitcoin client, and at least initially released it as a closed-source software.  ","471":"I bought to spend. It's now cheaper to buy stuff from Amazon in EU than US.","472":"Lasers use toner.  As I said earlier, I get about 2,000 pages from generic toner cartridges that come from Amazon for $10 shipped.  You can print 2 labels per page, so 4,000 labels for $10. At 2 and a half tenths of a cent per label, I'm not going to waste time trying to cut that down. Cheaper than toner or thermal labels, even factoring in regular paper costs.  Easier for me, since I don't need to swap paper or labels when switching from packing slips to shipping labels. ","473":"Just like you, I also have a full time job and a family.  My husband is fully supportive of me flipping as a hobby.  I am thinking of starting FBA on Amazon and I don't plan on quitting my job.  You did it and I think I can too.  Thank you for sharing your story.","474":"It sounds like you might already have inventory but people around here seem to prefer drop shipping (if the costs work out favorably). There are two routes you could take regarding getting found, which one you go with depends on what value your company offers. If you offer competitive rates, create and pay to promote listings on large marketplaces like eBay and Amazon. Eventually you might do enough volume to justify creating your own website but until that point sticking to an established marketplace is a much safer bet. If you do not have competitive rates, you can offer value in other ways. You might run an HVAC blog, with regular posts that are relevant to your customers and are loaded with SEO keywords. In this way, you can build a following and drive sales directly from these articles (or videos, podcasts, something else entirely). If you dont fit into either of these categories, you might want to ask what value your company offers and then work off promoting that.","475":"Amazons prices are getting worse and worse it seems.","476":"Well, with Amazon you have to label almost everything. If you don't, they can do it for you for $.20\/item. You probably don't want to stick small Avery labels through the printer more than a few times max. So I wouldn't suggest using a regular printer for Amazon product labels.","477":"1. Label printer if you are taking Amazon seriously; if you are just printing out shipping labels you can use a regular laser printer with stick-on labels.\n\n2. As much variety on box\/envelope sizes as possible for eBay\/MF sales. This isn't important for FBA since you send in a big box full of lots of stuff. I'd probably get lots of DVD case-sized padded envelopes and a decent number of 6x6x6 boxes for smaller items. Both are reasonably cheap at Walmart, or you can get them even cheaper (but in bulk) off of eBay. Old newspaper won't save much since it's actually kind've dense compared to other packing materials and it's not very professional. It'll work for some items in a pinch, but shouldn't be relied on for everything. Peanuts are good, airbags are good, bubble wrap is critical for delicate items. Just put a good amount of bubblewrap around the item and then pad the rest with something cheaper like air bags or peanuts. You can also get huge rolls of brown craft paper for pretty cheap some places (Costco used to carry them, not sure about now) which balls up and protects pretty well, but it is still heavier than some alternatives. I use it mainly when packing slightly heavier stuff, where the added weight doesn't really matter. Get good quality packing tape (you do NOT want it ripping or peeling) as it's pretty literally the glue that holds the whole thing together. When in doubt, overtape. Some extra cents for peace of mind and a lower chance of negative feedback, which is a big big deal on eBay these days. And I just use the bulk packs of 3M mailing tape from Costco. Not the cheapest but I don't really have to worry about it failing.\n\n3. Wait on the pro Amazon account unless you are diving in and getting a massive inventory right off the bat, which as a newbie you probably won't and shouldn't. Get a feel for FBA\/Amazon and get some good feedback first. I'm still pretty new to FBA myself and I seriously suggest you take it one step at a time.\n\n4. There are all kinds of apps of various usefulness. I do mainly use the Amazon Seller and eBay apps. Decluttr app can be helpful (it's fast) for scanning dvds\/games\/cds to see if they are worth anything, although don't trust its actual values. If they are worth more than $.50 on Decluttr and they are dirt cheap to buy, they are *probably* worth buying. \n\nTo start off, sourcing will likely be the hard part and you may not manage to even spend the $1000 on (good return) sourced items. You could always buy break-even type stuff to get your feedback going, though.","478":"What is the factory sealed has like a 1 inch long tear but the game is still sealed?

I recommend the Citi Double Cash card (which gives you 2% on all purchases), as well as the Sallie Mae credit card, which gives up to 5% back on gas, groceries, and Amazon purchases.\n\nHowever, it is pretty much foolish to be worried about getting cash back as long as you are paying interest. The interest you pay far outweighs any benefit you get from cash back rewards.\n\nFor your $4000 in debt, I might consider the Chase Slate card, which gives you 0% for 15 months on balance transfers, with no BT fee.

Cheap clothing is generally made with low quality materials that very quickly begin to degrade.

And it's hardly focused on high fashion; you'll see plenty of basic pieces like Levi's jeans, Dockers pants, underwear, boat shoes, etc.\n\nI would hold on to those Amazon cards for other purchases.  They don't have a wide selection of clothing and what they do have is often nowhere near the best price available at any given time.  Uniqlo is one brand you can rely on for consistently well-made clothing at great prices.  I also think that Lands End is really great for the price with one of their near constant 40% off sales.

In your early stages, you need to sale enough product to have enough cash on hand to pay expenses and to put something away for more supplies to make more product.\n\nA few questions:\n\n* Are you going to ship this furniture as made to assemble, or already in one piece? made to assemble would be more cost-effective shipping-wise.\n* Do you have apprehension about selling on Amazon? Don't. This could really kick-start your sales to give you calculable and semi-consistent cash flow base. Your biggest problem starting out will be in advertising a new product in an insanely competitive market. Having something on Amazon gives you cash flow, but also a reputation and the possibility of positive reviews to bolster your brand.\n* Would you be adverse to working out of your garage? You shouldn't be if you have one. It would be a great way to sell product with $0 overhead.\n\nHaving a store, or a place to show your furniture, should be the VERY LAST THING you do. Like, maybe 3 years from now. Would you have a lot of foot-traffic from high-end buyers (average HHI of 150K or more, a thousand people a day minimum)? Overhead from rent needs to be justified from in-person sales. The majority of your sales will most likely be online, so keep that in mind. I know it's a sense of pride to have your own store-front, especially in a honorable and traditional industry like furniture. But really think this one over. I would personally never open a store front unless I can get it in a shopping center that caters to mid-upperclass shoppers with a lot of foot traffic. Your cash flow won't be consistent enough in the first year to pay a monthly rent anyway.\n\nThe problem with a small consumer goods business such as yours is that nowadays you have to already contemplate scaling large. Other competitors are multi-national companies who can move product faster and cheaper than you, especially in dying US manufacturing industries such as textiles and furniture. I would start with Amazon just to give you a taste of sales and getting product ready. This will give you more time to build your brand and start a proper online store and company website. Then, I would attend furniture conventions (High Point, NC and Las Vegas). Get some ideas, mingle with people in the business, meet potential distributors, etc. Then you can have both online sales direct from you and discounted bulk sales to distributors (i.e. Grand Home Furnishings) yearly to give yourself two streams for cash.

Never had Time Warner as we have Comcast here, but with some of the cable providers you pay 7-10 bucks a month for as long as the account is live to rent their modem, but if you provide your own modem they instead charge about the same as a \"service fee\". If that is the case might as well use their shit modem, because even a shit modem can handle 6Mb, their support will have to support it, and if it goes bad they replace it, while if you use a 3rd party modem they will provide almost no support and you have to eat the cost of replacing if something happens. \n\nIf they do not charge you to use your own modem order one online. Amazon can have amazingly cheap new modems without having to go through someone selling secondhand crap that can cut out any time. Bought a couple brand new Netgear N600s on there for 20 bucks about two months ago instead of paying 100 bucks in a store. \n\nRelying on their support is not a big deal, you can easily learn some basic connectivity and troubleshooting and you'll be as qualified as all but their best techs and will never have to call them except to set up dispatches or in case of area outages. Just be patient when you do call, no sense in arguing with them as they are required to treat you like a dumbass and the guy is just trying to earn a check, jump through the hoops and get fixed or get a dispatch out.

The numbers I used were likely average case scenario numbers and I'm up $1.8M more by investing in real estate than if I were to leave the $350,000 in funds in stocks.  It would take a *lot* of unlikely real estate crashes combined with stock bull markets to make up the difference between $3.081M returns in real estate versus the $1.281M returns in stocks. Go ahead and run your own scenarios and you'll see. Mathematics never lies.\n\nAs I've said before in this thread, real estate investing isn't passive like stock market investing. Of course there are additional considerations when investing in real estate that one doesn't have to worry about when investing in stocks (and the same is true vice versa).  Every investor is unique and must make an informed decision as to what is their preference as a result of these considerations. \n\n&gt; It's wait and see because you have a mortgage on top of the property. You have to wait and see if your tenants pay, you have to wait and see if the property appreciates. You have to wait and see about taxes. You have assumption that tenants will just pay so it doesn't matter to you.\n\nAs for the items you've listed:\n\n- Tenant pays? If not, evict (30 days). This will happen occasionally, I've evicted 2 tenants in 5 years and lost 2 months rent out of 18 units as a result (not a bad ratio 18 units x 12 months x 5 years = 1,080 months of rental income; 2 missed due to eviction or 0.1% of the time this may happen on average if you perform both financial checks and criminal checks before accepting a tenant).\n\n- Property appreciates? Short term I don't care. Over 20 years, show me a 20 year history where real estate doesn't appreciate exponentially.  I'm pretty sure you'll agree there's no risk here. Inflation alone will systematically cause appreciation, but this would require a much longer conversation.\n\n- Taxes? Wait and see about taxes? How so? Taxes are mathematical and easy to figure out. Property taxes are covered entirely within the cashflow analysis. Income taxes? Obviously you need to plan for these, not just in real estate investing, but in stock market investing as well.  But, real estate investing offers the benefit of depreciating the value of your real estate annually by 4% in most jurisdictions in both US &amp; Canada thereby offering much more attractive taxation benefits for real estate investors over stock market investors. That being said, stock market investors can leverage American Roth IRA (US) or TFSA (Canada) and can save on annual income taxes via 401K (USA) or RRSP (Canada); and this is another reason why I'm invested in both real estate &amp; stocks; because I can offset my real estate income with even more tax benefits by leveraging stocks.\n\n&gt; Stock are similar, different types of variables. But i can also exit a stock at any time. If my property depreciates, or the neighborhood gets bad I can just up and leave and find a new property.\n\n&gt; For me I look at real estate as i got find a property, and hope it appreciates, then hope I can tenants and upkeep on the property. I don't understand how to find a property right now.\n\nYou are 100% correct in that you can exit stocks at any time, and you don't have the exact same freedom with real estate and this is where due diligence comes into play.  If you consider real estate investing, making prudent informed decisions re: neighborhoods, housing profiles, etc. are vital. If you are truly interested in learning about those challenges you mention I suggest you go to Amazon and pick up a few of the highest rated books (4-5 star with a ton of reviews) and start reading, it'll help fill in the gaps and the more you know, the less you'll worry about the unlikely (and perceived) risks that you are worrying about.","545":"&gt;Agreed, but all scenarios considered (best case, worst case, likely average case) real estate still significantly outperformed stocks. \n\nI don't think this is accurate across all sectors.  I believe in understanding a business over, or looking at just investment vehicles. I believe  securities outperform real estate in general. \n\n&gt; The numbers I used were likely average case scenario numbers and I'm up $1.8M more by investing in real estate than if I were to leave the $350,000 in funds in stocks. It would take a lot of unlikely real estate crashes combined with stock bull markets to make up the difference between $3.081M returns in real estate versus the $1.281M returns in stocks. Go ahead and run your own scenarios and you'll see. Mathematics never lies.\n\nMath can lie. Clearly real estate It depends on your ability to pick properties. Every location isn't the same. But I like I said before knowing the business is really what matters. \n\n&gt;Tenant pays? If not, evict (30 days). This will happen occasionally, I've evicted 2 tenants in 5 years and lost 2 months rent out of 18 units as a result (not a bad ratio 18 units x 12 months x 5 years = 1,080 months of rental income; 2 missed due to eviction or 0.1% of the time this may happen on average if you perform both financial checks and criminal checks before accepting a tenant).\n\nIn downturn several people may not be able to pay. There are other factors as well. I know of companies to hire people just to collect rent. That's a whole another scenario. Part of the game. \n\n&gt;Property appreciates? Short term I don't care. Over 20 years, show me a 20 year history where real estate doesn't appreciate exponentially. I'm pretty sure you'll agree there's no risk here. Inflation alone will systematically cause appreciation, but this would require a much longer conversation.\n\nRight, so I've known of people to buy property and the property depreciates over the course of the mortgage. In better locations surely this may not happen, but it can happen. \n\n&gt;Taxes? Wait and see about taxes? How so? Taxes are mathematical and easy to figure out. Property taxes are covered entirely within the cashflow analysis. Income taxes? Obviously you need to plan for these, not just in real estate investing, but in stock market investing as well. But, real estate investing offers the benefit of depreciating the value of your real estate annually by 4% in most jurisdictions in both US &amp; Canada thereby offering much more attractive taxation benefits for real estate investors over stock market investors.

If you're in Canada, then maybe it's different. \n\n&gt;You are 100% correct in that you can exit stocks at any time, but you don't have the exact same freedom with real estate and this is where due diligence comes into play. If you consider real estate investing, making prudent informed decisions re: neighborhoods, housing profiles, etc. are vital. If you are truly interested in learning about those challenges you mention I suggest you go to Amazon and pick up a few of the highest rated books (4-5 star with a ton of reviews) and start reading, it'll help fill in the gaps and the more you know, the less you'll worry about the unlikely (and perceived) risks that you are worrying about.\n\nYep.

Does the business require a local presence? (Can it be run by anyone, anywhere?)\n\n2. Do you have the work\/processes documented? (Would you be willing to do this before listing?)\n\nWe have some buyers\/investors specifically looking for site that have some work.

Most of the time they're pump and dump jobs, and you usually never want to get in after the 2nd day (some stocks are the exception though look at AZFL before it went back down-hill). I watched that video by the CEO, and it honestly sounded like a crock of shit. He acted like there was some \"exclusive\" deal with Amazon, but it honestly was nothing more than what any average tech-savvy individual can pay for to get their content hosted by the AWS program. Maybe I'm wrong though, and Amazon did \"contact him\", but that PR and video didn't clear up anything, rather make it even more confusing as to what this deal means for the company. He also acted as if he didn't increase the toxic financing to bring his share value down from .10, and it was all the \"crooked shorts\", but these CEOs are all the same. \n\nThey use the shareholders, until there's nothing left, and then R\/S or attempt to resurrect their stock with some pump news like this. Honestly, can't believe it even got that high, but I'll be watching this thing to see if any new developments happen. I sold out EOD of the first day btw, but probably should have held knowing that these things usually have another day of momentum before going bust again.

Shouldn't cost *more than* around $20. If you get ANYTHING else make it a stainless steel one and I'd just pop into a local Goodwill. Look for copper bottom Revereware pans. I got mine for $6 and it's huge, looks brand new and is amazing. I also got a 10\" cast iron from Amazon because it was (is?) $14 now. Boom.\n\nPot: I dunno quart sizes but look for something you can make a nice stew in and I'd thrift it. Either copper bottom same as above or something heavy that feels like cast iron. Once you have a cast iron you'll know. I have a copper bottom and a cast iron (forget brand) at home. Both should have glass lids. Why glass? Helps you see inside without letting out steam.\n\nRice cooker thing: well I seriously can't live without it. I thrifted mine brand new for $15 so whatever. Same with a coffee machine. I use both daily so it's $$ well spent.\n\nSmall sauce pan. I'd thrift one. Lift up pans and buy one that's heavy. Can't go wrong with Revereware.\n\nWooden spoons. Can also double as a thing to paddle your SO with in bed. Also I'd thrift up: a spatula, a big scooping type spoon (metal or plastic, I have both), a wine bottle opener, one of those pronged scooping spoons ... if you go to thrift stores really a lot of cookware is super cheap in the little stuff department :)\n\nI ponied up for nice knives. I actually got a brand called *Kai Pure Komachi 2* that are apparently amazing for cheap via Amazon. A chef's knife, a pairing knife (or small all purpose) and a small serrated knife. I think it's cheapest to buy them in the set. Ikea also sells pretty OK knives for cheap. I'd seriously invest in a **quality** chef's knife. I have a Shun on my wishlist. \n\nIf all you have is a pot, a cast iron skillet and a quality chef's knife you're better off than having 10,000 pieces of crap garbage suggested ITT.","596":"&gt;That's quite a reasonable percentage (albeit maybe a few points high) considering that they provide a trusted payment\/transaction\/driver system through which consumer trust flows to strangers that they would not have normally trusted and they do all of the marketing.\n\nNot really.

Look at VISA, Mastercard, etc... as a comparable commoditized business. That's more or less all they're doing plus some some basic app development and maintenance. Hell, look at Amazon's affiliate marketing program: https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\/gp\/associates\/join\/compensation.html\n\n20-25% is INSANE.","597":"Check out the Sallie Mae mastercard. If it's available in Canada, I think it's what you want. No annual fee and 5% back on gas, groceries, and books (including Amazon.com).

Biotech\/pharma isn't any different: A dollar of profit from ISIS is worth exactly the same as a dollar of profit from DIS.\n\n&gt; and that these few parameters (FCF, net income, PE etc.) are not enough to say whether price is matched to value.\n\nAgain, a dollar of profit from one company is exactly the same as that for another. Dollars aren't worth more on account of difficulty. You can argue that there are certain ways to augment biotech\/pharma\/basically any heavy R&amp;D-type firm's financials by capitalizing the R&amp;D expense, and then amortizing it over a certain time period, but at the end of the day you're just making an adjustment to how Net income\/FCF\/ROE\/Book value is calculated, you're not omitting them all together.

(or a medallion)\n\n&gt; No it isn't.

Amazon is getting warmer, but still very different. Amazon is still closing the deal, utilizing their brand, providing all infrastructure to even support the would be ad partner, it's a different market with much smaller margins, and most importantly, again, it is utilizing Amazon's branding.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying it couldn't be a little lower, but I am saying it isn't insane. \n\nTo understand what you're talking about, we need to look at this as if we're the driver, and the driver is a company of one.\n\nThinking of it this way let's revisit the 25%. That's like 5%+- SGA (Uber's 5 % is half of 10% SGA budget,  since they provide part of the support and the app infrastructure) and 20%+- towards marketing costs.\n\nSGA costs vary, but we'll call 10% a safe of midground as a total to be split. \nMore importantly, 20% on marketing is quite reasonable for someone competing against the de facto option in the space. \n\nWorth noting; Microsoft, a goliath, not a budding company that needs to put every damn penny into marketing, still spent 18% of revenue on marketing this past year, and 20% the year before that.

Say there is a \"best\" product with highest reviews already in a particular field, is there a chance for success just focusing on trying to sell that thru the program? or better off with working within an entire category and doing the comparison chart thing, giving people options and letting them decide (which seems is what you've done with your site). \n\nYour product is a several hundred dollar purchase, which is considerable and I would imagine people would want to research first before buying, so a whole niche site dedicated to comparing them makes sense, but with just one product.. is there any tips for that. \n\nPersonally I find Amazon reviews by users the best research that can be found. They weed out the bots and fake profiles to large degree (I think). I've found the reviews really on target. Yet, you and others doing niche sites still somehow manage to end up with some degree of financial success!? It's interesting with the various tactics.

My brother subscribes to one of the Motley Fool newsletters, for example, and when they discuss past performance, they regularly quote returns as you you had sold at or near the peak (e.g., they claim a 35x return on AMZN because they suggested buying at $10).  If it's a buy-and-hold-forever pick, that's fine, but some stock recommendations come with \"buy at or below $X\" and \"sell at or above $Y\" or similar.  Obviously, your opinion changes over time, but it seems like that should be part of the analysis template.\n\nAgain, I'm not even an armchair investor, so maybe there's a good reason to not include sell signals.","634":"Dropbox is more well known.

This drug will not be making the company any money, or show up on the company's financials, until it has been put into production, and launched to the market.\n\nThis can be applied to ANY company with a substantial R&amp;D budget (AMZN Fire phone, MSFT Surface, etc. etc.), not just biotech\/pharma. Doesn't mean you can't value them.\n","637":"A lot of streaming services are starting to produce their own. They've been producing their own content since Lilyhammer in Jan 2012. Hulu and Amazon have joined the mix. Where Netflix beats the other stream-only services at this point is an earlier international perspective. It's one of the few areas Netflix has to expand into and it's really important they do it well. ","638":"You could say the same thing about AMZN 15 years ago. Online shopping? Anyone can set up a website for that, so why do they dominate the landscape? There's a lot of value in doing something well first.\n\nYou say Google could basically destroy Netflix overnight, but if they could, why don't they? If it's a guaranteed success, would they be leaving that money on the table?

And their streaming service is even propped up by people who subscribe for the free shipping.\n\nPersonally, I have Netflix and Prime accounts, and I don't even think to look at Amazon when I want to watch something. I think one reason is the a la carte cost for a lot of their content. How am I supposed to binge watch Agents of SHIELD at $1.99 an episode? I'm not saying they don't have lots of free titles, their service is better than I'm giving them credit for. And that's my point: they have to overcome the established perceptions of idiot consumers like myself.\n\nI think you're underestimating the value of the Netflix brand, which was established when they were the first to get the business model right.","639":"Appreciate the response.   But disagree on a couple of points.   On subscription model being foreign to Google.   This is not true as they are now doing subscription for streaming music.   \n\nI don't agree on the cable companies being a competitor.   They are so lost I have zero faith in them doing anything but a slow death.\n\nRecently Schmidt indicated that Google's #1 competitor is AMZN.   If this is true then AMZN providing streaming is a competitor to Google.\n\nI do agree on the profit.   That is the #1 reason I don't think Google has pursued.   This is why I just don't buy into NetFlix longer term success.   How will you get margins when someone argues that there is a lack of competitors because of profit?   What am I missing with this? \n\nBut I would be surprised if we don't see Google ease into providing a competing capability over the next 24 months if not sooner.   It seems like it would be really easy for them to offer such a service.   Google would have lower cost than NFLX, better leverage and other advantageous, IMO.\n\n\n \n","640":"&gt; No it doesn't mean you can't value them, but it means that their financials do not give a complete view of the company. \n\nThen what does? Financials don't give a complete view of ANY company (Maybe LGE will have a box office hit next quarter that saves their balance sheet, maybe DIS new themepark will outdraw all the others combined, maybe AMZN next foray into mobile will be more successful), but they're the best indicator of what's going on.\n\nYour point is that because R&amp;D takes longer to materialize into profitability, it makes these firms inherently more uncertain, and thus typical fundamental analysis isn't appropriate. My point is that inherent uncertainty applies to EVERY stock, and that there are ways to augment the financials (capitalizing R&amp;D, adding it back to FCF, etc. etc.) that results in fundamental analysis being just as valid for them, as for any other stock.","641":"The problem is that someone like Google has many advantegous over NetFlix.   Honestly, Amazon has advantageous over NetFlix.\n\nYes, I get they are first movers and great brand.   Very, very popular in our house.   But that does not secure you great profits and long term success, IMO.  \n\nWe were one of the first to use NetFlix service.   We are grandfathered to more discs outstanding at a time because of this.   We started using the streaming service right when it became available, bla, bla, bla.\n\nBut honestly it is a click of a button and I am watching something on a competitor.   How do you get margins?   We watch Amazon on Fire Stick and NetFlix on whatever is attached to the particular TV.   If I turn on TV and input is on Fire Stick and what I want to watch is on Amazon then Amazon is where I watch it.\n\nAmazon and Google also know a lot more about me and my family than NetFlix.

For most of the past half decade, they were THE place people streamed stuff... that name recognition and familiarity make a huge difference in terms of attracting and retaining customers. What 'competitive advantage' did Facebook have over Google Plus? Hell, according to an oft-reposted TIL, AOL still makes bank on dialup by virtue of their first mover advantage...\n\nAlso, by virtue of their huge customer base, they have probably the best data set in the industry on what people watch and how they watch it. Don't think they don't have a room full of quants coming up with precise metrics on what type of content they need to be investing in, and how much they need to pay for it.\n\nThis last is kind of huge in this space and doesn't get enough attention. The economic difficulties of streaming are a *far* bigger hurdle than the technical ones. Traditional providers like HBO haven't taken so long to make the jump because they're idiots, they've just taken this long to cone up with a workable business plan for it. (And they still might not have one - ostensibly HBO's over the top offering will be dropping this April, but we still haven't heard details or pricing). Suffice to say, it's a complicated business sector that Netflix has proved their ability to navigate.\n\nMy biggest concern with them going forward would be one of overextension. With the increasingly crowded market, they are being pushed into a bit of an arms race in terms of original content, \"theatrical releases\" and other such developing sectors. When House of Cards dropped, it made a huge splash... Marco Polo, not so much. But they have a solid slate lined up for this year, and the recent sight-unseen Woody Allen deal Amazon signed sounds like a huge debacle for The Other Guys, so they should be positioned pretty well for the time being.","645":"Scammers are part of business.

I buy so much on Amazon that when there is an issue, a new product is shipped to me next-day for free, no return necessary.  I actually MADE $10 from the last toner I bought because they sent the wrong one and told me to \"keep\" it.  Places like Target could eliminate thefts by patting-down customers as they exit, but they don't because they're smart enough to realize sometimes the cure for dirtbags can be worse than the disease.\n\n\nDon't bend over, but frankly if I received broken things from ebay and was forced to pay return shipping and wait a week for my return, I wouldn't buy on ebay anymore.

If Amazon or Google or whoever offers me a better deal, I'll just take it.  There's no switching costs.\n\nNetflix has zero moat.  No social effect.  No cost advantage.  No stickiness. No IP.

Often with 1 being really relevant and the other no so much.\n\nWith this I see no more than 2 major players.

But when I look at a company like Google they have so much more data, better data and just a lot better using data.\n\nI can't see anything that gets you a moat.   \n\nNow maybe they pivot to being primarily a content creator.    I don't know anything about that business so can't comment if that is a good or bad thing.  \n\n","672":"Just as a heads up, every time I've seen DE blades at the grocery store, they are disgustingly marked up.

You have little to no income, poor credit, and no co-signer. What incentive would a private lender have to give you an unsecured loan?\n\nThere are ways to afford school without private loans. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n**Find a more affordable school.** You didn't say what type of school you're planning on attending or what your major is... but if you can find a comparable program elsewhere for less money, definitely consider it.\n\n**Get a part-time job (if you haven't already).** I don't care how busy you think you are; I have never met a college student who truly had NO time to work. Even just a few hours per week is better than nothing.\n\n**Apply for every scholarship you can find.** Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to be exceptionally smart or exceptionally poor to qualify for scholarships. There are tons of scholarships out there for all sorts of qualities\/achievements... some of which receive zero applications because nobody bothered looking for them.\n\n**Keep your living expenses as low as possible.** Get a cheap apartment with one or two roommates - or find a school close enough to home that you can live with your parents. Keep discretionary spending to a minimum.\n\n**Buy used textbooks.** College bookstores are a rip-off. Amazon is a great place to buy textbooks... and if you don't need them after the class is over, you can sell them back for a good chunk of the original price.\n\n**Ask your parents for help.** Obviously, they're not willing to co-sign on a loan for you... but maybe they would consider paying a couple of your bills while you're away at school. Also, if they have poor credit, it's actually a good idea for them to apply for a Parent PLUS loan and get denied. This will give you a few thousand dollars in additional unsubsidized loans.\n\nBest of luck!","674":"I can't think of many pure play ecommerce companies that have done a traditional commercial.  I can only really think of the big names or those pushing a product.

But it seems like I get a better selection from Amazon Prime over Netflix.  I have nothing to back that up other than my personal findings.  I just hope it improves.","677":"What I infer from your post is typical with regards to the analysis of Netflix's moat. Correct me if I'm wrong, but your assertion mostly assumes that the infrastructure is the business. Mine is that it's actually incidental and mostly irrelevant. The infrastructure *serves* the business, but it's not the business itself.\n\nAnyone can set up some servers and stream things, other companies have tried and died. Even big cable companies with all the network, in-place customer and cash flow advantages in the world couldn't manage. Big media enterprises (like Disney) with all the content in the world also gave up.\n\nEven the example of YouTube proves that anyone can stream. YouTube has lots of streaming competitors, and yet it remains the go-to in the industry. Why?\n\nIt's content that's king and Neftlix's business model understands that. They have the technology to understand what content people want and how people want to use it, they have the licenses to that content, and of course they can serve that content. They can also use the data they have to analyze what content is worth to them and whether it makes sense to produce their own content.\n\nSecuring the rights to this content at prices that are economic is seemingly not as easy as one might imagine. Amazon is making a great effort at it, but despite being both incredibly data-savvy, having arguably some of the best infrastructure on Earth (In fact, doesn't Neftlix use Amazon's infrastructure?) and having lots of money to make things happen, Netflix is still at the top of the streaming food chain.\n\nSimilarly for Google and Apple. They have all the pieces and all the tools, mountains of money and an amazing pool of talent, and they even do things that are pretty similar to Netflix already in terms of selling PPV media. But they can't get it all together to make it happen. \n\nIt's been more than 5 years. Netflix has proven it can work and the model is a runaway success, so people should be competing the hell out of Netflix... But they are failing to. \n\nThat suggests to me that maybe there's a moat.\n\nOnce upon a time all of Netflix's competitors must have thought the same. No moat. We'll start our own service and crush Netflix. Turns out they were wrong. They could alternatively buy Netflix, but the price is ridiculous. They're probably kicking themselves for not buying it out after the Qwikster debacle (that's when I bought, BTW).\n\nThis time around, if Netflix's price falls appreciably, I think you should expect a competitor to take it out.","678":"&gt; sounds pretentious.\n&gt; \n\nThat is not something I would put on a resume and in fact say \u2018Not sure how I would word it on a resume\u2019, that is what I tell people when talking about it.  Pretentious or not, it is the truth. \n\n&gt; So successful that you're looking for a job.\n&gt; \n\nThere are any number of legitimate reasons why a successful small business owner would close their business in favor of a salary job.  Perhaps someone no longer wants the responsibility or long hours of running their own business, perhaps a  sudden ailment or injury prevents them from performing the physical responsibilities of being a flipper, perhaps they moved to a new city and need work until they are on their feet, maybe a warehouse fire destroyed their entire inventory and need to start from scratch.  It is not a hiring manager\u2019s job to figure out why a potential employee is looking for a job, they are there to  verify that the experience and knowledge of someone matches up with the requirements for a position.\n\n&gt; Not unless you can actually back it up with the kind of knowledge that one would expect a real purchasing agent or manager to have.\n&gt; \n\nAre you referring to the kind of knowledge you gain while running a small business that requires you to purchase items and manage inventory? Sounds like purchasing agent and management work to me.  How is that not real?  Sure, an ebay business is small scale compared to a multinational Fortune 500 company, but the job skill is the same.  If you sell online, procure items through multiple channels and manage sales and inventory, especially if sales\/inventory reaches into the thousands, any number of small companies  that require the acquisition and management of goods and services would see your value.\n\n&gt; Most people resent being fed a bunch of BS in a resume. Don't insult the intelligence of the person who is going to be reading by trying to be clever. Nothing is wrong with something straight forward like \"Online Sales - eBay and Amazon - xxxx successful transactions, xx% on time shipping, .0x% defect rate.\" \n\nAs someone who has personally read tens of thousands of (shitty) resumes and conducted many hundreds of (terrible) interviews over the last 20 years, the expectation is that people will exaggerate on their resume and never once did I resent anyone or feel that my intelligence was insulted.  The resume gets you in the door, the interview gets you the job.  ","679":"It's not Amazon.com, it's a third party seller.

One of the reasons, for instance, why HBO is developing a stand alone streaming service ahead of the new Game of Thrones season. There seems to be enough room in the market for households to use multiple services. It also seems that especially younger generations are more likely to subscribe to Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, for instance, rather than get more expensive cable subscriptions. ","682":"FWIW; I've lately switched where I order parts from for my projects.  Last week, I saved about HALF by ordering a replacement LCD screen from a Spanish vendor's website (and paying the VAT), rather than buying it directly, domestically from Amazon (without tax).  ","683":"I understand and in some aspects agree on not getting into hardware.   I thought it was crazy for Amazon to get into hardware.\n\nBut what is interesting is that without getting into hardware and really more importantly, the OS on the hardware, you leave yourself vulnerable.\n\nIt was just pure genius what Google has done with Android, Chrome and Chromecast.  They realized early enough that a lack of control of the client OS or equivalent would leave them very vulnerable with their services.\n\nIf NetFlix could do it over again and have purchased Android and put it out there they would be in a much stronger position, IMO.\n\nIt definitely is too late now for NetFlix and hardware.   Probably too late also for Amazon except it does seem the FireTV stick is doing decent.\n\nThis entire discussion this morning has only reinforced how strong of a position Google is in, IMO.\n","684":"~~You can use prime for things you intend to resell, as long as you aren't shipping it to the buyer from Amazon.~~","685":"Third party merchant on Amazon.

We basically watch 0 network TV besides sports.","687":"Thankyou for your thoughtful comments.\n\nI don't think infrastructure \"makes\" a business.   Most definitely not.   But infrastructure is definitely an element.\n\nMy issue with NetFlix is not primarily the infrastructure weakness.   It is that I just can't find anything that truly differentiates, creates a moats, has stickiness.\n\nThe lack of ownership in the infrastructure only contributes.   If they had above then the infrastructure issue would be mute.\n\nIn some ways NetFlix is almost a virtual company.   What I can gather is that they outsource everything but the streaming of the video to Amazon.   They outsource the streaming of content including servers, network bandwidth, network equipmentment, etc to CDNs.   Majority of the content comes from 3rd parties.   I am having a tough time finding anything that is proprietary.   \n\nThe issue with this is that Amazon has their own infrastructure and some client hardware.   Google has the backend, much of the network, control over 10% of DNS, large portion of the OS on front-end, etc.   \n\nPlus both Google and Amazon have better data, IMO.   Importantly, Amazon and Google also know how to use data.  Yes NetFlix definitely had first mover.   But first mover is not proprietary.   It could have been if they had some patents that protect but as far as I can tell they do not.\n\nNetFlix had a great head start but they do not appear to have done anything that locks them in.   That is where the client hardware thought came from.\n\n\n","688":"If I get a cash stipend of $400 from taxes on a person who made 500k, and I spend it on a laptop, and that money goes into the coffers of Amazon, and amazon takes that money and advances robotic for shipping, then how does that take money away from investment?

It is Amazon's to lose at this point.\n\nUltimately, I think it will come down to two large providers.

Then you need to know all of your monthly expenses.

I go days without spending money on anything.  I pay my bills, and the rest of my money is clenched with an iron fist.  The reason I'm so tight with my money is that I want what you want in a way.  One day I want nicer things, and more importantly I want financial independence.  My goal is to retire by age 45.  This is a tough goal.  So I am very serious about saving.  Along the way I will still indulge here and there and take trips occasionally, but I won't fall for the many traps along the way (expensive house, car payments, small daily transactions).   Remember one thing: every dollar you spend is one less dollar put towards your goal of having a nicer life later on.  \n\nSo back to the beginning, by having a budget in your mind this is what I mean: every dollar you spend, think do I really need this?  If it's coffee, lunch, snack, the answer is no, buy it at the grocery store and prepare it at home and save.  If it is clothing, or something on Amazon, the answer is again probably no.  Every purchase needs to be considered. That is a mental budget.  If you really want to get deeper into this then research financial independence.  You can find all of your answers in the following places, and in my preferred order: www.mrmoneymustache.com, start at the beginning and read it all, \/r\/personalfinance, \/r\/frugal, \/r\/financialindependence, read books on personal finance, listen to podcasts in your spare time or on your commute.  It requires dedication and a lot of learning because it is a lifestyle change.  If you are serious about it then you will do it.  You can learn and you can start making progress, but you need to put in the work.

Before I'm called an idiot I'm not advocating a focus on profit maximisation during the first few years of growth, but the fact that even 15 years later, Amazon makes very little actual money (you can pin that on Bezos, but market share would collapse with a higher margin), is a warning sign imho that even if many of these businesses do stabilise and grow large, in the long term tech as a whole is overvalued. \r\rThere's a very risky presumption in most tech equity that doesn't exist in other industries, which is that promised potential will always be fulfilled.  Uber's stock is based on the assumption that it will be allowed in every taxi market and regulatory system and that customer growth in the rest of the world will be as high as in San Francisco and Manhattan.  The price of Facebook remains based on the implicit assumption that one day Zuck will figure out how to use our information to bring in tens of billions of advertising revenue via some magic trick that makes doctors mad or whatever.  \r\rExisting models of expected return and risk rates just aren't applicable here, I think.","802":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I thought Apple just provided a new POS terminal experience, not replace the whole CC network itself. \n\nThey haven't (to my knowledge) provided a new POS terminal experience.  I went shopping earlier today and noticed the Apple Pay option on a (more or less) standard credit card swipe machine.  It piggy-backed off of the same system that Visa\/Mastercard\/whoever use to do tap-to-pay cards.  Is Apple's system innovative?  Slightly, but then again, Square attempted to do just the same exact thing, and it didn't really catch on too much.  I figure they mean to compete with Visa and them, since that's the whole point of getting in on the transaction business.  When you provide your own payment system, *you* get to charge those little transaction fees to the merchant instead of Visa.  \n\n&gt; The market has dismissed currently available smart watches. I firmly believe that Apple is the only company out there that can pull it off.\n\nRight, and there's some people that believe Apple can finally do it right.  People cite that Blackberry and Palm were around before the iPhone, and when Apple did it, smartphones suddenly took off.  That's fair, but in those instances, Apple also brought new (touchscreen) technology to the table.  \n\nThey would need a massive leap of innovation to bring a smartwatch to market that's somehow different than existing models.  I mean, what's left to do? There's built-in cameras, heartrate sensors, step counters, an open source platform for developers to interface with the hardware (Android did this).  I fail to see what really cool innovative thing the Apple Watch is going to do.  Beyond that, one of the biggest flaws of smartwatches has been highly detailed by tech reviewers already:  people look at them and say \"great, but it's too expensive\".  \n\nIf Apple prices their watches at something like $100, then maybe they'll sell by the billions.  But this is Apple, and knowing Apple, they'll want to price it pretty high up there.  And when it gets to that point, a consumer will say \"Hmm... the Apple watch is kind of cool, but with a price tag of $400, I could just go out and buy a really, *really* nice regular watch and it would help me get all the ladies.  I'd miss out on checking my email on my wrist, but, you know, I can just pull my phone out of my pocket for that...\"\n\nThe only way I could see the Apple Watch being truly innovative is if it completely replaces the smartphone.  As in, \"hey, here's a phone that *you wear on your wrist*.  Better battery life than your phone, still provides much of the same functionality, but with the added benefit of decluttering your pocket and simplifying your life.\"   That would probably sell pretty well.  \n\nAs it stands though, it's a sort of extension of the iPhone, requiring you to shell out more cash just to play keep-up with Apple and be a cool kid like everyone else.  I think Apple can only milk that cow for so long.  They need to bring back real innovation again.

Uber's business model doesn't have it owning any vehicles, rather it's the middle man to connect vehicles and consumers.  The big winners in the self driving taxi areas would presumably be companies like ZipCar or the existing car rental firms like Avis and Hertz or indeed actual taxi firms, because they have a business model that revolves around purchasing vehicles and renting time in them to consumers.   Uber's valuation is based more on the idea that it will become the 'google' of taxi apps, and utterly dominate the marketplace globally.\r\rYour general point though is something I absolutely agree with.  A lot of modern tech companies that are doing well today and raising lots of money are entirely dependent on the success of other, as yet unproven technologies.  But the market is so confident that even when we see big ideas flop (google glass and so on prove that even the big boys don't always get it right) or a thousand other startups burn up their venture capital and fade into obscurity, the bubble keeps growing. \r\rIf the model in 2000 was 'overestimate potential growth, IPO ASAP, get out with the cash and run', the current model seems to be about getting as big as possible, and then selling to their friends at Google or Yahoo or Amazon or Microsoft or Apple only to be quietly written off five years later.  \r\rI'm not sure I share your optimism\/pessimism about the crash being another cycle away though.

Do you face such a problem?\n\nYes and no. I hate long TOS agreements, and do sometimes sign without reading, but it's not something that I view as a major problem. \n\nI have, however, occasionally signed up for a service, and forgotten to cancel it before being charged (e.g. Amazon Prime). That's something that I do regard as a problem.\n\n&gt; Does Amicus solve your problem?\n\nOn reminders for cancellation\/return dates, yes. \n\nScanning for other sorts of hidden fine print don't seem all that useful to me. For the sort of contracts where I'm already worried about the fine print (say, getting locked into a mobile provider contract), I'm probably going to want to read them in full, rather than trust an app to give me an accurate summary. And for ones where I don't care that much (iTunes, Hulu, etc.), I'm probably not willing to pay for a service like Amicus.\n\nNot sure about the compare and suggest other websites function. Could be useful, but there are other price-comparison apps out there. I'm not sure how often comparing TOS is going to matter.\n\nSo, to me, the value is more in the reminder function than the scan+summary\/compare function. I might not be representative of your target market, but you still might want to consider emphasizing that side of the product more. Your current description of it as anti-virus (which, I agree with the other posters is confusing--I want to know what it does for me, not how you'd describe it compared to other software), doesn't really cover that side of it at all.\n\n&gt;Is there anything else you face a problem with? A similar problem that I ignored?\n\nFiguring out the insurance on car rentals is a nightmare, because you not only have to read the company's policy, but also your Credit Card, and primary insurance. If you could find a way to scan all those and tell me what will\/won't be covered by each when I'm at the counter trying to decide whether to get coverage, that would definitely be worth money to me.\n\nI also look at TOS agreements from the vendor side. On my website, I want people to sign up for accounts, which requires them to agree to our TOS. I want to make that as transparent and easy as possible. Maybe some sort of software like Amicus (minus comparing to other sites!) could help.","836":"Also keep in mind the $100 credit you get after reaching your limit as well as the free Amazon Prime (which for some consumers makes a big deal) and also the 3% cash back on gas.

","840":"As a teenage, who's lives on his own with some roommates and goes to college, here is what I've learn and am learning thus far. You've already heard about investments, but here's a few other things.\n\n1. Learn to cook. This may sounds really lame and kinda of a waste, but trust me it's not! I am not saying you need to make Beef Wellington ( Gordon Ramsey's dish ) on the daily, but learn to cook chicken, rice , eggs, and lentils. If you live with your parents you can explore what you like and not have to worry to much about cost.\n However, if you live alone it's a life saver. It teaches you what to look for when going grocery shopping and the ladies do like a man who can cook ( or vise versa ).\n\n2. Read. Browse Reddit. Not Facebook. There are so many free resources available on reddit for you to explore. You can learn some tips about cooking on r\/cooking, or solid investment choices on r\/personalfinance, and of course r\/frugal on how to maximize your budget. Take some time to read up and learn a little bit about life. \n\n3. If you love alone make your own laundry detergent and don't wash on hot. Washing clothes on hot raises your utilities bill greatly, because of the hot water heater needing to heat the water.  In addition to even if you don't live alone make laundry detergent. It will save you and your parents a lot more money over all. The recipes can be found on pintrest or just Google it. \n\n4. If you so chose to buy something at full price that is going to be expensive, then buy what you want and make sure it's worth it. Nothing is worse than buying something because it's cheap and having it break for the same reason. If you are planning on spending the money. Make it count the first time around. \n\n5. Following that up check for deals. Deals are always happening. Slickdeals.com usually has some pretty decent stuff and of course Amazon as well. If have patience you'll more than likely find a sweet deal on what you want. Just make sure to commit to a spending budget for that item so you don't binge buy. \n\n6. Lastly be open to trying new ways to live. For example you don't need Starbucks everyday, rather go out and buy a coffee maker and make it yourself. \n\nThat's all for now before class. I'm sure others on this subreddit will add on to this or give me tips. Also sorry for any mispelling or lack of Grammer. I'm typing using the reddit app while having almost no signal.

Cashback strategies have become extremely inefficient in recent months thanks to more stringent policies from Amazon and Wal-Mart, and it's pretty unlikely that this dude has uncovered some magical way of manufacturing spending.

","848":"I'll definitely look into that. Amazon seems like a promising source. Thanks!","849":"One thing my husband and myself did was start using couponing techniques to stockpile diapers. I was regularly able to purchase those giant 300+ Pampers packs of diapers on Amazon for between $5-$10 dollars and free shipping. We focused a lot on getting lots of size 3 and size 4 diapers. My son is still in size 3s and nearing 9 months and we have never had to run out to the store to purchase diapers. Many times we ended up paying under a cent per diaper. So if you have the space, couponing + stockpiling for diapers worked out well for us.\n\nWe also got a trust going. Included in the set up was handling what would happen to our son in the event that my husband and I died in a car crash or something that made him an orphan. It goes beyond inheritance but covers who guardianship will go to, how much money they'll have access to, when and how much our son can begin to draw, and so on. \n\nSomething else to be looking at is schools in your area. I live in an area with not so great public schools so making sure we can afford to send our son to a private one if we're still here when the time comes became a priority. If there are good public schools then you're set here.\n\nSome other random tips:\n\n- Don't buy an infant bucket seat. Your kid will grow out of it before they're ready to not be in a carseat and now you'll be paying for a convertible car seat. Buy a convertible carseat from the get go. For toting your baby around in the newborn months, buy a baby wearing carrier like an Ergo. Once they get older you can use the stroller if you want, but buggies designed just for tiny infants is a similar waste of money.\n\n- Instead of a huge bulky high chair, get a high-backed chair that attaches to tables. We use [the Regalo which you can get on amazon for something like $20](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Regalo-Easy-Diner-Portable-Highchair\/dp\/B0000A1O7P\/ref=pd_cp_ba_0). It has a five point harness, collapses to a small size and can be used at home and on the road. To clean it you just toss the fabric part into the washer and the rest is metal so you wipe it down. \n\n- Kids can be REALLY picky about which bottles or which pacifiers they use. See if you can find a friend or family member with an assortment of pacifiers and bottles to try out on your kiddo and see which one they like before making a full investment. We were given a bunch of Dr. Brown's pacifiers and our son would only use the Nuk ones. \n\n- If you do end up needing or using a baby swing (we'd have died without ours, only way to get colicky baby to nap) make sure you have a model that can be plugged into the wall or else you'll go through a ton of batteries in no time at all. A trick for the swing is that the faster you make it go for the younger the baby, the better. If you don't want to pay full price, just keep an eye on craigslist and try to hit yard sales. We got so much great, barely used baby stuff doing that. \n\n- Don't be afraid to exchange stuff you don't need or want after a baby shower. We exchanged all of the newborn outfits we got, and were happy we did when I popped out a nearly 10lb baby who didn't even fit newborn clothes. \n\n- If your wife plans to try breastfeeding, she is entitled to a free breast pump. I'd highly recommend that if she is able to, she pumps to start trying to build up a small stockpile of milk. This will be especially important if she heads back to work, but it's nice to have if you guys need to go out or someone other than her has to be watching the baby. ","850":"This really annoys me, because no one ever responds to these questions, or if they do they are very obnoxious about it. \n\nThere are very few things you can do that are even semi-passive moneymakers.\n\nBut here are a few:\n\nStart a lawnmowing\/landscaping business. You provide the tools, contact number, signs and a website. You then post ads on craigslist for people that need day labor, make them sign a 1099, and then let them notify with a webform their hours of availability.\n\nWhen people post jobs that match their availability, they are dispatched. The customer pays you personally, you write out the check for the laborer (or pay cash, whatever... Get a signed receipt)\n\n$5000 should get you the website and tools and signage and business license. You would probably have to work at it for a good while, but after a bit the system would be up and running and require very little maintenance from you, like a weekly account balancing and responding to emails, offering occasional refunds, etc.\n\nYou could also take a risk and search alibaba for a really niche device, have it manufactured and branded and sent to you, and then resale through Amazon. If you do it right, Amazon will warehouse your product (and deliver it for you) for a decent cut. You just have to look hard and find a good deal for both yourself and your customers.\n\nBut as far as doing one thing one time and making money off of it for a long time after, there is not much like that out there.","851":"Oh sorry about that, thought I posted it.

This is not to say that you cant present agreements as something that needs to be dealt with, but by using the word \"Ant-Virus for E-commerce\" you are setting a negative connotation.\n\nThe positive spin on this is you are protecting consumers and \"Reading in between the lines\" for agreements and services that they sign up for. Now THAT is protection that would incline me to sign up for your beta.\n\n\nC. Are you presenting the solution?\n\nNO. There is WAY too much fluff and bad branding that makes me feel as though you do not have your product put together. I want to know more about the opportunity, not a bunch of fancy features that mean nothing if it isn't tangible. as Aeoxic said, this may be something you present in the video, but if the video is at the bottom and you make me work to get to it, then you lost me.\n\nLastly, from a brand and design standpoint, the site does not entice the senses and does not communicate effectively. I work on designing\/developing beautiful websites (i.e. http:\/\/www.gemini-labs.com) and know that communication is key. You need to speak for your audience, not yourself. \n\nHope this helps.\n","853":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

The video does do a fairly good job describing what the problem is and a sort of process, but I like to see physical results, like an actual physical demonstration of the product in action (what I see is cartoonish process showingcasing the idea, but not physically demonstrating it)\n\n* What I would do is probably have a video tutorial showing the product in action (if you have a prototype available). Use a screen recording software \/ audio notator and physically go download itunes (since everyone knows apple has silly clauses) or going to comcast for a phone agreement(ride their coattails, everyone hates them) and show the actual text recognition \/ product in action. People want to see the product actually works in the most relatable way possible (like an actual user demonstrating its use in 1-3 minute video) somewhere on the site. \n\n* Don't worry about the cost for now. The cost is the last thing people need to look at. When your selling a product or service, always emphasize time saved for the end user, because your general audience looks like they will have above average intelligence and wants to protect their own interests (i.e. someone who plans ahead). When you make your cost program, make it really simple to understand\n\n* Emphasize how long it takes to physically read a normal agreement based on average reading speed, then showcase how this product highlights everything of interest\n\n* On your software package itself, some agreements are going to be really common \/popular (i.e. Itunes) . I would have the software cache those particular agreements in some way shape or form just to make sure your users feel confident\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Good examples showing time saved with lastpass:\n* A really good example of how a good way of showing ROI is like this from lastpass\n\nhttps:\/\/lastpass.com\/enterprise\/pricing-roi\n\n* It demonstrates why a big company should shell out XXX money for each user based on time saved which equals money saved.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThoughts on the problem \/ product in general\nI guess this is where I'll insert my 2 cents here\n\nI truely don't believe this is an actual problem in the industry because of the following:\n\n1. Intelligent users who are paranoid won't trust a software package to do text scan based reading anyways, and will read the agreement themselves + will probably be able to skim \/ speed read anyhow (I do this occassionally)\n\n2. Average user doesn't really get screwed over that often (at least imo) from terms and conditions, and users that do are usually from unreputable companies to begin with, meaning they didn't do due diligence research on warranties to begin with. At the same time, companies do not knowingly want to screw over people, since social media can seriously backfire in their face (as seen on reddit's witch hunts on small and big corporations) so its in a company's best interests to help the customer as much as possible (exceptions Comcast \/ similar companies that can poach on users b\/c no competition)\n\n3. Even if a user recognized the problem of terms and agreements, what would they do? I watched the video and it said to use X Y Z other companies that don't have absurd agreements. If the terms and agreements is truely for something with no competition (itunes) the user is going sign it anyways, because they have no choice. If its for an ecommerce site, well most people use amazon anyways, which is more user friendly than other sites. I personally only shop on a few sites besides amazon but generally those sites have some form of customer backing to it and I've usually done my due diligent research on those companies b\/c Amazon didn't have what I really wanted. Instances this doesn't apply is mostly towards clothing companies, since almost anyone can open their own design, but those rely heavily on social media\/ instagram regardless, so a company screwing over the end user doesn't benefit them at all and also the margins are incredible high here as well, so again this doesn't really matter.\n\n4. For high ticket items that have really lousy terms and agreements, there's usually a manufacturers warranty anyways for these items. I'm talking about things like treadmills, manufacturing equipment, refrigerators, monitors things that cost $2000+. Most of those terms and agreements are per the date purchased on the invoice for that product, and all claims are handled directly with the MFR. Same applies to items like computer and parts (i.e. cyberpowerpc.com and ibuypower.com, newegg, etc.) \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthoughts on the website\n\n* \"Anti-Virus\" is a silly term for what your selling and does not help you convey the message at all. Use a name that conveys \"precaution\" \"smart thinking\" \"planning ahead\" \"trying not to be screwed over by corporations\" etc. Like maybe name the package \"Terms Flagger\" since \"terms and conditions\" is a rather lengthy statement. Use a common catchphrase that people can really remember (amicus is an okay name, its 3 syllabels and isn't too long of a word). I find the use of .co domain to be strange since most companies that use widgets that don't use common domain names (i.e. .com, .net, .org, .info) are using things like snag.gy , twitch.tv, where the domain's end name is actually physically incorporated to the name itself. For instance, \"amic.us\" might not be a bad idea or example . Also, for some reason I also associate .co with somewhere in the UK but that's just me I think \n \n* Like i said earlier wix is not something you should use imo. Any well established developer will tell you the same, use twitter bootstrap or word press. Just Google \"wix issues\" and do some researching on wix. I've personally used both wix and wordpress and I can definitely say that wix does have an easier learning curve for DIY approach but wordpress is still the way to go\n\n* For hosting, I recommend cloudways by digital ocean for wordpress. It uses a cloud based shared hosting (vs. conventional shared hosting) and is recommended by github along with other sources. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSome more thoughts\n\nI guess the type of person that this \"terms and conditions\" agreement applies to is mostly towards paranoid \/ power users like me. Your general audience doesn't really care too much about terms and conditions (i.e. apple is notorious for having some really silly clauses in there, but the general user never cares IMO) https:\/\/sillyside.wordpress.com\/2011\/01\/23\/top-10-hidden-messages-in-itunes-service-agreement\/\n\nI literally wrote this as I thought it out then did a wee bit of formatting so its easier to read\n\nI hope this helps out \n\n","856":"Hey I'm sorry to hear about your situation. I dealt with a similar problem and want to share my analysis and approach tailored to you.\n\n\nIt sounds like your most urgent, critical problem is a need for extra cash for medical expenses. The ultimate way to pay for that is through savings, which you can only muster through lowering your expenses in the short term, and by increasing your income meaningfully in the medium and long term. There are several ways you can do these things, and I'm sure you're already well versed at at living on a shoestring budget. Find more ways to cut costs, however boring or exhausting as your life has to be for a while, or as humiliating as it might feel. I promise you can cope and might even become happier.\n\n\nThe second problem is looming, building debt - your debt builds with every month it is not paid off because of interest. You cannot afford to pay it off, and I assume you do not want to go into bankruptcy.\n\n\nYour first approach on the debt should be to stop adding to it with interest. Your next best option is to buy time. Chase Slate lets you transfer a balance for no fee, and has free interest for 15 months. During that time, you can pay more than the minimum if you want to. Sometime around 13 months, look for another offer if you need more time to pay off the balance.\n\n\nSomething you might want to consider is transferring more than your actual credit card debt amount to Chase. This is as simple as listing 11k total rather than 7k on your application. You have to be strategic about it to represent something that Chase will find believable or it will only transfer an amount less than what you asked for. It might only transfer $500 or $1,500 and that wouldn't be a huge help for you.\nIf one of your cards is already a Chase card, don't misrepresent that balance, and list the full amount for transfer. Know that when Chase checks your credit, all it will know for the rest of your cards is the debt ratio (how much you owe in proportion to how high your credit line is) on each card, and your payment history. It will use industry practices and data to estimate what your credit limit on each card might be. It knows based on the income you provide in your application what other card companies probably offered you as a credit limit in the past. You should inflate your income, too, by about 3-5k based on what sounds reasonable for your job title.\n\n\nBottom line, Chase will know for almost sure that you do not have any one card that gives you a $20k limit, and probably none with even an $8k limit. This is because one industry practice provides a credit limit based on only 10-30% of your income and another practice is to lower your credit limit when you make minimum payments for about a year. (Card companies don't want you racking up bills beyond what you can pay, only enough bills so that you can at least afford the minimum payments.)\nSo inflate one or all of your other cards whose balance you want to transfer to about 60% of each of their credit limit being mindful that Chase will not expect you to have a combined credit limit of over $15-20k. You should probably follow these steps for your boyfriend in about a month or two after your application.\n\n\nFollowing the above steps gives you a cash buffer for the emergency expenses in addition to buying time to pay off the balance, and stopping the increase in the amount you owe on interest. You should plan to use this cash for covering the minimum expenses you face while you try to save.\n\nIf you feel like this is 'adding more debt,' you are right, but you are in a tough spot where your chances of a medical expense are certain and your ability to pay your other expenses is not. So see it as a 0% loan and do everything you can to prepare to eventually pay it all off under the smallest interest possible.\n\nThe other issue you need to think through is to be really honest about the success and impact of your attempts at making more money. You can sell your belongings one time for a little bit of your money back. You can 'invest' in making soap. These are not great strategies because they provide inconsistent, low returns and will NEVER change your financial situation.\nYour better bet is to focus your time and resources into something will result in a consistently higher return on cash investment and your time. This takes discipline and an honest view of reality (including future earnings expectations), and most people don't have either. This means immediately stopping your non-fruitful investments and doing more to put yourself into a position to make consistent returns on investment or higher income.\nIf you can pick up another part-time job, do it now. It sucks but your situation is only going to get worse without more money and even $50\/day is huge proportional to what you need to pay for.\nYou can also prepare for and look for a better paying job. This might include an investment in time to study on your own or take a course. A better paying job is your only way out of your situation. In the meantime, if you can't or won't find a part-time job, you should get more creative in your home-based work. Look for under-priced products and learn to re-sell them in another market. r\/flipping is a good resource for to learn how to find hidden gems at yard sales and store clearances, and resell them on eBay and Amazon. You might consider going to odesk.com and signing up as a personal assistant or bookkeeper. You might want to go to fiverr.com and sign up to sell a creative service.\n\n\nAvoid the traps of network marketing, making things to sell, or worse, the crap I fell into where I tried to make money on these websites and apps that pay you tiny amounts for tiny actions. It was a royal waste of time and prolonged my situation until I found better consistent work. Like you, my financial rut caused me to put off family for multiple years. It set me back emotionally as well and caused problems in my relationship that were too hard to deal with because I was so scared about finances and just acting desperate.\n\n\nBest of luck to you. You will get through this. Feel free to PM me if you need some more ideas.","857":"Make sure you're getting compatible parts.

Afterall, your whole idea is to make something complicated like \"terms and conditions\" simple and easy to understand. \n\nI believe that for webdesign, fancy and artsy looking designs applies mostly to places that actually emphasize artsy services and products. For instance, web design services, logo design services, clothing companies, etc.\n\nAlso, you should have some small companies and possibly large corporations backing your product in some way shape or form, or your product \/ service might not survive IMO or improve over time because R&amp;D and improvements on your software isn't cheap or free\n\nAlso, since your also on looking to form a partnership in New Delhi (I don't know if I read this correctly on the reddit responses). I don't know why you need someone particularly from there. My guess is that you are from India originally based on your name and profile on the site. Is it because you need Indian programmers for cheap labor for R&amp;D development or is it something I'm missing? You are the lawyer who understands terms and agreement, and you have a data scientist who should be able to program text recognition software based on reference values, so what does the other partner offer? \n\nAlso, you should totally check out Amazon turking although I don't know if this is applicable at all. Basically cheap human labor for surveys for possibly scanning terms and agreements on popular sites as I had mentioned previously.\nhttps:\/\/www.mturk.com\/mturk\/welcome\n\nI feel like your software needs to be aided by humans because every term and condition is different and needs to be spot checked by people.\n\nAlso, I would also contact Adobe since they sort of specialize in text recognition software to be my knowledge, since PDFs are sort of the default for long documents. Maybe you can find some form of text recognition engine subcontracted out to you like how they do with game engines to the gaming industry \/ companies. \n","860":"Didn't know they expired after 3 years.

Sorry.\n\nSecondly, kudos to you for stepping up and taking care of her. I've worked with people with mental illness for 4 years. The reason I mention that is that one of the clients who had schizophrenia also had terrible seizures to such a point that he had an implant in him, that when seizing we had to swipe with a magnet which somehow helped the seizures. It was terrifying, it made my own anxiety quadruple, and I would run out the door the second my relief came in. I can't imagine doing it full time.\n\nBut concerning the rest of the post. Now, not to call your father out but there's no way he'd be disqualified for unemployment due to income. You get capped - last time I heard it was 410 or something like that a week in my state (NY). That sounds like a lot until you realize that's barely above $10 an hour. It's not great but it's something. Legally the only way you can't get unemployment is if you're fired due to insubordination or you quit. I made the mistake once of knowing the company I was working for was looking for a replacement for me (I was promoted to an operations manager no prior training, right out of college, and was so stressed and overwhelmed I came home and would cry for 2 hours straight every single night), and figured I could simply be laid off earlier. By bringing it up first, they managed to get NYS to side with them that I quit, and wasn't going to be laid off. So it's an easy slip up that can fuck you.\n\nAnyhoo! Question answering.\n\n1. Has your mother ever worked? If so, check out these resources: http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/dibplan\/dqualify.htm If not: http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/ssi\/\n2. Have you ever worked? If not, go for SSI. You can't get disability if you've never worked. But you are 100% qualified as disabled if your depression and anxiety are severe enough that you cannot work or go to school. Don't listen to anyone who says that depression and anxiety aren't disabilities. They're the kind of people that make a real illness \"taboo\" as if you are crying out for attention. A complete list of all disabilities according to the government is here: http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/disability\/professionals\/bluebook\/AdultListings.htm Even ADHD is on it.\n3. I assume with your father working you don't qualify for welfare. However, you may for food stamps. It might be $50 a month but hey, it's $50 of milk and bread. I don't know what state you're in so just google \"food stamps [your state] calculator\" and it will probably give you a link that will guestimate how much you can get. Some states even allow online applications.\n4. I know things are tough, I know you have your hands full and can't work and are probably too stressed and upset to drive. But look into an online high school program. Even if you spend just 2 hours a day when your father's home watching over your mother, you can get it done in a year or two. Then if you choose, when things are better, you can continue on with college. Even if it doesn't get easier for a long time by then you can take local community classes online - just one or two. And there are tons and tons of scholarships and aid options out there for low income or disadvantaged.\n\nReally, just look at any possible income you can start getting. Also! For a job, have you looked at jobs that involve working at home? I'm specifically thinking those live chat operators online. Many are in call-center type buildings but Apple pays people $12-14 an hour to sit at home with a Mac they give them and answer online chat questions. Other companies like Amazon, AT&amp;T, even small random companies have it. \n\nThere's also transcription businesses where they send you files people (like doctors, for instance) recorded and you just type them out. It's by file so it's your pace.\n\nOr you can sell something on Fiverr. For each job you sell, you make $4. Check out that website if you just want extra cash.\n\nBut I essentially just wrote a fucking novel and used about half of the allotted characters so Imma shut up now. Just keep your head up. :)","912":"I'm starting a business and looking for investments if you're feeling that way inclined!     \n     \nnow that I've gotten my shot in the dark out of the way there's a couple things you could do with help found on reddit.\n\n\/r\/FulfillmentByAmazon is a good place the check out, you will need to do some legwork to find a good niche to sell in, then you will need to find a supplier, buy your items, ship them to amazon, list them and then when they sell amazon takes care of everything. Though I'm not sure if there's an age requirement to sell on there. Starting with $20k plus should give you a nice amount of stock if you find something cheap and that will sell, you should get a nice return too.\n\nthere's also \/r\/EntrepreneurRideAlong that's mostly people starting cleaning companies for their area, gives lots of good information on site building, advertising, how to set up recurring customers and payments and how to hire staff, insurance and other things you will need to know. You could probably do this without doing any cleaning yourself.\n\nThe good thing about your situation is that you're young and you have a lot of time to learn and become great at something. Do you have any hobbies? Those are usually a great place to build a business around, for instance I like guitars and decided to build one and it turned out pretty good. With a bit more practice I could probably sell bodies pretty easily. And even within the building guitars business, there is another business to be made which isn't very active and could make some alright money.\n\nYou're obviously pretty clever for your age, I can't even remember what time wasting thing I was doing at thirteen, definitely wasn't thinking about making money that's for sure, and I don't think I knew what tax brackets were at 17 either, so I would find something you enjoy and incorporate that. I would say something apps wise, but if that's not viable anymore then I don't blame you for looking somewhere else.\n\nI've got some more hands on ideas that I am looking to start, but I don't want to share them online, if you find a niche, keep it quiet or it will end up just like the app market, or more recently the \"shipyourenemies\" type things. Although since these are more local and you starting a business in this field won't compete with me I'll be happy to send you some more info if you want to send me a PM.\n\nWhatever you end up doing, I wish you the best!","913":"Actually the rule states that only those with Experienced Trader Flair and above can offer balance to to a post.\n\n&gt;Amazon balance may be OFFERED only by Experienced traders &amp; even then it requires mod approval.

So you wouldn't get very much cash value after all is said and done. That's what I realized as I was typing it out.\n\nAnd it looks like $350-375 is a fair price for a PS4 based on eBay prices.

Don't even bother with Ebay because you're going to pay $50 in fees and risk getting scammed (pretty low risk, but still).\n\nOr as someone else stated, if you want to put a lot more effort and time into this, you can scope out places like slickdeals and jump on some of the good Amazon deals (especially if they're Prime eligible) and flip things on Ebay to end up with more than $420 in cash. But it's not free money, it's gonna take work and things will take time to sell, so if you're just interested in getting as close to your balance in cash as quickly as possible go the PS4 route.","936":"WOW!

Otherwise orders have to be over $35 to be eligible for free shipping. Depending on the sales and how many items you flip, not paying shipping will help your margins.\n\nHonestly if you haven't flipped before, despite it being tempting to make some extra cash I would suggest going the PS4 route. A lot of people start flipping and realize it's not for them (too much work, too boring, can't find good sources, etc). If you spend $50 of your balance on stuff and realize you don't want to flip, well now you don't have enough left to buy a PS4 or Xbox one which are by far the best ways to quickly liquidate credits or gift cards.

Unfortunately, cutting that number in half is not realistic unless we were to use an unlicensed (under-the-table) provider, which we don't want to do.  Plus we have become friends with her and her husband, so we like leaving the children with her.\n\nThe home and auto upkeep numbers (actually nearly all of the numbers) are based on the average of my last 12 months of spending.  I'm fairly handy and basically do everything DIY, so I feel those numbers are already fairly low - reducing them would mean letting the cars or house go without regular maintenance, which I'm unwilling to do.  **I** would be willing to reduce the \"home furnishings\" category, but my wife has other thoughts on that one...  lol.  \n\nI will revisit some of those categories though, as you suggest.  I've wanted to cut the cord on Cable for a while now, but my primary interest on TV is live sports, and there is no Netflix\/Hulu\/Amazon alternative for that unfortunately.\n\nYeah, I figured we were on the high end of the housing budget.  I don't think we're \"house poor\", but it would be nice to have a couple hundred extra dollars in the bank instead of in the mortgage.  In almost all of my previous experiences, I've saved money in the long run by paying a bit more to buy the \"quality\" item, instead of the cheap item - we kind of applied that logic to the house by immediately buying the 4br house we wanted, instead of the smaller \"starter home\" and moving in 5 years.

Those are typically the ones fulfilled by Amazon.\n\nI started by looking at how many things I would get just to get over that mark (buying $2 worth of crap vs $5 shipping was saving me money, but still accumulating crap). I tried saving all the items I wanted to buy that had super saver shipping to buy all at once, but that didn't work out that well either. Sometimes things I needed I would know I need after I had just placed an order, like a small car part or something, then have to wait a month for a car part I need or pay have the price of the item in shipping. \n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is, I realized Prime was worth it for myself when the estamated cost per year of shipping + crap previously mentioned became more per year than the membership at the time, which I think was $30 for students.

That way you better know what you can afford after your necessities.\n\n&gt;How do I know if I can't afford to do this?\n\nIf your expenses are larger than your income, you can't afford it.  Credit is not a good idea if your budget isn't sound.  Reassess and cut some non-mandatory things out of your budget.\n\n&gt;What happens when I want to go to college?\n\nFAFSA is your friend.  Use your student loans to pay for housing and tuition, but make sure you're loans cover it all or that you're budgeting some of your own income (work a part time job if you have to) if they don't cover it all.\n\nConsider commuting to school from a nearby, off-campus home.

You can sometimes cut rent costs in half by living just 10 miles away.\n\n&gt; Should I get a room mate?\n\nUp to you, but it's the best way to save money on rent, and rent is typically your largest single expense.\n\n&gt;What sorts of expenses should I think of besides the big stuff like rent, utilities, food, car stuff, etc.?\n\nCable, Internet, subscription fees like Netflix, Amazon Prime or Xbox Live, phone bill, basic furniture, moving expenses, savings to build up an emergency fund.\n\n&gt;Is renters insurance worth it?\n\nYes.  It covers theft, most damages, and most importantly your liability if you start a fire or flood a neighbor's apartment.  If you own more than $2000-3000 in property, get renters insurance and never look back.  If you don't, consider renters insurance for the liability coverage.

If portability is a concern, then obviously a desktop may not be a good idea.\n\nIn terms of printers I would purchase a laser printer, you'll save in the long-run on cost of toner vs cost of ink with an inkjet printer.

I've routinely bought OEM toner very cheap from Staples or similar with a coupon + sale. Printer paper can be picked up pretty cheaply that way as well, or purchased in bulk for cheap online. I personally will not run aftermarket toner in any printer, as I've seen way too many issues caused by doing so.

I wear many hats.\n\nWith one company we were doing 30-50 direct containers per month. With that volume you get exclusivity which makes brand building and quality concerns much better. Our sales were a mix of dealer + e-commerce. E-commerce was smaller because that niche has big shipping costs so many people buy it in person.\n\nA good business won't put every egg in the e-commerce basket. If you have a unique product that you think there's demand for... have you tried contacting brick+mortars or maybe niche boutiques that might want the product?\n\nIf a similar product is outselling you on Amazon... is there a big difference in review quality and quantity? Maybe their pictures are better or product page is more cohesive? Either way it sounds more of an e-commerce issue than an alibaba one. \n\nIn regards to the course... its more geared towards beginners learning how to bring products in rather than how to sell them once they are
