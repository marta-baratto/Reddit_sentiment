So it took me about a week just to get my account up and running.\n\n\nNext step was to actually find some HIT's. I visited the suggested /r/hitsworthturkingfor subreddit, but found that I was not qualified for most of the HIT's they were recommending. It seems to be a vicious cycle where a lot of the \"good\" HIT's require you to have completed 500+ or 1000+ other HIT's. But because you're not qualified, you can't sign up for many HIT's.\n\n\nI managed to find a few HIT's that I was able to accept directly on the website itself. In total, I found 6 that was able to complete, and one that frustratingly I had to abandon almost an hour in. It looked like a simple survey, but ended up being over 1,000 questions - with only an hour allocated to complete.\n\n\nTo summarize my first week, I'm really unimpressed with it thus far, and feel like for the time spent, it does not appear to be worth it. Willing to stick with it for a few more weeks to see if it gets better.\n\nSummary:\n\n* Time spent: ~5 hours (both looking for and doing HIT's)\n* HIT's completed: 6\n* HIT's approved: 1\n* Money earned: $0.03\n\n\nPS.

{"id":"4q94xa","author":"yunhaila","body":"It all started in February. A spark of an idea hit me hard while I was studying in the Big Apple as a foreign student. A spark born from lurking in /r/entrepreneur for a couple years. My idea was to set up dropshipping business targeting festival goers and hippy enthusiasts who buy 'artsy' clothes and decorations that define who they are as 'creative independent unique individuals', hipsters. Taking advice from here, I found Aliexpress and Amazon sellers who's platforms made it surprisingly easy to 'dropship' (really just buy it from there and put in the shipping address). I created a Shopify website and from there made my first sales. \n\nHowever, I had NO clue how to receive payments other than custom Paypal P2P transactions as I had no ITIN or SSN. So I got my friend to buy into my idea as a co-founder, splitting profits 50-50. \n\nHence Mistake #1: Giving away 50% equity of a tested idea so that we could implement a payment gateway using his tax credentials. Dumb me should have just filed an LLC for a couple hundred bucks.\n\nWell the web store ended up surpassing my underthought target of 100 orders and made $1500 in the first three months even with minimal advertising (pretty much only paid FB ads). By this time, I knew splitting profits 50/50 was a huge mistake. I was offered $6000 by an interested party for the acquisition of the website, which I turned down because I thought I could run it better for a couple more months and sell it for $10,000. You see, I really thought I could do it without even taking into account my full time job was starting in May. The full time research job ended up taking so much energy out of me I couldn't give the site any more time. I passed management of the site to my co-founder who hasn't done zilch.\n\nMistake #2: Turning down a good offer and thinking I could fly around as superbusinessman. Nope.\n\nTaking some advice from here again, I've put my site up for auction so I can walk away before I'm too deep in resentment. But due to the site being in hibernation mode (in the care of my co-founder), average revenue and average net profit have dipped to 75% of what it once was.\n\nTl;dr If your idea doesn't need two people to run it, don't be a fool and get a partner just to feel safe. Go solo instead, especially if the business is highly automated and needs like 4 hours a month to run. I'm starting my next venture solo and it feels much more liberating.","name":"t3_4q94xa","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-28 14:21:49","week":26}
{"id":"4q9k9a","author":"RedditorSays","body":"I just realized why I'm always over-spending my budget. \n\nA little background - I work in finance and have built a thorough budgeting sheet for my personal finances.  Every month, I know exactly what I have coming in, what I've spent historically for that month, what my regular bills are, any anticipated expenses, etc... This file has been maintained for years and is full of great data.\n\nSo I'm looking at it today and notice I'm within $20 of my discretionary budget.  I go \"oh shit, how does that happen??\" Last month I raised my monthly spending budget, and I'm still left with only $20 and 3 more days in the month.  This leaves me perplexed, frustrated, and disappointed.\n\nLiterally 20 minutes later I'm looking at my work calendar and realize I have Friday off to go away for the July 4th weekend. I told my gf I would get an air mattress for the trip, so I start browsing Amazon Prime. Top selling air mattress is $50. The top rated one is $120. I start rationalizing why the $120 one is a good investment.  Then I buy it.\n\nIt's not until this very minute, 2 hours later, that I realize I only had $20 left in my discretionary budget. It never even crossed my mind the whole time I was browsing Amazon. I've been relying on consistent spreadsheet budgeting, prior trends, and historical data to make me stay within my spending budget.  Now I realize I have to change my purchasing behavior rather than put numbers into a computer if I ever want to be truly responsible with my finances. \n\nAnd yes, I know this seems obvious. But I was tricking myself into thinking the number I put into the budget was representative of my self control - \"I'll only spend $1000 next month\". But there was not personal accountability to actually staying within the established limits, which is what really matters.\n\ntl;dr: Been relying on complicated budgeting practices and spreadsheets to control spending, when the problem was self control this whole time.","name":"t3_4q9k9a","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-28 16:00:12","week":26}

{"id":"4qb2p4","author":"nik1911","body":"BACKGROUND I'm a 26-year-old with college degree in Computer Science. After college, I had no clue what will be my next step, so I began traveling places and meeting new people. After one and a half year, I had zero money in my account and had to find ways to support my traveling and expenses. I had experience with computer and knew few languages. I learned WordPress and began to develop websites for small business.My first website was for a house rental company in Spain. Link for the website http://www.uniquepropertiessouthofspain.com Much of the time, I was developing websites for people, who always kept on changing requirements. This meant I had to spend plenty of time learning new techniques and skill, so that I could develop a website with less revisions required (practically impossible!!!). But since, website development is a long process and money is less, I changed my focus into marketing. I began working for small jobs like creating followers and likes for facebook pages for local shops and products (self-taught!!!!). I moved to SEO and started writing blogs and creating content for companies. My first branding campaign was for a car care company in USA. All the likes were organic. Name of the page is Formula Auto Care. I began to create pre-launch pages for many companies and product. Much of the time, I was creating landing pages (leadpage) and facebook following for the products to make them a sucess. Later I turned my focus into paid marketing (Google Adwords,bing campaign, Facebook campaigns,etc. ) This helped me develop an extensive knowledge for successfully marketing a product/service which some of the most successful online marketer do. For example, I created facebook pages to created a facebook following for the page and later introducing the product. This helps in introducing a product to people who have interest in that kind of product. I was surprised at the success of the launch myself but that ensured the client launched the product with positive rating and got him to first in a matter of days. I have worked on an Amazon product list, where I have helped in launching five product in a year which are now top selling on Amazon.After doing such projects for about 3 years, I found myself creating campaigns for products right from the start to making them a bestseller.\n\nWhat I'm doing right now Two months ago I started my traveling again and I have traveled to Goa.I will be going to Singapore next month. I have now combined my passion and my work and will be traveling to Hong Kong.\n\nThis has been a great experience. I now receive emails and calls from many startups for online media marketing. I have learned marketing skills for product/services like premium car service, student loan consolidation, amazon pre-product launch and more. I have learned their businesses very well\n\nI want to share my knowledge and experience to my best ability with who ever is in the early phase of product launch or want to promote their product/services or want to create internet presence. I will set the ball rolling, which is the main problem, since they don't know where to start from.\n","name":"t3_4qb2p4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-28 20:47:15","week":26}

{"id":"4qc1n3","author":"elislider","body":"This is long but mostly because I wanted to quote the buyer verbatim to show how weird they are.\n\nI sold a computer game on amazon a few weeks ago. It was marked as used, description and photos showed the discs in the case. It was an older game which I had played a while ago, and although there was no code/key in the case, I seemed to recall it didn't require a serial number, which I noted in the listing. Buyer purchased, I shipped, done. Yesterday I get a message in the Amazon Seller system:\n\n&gt;Order delivery inquiry: Where's my stuff? -- Customer states that the information you provided on the Amazon site was misleading and he would like a prepaid mailing label so he could send back this item for a full refund.\n\nI check the tracking and it was delivered a week ago, so I reply politely reiterating the tracking number and showing it was delivered and if there was an issue? I get another email from Amazon, this time its in a different category:\n\n&gt; Shipping inquiry: Missing Items, Parts or Accessories -- Hello, The item has arrived, but there's no product key. If you can ship the product key that would be great and if not, kindly send prepaid return label if you want the item back and issue full refund. Please research the issue and contact the customer. Thank you.\n\nIt seems like the buyer is formatting their questions to pretend they are Amazon to trick me into providing an elevated level of support or something, I have no idea, but the wording is very strange. I do some googling and realize the game apparently is supposed to have a serial number, so I look around some more in my inventory and find it had fallen out. So I reply to the message apologizing and explaining and providing the key. Its not the sort of key that activates on Steam/etc so neither of us are at risk for one-time-activation keys or anything like that. They reply again, this time as a \"product details inquiry\":\n\n&gt; Product details inquiry -- Dear amazon seller, No i want you to issue me a complete refund because what you are doing is a violation of your amazon selling metrics policy and i could get into trouble by the \"digital millinum copy right act and the publisher\", please issue me a refund or a pre-paid return shipping label to mail back the product right now or i will file an A-Z claim on your behalf because you are doing something is against amazon's selling policy and you are doing illegal workmanship on amazon directly, thank you!!!! Sincere, &lt;buyer&gt;\n\nlol wat. \"illegal workmanship\"? I reply and remind them I've provided the key as they requested. In the meantime I start researching how to issue a prepaid return label through Amazon, since I hadn't done that yet for a sale. They reply again:\n\n&gt; Product details inquiry -- Dear amazon seller, You are violating the laws of both amazon and the publisher who made the product, you are suppose to send me the box with the case including with the serial key code and what you are totally doing is violating amazon's selling policy of both your metrics and your selling account, sending me the key through amazon is totally uncalled for and i will not only file A-Z claim on your behalf but get your selling privileges removed right now, thank you and have a wonderful day!!!! Sincere, &lt;buyer&gt;\n\n\"laws of the publisher\"? Now the guy is making up weird stuff. There is no box anyways, it was sold retail in the case as I sold it. I reply again, restating again that I have provided everything and apologized for the inconvenience once more. I then get another email:\n\n&gt; Product details inquiry -- Dear amazon seller, I want to ask where the original box, the original game case and the key that go's into the products game case, failed to understand this situation will get your amazon sellers account removed, I just noted amazon about the A-Z claim and their for you will either refund me the amount for what i spent for this item or issue me a pre-paid shipping label and you will not be told to visit amazon or to sell on amazon anymore because you have sold me a pirated copy of this product and if not then i need the original box, the original game case and the key that is suppose to be all included in the original package, thank you!!!! Sincere, &lt;buyer&gt;\n\nI reply again reminding them there is no box advertised, described, or shown in the pictures, and get this reply\n\n&gt;Product details inquiry -- Dear amazon seller, What you sent me out is not 2 disk in its original case, I have received 2 disk in 2  paper sleeve not the original manufacturing case at all, see this is why you should not be listing and selling on amazon if you are going to be playing these dirty games to me as a buyer, you will be reported directly to amazon and their for not being allow to list and sell because you seem to be making excuses every single time. I am going to ask you again amazon seller, where is the orignal game case that is suppose to come with the paper product key all in the original manufacturing case or i will have amazon issue me a refund and i will have amazon or you or force you to send me out a pre-paid shipping lablel right now asap, thank you!!! sincere, &lt;buyer&gt;\n\nFollowed by this:\n\n&gt; Dear amazon seller, You are instructed to tell me where the original game case is at included the original packaging box and the product key that go's with the product's game or publisher's game, failed to meet these requirements will result a suspension towards your amazon selling and purchasing privileges on your amazon account, as i stated before the game came with 2 paper sleeves and you are violating the digital copy right and the game publisher for not providing me the product key for this game and the original retail box. You will get a harsh punishment on amazon right now....where is the product key for this game and the original retail box that the original game case suppose to come in!!!!! Sincere, &lt;buyer&gt;\"\n\nSo now they are saying they got 2 discs in paper sleeves? Totally false, I reply asking them if they are confusing this item with a different item they bought, and I included photos of the item as I advertised it. In the meantime they open an A-Z Guarantee case and then get another message:\n\n&gt; Dear amazon seller, And yet you know what you did is totally wrong and its a violation of amazon's selling policy to not include the original retail box with the product key all in its original game packaging case and all the manuals that should have been all included, please issue me a pre-paid return shipping label or a return shipping label but you are going to refund me for the returning shipping and the cost of the item for in which i paid for right now!!!!! Sincere, &lt;buyer&gt;\n\nI added my notes to the A-Z case and escalated it to Amazon, they replied in about 2 hours and found me not-at-fault, but refunded him anyways (didn't charge me for it). Well... whatever... moving on now....","name":"t3_4qc1n3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-28 23:58:51","week":26}
{"id":"4qc6ze","author":"rezgod","body":"Hello guys, in this thread i'll be revealing everything in order to find a partner who may be actually interested in my project.\n\nif you are looking for long term partnership where you'll be making a passive income, make sure to continue reading.\n\n\n\nmy website: http://www.related2gaming.com/\n\ni've been doing what i'm doing for over a year and now it's time for me to upgrade  and take it to the next level. Since i ever started i've been doing everything alone from learning wordpress, video editing and photoshopping, which slowed me down but still my steps were solid.\n\n\ni kept growing my facebook page organically and i didn't push anything. i can get up to 6-8k UV a day (my max was 15k UV), i did it before when i 1st started and i'm planning to resume everything when i'm ready (this will be within a day after i find a partner).\n\n\nhow the monetization will be done?\n\nbig part of the website will be based on videos i'll be providing including a video series i'm making called \"Around the Rift\" and it's informative series, everyday i'll be adding 6 videos minimum =&gt; this video gallery will will be monetized by \"Select Media\", best network when it comes to video monetization, so here is the exact technique to reach the best results monetizing the video gallery: http://www.related2gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/technique.png\n\nlet me explain this, so even people who are not into Internet marketing can understand: there is something called CPM \"cost per thousand\": when 1000 persons visit one of your site pages while there is an adsense ad, you'll be paid for exemple 2$ for those 1000 persons, ok so once the video ends, there will be a countdown of 10 seconds then visitors will be redirected to the next video (which means they will be redirected to another page) the videos will be set on autoplays, so the more the user watchs, the CPM income will be multiplied, so for exemple 1000 persons watchs 5 videos =&gt; CPM multiple 5.\n\nall of that without counting the \"Select Media\" ads that will be appearing once every 2 videos and without counting the adsense clicks (coz some visitor may really be interested in an ad they see).\n\n\n\n\"Taboola\" and \"CPMStar\" those 2 networks are top tier and they dont approve anyone, there are minimum requirements you must provide and both networks only accept websites with 500k pages views minimum for a month. \n\n\nWhy \"Taboola\" ? taboola ads can overcome \"adblock\" so even if the visitor using adblock, we will be getting something from him eventually.\n\n\nWhy \"CPMStar\" ? when it comes to video games, this network has best converting ads, cause their ads are simply targeted to gamers and once visitor puts his cursor, the ad will interact with him in special way.\n\n\n\"Peerfly\" very good network for CPA and they have juicy gaming offers, and since we are building a community around the site and facebook page, generating leads with a \"call to action\" is something very doable (making a saturday night event where we will be reviewing a game so people interested in joining the event will bring us leads by finishing the offer on the site)\n\n\n\nNow we will talk about the *SHOP*:\n\nfor now the SHOP will be seperated for 2 sections: \n\n-design section: i'll have 2 designers working on the shop, they will be offering their services through the site, the payment will be through the site and we will be cutting 20% of the selling price.\n\n\n-selling computers parts and accessories -&gt; basically it's a review section (for exemple: reviewing the mouse that a pro player is using and putting the amazon link to it, for this section we got 3 options:\n\n\ndropshipping - your supplier ships product directly to your customer. You charge the customer $10, pay the supplier $5, keep the $5 difference.\nFBA - You buy products. You ship products to amazon. Customer buys product from amazon. Amazon ships product to customer.\nAffiliate - You refer a customer to someone else's website who completes the purchase. You receive a % of the purchase price.\n\n\n*OBJECTIVES*\n\n- making 4000$ profits in december 2016 only\n\n- i wish to enter the E-SPORTS scene in a year or year and half and it requires tons of work, i just graduated from college and i'm not planning to find decent job and paying bills, it's just not me. Right now i have an \"Overwatch\" top tier team who's playing under \"Related 2 Gaming\" name in North America, and they are participating in big tournament next week and will be facing some important teams like \"Team Liquid\".\n\n\n\n*Timeline* =&gt; it's 6 months plan.\n\n for the first 4 weeks (whole month of *July* ): i will focus on generating 5000 Unique visitors a day. growing the facebook page and other social medias (instagram, twitter and youtube) i really have a good technique to grow those but i honestly can't discuss it in public. \n\nafter those 4 weeks (in the begining of *August* ) we will get approved in all the reputable networks i mentioned: Select Media, Taboola, CPMStar.\n\n\nSo after 2 months exactly we will be seeing results and scaling (starting from *September* )\n\n\n\nThat's all guys, that's how money will be made.\n\n\nwhat i need to make the above happen?\n\n\na couple of plugins for site,2 softwares, some tools and buying some SEO services to rank some words into 1st page. all of this will costs around 2000$, and you wont be giving them at once, it will be on stages.\n\n\nWhat i'll be giving you ? =&gt; permanent 30% of my project and transfer the domain name to you, so i wont be able to do anything without you, and you wont be able to anything without me, we will be complemental. other than that, i reall don't know what else to offer. thank you for reading!","name":"t3_4qc6ze","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-29 00:30:53","week":26}

{"id":"4qjby9","author":"mohi666","body":"Right now I'm using tastytrade special flat rate of $1.5 per contract to trade options in TD. I pay $7 for stocks. I also trade futures. This rate has been fair to me until recently, as I was mostly trading 1-2 lot of options, because of my small account size. \n\nHowever, things have changed recently. I have deposited more money into my account and because of market cooperation, I am at a level where I can apply for portfolio margin now. Nowadays I feel more comfortable trading 5 lots of strangles in QQQ and 3 lots of strangles in SPY. However, it's going to be expensive for me if I want to trade 20 lots of a cheap stocks, such as SLV, etc. It will be even more expensive if i want to try defined risk trades such as Iron Condors for cheaper stocks.\n\nSo far I have spent $1780 for options/stocks and $870 for futures commissions this year. I'm planning to deposit more money and trade more lots. That's why I'm expecting to spend at least $3K on commissions for options/stocks in the second half of the year if I stay with my current plans.\n\nDo you think the current flat rate that I'm paying for options will be fair once I start trading more lots? Can I use a hybrid of flat rate and their standard $10 per symbol + $0.75 per contract? Because I still will be trading larger stocks such as GOOGL and AMZN in 1 or 2 lots.\n\nIs it easier to negotiate with them in person, over the phone, or email?\n\nI'd really appreciate if you could share your experience with TD when it comes to negotiations.\n","name":"t3_4qjby9","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-06-30 04:14:56","week":26}

{"id":"4qjej3","author":"SurveySaysX","body":"I've been using [Harris Poll Online](http://www.harrispollonline.com/) for about three months now and like it. Here's some information on it you might find useful!\n\n**How It Works**\n\nIt's a straight-forward survey site. You answer surveys, they give you something called HIpoints, which you can redeem for merchandise (meh) or electronic gift cards (woo hoo!). They also automatically enter you into sweepstakes for completing surveys, but of course the odds are not in your favor. Harris does lots political polling in addition to their consumer survey work, and are totally legitimate.\n\nI receive about two emails a day letting me now that surveys are available for me to complete. One nice thing about this site is that even if you disqualify (DQ) a survey, they still give you 15 HIpoints for trying -- those definitely add up! You can also reuse the link they include in the email to get a new survey; their router just passes you of to something you haven't done.\n\nThey allow users from the United States and its territories, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain and Germany. You must be 13 years or older.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nThe offer a nice array of electronic gift cards, which are delivered nearly instantly. I've only ever chosen an Amazon GC, and I've received in the code in less than ten minutes. **Please note there is no cash option.** The great part is that cashing out at a low dollar amount does not incur any penalty. Here is the breakdown for Amazon GC:\n\n- $5 = 625 HIpoints\n- $10 = 1250\n- $25 = 3125\n- $50 = 6250\n\nSo every 125 HIpoints is worth $1 in Amazon GC value. The exchange rate is the same for nearly all the other gift cards (Walmart, iTunes, etc.). You can do better if you cash your points in for Restaurant.com gift cards, but I always found that site sketchy for some reason, so I stick with Amazon which is getting most of money anyway.\n\nI only took a quick look at the merchandise, but as I suspected, it's not a good deal. For example, a copy of \"The Poky Little Puppy\" will set you back 1138 HIpoints, which is about $9 in Amazon GC value. You can get the book on Amazon for less than five bucks. There might be some real deals in there, but I doubt it. Shipping is included in the cost, so that probably has something to do with it.\n\n**My Statistics**\n\nTo get to my first $50 cash out, it took me completing 117 \"jobs\" from April 1st to June 28th. That count includes DQs, which actually account for half of the jobs; so I earned $7 by failing to complete surveys - not bad!\n\n- Low survey: 30 HIpoints\n- High survey: 250 HIpoints\n- Average (not including DQ): 91 HIpoints/survey\n\nObviously, the best stat to track would have been the time I spent doing this, but I am not *that* crazy. I don't feel like Harris is much of time sink; I can pop in, DQ once or twice, do a 10-15 minute survey, then be done.\n\n**Referrals**\n\nThere is no referral program for Harris Poll Online -- too bad for me! Stay tuned for more posts from me about other survey sites that may contain a referral link. ;-)","name":"t3_4qjej3","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-30 04:31:57","week":26}

I just paid someone $200 to take 2 pick up loads of books and other goods to the dump as an example. I needed them gone that day. He didn't want to do the job and I ended up having to beg him to do so. I simply have not had the time, resources, or ability to figure out what to do with these and without the ability to do so, I would have become (literally) buried to deal with them.\n\nThat leads me to last week. That was the last straw. I know there is money to be made here, or at least money to break even on here (including my own time) rather than throwing money at other people to handle it. I got online the last few days and tried to piece together this puzzle. I figure I can convert my garage into a processing area where I package and ship these but there is one thing I can't really wrap my head around and I really don't want to trial by fire this part of the equation because it will be a bottle neck. \n\nHere goes.\n\nWhen I am taking these books, according to the FBA instructions, I need to print out the labels and put them over the barcode on each book and then put them in a box together and ship them, correct? So I have an HP M1536dnf printer (laser printer - fits requirements), and can print on 44UP labels, so that means I need to process these books in batches of 44, correct? So I scan in 44 books to put for sale, get 2-3 boxes, print the label and put on each box, then print a shipping label from Amazon and send it? Am I missing something here? Do I also need to weigh the boxes so that Amazon charges the correct shipping weight?\n\nIs there anything else I need to know?","name":"t1_d4p7gyk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-27 02:20:12","week":26}

I mean, why is Kickstarter successful?\n\n&gt; JC: Intimate, personal, innovative? The experience?\n\n&gt; TL: I don’t think it has anything to do with crowdfunding. I think it’s a complete misattribution of the success. The reason that Kickstarter is successful is that it forces the actual person who made the product to make a video about it. Completely accidental and everyone forgets about this.\n\n&gt; But– **If the people who create the product– the people who know more than anyone else in the world about something– tell you not just what the product does, and all the platitudes the marketing industry has focused on for the last 100 years, but rather the reason why they went there, why they did this, why this a product that needs to exist– it’s a much more powerful thing.**\n\n&gt; The problem is– when you have someone like Best Buy, they will not tell you this story. The channel between the people who create the things– creators, curators, crafts people– there’s a layer between them and consumers that’s simply a construct of history that’s related to how distribution was owned previously. I that can be shattered, that would be extremely powerful.\n\n&gt; Because, like you, when I go to buy something I would like the person who came up with this explain what to me it’s used for why it’s useful. And I think there is a way to build an infrastructure to make stuff happen, to disintermediate this whole process and make it a lot more interesting.\n\n&gt; if you have products that have barcodes. Amazon is going to be best in the world to sell these things. And there’s nothing you can do. Amazon is the logical end conclusion of this branch of retail that is the department store. No department stores will be able to survive against them once they realise that and actually build department stores, or they’ll just buy all the Best Buys or whatever. That’s going to happen. Which is– what’s left? The products that don’t have barcodes. The things created by products, creators, people who add a lot of value to things– like the Snowboards we used to sell.","name":"t1_d4pkduc","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-27 08:37:02","week":26}

The articles on the site are dated 2014, it just doesn't seem like you're passionate enough to make it work.\n\nIf you're going to spend $100 on facebook, get a site up with Shopify and drop ship \"bro stuff\" if that's your thing. I would find something else; more on this later. Start with an eCommerce platform that easily integrates with suppliers and build that rather than trying to use Drupal. I'm going to take a random guess you're not a web developer since the Favicon is still the Drupal logo on your site. So use something easy, it's a bit more per month but $10 a month for DIY hard site or $30 for point, click, sell... Take the $30 option if you're serious about making money.\n\nPersonally I'm not sure \"bro stuff\" would sell though. The most important thing you got to figure out first is where you can add value.

They all sold like one thing over a few months, even with advertising, as I didn't give the customer any reason to buy from me.

{"id":"d4q2ewn","author":"YaSureBuddy","body":"You're talking about two different things.\n\nDrop shipping, as I'm sure you know, is when you take an existing product and sell it. The drop shipper sends the item to the customer.\n\nPrivate labeling is taking a product, having the manufacture customize it with your logo/brand, and selling it.\n\nThe two things do NOT go hand in hand. Drop shipping doesn't involve you handling stock, private labeling does. In order to private label a product you'll be required to buy a large quantity up front. They will put your band on it and send them all to you. At that point you can send it to a 3PL place such as Amazon FBA to get the effect of drop shipping on your end. BUT you still had to put up a whole bunch of cash to get the items and you're taking the risk handling stock now.\n\nDrop ship or private label, neither one increases or decreases your chances of success. It's just a different process of doing business. Private label gives you the opportunity to add more value to the product (nicer packaging, quicker shipping, etc) but it isn't without it's share of horror stories.","name":"t1_d4q2ewn","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-27 19:16:52","week":26}

{"id":"d4q5wdm","author":"Jancy52","body":"Seriously I also used to travel for a living, can make due with a electric hot pot,  a crock pot, and would grocery shop daily as needed for perishables on my way home from work to pick up yogurt and other special items. \n      I also use to make up zip lock bags of dehydrated meals at home, doing all the prep in advance... one only had to add hot water to let rehydrate for 10-15 min's and the meal would be ready.   I'd buy a box of instant oatmeal and then separate it all out into zip lock portions with oatmeal in each bag and then add dehydrated fruit to the bag,  and whatever else I normally added like  a dash of salt, sugar and some dehydrated butter (easy to find nowadays in products like butter buds.) I'd make up 20 or more bags of oatmeal at a time and it's easier than bringing the box from home. This way I'd have no dishes to do  I'd also put together a large bag of single serving meals for each day into larger bags and group together to bring with me.  The dollar store has plenty of those side dishes that serve 2 - 4... like noodles and tuna(never open any protein products until ready to use!)  in a single serving bag.  You split hose meals all down into single serving sizes (I\"d use a good collender to seperate noodles from gravy and divvy up that way - it's easy to underestimate how much you need when ingredients are already assembled.    \n    YOu can also get single size PB &amp; J, energy bars, etc.  There are plenty of ideas thru YouTube on backpacking meal ideas - the only difference is you are sleeping in a hotel not the outdoors.   YOu can keep the mess to a minimum by soaking the food in a bag and eating from the bag, you close and toss out when done.  If it was a really solid zip lock bag I'd clean it out and save it for reuse.   I also kept my supplies locked in the trunk of my car in boxes labeled breakfast, lunch and dinner and snacks.  \n      Dehydrated is the cheapest way to go.   The initial expense is absorbed by dividing the products out across multiple meals..... for example -  A box of dehydrated mashed potatoes can have multiple uses in meals as a thickener as well as a main side dish...  and goes a long way, as does a box of stuffing which they also now make in single size servings.   It's still cheaper to buy mac and cheese in a larger box and break down into individual sizes.  Top ramen actually rehydrates easily as you may already know.     At home I'd dehydrate meals in advance like spaghetti and sauce with \"meat gravel\" (making sure the meat was well dehydrated as it can go rancid in a storage bag due to any fat left in it.)   They also sell dehydrated chicken and dehydrated meat, and if you are  a vegan they sell vegetable protein mix at a good price which acts like chicken that picks up flavors while it's rehydrating... you add to your home made zip lock baggies instead of dehydrated protein.  \n     I also used my seal-a-meal, or used mylar bags that came with a zip lock  function at the bag top.  ADD A OXYGEN ABSORBER TO INCREASE SHELF LIFE, and wear gloves when prepping to prevent tainting you food.  My youngest son makes a mean hamburger jerky (message me and i'll send details.) that I use as a tasty alternative to seasoning over dehydrated eggs or dehydrated bacon. I also dehydrated sweet bell peppers to use as seasonings by pureeing and then grinding up. \n     Those backpacker meals from mountain house are the best tasting,better than wise! But are also some of the most expensive. It's seriously cheaper to make up your own dried meals.One doesn't want to have to carry cans with you.   YOu know that gravy come in two serving sizes dehydrated packets, you can pour over a slice of toast or use as a base for a meal.    One could also pick up MRE's, but for me they were too high in costs/calories and I didn't need the cigarettes or gum.    IF you make up meals be sure to make up or bring along any sauce you like (tabasco is a huge help and doesn't need refrigeration..   I personally also like sweet chili sauce and I like Thai cock sauce also called Sriracha.)  Don't forget to bring a few utensils or your thin cutting board if you think you'll need it.  I love the long handled spoons from Dairy Queen used for milk  shakes.. and i own a half dozen of the very long handled iced tea spoons(i paid a dollar each on the internet thru Amazon)  to reach into your cooking bags.   And prepacked salt and pepper are helpful or pick up some packs of condiments when you go out to fast food places to supplement your meals.    \n    I'd also put together my pour over coffee supplies in a box and brought with me inside the hotel with my electric water heater.   My sons would put together those powdered sugar free drinks for me to pour into water bottles and I'd have counted how many days i'd be gone and they'd make up about 30 for me at a time (if any longer than that I'd have to go buy them somewhere - and i was usually gone for 12-13 weeks and there was normally grocery stores close by.   \n  I also use to make up the meal with hot water, then toss a blanket over the meal to help it retain heat while it was soaking - I then learned how to make a envelope of mylar bubble wrap to use as a cozy to help retain heat.   \n  Seriously, dehydrated and assembled in advanced is the way to go - baggies are less cumbersome than canned,  and takes so little time to prepare.   Just make up a menu so you know what you are having day to day for three meals for the day  and do a \"body count\" on each baggy so that you have enough to get you thru your assignment.   I used to make up a menu, assemble a bag per day and stick to it... putting all the supplies into one large bag for the day, ensuring I didn't go over 1,200 calories a day and watched my sodium level as well (sodium is a killer in those prepared dehydrated cheap grocery style side meals and dehydrated soups.)  \n   Because of my sodium issues, at home and because of my traveling I still make a dehydrated creamed soup base for use here at home that we add mushrooms, chicken, potatoe or any thing you can make a \"cream of something\" soup from.  My sons like my cream of lentil soup.  We all rely on my cream soup base also for use in our other cooking  for making a fast and easy meal...  my batch of cream soup base makes up to 17 quarts of soup!  and I  make up \"Dinner is in the jar\" recipes which I put together in mason jars for my sons to have when I'm not in the mood to cook - our meals in the jar serve 4 people, and only require one add about 16-20 oz of water and heat over a burner on the stove and is ready in less than  20 min's or so. By making our meals in the jar I spread costs of raw supplies across several meals so those meals cost less than a dollar per person.  It is too expensive to buy dehydrate chicken or beef, and sometimes I order \"chicken-ish\" vegetable protein which is the vegetable protein with chicken bouillon or flavoring added. They also make it in \"beef-ish.\" \n      instead of making up a single serving bag you could do the same using a crock pot and cook all day on low, making enough for yourself and roommate.  BRing extra lightweight bowls and sporks.  On the weekends i'd cook for two meals and leave in the crockpot all day until ready to eat.   I used to supplement with a fresh pre-made salad and two servings of fresh raw fruit every day and kept a fresh bag of English Toast or plain bagels I bought in the local area.   i'd make and take granola type snacks  to work with me in a snack size bag - making my own at home, i love mini pretzels or sticks , nuts and M&amp;M\"s together in a cereal base!       \n.   In most hotel rooms you've usually barely got a place to heat water on a counter near the bathroom, or next to your bed.   The issue for me was remembering to turn the water off after I poured water out... and I never had a roommate! \n       Maybe your hotel offers hot water for it's guests for making tea, or offers coffee/donuts in the morning - call ahead and find out what guest service are available.    Also do a google search on nearby grocery stores so you can minimize your food searches.  \n      About the steak... They  do make single use BBQ equipment you could bring along,  and you might be able to make up your own for cheap... using a throw away aluminum tray and self lighting briquettes.. use google to search for where you can set up and grill a steak with your coworkers in tow - splitting costs of course. \n   IF your hotel has a pool they might also have BBQ's set up around the pool, just ask!   \n   I have been there and done that all in a extremely frugal manner.  i never trusted housekeeping staff so kept it all uneer lock and key in my truck and would grab as needed for each day.  \n  I now also prep for my EX (a professional truck driver) and we prep his meals in a mylar bags which he cleans and reuses.  He keeps a water heater for his truck and a mini- microwave and let's me know in advance when he's arriving and what he wants.   The hardest thing is, he really likes my dirty rice and I end up having to dehydrate enough for him for at least 30 days in advance.   Keeps him happy and in return I get grocery money in abundance,  and when he's here he works with our sons on home repairs and upkeep in exchange for a place on the couch and internet access.      \n        ","name":"t1_d4q5wdm","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-27 20:30:20","week":26}

{"id":"d4q7wxc","author":"sheymyster","body":"On one end you are looking for experience in selling on FBA, (or maybe just books on FBA?) so it could be a good learning tool for you. But, in my experience selling a lot of books on FBA, I wouldn't touch a book that is selling for less than about $10 on FBA. The fees hit lower priced items pretty hard so expect half of that to be gone after fees, plus factor in the extra $1 Amazon takes if you aren't a pro seller. You have to pay to ship it in too, and the best rate you're going to get is about $0.3 per pound and that's if you send a box near the 50lb cutoff. If it's a medium weight box, more like $0.55 per pound for shipping. And you're right, the price you send that book in for might not be the price you get. I've learned to leave books alone for the most part because they tend to be pretty liquid under the 1 million rank or so. This means that one day you'll have 10 people undercut you, a week from then you'll be the cheapest again. Eventually most books will sell with a good rank and some patience. \n\nThat being said, if you're looking at anything for FBA and with it's current sale price you will only clear $1 after everything is said and done, I'd call that a bad flip. That's too risky. The profit is so minimal and that's if everything works out perfectly, the price can get worse and sometimes it will. If you leave yourself some cushion then you might still make money, just not as much. Worse case scenario you break even. But, starting a flip at only $1 expected profit is asking to take a loss on some flips and that's never a good goal.

{"id":"d4qb45b","author":"sheymyster","body":"If someone gave me this book for free, I still wouldn't send it in. The Amazon Seller app usually gives you a pretty good idea of the fees you'll pay when selling an item with FBA. I don't know if it's 100% accurate because I've never really cross-checked it with my sold items but I know it's close enough to use to gauge whether something is a good flip or not. That book right now has a listing for FBA at $5.44. The lowest on the first page is around $6.99 so you are looking at a $0.97 - $2.48 profit on the book. If you aren't an Amazon Pro seller they tack on a $1 flat fee per item so you'd be a few pennies lost to about $1.48 profit depending on if you could sell it for $6.99. I haven't checked the quantities for each listing below $6.99 to see if it's possible they would sell out and you're listing would sell eventually, but for something already on a razor thin margin, I would never chance that multiple sellers would sell out for mine to sell. \n\nThis still hasn't included your cost to ship, which will likely only be about $0.50 or so depending on how many other items are in the box. \n\nI think it is a good idea to flip things you have lying around to get some experience, but you definitely don't want to lose money in the process. I'm sure you have something around your house that will net you a few more bucks than these mass produced books. If not, go into a thrift shop and just research research research.

{"id":"d4qbcv2","author":"Llama11amaduck","body":"Alright, here's the best way to tackle your issues from a general standpoint.\n\n1. Lay out all your debts including balance owed, and interest rate. Determine the minimum monthly payments on each. The IRS will probably be your #1 priority right now, and if you haven't set up a payment plan with them or reached out, you need to!\n\n2. Once you have this information, set up a budget. Include EVERYTHING, food, gas, utilities, debts, etc. Put your \"discretionary\" and flexible spending items (like food and gas) on the bare minimum possible to maximize your available income to put towards your debts.\n\n3. Stick to the budget. Truly honestly and completely.\n\n4. Any \"extra\" income (anything above your bare minimum living expenses) should be devoted to your debt. After the IRS, look at either the avalanche method or the snowball method. The avalanche method means paying your debts down by interest rate, going from the highest to lowest. Snowball means paying off by balance, lowest to highest. Avalanche results in the least interest paid, but snowball can be psychologically helpful as you feel more accomplished. With either method, once you pay off one debt, roll that payment into your next loan/debt.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say you pull in $2k/mo. Firstly, your rent is way too high for your income if this is the case. But say your budget looks like this:\n\n * $1250 - rent\n * $200 - food\n * $230 - car\n * $200 - health &amp; dental\n\nThat's only leaving you with $120/mo which is almost assuredly not enough to pay off your debts. Which means you need to decrease your spending in one of these categories. Let's give different example numbers so we can make a \"budget\"\n\n * $700 - rent\n * $200 - food\n * $230 - car\n * $200 - health &amp; dental\n * $70 - Amazon Minimum Payment - 6% interest - $500 balance\n * $70 - Paypal Minimum Payment - 5% interest - $700 balance\n * $150 - Payment to IRS - ?% - $4k balance\n\nThis would total out to $1620 and if you're making $2k, you have $380 \"extra\" to put towards your debts on top of the minimum. So lets say you put that towards your IRS payment. You're now putting \na whopping $530 towards that! That means you'll be paid off on that debt in 8 months! That's the same timem you'd pay off your Amazon just making minimum payments ([pay schedule here](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=70&amp;name_0=Amaon&amp;balance_0=500&amp;payment_0=70&amp;rate_0=5&amp;)) and you'd only have ~$150 left on your PayPal, ([pay schedule shown here](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=70&amp;name_0=Paypal&amp;balance_0=700&amp;payment_0=70&amp;rate_0=6&amp;)) which you can now easily knock out the following month, (month 9) as you've just freed up $600 by paying off your other two debts.\n\nYou then need to focus on applying that $600/mo into an emergency fund to keep you from getting into this mess again. Save up at least one month's living expenses, preferably ~6.\n\nThat's the basic gist of all personal finance!","name":"t1_d4qbcv2","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-27 22:22:46","week":26}
{"id":"d4qbw6x","author":"jjjjennieeee","body":"Is your girlfriend at all interested in drinking cold brew coffee during the Summertime? And is she okay with it not being freshly brewed that morning? I found that for the Summertime I prefer cold brew to hot coffee and since I live alone and it's just a seasonal thing, I buy the ready-to-drink bottles which is more economical than a Keurig. In my area, Target seems to have the best regular prices (compared to Safeway and Whole Foods) and often has small sales ($1 off). I prefer Chameleon cold brew, which is concentrated so the bottles are convenient to lug from the store and last longer. But there are plenty of other well known brands like Starbucks and Blue Bottle Coffee available in the most common flavors (regular, vanilla, mocha).\n\nI just bought a Soda Stream Penguin from William-Sonoma because it is the only Soda Stream with a lifetime limited warranty (the others range from 1-10 yr warranties). And, they've got a 20% off sale now and include 2 glass carafes which makes the price better than Amazon's Soda Stream Crystal. I haven't received it yet. Although the other poster says that Soda Stream has a bad rep, I just checked BBB https://www.bbb.org/new-jersey/business-reviews/soda-fountain-supplies/sodastream-usa-inc-in-mount-laurel-nj-1005011/ and they at least have an A+ rating and seem to close customer complaints satisfactorily. I hope that we won't have to deal with any issues. It'll take me about 2 years to break even in cost vs. buying the discounted San Pellegrino from Costco, but I hate lugging the boxes so hopefully it'll be worth the investment.\n\nIf you prefer the Soda Streams that work with plastic bottles that you can take with you, Groupon has 2 different deals now on those, and I believe it is currently the best price. Also, they allow returns, but Amazon doesn't, which is helpful if it ends up not working for you.","name":"t1_d4qbw6x","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-27 22:33:55","week":26}

{"id":"d4qqn61","author":"YaSureBuddy","body":"After having my share of drop ship sites and going through more niches than I can count... I've done the iPhone cases, the Anime stuff, the sex toys, etc... You seem to missing the #1 critical thing for success. Where are you adding value?\n\nThe website look, IMO looks stupid but that's irrelevant if you aren't adding value. Right now, you got a website where I took the first product I saw \"CUTE CAT' CASE - IPHONE 6\" and typed that into Amazon. Turns out you have a 'marc jacobs' case for double that. Now you can do double the price but how did you add value? Why should I purchase from you and not Amazon? You must give the customer a reason or you won't sell. Right now I'd buy from Amazon as you didn't add value, usually knowledge, to the picture.\n\nThere's a guy here selling lug nuts, I bet you he's going to do just fine. Why? Because he can add value. He can tell the customers what nuts fit what car, vs most sites that just sell the lug nut assuming the customer actually knows more about their car than the brand name. Most don't.\n\nYour problem isn't going to be design, it's I don't see a single product where you can add value. If you did something like sprinklers, you could add value by giving knowledge about sprinklers. Amazon isn't going to tell you all the pipe sizes or whatever but if you can, you add value. People like purchasing from people that help them out, even if the price is higher. You're selling hats and cases, you can't really add value to that.\n\nthe #2 rule, find a product that can't be sourced locally. If I pay you $14 for a case, I can get that down the street at pretty much any gas station for $14. Why purchase from you?\n\nGeneral advice, if I had to guess... You sell the same sort of stuff on eBay right? It's not that your skills are lacking, it's the product. I now drop ship items where I can add knowledge, I can provide the buyers with free consultations. They tell me what setup they want, I can explain what they need, and they'll purchase from me as I included store links to the exact things they'll need to get the job done. It adds value and it gets the sales.","name":"t1_d4qqn61","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-28 04:40:55","week":26}

It gives you pride and your able to learn alot, maybe also saving on other stuff because you know how to fix them now. \n\nOne example here is a set of Bluetooth speakers I built. Costed around $80 Cad? I think. The sound quality is decent and definitely will do for my uses. Something as loud would have costed me around 200-300. And I learned valuable knowledge on electronics and is now able to save money fixing my own headphones or making my own battery pack (my next project). \n\nBy being able to fix my own headphones, I save around 10 bucks every two month since I don't have to throw them out anymore. Anyways, I'm a 17 year old and this is my way to save money. I hope you can take some stuff I have said and maybe apply it to your situation. \n\nI also don't get why everybody hates on subscriptions. Ya sure some are a waste of money. But something like Google play music would acctually save in the long run depending on you lifestyle. Do you spend more than 10 a month on music? Switch to Google play and your going to be saving in the long run. Do you watch alot of TV shows? Cut off your TV and get high-speed internet with Netflix and you should also be saving. It rather just about control. Spend on what will save in the long run.\n\n\nI almost also forget. I spend a big portion of my expenditure on clothing, but it only comes down to 30-40 a month( remember just a kid.). I always hit the clearance rack and nothing else. I am able to get brand new leather Oxfords for $25 from top shop and cotton collared shirts from express for $19.\n\nI might seem like I have my shit down. But nope.

{"id":"d4qs1ot","author":"nobodytrickedme","body":"You might be ignorant (as in not knowing) but you're 22 and asking these questions..... that proves you're pretty intelligent. My dad is a stock broker and financial advisor (now to high net worth clients) I started dabbling into investing with like $200 chunks of birthday /christmas money and odd job money when I was 14-15. I opened a Roth IRA in college because I figured out that I get a tax refund which mean that my tax rate was really low- and when I retired I'd hopefully have had a successful career and be in a much higher tax bracket so putting away a dollar that I paid little tax on now would do me wonders in the future. \n\nI lost $20,000 in the stock market before I turned 21. (Because I didnt listen to dad when I bought into the stock market) He told me now was a bad time.... his advice was near perfect. I invested in December 1999. The dot.com bubble burst in March 2000.... So my investments went up in value for 3 months then tanked. A year and a half later I had lost 2/3 of my money. Then I made probably a bigger mistake. I asked dad to sell everything he asked if I wanted to talk when he got home- I said no. He sold AMGN, BIIB, GE and INTC - in summer of 2002. BIIB went from 30 to 50 then down to 30....I dont remember where I sold it... but about 6 years ago it went parabolic. In June 2010 it was trading at $50.....June 2014 it was trading at 335 and continued to rise until March 2015 where it peaked at $475.  \n\nOpening a Roth is a great idea-- reading and learning would be just as if not even more beneficial. Let your money grow safely while you're learning- then when you've learned a thing or two your investing will be far more profitable. They say work smarter not harder. That works for money too. Learning as much as you can now you'll make better and more profitable decisions.  \n\nBiggest thing I can tell you- is try not to dwell to much on what-ifs. If you think you found the next Microsoft, Apple, Amazon or Tesla. Throw a little at it. Figure out what you're comfortable throwing away and buy a couple shares. In all probability you'll lose that money. But if you do find that next big thing be happy and dont spend too much time thinking man if I'd invested $2,000 I'd be able to retire now.... (It's a hard thing to do- even after 20 years I find myself occasionally thinking about what would have happened had I bought $500 worth of Starbucks in 1996 as a sophomore in High School. I'd never invested before and mom went to this coffee shop twice in the same day. They were trading at $20 a share or so.... it's at $52 after multiple splits conservative estimates say  that $500 would be worth 20 years later about $35,000. The only thing I knew about the company is they'd started selling stock 4 years before I found them and my mom loved their coffee. It doesnt have to be complicated.\n\n","name":"t1_d4qs1ot","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-28 05:20:36","week":26}

That seems to cover most of the Freedom categories already. The only Freedom category that I don't see covered at all is gas stations, and I haven't even dug through Gyft or Paypal Digital gifts. One could argue that if your grocery store chain isn't on the list, then the Ink doesn't do much good for you, which would be fair, but the point is still that you can buy gift cards as you go (avoiding the alteration in spending pitfall that churners often fall into) year round.\n\nIn addition, you get the potential for 5x UR on pet supplies, movie theaters, airlines (southwest at least), Target, Groupon, eBay, and all sorts of other places, not to mention the non-trivial 5x on telecom/cable service. \n\nI know why people love the Freedom, but the Ink has higher limits, earns a bonus at stores that don't have \"cash only\" policies, can purchase instant store gift cards for hundreds of retailers, and maintains these benefits year round.

{"id":"d4r938z","author":"Jancy52","body":"I picked up a dozen herbs thru a culinary special on Amazon for seeds and it balanced out my herb garden, all I do is water and harvest - I use the 'trim and let grow' method.   My garden produces year round.  I also grow cantaloupe from seeds that I harvested from the fruit, peanuts i grow from uncooked raw peanuts in the shell,tomatoes from seeds, and potatoes that grew eyes are put in the yard for growing. .... Photo of my early set up included, I use a combination of elevated containers, plastic produce boxes, shipping boxes (lined due to arsenic concerns) and in straw bales,whatever I could find for free:   put your money into the quality soil, amend, compost and make your own soil but put very little money if any into containers.  The important part of your garden is the health of your soil.  \n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QxN9mIW.jpg)\n     When buying green onion, don't cast off the bulb...  replant it and it will regrow.  Over the winter I had to buy green onion, and I save the bulbs in a shallow dish of water and in the spring I planted.    Once I got about 30 plants it was enough to stop buying green onions and just harvest frequently.  You can harvest stems individually while allowing the bulb to keep growing and producing. Same with carrots, celery.   Rather than toss garlic that won't get used, plant it. Same with potato and onion, raw snap peas and beans:   if it has a seed inside it, plant or dehydrate it and then when it's time, plant it. \n    I don't own the house i am in,  and didn't want to disturb the owner's sod (it's full of japanese grubs) so I rely on an elevated bed system with fabric/metal screening to  block the grass under each bed  to prevent grubs and vermin from climbing up underground and getting our plants and food.  \n   \nI set up a working pantry - I buy in bulk now and have plenty of staple items like flour, sugar, rice, dehydrate potato, etc.  and we also dehydrate and can as needed so when food is plentiful in season we store it for use later in the year.  The pantry is my number one priority in my kitchen and a true lifesaver.... we've had our fair share of hard times and the pantry helped us avoid relying on charity of a community food bank.   There are many resources available to learn how to build a pantry so you can buy your supplies with confidence each payday and not break the bank getting set up!You'll always have food if you do it right.   The flip side to having a pantry is to be able to cook from scratch so you can avoid paying excess money on things like boxed or prepared frozen meals.   Use a home economics guide to help you focus on what/how to stock up as you go along so that in under a year you are in better shape.  I use an old Reader's Digest book on HOmesteading and DIY home management from the 80's as my guide.   WE  purchase dehydrated foods like milk, butter, diced chicken and beef, and for long term prepping I separate my kitchen pantry which is geared for immediate use!  i rotate supplies into my kitchen pantry and use up anything coming close to expiry date.    My long term storage is designed for SHTF or \"prepping\" needs - and I\"m currently building a massive pantry for years worth for three people. \n\nI make up dehydrated recipes for soup and meals stored in mason jars as in directions from \"Dinner is in the jar!\"  when you buy dehdrated foods it's expensive, but those costs are spread across multiple meals thus saving you more money.   I spend only $200 a month on my family of three and two tiny pups for quality food (mostly perishables)  and the food I make a home has no extra additives or chemicals.   \n     We also make jerky!    I think the important thing about jerky is to remember that fat will go rancid in long term storage if not \"cured\".   When we make hamburger gravel (seasoned dehydrated cooked hamburger meat) we fry it up in the skillet, drain,  and then rinse any remaining fat off under hot water and drain again.   I'll wash the fat out of the skillet and after the second fry in the dry skillet, (this is to remove any water)  I'll then set it out on a clean paper towel (I honestly just use old worn out,soft, cotton bed sheets I've cut down into large pieces of fabric just for use in the kitchen)(these get washed separately from regular clohting)  I'll add jerky flavorings, brown sugar and \"smoke\" flavoring or soy to marinade the meat in a zip lock bag in the fridge overnight, and the following day will drain it and put into the dehydrator at 165° for 12-16 hours.   The hamburger gravel (jerky) is amazing!  We  then grind it down to pepper consistency in he food processor...  and we use it as a condiment on food like breakfast eggs! 4 pounds of hamburger makes less than 12 oz of gravel.  We also make fruit jerky when fruit is in season for long term storage by making a fresh puree and then dehydrating it on fruit trays in the dehydrator: much like fruit roll ups.   \n\n     We love our pre-made dehydrated soup/dinner mixes.  I make a cream soup base out of dehydrated ingredients and keep it in an air tight  container for use anytime as desired while cooking in the kitchen - it looks like dehydrated powdered gravy... and it makes a good base for stroganoff as well as cream of potato or chicken soup.  I make up  enough for 17 pints of soup which one can add a variety of ingredients to.    \n   We also make our own bread at home for pennies on the dollar.    Canning is also good skill to have.   I have a miniature Komquot tree that produces only 50 individual fruit each year.    It's not much but it makes an excellent complimentary flavor for my lemon jelly which doesn't last long in my home!\n     WE also make soup from beef, chicken, and turkey bones.   I will also make german sousa - a form of spam from unwanted meat scraps from skull and bone shank.  It's just a process of boiling the scraps of meat, adding seasonings and the stock, processing it with anything else you want - rice, celery, and corn is good - then pouring into mason jars and canning it for storage. It's very tasty and good on sandwich bread!    Unlike spam, I know what's in the sousa. \n\n   I am good at buying stuff on sale and we use a scratch and dent store nearby that carries food close to expiry date. \n   I'm on disability with two adult sons, and have gotten good at food storage (out of necessity,)  and remain pragmatic about our success with saving money on quality fresh foods and finding ways extend our money thru bartering chores for produce or exchanging with fellow gardeners. \n     A cooking tip:  make yourself a cozy and learn to cook in cast iron or heavy metal pans.    When making boiling water on the stove top  I'll bring it up to boiling, take what I need, remove the pot from the stove and toss a cozy over it to keep the pot warm.    When I cook food, i'll turn the heat source off early and put the pot under the cozy to continue to cook - that's the value of a thick heavy pot as it holds heat so interior food keeps cooking.    I am paying for the heat source, so why waste that?  People don't think about being frugal with their  heat source, but it's as important not to waste it any more than you would toss food away.  \n     ON my herbs, when drying them, I sometimes set them on a tray onto the passenger seat in my truck in full sunlight early in the morning.  - my truck cab gets really hot (would kill an adult sitting in the closed cab)  and those herbs dry in a few hours while in their on hot days.  \n   I keep sets of pretty jars (not masons) for my herbs to use in the kitchen for cooking.    I bough two dozen decorative jars on Ebay cheap! Each jar holds 6 oz. - more than enough for herbs and makes great gift jars.    \n    Good luck to you.

{"id":"d4rc9pq","author":"GlutenFreeToys","body":"Based on all the details from your post and the software you use, when you say \"my vendors\" it really seems like you mean online big box stores like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, etc. and that when an order comes in from Amazon you have your VAs place the real order on these websites utilizing some sort of free shipping and the order goes straight to the customers house and arrives in a package from one of these stores even though they bought it on Amazon.  Since there are no real vendors, there are no relationships in place and this isn't sustainable for the long term in my opinion.\n\nTo me, this is an awful customer experience and I'm not surprised you have so many A to Z claims opened against you. Furthermore, it's likely against these stores' Terms of Service to buy from them in this manner and may not be much longer your accounts there are all active.\n\nWhat's more surprising here is that you're sharing this with a community of nearly 200,000 people. Your business opportunity here relies on a very small price arbitrage opportunity that the software you are using helps uncover to show you which items you can do this with. As more people use the tools you freely shared, they'll undoubtedly uncover some of the same items and any previous profit potential that existed will be further eroded as more sellers take their small piece of the pie. You're already running on razor-thin margins as it is so this likely wasn't one of your best moves. \n\nIn my opinion, this type of seller is the second worst on the Amazon marketplace because of the frustrating customer experience of being duped when the package arrives and has the branding of another retailer.

{"id":"d4rha0m","author":"branxs2","body":"**Dropshipping** - Source a product from a wholesaler, negotiate commission %, build a website and sell the product for wholesaler. You take care of customer support and marketing, wholesaler takes care of shipping and logistics.\n\n**FBA** - You source a product that you would like to sell on amazon, basically arbitrage, very risky at times but can be profitable and a great source of passive income. You ship the products you paid for to Amazon and they store and handle the shipping logistics.\n\n**Affiliate** - Mainly for those who have access to lots of views or is an online digital publisher looking for additional streams of revenue. Basically when Google Adsense isn't cutting enough / you are doing product reviews for items that you have experience with. Websites like CJ will have a catalog of items along with commission % they will pay if it converts. You drop the link on your website and if someone buys, you get paid. \n\nOverall, the fastest way to make money is with an **affiliate** program if you own a blog that nets a decent amount of pageviews. What most people are doing these days are building an ecommerce store and growing their audience through content marketing as well or doing paid advertising arbitrage and trying to leverage Facebook Ads vs **Dropshipping** catalogue. **FBA** is decent as well, but also requires a lot of work and passion for finding good deals, building in person relationships with local and online stores and a hell of a lot of hustle everyday.","name":"t1_d4rha0m","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-28 19:59:10","week":26}

A few thoughts:\n\n- Drop shipping on Amazon may make money if you can find a good niche. You're not looking into going private label/making your own product? \n\n- A quick Google search brought up 5 subscription box services for spices and the first page had at least 2 specific to Indian spices. You can still do it and probably make money on it though. \n\n- Elections paraphernalia is only temporary. Any revenue you pull from that will quickly dry up before you reach the year end goal. \n\n- Car GPS installation I'm not sure on. I don't know what the demand is on that. I bought a mount and use my phone + Google Maps for my GPS. \n\n- Personal productivity apps are very easy to come by.

{"id":"d4scdi3","author":"LonelyConfusedThrown","body":"The deleted OP:\nr/Entrepreneur\nSharing my journey how I sold $315k in one year just dropshipping on Amazon and why I am moving to FBA.\nu/Matiabi8h\nI have been FBM seller for a year(since June 2015) after I learned dropshipping with an amazing group of people.\n\nYou might get excited to hear $315k in revenue but my profit is only 7-15%. Still great income for my first year. So don't be too excited if someone tells you their revenue and wanted to teach you how. Some of them barely make 2% of profit.\n\nI started selling outdoor and kitchen stuffs and also items that are hot in summer time.\n\nThe learning curve at the beginning was a bit tough esp until you see your first sale. After I completed all tutorial, taking action is what makes you unique. So I was lucky to make my first sale 8 hours after I listed my first 5 items.\n\nAfter this point I spent only 2-3 hrs/day and made $500 profit first month and about $1k-$1.5k the next couple of months. Still great money for the 2-3 hrs I spent.\n\nI saw the big opportunity with Amazon and quit my job early 2016, hired 3VAs and worked 12-14 hours. That is the time I started generating $80k-$120k/month. So I highly recommend hiring VAs to take care of repetitive tasks like sourcing products, customer support, and inventory management. Never hire new ones but experienced once. It's not worth teaching new folks and see them leave you in a couple of weeks.\n\nThen I started leveraging softwares like SKU Grid, Appeagle, OAX ray and others to automate some part of my business.\n\nProblem started coming 2 months ago when things get too busy(when we were selling up to 320 items/day) and customer support become so hard and we started receiving A-Z claims, had issues with our suppliers. I was only getting 2-3 hrs of sleep for a couple of weeks.\n\nIn order to solve those issues I had to take down all my listings (vacation mode) and deal with customers, and vendors before my account gets suspended.\n\nWhy I decided to move fully to FBA : It is so hard to depend on your vendors. I had a situation where my vendor increased price 1.5X after receiving 500 orders on Amazon. It's because they were getting too much order from us and it's eating their profit while they use their own human resource to fulfill our orders. So I lost nearly $3k in 3 days since I can't cancel 500 orders which will cause termination of my account. Still I had profit though.\n\nWhat I am doing now : I am now doing Online Arbitrage (to FBA) and contacting vendors to make bulk deals while planning a private label. Planning multichanneling as well to diversify my income.\n\nWhat I recommend: Since it is very hard to scale dropshipping after some point, I would recommend starting with Online Arbitrage. Take a course on Udemy and take action. Why worry with customer support and A-Z claims when you can easily scale your business with FBA.\n\n*You should be cautious * when dealing FBA gurus. There thousands of them out there who say they will teach but they barely make $5k/month. There are a few good ones though, but you have to be very selective.\n\nRight now, while I am starting my new journey with FBA, I am also looking for a mentor who has done FBA (preferably PL and OA) to mentor me and may be start new venture in the near future. If you know someone, please let me know. If you have any questions, ask me and I will try to answer them honestly.","name":"t1_d4scdi3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-29 11:10:24","week":26}

{"id":"d4sfctz","author":"averagejones","body":"&gt;But I was tricking myself into thinking the number I put into the budget was representative of my self control - \"I'll only spend $1000 next month\". But there was not personal accountability to actually staying within the established limits, which is what really matters.\n\nSo I'm having my own similar struggles, sort of.   Particularly with Amazon.\n\nMy storecard statement cuts in the middle of the month, and I pretty much always let it cut for the full balance so that the 5% cashback applies and I don't risk paying it down below whatever will be credited back because I *haaaaate* being positive on my credit accounts.\n\nNow, in an attempt to curb my Amazon spending, I have a monthly line item in the budget separate from discretionary spending specifically set aside for Amazon.  \n\nSo here it is, the end of June.  I only have $20 left in my Amazon budget.  There's a $75 item I want.  So I sit here and debate with myself.  If I order it today, I'll get it in time to use said item on the weekend.  It shouldn't technically charge the account til the 1st so I could lie on my budget tracker and put it against Julys budget.  But then I'd know I was lying to myself and it would shame me to look at that line in the budget for the whole month knowing I actually made the purchase 2 days prior to July 1st...  but then again, I'm actually paying for the item on July 29th, whether I order it now or whether I order it in 2 days so what's the difference?  The difference is I'd have it for the damn weekend!  But then again, I don't have enough Amazon money left for June....\n\nIt's enough to drive a person crazy.\n\n","name":"t1_d4sfctz","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-29 13:52:47","week":26}

{"id":"d4sit5f","author":"umerefer","body":"Yes, a higher limit increases your score in the long run. Consider, however, that in the long run you will have a large net gain in your credit limit even if you make reductions. E.g., open a card you would not have otherwise opened, you get 20k limit, then reduce to 8k. You are still 8k higher than you would have been. Rinse and repeat.\n\nOnce you get to a certain total credit limit it may be a roadblock to getting new cards. I lowered all of my chase cards to an 8k limit. That way I can easily hit minimum spend without a negative impact on my utilization ratio. Right now I have 5 open chase travel cards with an 8k limit, plus a random old Chase Amazon card with a really small limit.\n\nI imagine that once you are in the 50-100k credit limit range, you are far higher than most people.

Lodging - ok with AirBnB, no hotel pref.\n\nWasn't sure if this belonged in MM or WCW but...\n\nAs you can see I'm fairly new to churning. I've read the wiki/other threads and perused through FlyerTalk as well to get as much info as possible. I was looking into the CSP as recommended but I'm still unsure of the benefits of having having the card after hitting the 50k + 5k bonus since it's 2x on dining and 1x on everything else. I understand the benefit of pairing it with the Freedom or FU would be best, but since I already have the SallieMae card covering for gas, groceries, and Amazon purchases I wasn't sure if this would make sense. My bf has the AMEX PRG, which is what I was also thinking of getting (would like to start relationship with Amex at some point), but am reading MR points aren't as valuable as UR. Plus, it would be nice having a non-AMEX card for when we go out dining in case a place doesn't accept it.\n\nMost of my purchases are groceries, Amazon, and dining with occasional online shopping. I don't drive my car as much (&lt;8k/year). I *could* get the Ink+ as I legitimately do have a small freelance biz pulling in a good amount of money, but I don't see the benefit *for me* as I don't really feel like going back and forth to buy gift cards for certain purchases (ha). In addition to this I have some big purchases in the next month (moving -- new couch, etc).\n\nEssentially, I'm looking to gather points for travel as well as replace my Citi Forward (RIP 5x), which was my everyday spend card but now I see it as essentially mostly useless; and Citi will not PC (unless someone has successfully done so and can help me). \n\nAlso, I'm starting out slowly and will probably ramp up if I see fit, but mostly am just looking for 1-2 cards right now if it makes sense. I know this is *a lot* but would just like affirmation for my choices or if someone would kindly suggest something different that would be very helpful.

{"id":"d4uk60k","author":"jwho82","body":"I run a time tracking/invoicing SaaS over at [LogMyHours.com](https://logmyhours.com).\n\nThe costs have been really low, just costs me a lot of time at the start programming everything. I spend around $100/month in advertisement and was paying around $30/month for server fees. I was accepted into the Stripe Atlas program, which has given me pretty much 2 years worth of Amazon free, and Stripe is waving the first $1000 worth of transactions fees. (Stripe has been awesome to work with).\n\nI currently work on it outside of my full time job. I've been doing 60-70 hour weeks for the last year or so. It really doesn't feel like work to me most of the time since I enjoy it. Hopefully it can replace my full time job in the near future.\n","name":"t1_d4uk60k","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-30 23:52:38","week":26}

{"id":"d4uliwp","author":"inazuma","body":"Gotcha. I shop Amazon easily once or twice a month and use the card for gas and groceries, so it works out. My bank's credit card (credit union) is a back up, but it's not the best in terms of rewards, which is why I'm considering cancelling it and opting for another higher-yield option.","name":"t1_d4uliwp","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-07-01 00:24:55","week":26}
{"id":"d4ulnto","author":"MonkeyFu","body":"Okay.  Because we aren't banging sticks together to create fire, because almost anyone can buy a lighter now, our economy is healthy?  That's a false equivalency.\n\nThe economy isn't reliant on the technology level, and can have different levels for different countries, and different levels when compared world-wide.  Compared to the tribes living in the Amazon, we have far more technology.  But we can't actually claim that we have a healthier economy.","name":"t1_d4ulnto","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-07-01 00:28:20","week":26}

{"id":"d4uno4g","author":"hejman08","body":"Honestly it depends how much you use Amazon. The Citi Double Cash card gets you 2% pretty much everywhere. Amazon gets you 3% when you buy from Amazon. If you use Amazon regularly, then it's a good deal because, for example if you are like me, you can basically make Christmas almost free each year due to purchases throughout the year if you also shop on Amazon for Christmas. That all said, Chase is one of my favorite banks to have a card with, and the Amazon Rewards card is my monthly use-and-pay card.","name":"t1_d4uno4g","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-07-01 01:19:49","week":26}
