I was hoping to see if I could get any advice on my situation.\n\nI'm a 24 y/o male with about $6k in debt to an online school I made the mistake of trying a little over a year ago, as well as about $1k in CC debt.

I bring home roughly $300-$350 a week after taxes.\n\nMy expenses per month:\n$50 minimum payment for my Amazon Store Card.\n$50 minimum payment for my emergency only CC.\n~$30 between Hulu/funimation/crunchyroll accounts.\n~$50-$100 gas (estimated, I live very close to my work and don't travel much.)\n~$100 food (also estimated. Still live with parents but I buy my own food whenever possible to get in the habit.)\nNote: This doesn't include my debt I owe to the school which is currently in collections.\nI have $500 in savings.\n\nI'm looking to get my debt paid down without taking out any loans to get rid of it. Last I checked, my credit score was around the 500-550 range. I know little to nothing about bankruptcy and how it effects credit score, etc. I'm not asking for someone to make a budget for me, as I have a rough one worked out already (school debt excluded). What are some options I have to get this sorted out?\n\nIf more information is needed, I'll be happy to provide.

{"id":"3yjou0","author":"Travnar","body":"Hello!\n\nSo lately I've decided I'm going to be purchasing a new bed, and it will probably either be a Tuft &amp; Needle or a Leesa mattress. For starters, I'll say I'm not exactly sure on which mattress between these two I want to buy. I've heard good things about both, Tuft and Needle happens to be a cheaper mattress, but it seems like people like Leesa mattresses more. A lot of people say Tuft and Needle mattresses happen to be too firm, although I think I want my mattress to be firm, I'm just not sure how firm (one of the bad things about ordering a mattress online). Which leads me to my second point.\n\nBoth of these companies offer a 100-trial period, where I can decided whether or not I like the mattress, when ordering directly through the company. Here's the thing. Right now my credit card company is offering 10% cash back on purchases made through Amazon, and I also have Amazon Prime. So what I'm looking at is, for the Leesa:\n\nWhen ordering through the company - $715 bed, with $25 target gift card, plus 100-day trial period\n\nWhen ordering through amazon - $715 bed, $70 cash back, Amazon's 30-day return policy\n\n\nIt is a little different for Tuft and Needle, since their prices for Amazon are the same, but I believe they offer a $50 off coupon through their website.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is saving an additional $70 more important than a trial period? Thanks","name":"t3_3yjou0","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-12-28 18:49:54","week":53}

I own my own small giftshop business that only makes 30k a year. I have 35k in savings now that the Christmas season is over. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm not confident in my giftshop anymore. I made 30k last year with one store. I expanded to two shops this year, but even with two, I still only profited 30k total again. Sales are down a lot, probably due to Amazon Prime being so popular this year. I'd rather not continue this business another year, or if I do, it will likely be my last year in it. I do enjoy being my own boss but sales have plummeted this year and I'm concerned for my future. I have a lot of leftover merchandise, but I'd need to spend another 15k of that 35k to restock the bestsellers for the next year.\n\nIf I stop the business and low-sell the remaining merchandise, I can easily end up with $40k to actually work with. Should I buy a house (will be hard with large debt already), rent out the extra rooms, and take a $25k/yr job in another retail company (there was an offer)? Use the money to go back to school in a field of study that's actually profitable (computer science and IT interest me)? Invest it in stocks/bonds? I'm lost and can't seem to find any job offers better than $25k/yr.

{"id":"3ytv4j","author":"rimlogger","body":"Hello all,\n\nI was reading through this article about Amazon's cash flow and it noted that Amazon takes a long time to pay its suppliers. That piqued my curiosity a bit. The article is here:\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2014/10/at-amazon-its-all-about-cash-flow/\n\n&gt;Actually, though, it isn’t inventory management that distinguishes Amazon from Walmart and Costco. Walmart has an “inventory velocity” similar to Amazon’s while Costco, with its limited selection, turns its inventory substantially faster. Walmart and Costco also both get paid by customers more quickly than Amazon does. Where Amazon stands out is how excruciatingly long it takes it to pay its suppliers — 95.8 days on average last year, according to Morningstar, compared with 30.1 for Costco and 38.5 for Walmart.\n\nNow, per basic accounting, if your accounts payable increases between periods, that is considered an increase to operating cash flow. \n\nNow, logically, it makes sense. If you book an expense on an accrual basis for the current period, but it takes 90 days for you to make the cash outlay to pay for that expense, then you should add back the increase in accounts payable to net income since booking that expense doesn't result in an actual cash outlay for the period. \n\nHowever, the way some people think about it - you can't stretch your payables forever. If you are a decent company that wants to protect and maintain the relationships you have with your suppliers, you will pay what you owe before too long. \n\nHence, I believe that in evaluating companies that buy up lots of inventory on trade credit, you really shouldn't rely too heavily on what the cash flow statement tells you - ultimately, earnings may tell the best story, and unfortunately, in Amazon's case, their earnings are minimal. \n\nMoral of the story? Yes, operating cash flow is harder to manipulate. However, it can be manipulated from an operational sense, like pressuring customers to pay quickly or stretching out your payables. \n\nI'm not a sophisticated investor. But all this recent discussion about Amazon has gotten me to read numbers far more carefully when making decisions about a company, rather than just taking things at face value.

{"id":"3ytwe7","author":"johnrlew","body":"I'm knee deep in my first private label product and am starting to question my plan for shipping inventory to FBA.  Is there anyone out there with experience that can give me some advice on these questions?\n\nMy initial thought was to ship directly to Amazon FBA but I have a couple concerns.  First, having never done this before myself, I don't want any mistakes to be made by my supplier in China concerning the packaging and labeling guidelines.  Second, my initial order is for 2500 units and I recognize it will take some time for me to ramp up my sales and marketing efforts to get to the point where I am selling enough units per day to justify that inventory sitting in the Amazon warehouse accumulating storage fees.\n\nIs it better if I have this first shipment shipped directly to me and then I prepare the packaging to FBA myself and send an initial amount less than the full 2500 units (let's say 500-1000 units) and store the rest at my house until needed?  How much am I eating into my margins with the additional freight step if the cartons are about 35lbs (about 200 units)?\n\nAfter calculating cost of production, shipping from China to my house, and FBA fees per unit I am sitting at about 50% margin.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated greatly.\n\nThanks.","name":"t3_3ytwe7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-30 22:10:44","week":53}

{"id":"3ywt5i","author":"amazonbull","body":"I made a lot of money on Amazon last year. I intend to keep holding my shares. Here's why I think that Amazon is the best investment for 2016:\n\n**Major catalysts in online retail** \n\nHere's the thing, online retail in the US is still a growing market. And Amazon is increasing their share of that growing pie. Per an article in today's [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/technology/in-online-race-its-amazon-and-also-rans.html?_r=0):\n\n&gt;Of every additional $1 Americans spent for items online this year, Amazon captured 51 cents, according to a recent estimate by analysts at Macquarie Research.\n\nAnd furthermore:\n\n&gt;Over all, Amazon’s share of United States e-commerce sales jumped to 26 percent this year from 22 percent last year, and 16 percent in 2011, according to Macquarie estimates.\n\nAs you can see, America is hooked on Amazon. Every single day I go into my apartment building, I see a stack of Amazon packages in the mail room. Not so much for other e-commerce companies like Wayfair or Jet or whatever.\n\n**Prime Expansion**\n\nAmazon Prime is nothing short of genius. It keeps people hooked on Amazon, and keeps them ordering things on Amazon. That is why revenues have increased so much over the past few years - people will buy something from Amazon, even if it costs a few dollars more, because they know they will get it in a timely manner.\n\nFurthermore, with improvements to infrastructure and the advent of Prime Now, Amazon will finally be able to take on grocery stores by offering fast delivery of everything, immediately to a consumer's doorstep. \n\nOnce enough of the world population is hooked on Prime, Amazon will be able to raise prices on Prime. And who will dump Prime? \n\n**Prime Video**\n\nAmazon's *The Man in the High Castle* demonstrates that it can take on Netflix in the online streaming arena. With time and development of even more original series, Amazon could easily overtake Netflix because they have more money and are better funded. \n\n**Amazon Web Services**\n\nThis is the elephant in the room. My software developer friends and the companies they work for love AWS. They can deploy internal web apps on the fly. In fact, AWS helps power half of the Internet, including Reddit. Microsoft and IBM and all those traditional companies just can't keep up. \n\nWith such name brand recognition and great technology, I see AWS continuing to be a catalyst for increases in Amazon's stock price. \n\n**Amazon vs. UPS**\n\nLots has been written about Amazon building out its own delivery network. In fact, some of my packages from Amazon are being delivered via Amazon's internal delivery service, which operates out of their warehouses. \n\nLogistics is not easy, but it's the key to Amazon's future. I hope that Amazon uses its clout to build out a UPS and Fedex competitor, for it will force those companies to innovate and lower their fees. \n\nIn ten years, once Amazon has completely fleshed out its delivery network, there is no doubt in my mind that it will ultimately decreases costs in the long term. They will have control over the network that makes them the most desirable place to shop online. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are a lot of naysayers that say that Amazon doesn't have any profits or whatever. Well, Amazon is a stock that breaks all the traditional rules of valuation. They are clearly in a growth phase, building out all the infrastructure that's needed to dominate online retail in North America. Once everything is in place, they can easily raise prices - and people won't have a choice as Amazon has killed off all the big competition. \n\nNow, I'm not a Wall Street analyst or anything, just an average Joe, but I think that Amazon could easily hit $1,000 a share by the end of 2016. And who knows where it will go in 2017. All I know is that it will keep going up and up and up because Amazon has such great mindshare among online shoppers and the infrastructure they have in place ensures that no other company can come close to the convenience that is Amazon.com.

{"id":"cyd8x4g","author":"Rbrogrammer","body":"I think a lot of people have this attitude towards AWS right now, which makes it a good investment for us believers. There's not too much AWS hype built into the price currently. \n\nHere's why I think AWS is undervalued: It's a commodity business, kind of like electricity or water. Or at least that's the idea. You buy computing power from Amazon like you would buy power from a power company. Except AWS uses infrastructure owned by ISPs, so they can sell their computing power *anywhere*, while power companies can only sell their commodity within a certain region where they have developed infrastructure. Imagine a power company that powered 80% of the world. That would surely be a sound investment. AWS looks like it's headed towards this type of world market domination. \n\nNow granted comparing computing power as a commodity to actual power isn't really a fair comparison. Also I see some disadvantages of not owning the infrastructure used to deliver the commodity - being at the mercy of companies like TWC is never a good thing. But I still think AWS is going to be worth a LOT more in a few years, making Amazon a good buy in 2016.","name":"t1_cyd8x4g","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-28 01:00:39","week":53}

To put it simply, this is kind of what MSFT did in the late 90s, by manipulating what they categorized in their FCF operating vs investing activities.

Still live with parents but I buy my own food whenever possible to get in the habit.)  \n&gt; Note: This doesn't include my debt I owe to the school which is currently in collections.  \n&gt; I have $500 in savings.\n&gt;   \n&gt; I'm looking to get my debt paid down without taking out any loans to get rid of it.

Basically with a larger ETF's you would need more people acting together to sell to cause an issue as is described. Though, on the flip side smaller, less lilquid etf's may not even move at all\n\nExcept, that they aren’t. \n\nAn ETF with few assets under management does not move the market. If all owners of Think Global Equity ETF (‘TGET’) would suddenly decide to sell their ETF, the market would only have to absorb the €375 million in assets equally divided over 253 positions equals a €1.48 million sell order on stocks like Amazon, Google, Microsoft. That’s just a blip on the radar. \n\nNaturally, the unrealistic scenario that everyone decides to simultaneously sell TGET, this would exert serious downward pressure on the price of the ETF itself. The value of the ETF on the market may diverge from its Net Asset Value if market makers don’t arbitrage quick enough, but the ETF itself is very unlikely to move the share prices of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, et al. \n\nThe ‘problem’ with ETFs is that, in essence, a passive ETF is watching. However, given the size of the passive industry, or even the size of particular ETFs (i.e. SPY), a price discrepancy between the value of the ETF *and* the value of the underlying, can cause a change in the value of the underlying rather than the other way around.

It's great that you have a lot of disposable income at a young age, but it doesn't seem like you know very much about how the market works. On what basis do you see Tesla generating a lot more revenue in the next ten years? Why do you want to buy Amazon and Google over index-based investments? As for your view on Canadian cannabis stocks, know that most of them surged in October when the Liberals won and have been stagnant or declining since. Not to mention that most of them are too young and small, and thus very risky investments. Speaking of risk, what do you mean by \"I don't mind risk that much, I just don't want to do something stupid\". You'll only know you did something stupid when the risk doesn't pay off. When you say you are willing to take on more risk you are essentially saying that you are willing to make an investment that might turn out to have been a stupid one in the future (hence why it's considered risky). \n\nRe-evaluate why you want to invest on your own and if you are in the position to do so now. If you only want to invest for the sake of learning then why not try paper trading? If you are looking for a starting point in terms of what to follow and read to get a better sense of valuation and the markets you can pm me.","name":"t1_cye46ml","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-28 21:00:51","week":53}

We all graduated from the same cheap state university.\n\nThis is totally besides the point. You have a three friends that work for a few companies, and you guys were probably top of the line in your school. Pretty much the entirety of MIT goes to work for those kinds of companies, even the shittiest students. The amount of networking is completely incomparable. It's a flat, concrete fact that top schools have networking opportunities that simply cannot be replicated anywhere else. If you're an average student (which you probably weren't) at a cheap shitty state school, you will probably have average friends. If you go to a top university, where the average student is considered exceptional, your friends will be exceptional. How does this not register with you?\n\nOff the MIT website:\n&gt;The top employers for bachelor’s degree recipients in 2014 in this order were: Google, Oracle, McKinsey, Morgan Stanley, Accenture, Amazon, AthenaHealth, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group, Goldman Sachs, Palantir, and Shell. The top employers for master’s degree recipients were McKinsey, Amazon, Apple, Bain, Boston Consulting Group, Google, Deloitte, MIT, Microsoft, US Air Force, Goldman Sachs, and US Navy. The top employers for doctoral degree recipients were MIT, Harvard, Google, Stanford, McKinsey, UC Berkeley, Exponent, Apple, Exxon, Boston Consulting Group, Harvard Medical School, and Princeton. 90% of students who enter MIT either find a job right after graduation or go to graduate school.\n\nThese are the TOP employers. AKA dozens of students each year go to each of these companies, all of which are considered top tier tech companies. Here are more flat statistics: http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/223/hastings.html\n\n&gt;The average salary that graduates have at their first jobs post graduation is $74,980 with a bachelors. \n\nThis far exceeds the averages at state schools, which is typically between 40 and 50k.\n\n&gt;I haven't been convinced that there is a significant educational advantage for undergraduates. The course material is all simple enough that it comes down to the individual teachers' abilities.\n\nOh, please. Look up MIT econ or McGill honors econ on youtube and compare it to econ at a school like SUNY Binghamton. The amount of math and calculus they use would go far beyond the head of the average college student.

{"id":"cyf70qu","author":"W1ZZ4RD","body":"**Successful Split Test**\n\nSo one of the things I do with my smaller affiliate sites (especially amazon) is to add an image banner in my sidebar that is recommending the best product in the entire category. For example, if i was selling hunting knives, I would have a high quality image of the best selling knife on Amazon with the text that says something along the lines of \"Click here to see the hottest seller and check the price\".\n\nAnyway, Since the site had some good information, I had articles categorized in my side bar, search, email signup, general stuff like that and then had this image banner UNDER all of that. The site was doing about $3k a month. Simply moving that banner to the top over everything else skyrocketed conversions and equated to around $1k a month in extra earnings. All of that from just dropping a widget above all others.\n\n**Split Test Fail**\n\nOn one of my largest sites, I finally got around to adding email opt ins in places that I thought would work well. I started this way too late and am still learning myself, but one of the things I did was sit down and write up a little 25 page book that took me a while on the over arching subject of the site to give away for free in order for the email.\n\nI tested different positions for this, but it was not increasing conversions at ALL and I really could not see why. Essentially I felt like it was wasted effort.\n\nWhat ended up working a LOT better was creating different email optins based on the page content that the visitor was viewing. So if I had a site about hunting, I would create a different \"book\" to give away based on the page. One might be about knife cleaning tips to keep your knew purchase looking brand new, but someone who is looking at guns does not care about that. So the gun page would be around cleaning and maintaining your gun.

{"id":"cyf84bo","author":"AnF-18Bro","body":"eBooks\n\nI read a post on /r/beermoney sometime last year about a guy who wrote an eBook about how to sell things on ebay and made a few hundred bucks. I'm sort of a quasi-expert in the field I work in for my day job so I sat down one weekend and banged out 5,000 words on the subject in about 8 hours. After screwing around with formatting for a while and putting together a cover I had it up on the kindle store for $2.99. \n\nI make an average of one-two sales per day and of that I keep 70%. Then I advertise a tiny bit on Amazon with their PPC model so I end up taking home about $2 in profit for every book that is sold. I've had it on sale for about a month now and have made $60. So, not crazy money but should come in perpetuity. \n\nJust over the last few days I've got a few more books up on the kindle store. It's my goal to be eventually making $55 a day in passive income so I've got a lot of books to go. I've written a few of them myself (two that just went up that are 1 and 2 in a series) and have had one ghostwritten (4,000 words for $40). These are all non-fiction. The ones that I write are  business, branding, and marketing related and the one I've had ghostwritten is a new-age pseusoscience bullshit book.\n\nEdit to include book sales for my first book: http://i.imgur.com/w9pLu2y.png?1 . The red line is actual sales and the blue line is pages read on kindle's library program. I get $2.70 for every sale and $0.10 for every page read (minus marketing). *Edit* I was wrong and get only 1/2 of $0.01 for every KENP page read. Quite the difference. This brings my profit from one book down about $13 from what I believed it to be.\n\nI also bought the resale rights to a bunch of those spammy \"make money today\" videos. The plan was to put them up on Udemy for $10 a course but they're kind of being dicks so I'm not sure if they'll ever be approved. I was hoping to get a few bucks a day that way but it looks like that will be a loss. They were only $100 total and they came with a domain that I'm going to use eventually so it's not that bad. Lesson learned. Not sure if this is allowed but I dumped a bunch on youtube that definitely won't make the udemy cut if anybody wants to take a look. I'll probably just end up putting them all on youtube and letting them sit there since I don't really have the time or energy to deal with udemy. I do have ads enabled which is why I say I don't know if it's allowed. Though I'm doubting these will ever garner enough views to be profitable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/dpcv100\n\nThey're honestly not too bad in terms of content. I did watch through some of them while uploading. But they way they're targeted as get rich quick schemes and sold on shady websites makes them seem a bit sketchier than they are.

{"id":"cyf8mli","author":"boredaccountant829","body":"Just poked around a little bit and it seems like it generally is reccomended that if you have both W2 and 1099 income, the easiest way to deal with withholding is to just increase your withholding from the W2 job to cover the 1099 income.  \n\nSince the IRS just looks at \"What you owe in total\" vs \"What you paid in total\", they don't seem terribly particular on how its done.  However, they do require you to \"pay as you go\" so they'll require quarterly estimated payments if increasing your withholding at the W2 job still isn't enough to cover your total federal tax.  \n\nSo, what you could do is decrease down to 0 allowances on your W4 and see how you do your first year teaching.   You won't be penalized provided you withheld either 90% of your current year tax or 100% of your prior year tax (though, I'd plan on owing).  From there you can just have them take out extra per paycheck to cover it.  \n\nHonestly, no shame in not understanding tax code - while it would be nice include tax class in High School, I wouldn't wish that kind of punishment on anyone.   As far as books, there's nothing I can recommend off the top of my head.  Though, if you poke around on Amazon for some recommendations, try to get a 2015 version of the book since tax law changes on a yearly (if not daily) basis.   The basic calculation stays the same:\n\nIncome - Deductions = Taxable Income.  \nUse the tax table to convert Taxable Income to Tax Due.  \nTax Due - Tax Credits - Tax Paid = What you Owe/are Owed\n\nHowever, some of the nuances, and a lot of the limits/amounts, change year to year.  Once you know enough tax law to get by, I've found the IRS site is actually pretty user friendly and easy enough to track down what you're looking for.\n\nOther than that, I just keep an accordion binder to store any tax documents throughout the year.   I file using Turbo Tax - I'm sure there's better options, but it's served me well enough and it's easier than trying to paper file.   Just print out a copy of the return after you file, stick it and all of your support in a manila folder labeled 201X Taxes, and stick it all somewhere safe for the next few years in case you ever get audited.   Just filing a 1040EZ you'll likely never get audited.  However, once a Sch C is involved, they may want to take a close look at any business expenses you claim against self-employment income. \n\nEdit: Also, to echo what someone else said above - getting a separate bank account for just your teaching activity makes things a lot easier to track end of year.  Doesn't need to be under a business name or a different bank or anything.  Just an account that you only use for business purposes so you can let the bank do all of your bookkeeping for you.

We eat that Monday-Wednesday and take sandwiches or other left overs Thursday and Friday. We have a budget for our non essential spending (things like gas and bills are excluded but we still discuss them) and stick to it. Our limit is $75 for personal spending and eating out per week combined. We have to talk over purchases that fall into this non essential category (obviously not gum or little things) and it really helps us work together at not buying things we don't need. We set a goal for our savings every month and have a finance meeting every 3-4 weeks. We try to eat out once a week max, usually Friday or Saturday night and we usually get an appetizer and each get an entree however we eat just half (unless it's not something that rewarms well) and have it for lunch the next day . We have a simple rule like, if we go to a movie we can't go out for dinner or if we go out for dinner we have to use redbox or Amazon prime. I get percentage based raises at work usually 4-5% per year. I take that increase and add 2% to my 401k and take the remainder and put it in savings. We have a \"do not\" touch savings account, that's where we are saving for our wedding and other large purchases and a savings we don't spend from but occasionally dip into if needed (think major car repairs). We also have a minimum of $4k we keep in our checking which is 3 times our expenses. Hope this helps.

{"id":"cyfeve5","author":"jrossetti","body":"So when I was in choir during a concert people passed out.\n\nWhen I was a lifeguard and kids were swimming. People passed out.\n\nWhen I worked at Burger King.  People passed out.\n\nWhen I worked in a nice cushy office job at Chase....people passed out, and they often had an ambulance on standby during peak scheduling periods.\n\nUnless there is a systemic issue that is causing UNSAFE working conditions as opposed to people who work in a manual labor job not hydrating properly which most of these cases are because of then what is the ethical problem here?  \n\nAmazon warehouses are fucking huge.  Miles and miles and miles of corridors, hallways, and space. So in addition to having an ambulance having to drive to Amazon's warehouse where they have thousands of employees and are housing a small cities worth of people they would then have to find out which entrance was the best meet someone there, and then navigate them to where the person is who needs help. This isn't like a house call to your house. Amazon owes it to their employees to help keep them safe.\n\nNow, if this were some bad working condition and it were a systemic issue as opposed to the occasional person out of thousands who more often than not simply didn't hydrate enough properly passing out I would be with you. That is clearly NOT the case.  It was the case in a single warehouse and as the process should work it was reported as a problem once several people started having the same issue.  It's a warehouse job, out of 1600 people 15-20 had heat related injuries, that were fixed by drinking water and returning to work...\n\nI'm not a fan of having people work in 100+ degree weather, but I do know if they were pushing everyone too hard that way more than 16 people would be passing out.  \n\nIf that isn't enough however, once this was a problem at this location, Amazon then changed internal policy at ALL of the warehouses regarding demerits for heat related things as well as adding several additional fans to help with circulation.\n\nOn top of that, some of the gripes are clearly around people who are simply not capable of doing the work as required, which they probably should have known ahead of time.  \n\nToo many people have this idea that any job is better than no job and take it because it's there.  It's physical work.  I'm not at all surprised turnover rates are high. It's the same at EVERY labor intensive job.  Amazon is certainly not unique in that regard. There's a reason you can always get a job at UPS ;) \n\n\n\nNow, the people getting stressed out.  No shit, it's like any other job.  Amazon literally cuts 20% of their workforce every year in the great culling.  It's to keep them lean and this also means that it can be cutthroat and extremely competitive.  That's simply not an environment that works for everyone.  This also means that the NYT article, although interesting, doesn't really seem to be representative of the typical experience.  Further, when i looked on Glassdoor, the NYT article still appears to be a collection of the worst they could find or a mid level manager saying something that doesn't correspond with Amazon policy (the family one sticks out for that)\n\nNow the pickers. The guys who handle most of our work.  Let's talk about them.\n\nI know that I personally pay my contractors 15-20 an hour. This is for cleaning my house, packing my shipments, cleaning items, or listing. \n\nI know from glassdoor.com that the average picker makes about 13 dollars an hour.  In addition, they make about 3200 a year in bonus and 2,000 in stock.\n\nOn top of that they also (not seasonal) get other benefits.  \n\nAccording to glassdoor reports from other employees as well as Amazons internal wiki we know that the official amazon policy up until this year was 3 months of maternity leave.  Now it is 3 months maternity, paternity, and it's paid.  \n\nTheir employees are being paid better than mine and I pay well.  The job simply isn't for old, weak, sickly, or people with health problems.  When I go and do some digging I find a lot of the gripes are not systemic issues caused by Amazon and are the employees fault.  I dont see Amazon being any worse than any other big company and I would argue they are better.  \n\nIt's quite impossible to simply be fired for being sick or having a kid and it's not true to be suggesting that.  In no circumstance ever will simply the act of having a child or missing a day of work because you are sick by itself get you fired at Amazon, ever.  Also, the simple act of bringing in a doctors note for any sickness is all that they require to remove any disciplinary points they got for medical reasons.  \n\nIt sounds like the original policies and systems in place for part of Amazon didn't work in all areas, and when that happened those policies changed so it did work.  I can't blame someone for not getting it right the first time, but I can certainly judge them for how they react.  From all accounts it looks like Amazon started taking steps to fix the heat issues at that warehouse before Osha was involved but im sure it sped things up a little to be under investigation.  That's what Osha is for.  You'll note they didn't argue anything and simply stated the facts.  Out of XXX employees, XXX had issues, here are their results. In addition, we are doing X, Y, and Z to help fix these issues going forward.\n\nThey also internally by choice changed the points system when it became clear it was being used as a tool by some of their managers to \"encourage\" people to work.\n\nI do not at all critisize a company willing to take volunteers to work when it gets too hot as they currently do, and then close when they do not have enough staff.  \n\nI guess at the end of the day, if there is an ethical argument to avoid Amazon, i am not seeing it based off of the other information available.

However, they pay their employees more than retail staff so we lose retail jobs and gain amazon jobs that pay more. \n\nWith benefits the pickers at Amazon are making 12-13 an hour base rate + stocks/bonus benefits....full time staff even get paid maternity and paternity care.

Clearly cherry picking a bit of one article from Pennsylvania as well as a NYT article that focuses on outliers and is the worst they could dig up is a much better source than glassdoor with thousands of employee statements that disagree with much of those articles. \n\nYou can go to glassdoor and see this for yourself.  THere are some people who are just not cut out for some work, and take the job anyway because \"it's a job\" which is the worst reason to accept a job.  No shit you were unhappy or unable to do it.  \n\nOne of their examples on Amazon being evil was a woman with Asthma working in a 100 degree warehouse.  She shouldn't have gotten a physical labor job to begin with.  It's isn't amazons place to cater to an employees medical condition.  If I hire you for a job, I expect that you can do the job.  Amazon can't tell an old person no you can't be hired if they insist that they can do the job.  Then when they get the job and can't do it, obviously they will be fired.  This is not a bad thing.\n\nI'm with you so far, this doesn't seem to be a big ethical issue for Amazon.  There do not to be any ongoing issues, serious issues like this are reacted on with major policy shifts to reflect employee suggestions and feedback.

{"id":"cyfob07","author":"ShitBasket8","body":"I've always been interested in making money online, ever since I was a kid I've been looking for that \"easy way out\". Eventually, I went to college and sophomore year or so I decided to start learning html/css. \n\nThe first website I built drop-shipped a relatively new device. I was primarily trying to learn how to use html/css. It sorta worked, I would sell one every once in a while by spamming facebook groups, and since I didn't have to do anything after the sale, it was free money after the website was up. I left this up and pretty much abandoned it while it made me like $15 a week or something minuscule.\n\nThat summer, I worked for my father's law firm as the bitch, but primarily worked on building a website for my father's new solo practice law firm. So I pretty much practiced building a website from scratch from 9-5 for a few summer months. This is the same time that I was also reading heavily on Blackhatworld.com about SEO and online marketing in general. \n\nDuring the last two months of summer, I started building a new website from scratch for the sole purpose of selling things on Amazon associates. I had a master plan that would take a few months to complete, but I was determined. \n\nSo while I was marketing my father's website I was also building my new website. It took me two months to complete my website design, although I was far from over.\n\nMy father's website does well, it brings a few clients a month and sits high on the organic listings. (even though I haven't touched it since)\n\nWhile in my first semester of junior year I wrote all the preliminary content, seo optimized my website, and finished the website typography. My uploaded my website on October of 2014 with about 35 product reviews, and a few blog posts.\n\nIt made $200 in November which gave me the motivation to continue. I didn't do too well in my major classes and would unfortuantely not make it into the business school, so I had the choice of majoring in something else, transfer, or do something otherwise. \n\nI never wanted a traditional 9-5, I want to build a business, I want to be rich, I want to be able to do what I want.\n\nI'm an entrepreneur at heart and the only reason I went to school in the first place was because of family and societal pressures. So I convinced my parents to give me a semester off, if it didn't work out after that then I would go back to school. (I actually transferred and was accepted, but received the acceptance 2 weeks into the semester, so I said fuck it.)\n\nI worked my ass off those 6-months. Monsters/Coffee/Weed up the asshole for 6-months. It was completely unhealthy but it was entirely productive. (maybe not the weed, but it helped me keep going haha).\n\nThat July I broke $2,500 and told my parents, \"I'm not going back to school this semester, you can kick me out, that's fine and I understand, but what I'm doing is working and I would like another semester to continue my progress and see how the holidays work out\". They said alright, and I worked my ass off for another 4-5 months. \n\nAnd here we are.

{"id":"cyfyc5a","author":"jrossetti","body":"This isn't supposed to be controversial, but Why?   The buyer clearly wants a return.  short of not returning it in the same condition op has no options in this.    He's gonna take the return if they want it and them lying to op about why wouldn't affect it either.  You can literally make up any reason you want.  If it's within 30 days and same condition you're taking that return 100% of the time.\n\nI'm not sure the risk of making the customer feel OP is pushing the blame is worth this risk.  Buyer got a scratched disk.  It's well documented scratches and scuffs make disks not work correctly. Even though you're entirely correct, I'm not convinced trying to argue it when the simple explanation is the scratch.  Plus, there's almost zero chance they are going to believe him anyway.   \n\nApologize, take the return, own the mistake.  Risking rating by blaming a Wii with the info here seems like a very poor business decision.  \n\nTaking returns on Amazon is a zero sum game. Relaying this info won't change that and only wastes time. You are still losing the sale, the customer isn't going to care if the scratch is the reason or their wii.  Further, what is the end goal in telling a customer this?  They got a scratched cd that doesn't work and instead of the seller taking the return they first want to make sure they are aware that the problem could be their wii?  \n\nEdit: name one reason you should tell customer the reason the SCRATCHED game won't work \"might\" be due to their Wii..  What do you possibly think will happen besides them saying oh, well I want a refund anyway.     They can literally say my cats hair is green as a reason why they are returning within 30 and you a WILL still have to take the return.  What's with people wanting to waste time on shit like this.  Yay, now they know that the scratch isn't what's wrong, it's the wii itself?  Really?  You can tell me but it's not going to change anything.   \n\nLast, you're going to have a tough time pushing blame for a not working disk onto the customers Wii when it's scratched. The last time a customer tried making me go through any hoops and listen to \"explanations\" instead of simply refunding me they lost an A to Z claim and their item. Op said he can't afford to take these hits.  Do you think he can afford to lose the item and sale?  How about a review that says received scratched disk, told me it was possibly my Wii when I asked for return.   \n\nIf you're going to scream at me and day what I say holds no value then explain and or give a better option. That's what down voting is when misused.   If there's a business case I'm missing, then explain because I'm simply not seeing it and have explained why.

KO is a company that leveraged hard onto soda, and health consumers are like fuck that. I personally think it is just not for me anymore. \n\nPG... Oh PG. dude they are still a pretty decently a managed company imo. The PG alumni network is like c suite for a reason. However they definitely suffer the winners curse.

{"id":"cyghjrq","author":"insomniac20k","body":"\n&gt;My paycheck at my full time job is usually ~$850 every two weeks, and my paycheck delivering pizzas ~$80 and bring home about $200 per month in tips. I used to deliver a lot more, but we have too many drivers now.\n\nI feel like you could do better driving for Uber, depending on your car.\n\n&gt; So a little about where my money goes every month:\n\n&gt;Mortgage - $750\n\nCan't do much about that.\n\n&gt;Debts - $250\n\nHow much debt are we talking? Maybe devote more resources to getting rid of that.\n\n&gt;Car insurance (two cars) - $107\n\nThat seems really cheap. Depending on where you are, that might suggest your car is pretty old. You might want to consider the toll delivering pizza is taking on it and whether you can replace it.\n\n&gt;Vaping - ~$60 (hey, it's way cheaper than the cigarettes I smoked)\n\nYou could almost certainly get this down but I know people enjoy the hobby side of it, so maybe that's worth it. I dropped about 100 bucks on nice equipment and never thought about it again. Then mixed my own juices, which is very cheap and easy. You could realistically get that down to like 5-10 bucks.\n\n&gt;Lunch (I know, I should brown bag it) - $200\n\nWell you gave yourself the solution. You could realistically, with some planning, eat all your meals for 200 a month. Me and my girlfriend feed both of us for about 300 total, which is too high. \n\n\n&gt;Dining with my girlfriend - $50-100 (we cook at home most nights)\n\nDon't go too crazy cutting out fun. 50-100 a month is not that much.\n\n&gt;Groceries (we typically take turns doing grocery shopping) - $150\n\nThis is about right but should also include feeding you lunch!\n\n&gt;Internet access - $60\n\nGo to the library! \n\n&gt;Cell Phone - $89\n\nBut your cellphone outright and do prepaid. You could be paying half that per month.\n\n&gt;Hulu/Netflix - $15\n\nNo Amazon prime or HBO now??\n\n&gt;\nIt seems like the rest of my money just falls through my fingers like sand, buying random miscellaneous nonsense, or tools, or the occasional home improvement project. I know there's a lot of money I could save by bringing my lunch to work, as well as changing how/what I cook at home. \n\nThere's where the real work needs to be done. \n\n&gt;How can I help curb my needless spending?\n\nYou have to really understand where your money is going before you can start fixing your budget. The miscellaneous stuff really adds up. \n\nThere's different strategies to deal with this. I strictly budget everything and that seems to work for me. Make a simple spread sheet for all your expenses and then really break down that miscellaneous category into smaller groups (Such as movies or music or beer it whatever) and give yourself a max number you can spend on that. If you want something outside the category, don't impulse buy it. Sit on it for a week and then, if you still want it then get it. But really make yourself focus on how much it costs and whether it's worth it. I also decided how much I want to save and take that out first, then work the budget around that. Then I have it set up to transfer the money to savings as soon as I get paid and I never even see it.\n\nIt's also really not fair for your lady friend to not contribute. I recommend figuring out the fixed shared costs every month (such as housing and internet and a ballpark for utilities) and then have her pay that. If you wanna pay more, that's cool.\n\nYou could also set up a joint bank account connected to your usual accounts and just transfer money in for bills as they arise. That's what we're doing now and it seems to work well. When we have to pay something, we both transfer in half and then pay it. When we go to target or the grocery store, we estimate and put in what we need. This also helps make sure we stay under budget.\n\nSorry if this is crazy or rambling.

{"id":"cygniw9","author":"hedgefundaspirations","body":"It's more like 4 to 1, not 1,000 to 1. From Amazon:\n\n**Cloud Customers Consume 77% Fewer Servers**\n\nLet’s first look at server utilization and the number of servers required to support a given group of workloads. On-premises data centers typically have fairly low server utilization rates. This is because companies can’t afford to run out of server capacity. Without sufficient capacity, applications fail, sales don’t get completed, customers don’t get served, and critical business data doesn’t get tracked. Servers and related IT resources are required for the company to maintain high service quality through peak load periods.\n\nThis peak capacity is only rarely used and, consequently, average server utilization levels are often under 20%. In contrast, large-scale cloud infrastructure operators have a much larger pool of customers and applications allowing them to smooth out peaks and run at much higher overall utilization levels. In addition, innovations that are made possible by the scale and dynamic nature of the cloud, such as the EC2 Spot Market, help to drive utilization even higher and lead to additional efficiency improvements.\n\nThe 2014 Data Center Efficiency Assessment from the NRDC has cloud server utilization at 65% and on-premises utilization running 12 to 18%, which is consistent with other estimates I’ve come across over the years. So, with approximately 65% server utilization rates for the typical large-scale cloud provider versus 15% on-premises, it means that when companies move to the cloud, their applications can be supported using only 23% of the server resources, so this means they typically provision fewer than 1/4 of the servers that they would on-premises. This alone is a material gain — but there are significant power efficiency differences as well!","name":"t1_cygniw9","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-30 23:44:12","week":53}

{"id":"cygxowm","author":"redcards","body":"Hopefully I can illuminate some more about Amazon's cash flow and general business. \n\nFull disclosure: I probably spend $5-$10k on Amazon Prime per year. I absolutely love it. I'm addicted to the service and I don't care who knows. That said, I think that their stock is perhaps one of the worst investments that can be made right now. \n\nFirst, a note on free cash flow. AMZN generated $5.4bn in \"FCF\" TTM, and at the same time net cash on the balance sheet is +$2.bn. The company doesn't pay dividends, nor do the buyback stock (sharecount is +3% YoY), so where is all the free cash going if not to the balance sheet or back to debt/shareholders? Right back out of the Company's (Bezos'?) wallet to fund capital leases. The Company does loosely account for this though, and they've provided an adj. FCF number of $670m. However, once we factor in $2b TTM SBC, and the financing in the amount of $1.3bn/year, we can assume AMZN is actually generating negative FCF on a $28bn invested capital base and $290bn market cap.\n\nI know this board as a hard on for talking about AMZN's P&amp;L, and I am going to spend sometime talking about that, but before we do we have to understand the nature of their capital and financial leases.\n\nToday, AMZN has just under $3bn in capital &amp; financial leases for 2016 on their balance sheet. However, we need to break that number down to determine what % can be capitalized as with server/storage leasing and buildings/land for the rest of the Company's operations. The difference matters because servers and storage leases can be capitalized at 3x or 4x, while buildings and land are higher at 7x or 8x.\nSo as recent as 2010, forward lease commitments were $450m. We can assume that this was mostly all non-AWS, and if we double that, given the revenue growth from 2010-2015 at the retail business, we can back out about $1bn in leases for land/buildings and capitalize it at 8x. The other $2bn of leases we'll capitalize at 3x because servers burn out quickly (regardless of what some \"computer experts\" on here will argue). So combined, the debt from leasing that AMZN is carrying is about $14bn. Plus $8bn in financial debt = $22bn in debt. Contrast that against $3bn in net ST assets and $12bn in equity. They are, effectively, a debt issuing, equity printing machine rather than a cash generative, shareholder friendly business...\n\nOk, now that we've figured that out we can talk about the P&amp;L as we'll be referencing our invested capital base in that discussion.\nSpecifically, lets talk about AWS. Quarterly margins were 25%, but lets back out some SBC expense, and even with that you get 15-20% margins which are not bad. This argument is not that AWS is doing a bad job at generating profit. However, consider the capital base necessary to generate those margins - $20bn in net PPE - which is massive. AAPL, which is in manufacturing and does 2x more revenue than AMZN, only has $21bn in PPE. Okay, so lets consider something more \"utility\" like such as Con-Ed (NYSE: ED). ED is on track to generate $13bn revenue and $2.5bn EBIT, 18% margins, with $29bn PPE - sounds a lot like AWS numbers, no? However, ED is only $19bn market cap. Obviously AMZN is growing much faster than ED, so lets consider another example using the largest US utility by market cap - Duke Energy, (NYSE: DUK), $50bn market cap. DUK generates $25bn revenue and $5.5bn in EBIT, about 20-25% margins. Keep in mind, this is with $72bn PPE. The take away here is that $72bn PPE is A LOT of capital!. If AWS were to grow into their $100bn+ valuation, they would need to scale their capital base more efficiently or else AWS is going to have to get a $150bn PPE at some point. Which could be very interesting considering the largest PPE balance in the US is BRK with $140bn.\n\nSo the conclusion. This is not an argument that AWS is not growing its cash flow and profit. This is an argument that AWS's capital base is growing just as quick, probably faster, and not scaling anywhere near the levels most tech companies scale at under those capital inputs. AMZN's invested capital dynamic is more like a utility and less like a tech company.\n\nP.S., I didn't take the time to write all of this out for this thread. I copied it from a previous thread on AMZN and I think I'm just going to do this from now on because what I say is always the same...\n\n/u/TheRealAntacular &amp; /u/rimlogger b/c you just finished going through their 10k","name":"t1_cygxowm","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-31 04:44:53","week":53}

So you don't seem to understand 1) the company 2) AWS in particular. Also, I don't understand why China wants to destroy AMZN when it is one of the big client to China's economy. Everything you said show lacks of knowledge or due diligence.","name":"t1_cygz2qe","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-31 05:28:43","week":53}
{"id":"cygz34m","author":"4est4thetrees","body":"&gt; PE is far too simplistic on its own.\n\nI agree with this.  The market is a discounting mechanism for the future.  In other words, Amazon's stock price is a projection of its future growth and earnings capabilities.\n\n&gt; WMT does not seem to have the growth opportunities that AMZN does.\n\nI adamantly disagree with this.  WMT has a tremendous amount of upside, and is one of the most undervalued stocks right now IMO.  Walmart has their own retail and distribution infrastructure (albeit less technically sophisticated than Amazon at present; but on the other hand, currently Amazon must rely on 3rd party shippers which is proving to be an unsustainable cost in the long run).\n\nAnother interesting bit.  90% of households in America are within 15 minutes or ~5 miles of a Walmart.  Current commercial grade drone technology is limited to around 5 miles due to the shortcomings of battery life.  Even if Amazon is first to prove that drone delivery is feasible, they are not in any practical position to benefit, at least for a while.  They would need to invest massive capital in new depots and distribution centers all around the country to be able to maximize any gains of efficiency from this.  Walmart already has their locations in place, they would just need to pursue the tech.  The leading edge is more successful than the bleeding edge when it comes to disruptive technologies.  First to market does not always promise success.\n\nI think the \"problem\" with Walmart is mostly one of perception, and this impression that they lack vision to innovate or that brick and mortar is a vestige of a past.  But in this day and age, Amazon's \"pure play\" is going to face stiff competition from the entire retail sector which is investing heavily in e-commerce.  Amazon will also need to up its game and create a physical presence, pick-ups centers, etc. to maintain relevance.\n\nLastly -- please take a look at a chart and see how WMT weathered the 2009 recession.  It is a FANTASTIC defensive stock to hold in your portfolio.  One could argue that WMT as a business is nearly recession proof.  When the economy is not doing well, WMT is in a position to thrive.  WMT is a buy and hold forever stock.","name":"t1_cygz34m","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-31 05:29:05","week":53}

You need only look at RIM, the Amazon phone, the Windows phones, etc. to see the truth in that.  \n\nSo continually declining market share is cause for concern, regardless of total units sold or profit per unit.

It's also the number one company in many fields where being number two means you are out of the game.  Also, you have to believe in Bezos, his vision, and what would happen if he died.  \n\nSo, is it more likely to increase by 50% or decrease by 50%?  In 2015 it had an incredible run going from $300 to $700, can it really go to $1000, which would put it near AAPL and above GOOGL, and it's already 60% more than WMT.  Is it a technology company or retail goods provider?  Will they buy up UPS?  It has an interesting future and loyal fan base, which means it'll always be more than a less flashy company would cost.\n\nAnother risk is it's going to be much more expensive for Amazon to grow.  The low hanging fruit has been picked and the poor competitors are out of business.  Taking on Walmart or Google today is harder than it was 5 years ago.  \n\nTech stocks are in a bubble (of sorts) and some like AAPL are down 25% so far.  Amazon has bucked that trend, but it won't forever.\n\nI think It'll be flat or down for 2016, and this may continue until it switches from infrastructure investment to locking in profits (which may happen until a poor stock price forces it or it breaks into different companies).\n\nAny company with such a well known CEO who is worth $60 billion and could care less if that drops to $30 or $15 billion, mistakes like the fire phone, and the company only makes $0.17 per share per quarter at $685?  AAPL averages between $2 and $3 per share priced at $108.

{"id":"cyh2fxb","author":"marfalump","body":"There are literally thousands of things that could be working for you or against you.  A few random thoughts off the top of my head...\n\nStore:\n\n- Are you in a higly-trafficked location?  Recently a comic book shop in my town went out of business.  They were on a street in one of the poorest parts of the city, surrounded by vacant buildings.  And they had no parking.  Location is VERY important for local brick-and-mortar shops.\n\n- Is your store clean, neat, and organized?  Disorganization can make you inefficient and confuse customers.\n\n- Do you have professional-looking displays?  Are your best-selling products located where everyone will see them?\n\n- Are your hours consistant?  Are you open long enough?  Are the hours posted in the front window?\n\nEmployees:\n\n- Are all employees people-pleasers?  Are they cheerful and helpful?  Are they quick to tend to customers' needs?  If not, this is something to work on.  I recently went into a local bike shop in my neighborhood.  The only employee was \"shooting the shit\" with a friend for 10 minutes and didn't even say hello when I walked in.  After waiting around for him to help me, I left and didn't do business there.\n\n- Do employees have a dress code that makes them stand out?  Perhaps polo shirts with your store's name on them?  If employees look too casual, they can blend in with customers... And their sales performance becomes more casual too.\n\n- This is probaby sexist, but I am going to say it anyway... Do you have a female working in the shop?  Customers will often buy more from a cheerful, reasonably attractive female than they will a male.  It's anecdotal, but it's something I've learned from working many years in retail.\n\n- Encourage employees to remember customers.  Customers love being remembered because it makes them feel important.\n\nOnline:\n\n- Website:  SEO (search engine optimization) is extremely important.  With a well-implemented SEO strategy, you'll appear first in Google for more searches.  This means using unique title tags and meta descriptions on each page... Thinking about the specific  keyword phrases the customers search for... Building links from other sites to your own.. Having lots of unique written content on each page.  Be sure every page of your site is optimized well so people can find you.\n\n- Be sure you're registered with Google Business.  This will ensure that your address, phone number, and business hours show up when people search for you.\n\n- Facebook: Post things that people will not just like, but share!  Your followers are already customers, but when they SHARE, hundreds of THEIR friends see your posts too.  Aim for unique, funny, interesting posts.  \n\n- Facebook: You should usually post a link to your website with every picture.  Get them off Facebook and onto a site that's all about your business.\n\n- You mention Twitter, but not Instagram.  I've had much more luck with Instagram, personally.  It's trendy, and it's easy to accumulate followers.  Twitter is a tougher resource for building real followers.\n\n- Can you post a link to your site?\n\n\nCosts:\n\n- How are your costs?  Is your rent reasonably low?  Does the owner refrain from excessive spending?\n\nSelf-Promotion:\n\n- Whenever you hold a tournament, don't be afraid to ASK people to buy.  Example: \"Welcome to the January Magic: The Gathering tournament.  So happy to see such a great turnout.  Please look around the shop while you're here.  We are a small business, and your sales help us to stay afloat.  We have a new series of Magic cards, Magic t-shirts, game dice, storage boxes for your decks, and so much more!\"\n\n- Recommend add-ons.  If someone buys a product, always recommend a related product at the register.  \"Did you want some ___ to go with this?\"  Or, \"Did you know that we also have ___?\"  It such an easy thing to do, and you're in a niche where people will buy impulsively.  If someone adds $2.00 worth of dice to their $10.00 Magic card purchase, you've got an extra 20% in sales right there.\n\nMarketing:\n\n- Do you run occasional sales or other events?\n\n- Do you have coupons or special offers on your website?\n\n- Do you have a memorable logo on your building's sign?  Does it match the logos on your website and facebook page?\n\n- Do you have a loyalty program?  (Example: Buy 10 packs of cards, get the 11th free?)\n\n- Consider having occasional raffles/contests where you give away a $50-$100 prize.  This can be in-store or on your facebook page.\n\nProducts:\n\n- Are your prices competitive?  Like it or not, if Walmart sells the same games cheaper, people will buy from Walmart over your small business.  Or, if something is a lot cheaper on Amazon, people will buy from them instead.  Wouldn't you?\n\n- Try to stock a lot of unique products that people can't find elsewhere.  For ideas, look on etsy or ebay.  For example, if someone on etsy is producing an awesome Dungeons and Dragons t-shirt that you've never seen before, ask them if you can buy 6 at a discounted price.\n\n- Keep a list of customer requests by the register.  Every time a customer asks for something you don't carry, you should WRITE IT DOWN.  Customers will tell you what you should have in stock, and management will have an opportunity to act on it.  Example: \"Hey- four people this month asked for Netrunner card games.  I don't know much about those, but maybe we should start stocking them.\"\n\nTournaments:\n\n- Take pictures of the winners, frame them, and put them on the \"Wall of Champions.\" It will appeal to their pride.  If a customer's picture is on the wall, he not only feels welcome in the shop, but he feels a little like a celebrity when he walks in. And winners of tournaments are likely to be high-spenders, since they have the best decks.  (I've seen many restaurants capitalize on this trick.  A local bar near my house has a \"Wall of Flame\" for customers who manage to eat a dozen super-hot chicken wings.  I've noticed that the people pictured come back regularly.)\n\n- Post pictures of tournaments on Facebook.  When people recognize their friends, they'll share the posts.\n\n- When you host a tournament, be sure everyone is super comfortable.  Do you have sturdy, comfy chairs?  Is there enough room at the tables?  Are the tables round so everyone can see each other?\n\nOwnership/Management:\n\n- Is it run like a real business, or is it a playground for the owner and his buddies?  This a common problem for certain types of businesses- comic book shops, sports card shops, music shops, bars, and game stores.  The owner likes to meet up with friends and play games, drink, have fun.  In these cases, business and profit are secondary to the owner's entertainment and social life.\n\n- Is the owner or manager using Quickbooks (or other software) to keep accurate accounting records?  Is he/she being fair about choosing tax write-offs?  Is he/she paying quarterly taxes?  Is the business registered and insured?  Is the owner using a reputable payroll service?\n\n- Is he/she taking regular inventory?  Is there too much inventory in the store?  Or too little?\n\n- Does the owner spend a lot of time in the store, working on the business?  When a new business is starting up, most owners are putting in more than 40 hours per week.\n\n- Is he/she a good leader who treats employees well?  Does he/she have a good vision for the business?  And a plan for the future?\n\nSuggestion:  Print out my list above, as well as every suggestion by others in this reddit post.  Have a nice, long, thorough meeting with the owner and employees to discuss each and every suggestion/question one-by-one.  \n\nA 15% - 20% increase sales should be a reachable goal.  You just need to analyze your situation and make some improvements.  Self-evaluation should be an ongoing process for any successful business.\n\nGood luck to everyone at your \"small, geeky store!!\"","name":"t1_cyh2fxb","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-12-31 07:32:00","week":53}

It's valued to a point where such a tremendous growth rate is already baked in it seems unrealistic.

But there's also a chance that the bubble pops and brings it down to a much more realistic multiple. In fact even as the company matures and earnings begin to rise, it could be offset by a contracting multiple. In essence I think this price growth right now is pretty propped up by people like yourself he think Amazon can't fail or is special.

There are few industries where that still works.\n\nHowever, I think it's a good thing. The key to any successful eCommerce business is finding a niche. What are your competitors NOT doing that you can do? What are customers looking/asking for that nobody else is offering? If you find something like that, then... *do that thing.*\n\nIf you're just marking up products from China, you can't rely on that income. Any day you could wake up to other competitors that are doing the same thing as you—but cheaper. It then becomes a 'Race to the Bottom' situation. If you have a niche, then you're doing something that your competitors can't or won't do—your income is far more secure. \n\nAs someone with a family, I'm not comfortable with my income being that exposed; life is too short to be worried that any day your income could be kicked out from under you. I run a niche business that's running $3k/month with ~20 hours of work a week. The business isn't hard to get into, but it's aggravating, and takes a decent amount of knowledge/work to even start. I'm secure knowing that even if I did have another decent competitor, the work required to produce the product keeps it from being a 'Race to The Bottom' situation.\n\nIf I didn't have a family, I'd be much more comfortable with volatile businesses like import-&gt;markups.

The online streaming industry is getting crowded, and at this point it's unclear who the true winner will be. My money would be on Netflix though. Also, more money does not equal success.\n\n&gt;Once enough of the world population is hooked on Prime, Amazon will be able to raise prices on Prime. And who will dump Prime?\n\nPeople will pay for convenience, that is true. However, how much pricing power does Amazon really have on Prime? If they double the price, what kind of impact will that have on subscriptions? People only have so much money to spend. Also, I'd be interested in seeing how much they make/lose per subscription. I can't imagine it drives much more than revenue.\n\n&gt;Amazon Web Services\n\nAh yes, the crown jewel of Amazon. AWS is a great service. However, the amount of capital that this part of the company has is through the roof, and it would need to get MUCH more efficient to make any sense long term.\n\n&gt;In ten years, once Amazon has completely fleshed out its delivery network, there is no doubt in my mind that it will ultimately decreases costs in the long term.\n\nYou're pricing for perfection here. Do you have any idea what it will cost to built a network like this. They'd be better off acquiring one.\n\n&gt;Now, I'm not a Wall Street analyst or anything, just an average Joe\n\nThis much is clear.\n\n&gt;but I think that Amazon could easily hit $1,000 a share by the end of 2016.\n\nYou haven't made a great argument for this. What would cause Amazon to be worth close to 500B in 2016? Apple is making 40-50B a year, and they're only worth 600B right now. It seems you are valuing the share price, not the underlying company.\n\nSpeaking of shares, Amazon is handing them out like they're candy. They'll have over 1.5B in share based compensation this year.

{"id":"cyhi8rx","author":"teamboomerang","body":"Rumor is Amazon has gotten stricter with ungating for Health and personal care, beauty, and grocery, but no one I've seen has really been specific about that, so here's what I did/would do.  \n\nFirst, you need to have the Pro selling account for Amazon.  If you've never sold on Amazon, I'm pretty sure they'll give you the first month free, but you'll need to sign up for pro right away because they won't do it for an upgrade.  \n\nEach of the three categories will need a minimum of three \"invoices.\"  Some people have said store receipts have not worked for them, but they did for me.  Biggest thing Amazon is looking for here is that they want to be able to verify your source because of fakes. Yes...there IS such a thing as counterfeit makeup! They want to see the name and address of where you got the items, and each item needs to show the UPC code.  You must have \"resellable\" quantities, and the receipts you are submitting should ONLY have items you \"plan on\" selling.  No extra pack of gum or loaf of bread or can of Monster.  I would do a minimum of 5 items per SKU.  \n\nHere's the thing that people don't really think about--you don't have to sell the actual things you bought on Amazon.  They just have to be in the correct category.  If you are doing health and personal care, you can just stock up on toilet paper or toothpaste or Kleenex.  So you could buy 6 boxes of Kleenex from Target for one receipt.  Remember...nothing else on the receipt.  Then buy 6 packs of TP from WalMart.  Etc.  \n\nThe other tip I'd give is to have more than three receipts prepared, in case one or two are rejected because they will give you 48 hours to resubmit before you have to start over.  I would also look up the ASIN for each item and use that as a caption for the photo of the receipt.  The Amazon reps are measured by how many requests they can get through, so if you make it easier for them, you will have an easier time.\n\nAmazon also wants to make sure you understand the rules for each category--expiration dates for grocery, etc.  Read through them and understand the prep required for each category.  \n\nAlso know that many people have receipts rejected.  It's nothing personal, and it doesn't mean you won't get approved.  Just be prepared for it by having a couple backups.  And read through the response they send you.  In fact, read everything Amazon sends you immediately and carefully.  I've heard some people say they no longer give a reason for rejections, but I would guess that could depend on the rep.  When I applied for beauty, I had one receipt rejected because the address of the store wasn't clear/readable.  I also have one local store that doesn't use the UPC on their receipts (Shopko), so I ended up not being able to use any of their receipts.  I can and do source from there, but Target and Walmart were the easiest receipts for me to get, so that's what I used.  \n\nI have also heard that invoices from online stores don't work anymore.  That used to be the easiest way to get invoices.  I've also heard that store receipts don't work anymore, but I've heard others say they do. Who knows.  I would try it because the worst thing that could happen is they say no, and then you just try again later.\n\n  ","name":"t1_cyhi8rx","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-31 19:23:03","week":53}
{"id":"cyhiglv","author":"redditmodssuckass","body":"One product I had was doing decent sales on Amazon, but I wanted to increase sales.   I had a decent looking card board display made for my product like the ones you see at retail stores.  After failing to get into major retailers, I approached smaller \"mom and pop\" stores and convinced many of them to carry my product and offered them 10% of the profit for housing my item.  \n\nI convinced them the display looked nice in their store and that I would fill the display every week.   Every week for the next six months was no fun as I went around collecting my money and re-filling the displays.  But there was a lot of extra money and I even convinced some retailers to refill the display and I would just ship the item to them.  \n\nAfter about six months of this, I was approached by a major retailer looking to get my product in their lineup.   It made negotiations easy since they already wanted my product and I was able to show them what sales had been like.  \n\nI since have sold that product, but my point is that if it's a unique product, get local retailers to sell it for you.  And if it's successful, then push for major retailers.  As for a site to list your product to sell to other distributors, the only one I can think of is Alibaba.   \n\nOther than that, try to get major retailers.

The process though is different depending on mf or fba.

{"id":"cyhoz0s","author":"crockett5","body":"FBA question.. I want to start selling on Amazon and for now I'm looking at books due to the fact I'm already hitting thrift stores for my eBay sales. I'm curious if there are any good guides about Amazons fees for selling used books. \n\nI see a lot of books priced at 1 cent and 3.99 shipping. Is that a way people are getting around fees or is it to be at the top of the list?","name":"t1_cyhoz0s","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-31 22:33:46","week":53}

{"id":"cyhtdn6","author":"YouveBeenGundlached","body":"&gt;I truly don't have any idea why my comment is so terrible.\n\nI know - you wouldn't have made it otherwise.\n\n&gt;The only reason anyone is buying AMZN is because the trade has worked for 15 years.\n\nWe call this \"chasing past performance\" and it's an absolute garbage way of investing unless you have a systematic strategy to take advantage of momentum.  \n\n&gt;I first saw anted to buy in 1999. \n\nWe all have things we've missed out on.  This one is called hindsight bias.\n\n&gt;It's ALWAYS been overvalued on fundamentals. \n\nThis is what almost everyone misunderstands about people who care about the intrinsic worth of something.  Myself and /u/redcards and /u/therealantacular aren't sitting around saying \"wow that P/E is so high of course Amazon is going to crash\".  Investing based on fundamentals isn't inherently short-sighted.  It's not like someone who looks at financial statements is a robot who is only capable of looking at some book to market ratio and opining on that.  I/we are more than capable of buying into a narrative and and evaluating the probability of certain outcomes.\n\nUltimately though, the intrinsic worth of any equity is measured by how many dollars you can extract from the business over the course of its life.  The only thing you as an investor can control (activism aside) is how much you pay for this ability to extract money from the business.  When someone knowledgable says that Amazon stock is overpriced they're not saying it's not an amazing company that will do great things in the future, they're just saying there are certain assumptions built into the price that might not be realistic/likely to occur.  \n\n&gt;What's fucking stupid is people actually recommending WMT over AMZN. Buying a retailer whose sales are declining over a retailer whose sales are increasing. That not a good long term strategy.\n\nTo be perfectly frank you don't know what the fuck you're talking about and these three sentences are a perfect example.  I can think of plenty of companies with declining sales whose shares are far better bets than those of companies that are growing. Again, you're conflating the future returns of a security with the fortunes of the company itself, which is an insanely amateurish move.    \n\n&gt;And as for \"bubbles\", which this sub seems to think is the same as being overvalued. As a rule bubbles burst because there is little inherent value in the underlying security- dutch tulips, beanie babies, stock of internet companies that don't exist anymore, subprime mortgages. You're implying a company that does $6 billion in sales every quarter is some how even a tiny bit similar to the runup on beanie babies? Maybe you guys shouldn't be giving investment advice.\n\nI've already addressed this exact bullshit point you're making and you're too goddamn stupid to understand it.  \n   ","name":"t1_cyhtdn6","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-01 00:52:53","week":53}
