{"id":"4d9jh8","author":"mm1388","body":"I'm located in the NW and I just started selling books through FBA about three weeks ago. I've been sending in anywhere from 200-400 books a week. Most of them are being shipped to the TN warehouse and the inbound cost per unit is a little higher than I would like it to be due to the distance. I'm wondering if anyone has tips on reducing costs on inbound shipping. Right now I'm typically sending 2-4 shipments per week to build my inventory rapidly but once I increase my FBA inventory I'd like to get down to one shipment per week if possible. If I can reduce my inbound costs I would be much more comfortable increasing the amount of low margin books I send in. Has anyone shipped books LTL? Would that lower my costs significantly opposed to just shipping eight or nine boxes with the UPS discount? I've never done any LTL. Also, is there any way to select the warehouse my books are sent to or am I stuck with whatever shipping plan Amazon creates? I'm still relatively new to FBA so I'd love any pointers if anyone is willing to offer some up.

I figure, (or at least hope) someone else has had one of the two following issues and can help me out as I've never had this occur before and it's frustrating me that I can't find a solution. \n\n1. One of my recently listed items (a TI83+ calculator) is showing as \"Incomplete\" in my inventory, but I cannot figure out for the life of me what is missing. I've filled in all of the stuff I always fill out for an FBA item and yet it won't fix itself. I've tried deleting it so I can relist and now the listing won't even delete. Is this just a technical issue that I need to let work itself out on Amazon's side? Or should I call their support line?\n\n2. I have a book that has a few low MF offers but otherwise very high offers after that. Also, there are no FBA offers so I figure I'll ride out the long tail sell since I got it for nothing. This is causing an issue I believe. I put it on FBA for $49.95 even though the lowest MF offer is only like $12. It's showing I have an inventory quantity of 1 but it's (inactive out of stock). I clicked relist and it brings up the normal listing page, but it has all appropriate info so I clicked save and submit and it's still inactive. Does Amazon not allow you to price at whatever you want? \n\nI don't believe these are noob questions, I've been doing this for a bit and I really can't crack these two problems.

{"id":"4de5v2","author":"wiivile","body":"After the sudden Alaska devaluation with no notice, it occurred to me that there should be some kind of occasional discussion as to the products/programs that this community believes are 'to good to be true' and are likely to be nerfed, devalued, discontinued, or otherwise changed in the near future.\n\nThe landscape of churning and award travel is constantly changing (for both good and bad, but sadly mostly for the bad as of late). By predicting what might be nerfed in the coming months or so, we might be able to ease our disappointment and more importantly hedge our bets when deciding what cards/points to go for.\n\nHere are some things I've been thinking that are going to be nerfed in the near future:\n\n- **Citi Forward** (already scheduled for June 2016): 5x ThankYou points on some amazing spend categories like restaurants &amp; Amazon was never going to last. It's not surprising that this is being nerfed- it's actually surprising that it lasted this long.\n\n- **Serve:** While the shutdown waves have been coming, it's impossible to predict with what regularity. Eventually, however, we figure that AMEX will put its foot down somehow on VGC loading in-store, either by issuing lots and lots of stern memos to store owners or by lowering limits or discontinuing free loads altogether. Any other ideas how AMEX might nerf Serve?\n\n- **Citi Prestige 4th Night Free**: If you stay at hotels regularly, you can potentially be saving thousands of dollars per year with this card. If I had to pick one item in this whole hobby that is most likely to be nerfed this year, I'd say this one. It's too easy to see it being limited to once a year.\n\n- **Ink/Ink Plus 5x on Office Supplies/Utilities**: This one has stuck around for a long time, and it's one of the easiest ways to rack up Ultimate Rewards. A $50,000 (Plus)/$25,000 (Cash) a year limit is insane, and only a select few churners even get close to this number. With the 5x bonus combined with Staples gift cards, the sign-up bonus for the Ink+ is basically 85,000 UR points (60,000 UR signup bonus + 25,000 UR earned from $5,000*5 in VGCs at Staples * 5 pts/dollar). I can see a few things happening here- potentially the bonus being limited to 3pts per dollar, or limited to $5,000 per quarter (maybe $1,500 for Ink Cash like the Freedom). Or maybe Staples will be instructed to not take credit cards for VGCs and/or stop selling them online.\n\n- **Citi AA Loophole**: Looks like this one is already being closed up, though there are a few reports of people still getting it.\n\n- **SPG program**. We'll have to see how Marriott handles this. But the most valuable points out there may take a huge tumble.\n\n- **Chase limiting signup bonuses to once per lifetime? (pure speculation):** After AMEX did this, Chase might follow suit. 5/24 (extended to business and co-branded cards whenever it may come) may have stopped the bleeding for Chase, but I can't see Chase continuing to dish out huge signup bonuses every 2 years. With annual fees waived the first year, Chase is putting themselves in a position to make no money aside from minimum spend swipe fees when dishing out huge signup bonuses.\n\n\nAny others to add?","name":"t3_4de5v2","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-04-05 03:09:38","week":14}

If he loses, then I hope to sustain financial neutrality, or maybe all of the Bernie supporters, including me, will need a beer then more than ever.  \n5) Most memorable positive: Finally sending my first shipment to Amazon fulfillment centers, and feeling like that portion of the business was kind of out of my hands. Most memorable negative: taking five months to actually do that.  \n6) Don't go it alone, and start earlier.","name":"t3_4deb85","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-05 03:46:25","week":14}

{"id":"4dhgiu","author":"bigblue79","body":"I own a small ecom company that I built. We sell B2B and direct to consumer. We sell on my Shopify website and Amazon.com with 3 brands I have built. I have been doing this for 5 years and it is successful. I am making enough to live off of, and no more crazy all-nighters worrying if things are going to workout.\n\nDuring the process of building the business I made a lot of mistakes and have learned a lot. I have a new product line in the works that promises to be big. I have tested it with customers and the profit potential is far greater than anything I have ever done. I want to launch it flawlessly, and know how to do it. This is great and scary at the same time. It's going to be a big undertaking to fully launch this new line. I'm going to build a brand around the line, in essence it will be a new company. Website (Shopify), packaging design, graphics, branding, social media, giveaways, advertising, bookkeeping/accounting, analytics, etc. There is a ton of work here. As a poor entrepreneur I did all this myself. But I'm not there anymore, and I don't have the same fire to take all this on like I once did. I have become more of a creative manager of my company, and having my employees take care of the more mundane details.\n\nI don't have the talent right now to help me pull off this new undertaking. My current employees mostly pack/ship and handle customer service. I have the money to get help, but I'm not sure where to go. Likely this will be a short term project, something like 3 months. I would like to hire somebody (or maybe 2 people) for that period of time and if they were good I could keep them on to takeover some of my duties, and maintain the new brand.\n\nMy biggest problem is where to find a young, smart (technology pro), go-getter that I can depend on. I can pay very well to attract the right person and the experience for them would be invaluable I am sure. I did try to hire somebody for a similar role in the past and it went very poorly. He was very educated, smart, and a lazy ass. I need somebody I can train, but is also smart enough to dig in and get things done. And I want somebody I can bounce ideas off of and doesn't need to be micro-managed.\n\nI'd love to hear any ideas or advice. My ideas so far are: 1. Craigslist 2. Hire an agency to find somebody 3.

{"id":"4dmn4w","author":"p32nicky","body":"Hi all.\n\nWorked in Mobile monetization for a few years. Have seen some guys make some good revenue. Been doing it myself a few years. I do not know how to code. I know how to import, change package name, and compile apps in eclipse, OR use online app builders that give you the apk for android.\n\nHere is my advice for android.\n\nFor android apps, there are so many other markets for you to post your app on where you will get good downloads aside from Google Play. You are missing out on potential revenue. The only downside is posting can be time consuming until you get the hang of it. \n\nAll of these are free to join and post, except for mobile 9.\n\nI recommend - Samsung. I get good free and paid downloads from here.\nhttp://seller.samsungapps.com/login/signIn.as?returnURL=%2Ferror%2FerrorPage.as%3FgoPage%3DastoreNotPermittedError\n\nAmazon App Store - Free and paid\nhttps://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices\n\nOpera - Good for free\nhttps://publishers.apps.opera.com\n\nAPKFiles - Good for free. Very quick and easy to post.\nhttps://www.apkfiles.com/submit\n\nMobile 9 - You have to buy a subscription. Good for free. You have to use actual screenshots or they will not approve. For all others, it does not matter.\nhttp://www.mobile9.com/\n\nYou can use one of those online app makers, put in your ads from it, and post on these markets. You can decompile the app, put in the sdk and recompile, or use an SDK injection platform.\n\nI like Andromo.com to make my apps, but I pay for it. Just google online app maker and you will find one. They all have different packages or whatever. https://www.appsgeyser.com/ is free, and you can inject your own ads, or use theirs, or just charge people for it.\n\nI have one app, that took me 5 minutes to make earn $800 from paid downloads. I have several that have made near $1500 from ads. (Some impressions and assigned eCPM https://gyazo.com/91460b8cfbe9cbc336e9978b703e5c0c)\n\nYou can be more liberal with your content as these markets will approve most things.\n\nYou can buy source code from people on fiverr, and use your own ads, or make the apps yourself.\nOnce approved, you will not be removed (unless you are being super shady) unlike Google Play. If you have lots of mobile traffic (like Facebook, twitter, whatever), you can send them links to download the APK. I know several big guys who have their own site to download the app, and send lots of FB traffic to it.\n\nIf anybody has mobile / android traffic, I would love to chat more.\nThanks!\n","name":"t3_4dmn4w","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-06 18:57:11","week":14}

{"id":"4dovy6","author":"ylin12","body":"Hello Reddit,\n\nI got this message below. Does anyone know if this is possible? I tried finding if the design is patented and I can't find anything, but I see a lot of other product pages and merchants selling the same thing. But my design is printed differently.\n\nNo where in my product page, pictures, or title do I mention the \"BigMouth\" company name. My product page even says it was created by my \"brand\", not \"bigmouth\".\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nOur firm represents BigMouth, Inc. (“BigMouth”) of Glastonbury, CT with respect to intellectual property matters including the enforcement of copyrights, trademarks, and protection from unfair business practices.  Our client is a leading national manufacturer of novelties and toys, including pool floats.  One of our client’s products is the BigMouth Inc. Donut Pool Float (“Donut Pool Float”).\nIt has come to our attention that you have knowingly offered for sale and sold counterfeit Donut Floats on Amazon.com through seller ID ******.  You have done so without BigMouth’s permission or consent.  At all times while you distributed, promoted, sold or offered for sale the Donut Float on Amazon.com, you passed off the counterfeit Donut Pool Float as genuine BigMouth products.  \nUnder 15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq. (the \"Lanham Act\") as well as related state statutes and common law, these activities constitute a direct and willful infringement of BigMouth’s trademark rights, copyrights, as well as unfair competition and deceptive business practices.  Therefore, BigMouth is hereby entitled to recover from you damages under each of the above-discussed theories in addition to other claims.  Should this matter proceed to litigation, the damages awarded to BigMouth under 15 U.S.C. § 1117 could be two million dollars ($2,000,000) per mark infringed.\nIn order to avoid the time and expense of litigation and to ensure that your infringing and unlawful conduct immediately and forever cease, BigMouth offers the following terms of settlement:\nA.\tYou shall, at your own cost and expense, return to BigMouth all products and counterfeit versions thereof in your possession;\nB.\tYou shall turn over to BigMouth all information you now possess relating to the purchase and sale of BigMouth products or counterfeit versions thereof that you obtained either domestically and/or abroad, including all sources from where such products were obtained, as well as any customer lists and pricing data;\nC.\tYou shall agree to pay BigMouth a total of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) as compensation; and\nD.\tYou shall agree that you will never sell or deal in counterfeit or authentic BigMouth products in the future, either domestically or abroad.\nThese demands are not meant to be an initial salvo in protracted settlement negotiations.  Instead, they are a reasonable offer of settlement in light of your nefarious conduct.  \nWe strongly urge you not to contact the counterfeit manufacturer or to take any action that would interfere with BigMouth's ability to eliminate infringing merchandise from the marketplace.  BigMouth will hold you responsible for your complicity in any such actions to the maximum extent provided by law. Please be advised that any attempt to destroy evidence that is material to this matter may subject you to additional sanctions.  \nPlease contact me within the next seven (7) days to discuss resolving this matter.  Should we fail to quickly reach a resolution, my client reserves its right to fully protect its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent allowed under the law.\n\nVery truly yours,\nMorgan T. Nickerson\n617 261 3134\n\nAnother message from a different account.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nOur firm represents BigMouth, Inc. (“BigMouth”) of Glastonbury, CT with respect to intellectual property matters including the enforcement of copyrights and protection from unfair business practices.\nOur client is a leading national manufacturer of novelties and toys, including inflatable pool floats of various types.  Two of our client’s products are the Giant Strawberry Donut Pool Float (the “BigMouth Strawberry Donut Float”) and the Giant Chocolate Donut Pool Float (the “BigMouth Chocolate Donut Float,” and collectively, the “BigMouth Floats”).  Our client owns copyrights in the surface design and packaging of the BigMouth Floats.  Copies of our client's Registration Certificate VA 1-931-214 (BigMouth Strawberry Donut Float packaging), Registration Certificate VA 1-931-220 (BigMouth Strawberry Donut Float surface design), Registration Certificate VA 1-967-437 (BigMouth Chocolate Donut Float surface design) are enclosed.\nIt has come to our client's attention that your company created and is now offering for sale and selling similar pool floats called “****.”  The product images, including the packaging images, used on your Amazon listing are copies of the BigMouth Floats.  There is no question that the picture on your product's packaging also uses a copy of the BigMouth Chocolate Donut Float, which appears to have been slightly shaded or altered in color.  The use of these images on your Amazon listing and your product packaging is an infringement of our client's registered copyrights.  Moreover, the fact that the picture on your packaging is an almost exact copy of the BigMouth Chocolate Donut Float indicates that this infringement is willful.\nFurther, we have obtained and examined your company's products, and they are clearly not the same as the products displayed on their packaging and on your Amazon listing.  Instead, your products are merely cheap copies of the BigMouth Floats.  Offering to sell products online and in packaging depicting different products is clearly a \"bait and switch\" marketing technique that violates both state and federal unfair competition law.\nIn light of your infringing and unlawful conduct, we hereby demand that you immediately: \n(a)\tcease and desist from all marketing and sale of The Gigantic Donut Pool Floats by Zond; \n(b)\tcease and desist from all use of any packaging which depicts the BigMouth Chocolate Donut Float or any other of our client's products; \n(c)\tcease and desist from all use and sale of any product, packaging, or online listing that infringes our client's registered copyrights;\n(d)\trecall any such products and packaging and remove any such online listings;\n(e)\tprovide an accounting of all sales of your company's products in the infringing packaging so we can calculate the amount due our client as a result of your company's unlawful and infringing activities.\nThis letter is not meant to be an initial salvo in protracted settlement negotiations.  Please respond by e-mail, mail, or fax within seven (7) days of your receipt of this letter.  If we do not receive a timely response, we will assume that your company intends to continue its infringing conduct.\nVery truly yours,\nMorgan T. Nickerson\nMorgan T. Nickerson\n\nAnyone have any input?

{"id":"4dqyj3","author":"switchhh","body":"&gt; Luck plays an outsized role in every endeavor, and I can assure you we’ve had a bountiful supply.\n\n.\n\n&gt; They [AMZN and AWS] share a distinctive organizational culture that cares deeply about and acts with conviction on a small number of principles. I’m talking about customer obsession rather than competitor obsession, eagerness to invent and pioneer, willingness to fail, the patience to think long-term, and the taking of professional pride in operational excellence\n\n.\n\n&gt; corporate cultures: for better or for worse, they are enduring, stable, hard to change. They can be a source of advantage or disadvantage. You can write down your corporate culture, but when you do so, you’re discovering it, uncovering it – not creating it.\n\n.\n\n&gt; It is created slowly over time by the people and by events – by the stories of past success and failure that become a deep part of the company lore\n\n.\n\n&gt; I think we are especially distinctive is failure. I believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment\n\n.\n\n&gt; Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. \n\n.\n\n&gt; Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten.\n\n.\n\n&gt; if you swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out a lot, but you’re also going to hit some home runs.  When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments. \n\n.\n\n&gt; if we’re not vigilant and thoughtful, size could slow us down and diminish our inventiveness. \n\n.\n\n&gt; Prime Now offers members one-hour delivery on an important subset of selection, and was launched only 111 days after it was dreamed up. In that time, a small team built a customer-facing app, secured a location for an urban warehouse, determined which 25,000 items to sell, got those items stocked, recruited and on-boarded new staff, tested, iterated, designed new software for internal use – both a warehouse management system and a driver-facing app – and launched in time for the holidays. Today, just 15 months after that first city launch, Prime Now is serving members in more than 30 cities around the world. \n\n.\n\n&gt; We took two big swings and missed – with Auctions and zShops – before we launched Marketplace over 15 years ago. We learned from our failures and stayed stubborn on the vision, and today close to 50% of units sold on Amazon are sold by third-party sellers\n\n.\n\n&gt; there are over 70,000 entrepreneurs with sales of more than $100,000 a year selling on \nAmazon, and they’ve created over 600,000 new jobs.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Seller Fulfilled Prime. We invited sellers who are able to meet a high bar for shipping speed and consistency in service to be part of the Prime program and ship their own orders at Prime speed directly\n\n.\n\n&gt; Amazon Lending program to help sellers grow. Since the program launched, we’ve provided aggregate funding of over $1.5 billion to micro, small and medium businesses\n\n.\n\n&gt; Many characterized AWS as a bold – and unusual – bet when we started. “What does this have to do with selling books?” We could have stuck to the knitting. I’m glad we didn’t. Or did we? Maybe the knitting has as much to do with our approach as the arena. AWS is customer obsessed, inventive and experimental, long-term oriented, and cares deeply about operational excellence. \n\n.\n\n&gt; Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow. In contrast, 90 to 95% of what we build in AWS is driven by what customers tell us they want. \n\n.\n\n&gt; any companies have started moving toward more open engines like MySQL and Postgres, they often struggle to get the performance they need. Customers asked us if we could eliminate that inconvenient trade-off, and that’s why we built Aurora. It has commercial-grade durability and availability, is fully compatible with MySQL, has up to 5 times better performance than the typical MySQL implementation, but is 1/10th the price of the traditional, commercial-grade database engines.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation.\n\n.\n\n&gt; if you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through.\n\n.\n\n&gt; As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention\n\n.\n\n&gt; Frustration-Free Packaging is a customer delighter because the packages are easier to open. It’s good for the planet because it creates less waste. And it’s good for shareholders because, with tighter packaging, we ship less “air” and save on transportation costs. \n\n","name":"t3_4dqyj3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-07 15:12:07","week":14}

This is just the summary of my findings after 5 years of ownership:\n\nItem|Soda Siphon|Standard Purchasing|\n:--|:--|:--|\nInitial Cost|39.90 for 1 L model|3x 12-pk cases for $10 (36 cans total @ 12 oz fl/355 ml per can)|\nTotal Volume|1 L|12.78 L|\nExtras (replacement parts)|$19.00 replacement charger holder (2)|None|\nUse (total)|$228 for 645 charges|None; purchase when needed|\nCost per liter (at the end of use)|$0.45/liter average|$0.78/liter|\n\n\nI purchased the Soda Siphon from Amazon w/ Amazon Prime, so free shipping. My mother purchased the 3x 12 cases ONLY when they were on sale at the Rite Aid. The soda siphon holds a total of 1 liter per charge, while all 3 cases has a total of 12-13 L if poured out and consumed all at once. \n\n\nIn order to use the soda siphon, you require a soda charger and the soda charger holder. Some people modded up with a CO2 tank, my mother was like *no,* so I had to use this method. The chargers I initially bought at $18 for 45 chargers ($0.4 per charger), before purchasing them in bulk at 300 for $105 ($0.35 per charger). I purchased the second 300 set twice totaling 645 chargers for $228 (1). Assuming 5% loss due to misuse (my dad thought you could get more bubbles with two), icing (if there is ice in the siphon, you get no bubbles), or duds, I'm rounding it down to 613 charges for $228 (2).\n\n\nThe soda charger holder was also lost at one point, prompting us to have to repurchase, hence the additional $19.\n\n\nThe total cost was $286 including chargers and replacement parts lost, resulting in (1) $0.44/L or (2) $0.46/L averaging $0.45/L for seltzer.\n\n\nNow, if I had continued at the same rate to consume seltzer, what would the cost have been assuming 645 (3) or 613 (4) liters consumed? This calculation assumes the 3 cases for $10 sale price persists at all times. \n\n\nAll 3 cases = 12.78 L, so that results in (rounded up) 51 purchases (3) or 50 purchases (4), which monetarily is $510 (3) and $500 (4). Also I saved on not drinking the salt preservative, and the bottle deposit (5c) which is collected in my state.\n\n\nSo, in reflection, I saved $224 (1,3) or $214 (2,4) which is a savings either way over 5 years ($42/year). Additionally, I had the convenience of sparkling water where and when I damn well please. Would I keep doing it? No, here's why:\n\n(5) I saved a lot of money and had a temporarily lower footprint b/c I was just reusing the siphon. Except, the charger itself is a cheap recyclable metal that no places near me would take from me to recycle. I ended up having to trash them at a waste facility.\n\n\n(6) The soda siphon ended up having issues towards the 200th charge. I used ice cold water at all since CO2 will readily mix and stay mixed with cold water, but the issue became some water was left in the siphon, and requires a manual pull of the gasket to get all of the water out before the next charge. This caused some wear on the gasket interior, but it didn't affect performance. It just made it difficult for my parents to use since it was extra work. \n\n\n(7) Interior peeling. isi refused to address this with me, citing I had no warranty (it had been two years by then). They offered me the chance to buy new parts, but I opted not to. \n\n\n(8) Around the 500th charge, the siphon began to leak out of the charging area. You'd put in a charger, shake, take off the charger hold and there would be water spraying out of the tiny hole at a high pressure right into the face of the person standing next to you. I had purchased a SodaStream at this time, so I found it easier to empty the contents of the siphon into the SodaStream bottle (I had two), refill the siphon and leave it ready for the next charge. \n\n\n(9) Having to buy chargers. I bought mine off of eBay. You can't resell the chargers b/c you can't ship this stuff through the mail. I am actually 40 left on my second batch of 300, and will not buy anymore. It is far easier to use the SodaStream for everyone in my home to the point that buying more chargers for the siphon didn't make sense. \n\n\nEdit: Some people are saying this a lot of sparkling water to drink. Let me also give a reminder: the contents were shared between 4 people over 5 years. 645 L of sparkling water over 5 years is 129 L per year. Which is 355 mL per day or conveniently, a can of seltzer per day. But there are four people so that is 89 mL rounding up per person assuming an even share. To put that in contrast: 8 fl oz of water is 237 mL rounded up. So it really isn't a lot, at all. And I still have 40 L to finish charging out of the 645 chargers, so it is even less.","name":"t3_4dsatk","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-07 20:04:50","week":14}

{"id":"4dw3p9","author":"PM_NUDES_FOR_OPINION","body":"**Why save &amp; invest?**\n\nSaving and investing are important. I have said this before, and I will say it again. There are two classes in society, labour and capital. Unless you are a creditor or owner of a company, you are in the labour class. Means your wealth depends solely on the result of your time invested at work.\n\nSaving and investing in bonds (creditor) and equity (shareholder), puts you in the capital class. This transition between labour class to capital class is probably more important to us, now than ever, since the gap between both classes are widening at a quick pace, (read: Thomas Piketty) and its expected to worsen.\n**\nBasics of Buying ETFs**\n\nIts painfully simple. Exchange traded funds should be in your saving portfolio, because it’s easy to manage, provides instant diversification, and is difficult to screw up.\n\n**What are ETFs?**\n\nETF is a big shopping bag of financial stuffs. The stuff in question can be stocks/bonds/derivatives/other ETFs. Anything with a cash flow and is actively traded in the financial markets can be put in this shopping bag. ETFs usually follow some pre-defined rules in terms of what to put in that bag. It could be stocks only from Russia (RSX), or only gold mining firms (GDX), or only bonds (MINT) etc. The funky letters in the parenthesis tells you the identifying ticker name for these ETFs, in case you are interested in doing some homework before investing. Google the tickers + etf. ETFdb is an ok website to use.\n\n\n**Investment motive**\n\nThe first thing I would do is to examine my motives for investing. Are you investing because you want to finance a home in 10 years, or build a retirement nest egg? Maybe even just to try it out and find out why everyone is talking about it. Or perhaps you want to have the thrill of making money speculatively, in pyjamas on a Wednesday afternoon, scratching your balls in your chair? Whatever your motive could be, I shall show you in this article how ETFs can help you achieve your goals and not burn half your money, unlike your divorce.\n\n**Financing big purchases**\n\nFirst, I would set a target date, for when the expected withdrawal needs to happen. Then I would go make myself a cup of tea, because we are in this for the long game. Might as well take a chill pill. Usually, depending on the target date in mind, its good to start off aggressive and slowly tone it down as we get closer to the target date.\n\n**Retirement income**\n\nWell, you need a target date again, which will be your target retirement date. As you draw closer to the target date, keep to less volatile holdings and go into capital preservation mode. Its OK to lose half your money when you are 27, not so cool to lose half your money when you’re 72.\n\nYou know that jumpy financial advisor in that ugly glazed double-breasted gray suit, calling you every other week to recommend you some top-of-the-line investment product when you are in your golden years. Ignore him. He does not have your well-being at heart, he only cares about the commission he will earn from you. Don’t make any exotic, opaque, risky investments in your silver and golden years. If necessary, take the money out from a trading account, and in to a savings or fixed deposit account.\n\n**Trying it out**\n\nETFs are the best for beginners. It’s really hard to lose all your money with ETFs. If you follow the rules below, you’d be fine.\n\n**Speculation**\n\nETFs are not for you. Stop reading and go to the casino.\n\n**Risk appetite**\n\nAsking for your risk appetite is a polite way for those pesky financial advisors to ask you, “how much money can you lose before you shit your pants?”. The problem is, those guys asking you the questions don’t manage your money, and those guys managing your money have no clue who you are. The slimy guys at your banks probably direct your money to one of the low cost ETFs, and pocket the difference in commission anyway. Some banks charge a lot for fees, to do something so simple! Investing through your bank increases the risks too, since usually there are two counterparties instead of one. Investing is not rocket science, you can do it yourself. If you want to pay someone to do it, get an actively managed ETF then.\n\nIf you hate taking risks, that’s fine. Me too. Nothing wrong. All the better. Start constructing a portfolio with a conservative philosophy. If you are a risk taker, that’s fine too. It’s entirely up to you if you choose not to rubber up, when things get hot and heavy with the person you just met at the swingers’ club. Same for how you build a portfolio. At the end of the day, build a portfolio that doesn’t keep you up at night.\nRemember, we are in for the long game, ain’t nobody gonna be checking the portfolio every 5 minutes. The whole point of investing is to put the money to work, while you work too. Its counter-productive if you have to manage your portfolio and a job. That’s why we define a time-frame, philosophy, strategy and stick to it.\n\n**Rules**\n\nThere are some rules that are good to follow, since we’re talking about your hard-earned money.\n\n**Expense ratios and sales charges**\n\nKeep these as low as you can. Expense ratio is the cost to YOU for owning the ETF. There is strong correlation between low gross expense charges and good long term performance. Most big ETFs from Vanguard &amp; Blackrock have an expense ratio below 0.3%. That means you get charged $30 for every $10,000 invested. Pretty reasonable. Anything more than 0.99% is too much, in my opinion.\n\nSome good looking sales bro will call you ever so often and tout that his firm has unlocked the secret to long lasting excess alpha returns, through smart beta, and adhering to some modified, multifactorial index, yada yada yada. The first question you have to ask him is how did he get your phone number. The second is can you take me off your phone list. And lastly, what’s the expense ratio? These are 3 questions which he will try his best to avoid answering.\n\n**Volume**\n\nBuy ETFs that are traded. Volume should be 6 digits. Anything less, you’re asking for liquidity troubles. Imagine when the shit hits the fan and you can’t sell your stuff or when you are making sick bucks and you can’t sell your stuff.\nA good indicator is to glance at the trading volume column. Be sure to check it during trading hours. Another less reliable method is to check the assets under management (AUM). Anything with more than $1 billion is usually traded frequently.\n\n**Diversify, diversify, diversify**\n\nThis is so important, it has to be said thrice. Your risk appetite will define the way you diversify. You ought to diversify over the following: asset type, geography, size, equity type.\n\n**Asset type**\n\nThere are ETF for bonds, equities, commodities, derivatives, other ETFs.\nIf you are conservative, put 60–70% of your money in bond ETFs, and the rest in anything that catches your eye; as long as you follow the rules. If you are aggressive, put 60–70% of your money in equities ETFs, and the rest preferably in some bonds ETF; rules apply too. Any allocation in between conservative and aggressive are acceptable too. If you’re interested, go google Asset Allocation\n\n**Bonds**\n\nBuying bonds makes you a lender. The borrower is up to you to choose from, it could be a government, a municipality or corporates. Its healthy to have a good mix between the different entities you lend to. You can only lose what you put in.\n\nBonds are safer than equities simply because there is less uncertainty in cash flows. The bonds dictate how much has to be paid out, and the borrowers usually repay it. \n\nEspecially for governments, since governments usually prefer to print money to repay the bonds than to default and be blocked off the capital markets (Argentine-style!). Do take note that interest rates and exchange rates will affect the valuation of your bonds and cash flow. However, if you cast your net wide enough, and have a long enough investment horizon, there is nothing much to worry about.\n\nI recommend governmental bonds and corporate grade bonds. Municipal bonds are tricky. Town councils like to default. Municipal governments can’t print money too. I avoid them.\n\nThere are different classes of government bonds. Usually they are split between developed economies (AGG, BND) and developing economies (EMB). BND for example, holds 17,301 different bonds in 1 basket. That is more than enough diversification. EMB top 10 holdings includes lending money to Russia, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, Peru, Uruguay. Since holding emerging economies bonds are more dicey than developed markets, they pay more to you for interest. Another cool thing about owning bonds is that you can go to their citizens and say, your country owes me money. Absolutely true!\n\n**Bonds Duration**\n\nBonds are separated through the duration. As usual, when in doubt, diversify through the distinctions. Google “Bond duration” if interested.\n\n**Equities**\n\nMeans you are a part owner of the company. You can earn money in 2 ways, the value of your stock goes up, or they send money to you in the mail (dividends). Again, you can only lose what you put in. Taxes apply.\n\n**Geography**\n\nYou want to spread out your purchases across continents and nations. This insulates you from country-specific events. A good rule of thumb is not to have more than 40% of your portfolio based in one continent. North America is an exception.\n\nRemember to diversify based on your needs. For example, if your primary residence is in the US, your job pays in USD, and your job is based in USA, then you have more than enough exposure to the United States of America. It would be very pointless in the view of diversification, to invest your savings in Singapore. I act on this. My portfolio has no positions in my employing company, nor in the country where my livelihood is based on.\nIf you are aggressive, go for emerging markets (VWO, EEM, IEMG) and frontier markets (FRN) ETF. These usually experience more volatility. Meaning that the value of your portfolio jumps around a lot, and there is a stronger chance for higher returns.\nIf conservative, go for the developed markets like North America (VTI, SCHB) and Developed Europe (VGK).\n\nThe mentioned VTI and SCHB have 3723 and 2054 holdings respectively. Meaning to say that by buying VTI, you are purchasing 3723 companies in 1 go. This is recommended because you have instant diversification. Assuming equal weights, if 30 companies go bankrupt, you would have lost less than 1% of your money invested in VTI. Its much better than buying individual stocks. Take note that VTI and SCHB both have very low expense ratios too. You pay $3 for every $10,000 invested, and you gain from such diversification.\n\n**Size**\n\nEquities come in more or less three sizes. Large cap, mid cap, small cap. Cap is capitalization, not the thing that cool kids buy to hide their freckled, stunted foreheads. Conservative investors should stick to large cap. Large companies usually have everything in order, have strong market share, good cash flow, and make money in general. There are less surprises with these boys. The more aggressive you are, the more you should include mid and small cap in your portfolio. Note that in a recession, smaller cap companies suffer a lot. Smaller cap companies also experience great jumps and drops in prices.\n\n**Equity type**\n\nOther than by size, equities are also split by type: Value, Core, Growth. It’s good to diversify across the 3 types as well, and I feel it’s OK to have a preference if one wishes.\n\n**Value** are stocks that are comparably cheap, considering their earnings. This can be due to their industry, which has little growth prospects, or perhaps the company is domiciled in a country with short-term turmoil, hence a lower price due to the uncertainty.\n\n**Core** stocks are the backbones of the economy, whose stocks are a best representation of the domestic economy. These are usually well known companies and have a strong brand value. IVV which represents the core of the US economy, includes Apple, Microsoft, Exxon, J&amp;J, GE, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon etc. It’s usually good to have some global core in your portfolio.\n\n**Growth** are stocks that are usually comparatively expensive, considering their earnings. This is due to their growth prospect, and the promise of better returns in the future. Typical industries that have growth classification is Tech and Healthcare. In my opinion, the most bubbly valuations can be found here, as it’s hard to quantify future earnings accurately. Personally, I don’t hold too many growth ETFs if I can help it.\n\nI understand that managing by geography, size and type can be too troublesome for the retail investors. There are tools like Morningstar X-ray out there, where you can key in your holdings and this pops out.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4bS59l6  My ETF holdings some time ago (Produced with Morningstar)\n\nAs you can see, my holdings are mostly in large caps, because I am pretty conservative when it comes to investing. I try to stay away from small cap because those guys are too volatile for me. I have strong preference for value stocks too, which I will explain later why. For now just try to keep the stock style matrix well spread out or top heavy and you will be OK.\n\n**Sectors**\nDifferent sectors behave differently, and you will have to diversify likewise accordingly.\nhttp://imgur.com/SoJlbLa My ETF holdings some time ago, split by sector (Produced by Morningstar)\n\nIf you are more conservative, go for utilities, telcos, consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Materials and Industrials somewhat applies too.\nIf you are more aggressive, then hold healthcare, energy and IT stocks. Try not to have more than 20% of your portfolio in one sector, as sector valuations commonly move together.\n\n**Fund houses**\n\nVanguard, Blackrock, Guggenheim, Credit Suisse etc. These are fund houses. You should try to diversify your holdings across fund houses because funds from the same house can have a selection bias. The selection bias may lead to a concentration in your holdings. We want diversification, not concentration.\n\n**Leveraged ETFs**\n\nAvoid them. The roll costs are usually too painful. Owning leveraged ETFs is like owning a pet crocodile. It’s all fun and dandy at the start, but if you keep them for too long, it will return to bite you in the ass. Time horizon for keeping leveraged ETFs should be max. a few months.\n\n**Inverse ETFs**\n\nAvoid them. Roll costs again. Betting against the market long term, correlates with negative returns.\n\n**Investment Strategies**\n\nHere, we shall discuss some of the investment strategies prevalent in today’s markets.\nBuy and hold\n\nPersonally, I like to buy and hold. Less transaction charges, which correlates strongly with better long term performance. Set aside some money from your income every month, and put them in pre-defined ETFs. Then just hold them all the way till you need the money or you are convinced your holdings are too overvalued. (For valuation, google either: PE, Shiller PE/CAPE, PB)\n\nI believe the market is cyclical. Like the oft quoted phrase, the stock markets short term is a voting machine, and long term a weighing machine. What I do is when I am drinking coffee in the morning and reading the news, I keep an eye out for turmoil. Usually everyone is selling &amp; dumping when turmoil hits, so you just wait and watch the discount grow while the fear mounts. After some time, I invest in that country or sector. Then I forget about it. Since my investment horizon is a few decades, I have time to spare till that sector or country picks up again.\n\n**Case**: At time of writing,\n\n1. Russia is placed under sanctions and experiencing weak oil prices.\n\n2. Brazil has political turmoil through a corruption scandal of Rousseff\n\n3. Malaysia political class is facing corruption allegations, suffering oil prices\n\n4. Energy sector getting destroyed through low oil prices\n\n5. Financial sector battered through low interest rates\n\nThese are stuff you see on the news all the time. For point 1,2 &amp; 3, you can purchase Russian (RSX), Brazilian (EWZ) or Malaysian (EWM) stocks or their bonds (ELD, EMSH), or both. Usually they are at a discount when crisis hits.\n\nFor point 3 &amp; 4, you can purchase sector specific ETFs. Energy (VDE, XLE) and financial (VFH, FNCL, XLF)sectors are relatively cheap compared to before.\n\nYou can make proxy bets too. Ask yourself. If oil is cheap, which countries or sectors would benefit the most? Countries like India (INDA, EPI) and Philippines (EPHE) import a lot of oil as a percentage of GDP. Airlines (JETS, ITA) and transportation (IYT) companies spend the majority of costs on fuel. Cheap oil bodes well for all of them, so you can expect their business outlooks to improve and that they will provide good returns.\n\nMy strategy is basically bargain hunting. I wait outside the supermarket till something goes on discount, then I saunter in and pick it up. Buy low, sell high, remember? Unfortunately, this strategy is not for everyone. You need to have patience to ride out the market turmoil and cycles. You also have to keep your hands away from the trading platform, which is harder than expected. No matter what, remember to keep your investments diversified.\n\nI shall include the other strategies here for discussion sake. I do not necessarily think these are good ideas.\n\n**Smart Beta**\n\nSmart beta is the new game in town. Personally I think it’s stupid. Even sad to a point. The idea is so dumb, they put the word Smart in front of it. Its like naming your son Smart, hoping that it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSmart beta is the desperate way asset managers try to remain relevant today. The sorry sad fact is, most asset managers suck sweaty balls. When they outperform, they can’t repeat the fluke. You are better off just indexing. Asset managers realized that, and try to reduce a winning strategy to beat the index, by making an index with simple rules, then following it blindly.\n\nThe rules are anomalies identified from academic literature. They back-test (also known as lying to themselves) it, then fiddle around to find a formula to deliver the best result they were looking at. The problem is, once an anomaly is discovered in the market, it cannot continue. People will arbitrage the profits away. Well, at least most of these funds are kind of diversified.\n\n**Momentum**\nThese ETFs seek out stocks or sectors that are gaining momentum. They are usually an ETF of ETFs, which results in higher expense ratios. Momentum ETF usually have \ndifferent geographical focuses. Expect the global ones to incur more expense charges. The high fees are why I avoid them.\n\nThe most held momentum ETF is First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF (FV), which as of the time of writing includes:\n\nFirst Trust Utilities (FXU)\n\nFirst Trust Consumer discretion (FXD)\n\nFirst Trust Internet (FDN)\n\nFirst Trust Consumer Staples (FXG)\n\nFirst Trust Energy (FXN)\n\nThis ETF holds 5 different ETFs of the 5 sectors that have the most momentum in trading. Sly mofos double-charging their expense ratios too. One thing to take note is that because the ETF changes its holdings drastically, it could create unexpected concentration risk in your holdings.\n\n**Long Short**\n\nLong short can have long and short positions in different assets. Long means you own the stock. Short means you sell a stock you do not currently own, in the hopes that the price drops and so you can conduct the cancelling trade and profit. There may be an underlying objective, where the ETF claims it will be 130/30 for example. This means its 130% long and 30% short. I avoid long shorts because their expense ratio is high, averaging near 1%.\n\n**Volatility Hedged**\n\nThese ETFs invest in equities and volatilities derivatives. In English, it means that they buy insurance against wild swings in prices. The good thing is the downside is supposedly hedged. The bad thing is that you have to pay for this protection, meaning that the hedge hinders performance. I have not tried their services, and hence can’t recommend them.\n\n**Merger arbitrage**\nThis one is cool. I am not sure though if this strategy provides long term returns. When a company buys another company, the buyer usually has to pay more for the target. Merger arbitrage funds (MNA) will check out the M&amp;A scene and hold positions in the target companies, to earn this premium. Problem is, an ETF like this typically holds only a few stock. Since mergers and acquisitions typically happen in only a few industries where scale pays off, your holdings in a fund like this would be concentrated too. Thirdly, you are not protected against a market sell-off. Worse still, in the event that there is a sell off, the merger would probably not take place and you would not have earned the premium.\n\nMomentum, Long-short, Volatility Hedged, Merger arbitrage ETFs are usually actively managed. Means more fees to pay.\n\n**Conclusion**\nETFs are really simple to get started, and to put your investments in your hands. Through ETFs, its easy to gain diversification. Decide if you are a risk-taker or risk-averse, define an investment philosophy and hone a strategy, then cast a wide net across geographical, asset types, asset sizes, sectors and fund houses, forget about your investments, until the day you need money to cure the cancer you got from midnight binge on dank memes. Good luck.\n\n\n*All views expressed are personal opinions and not of that of the employer. Nothing written here should be construed as advice.

{"id":"4e32ox","author":"MahlersBitch","body":" Hello all,\n \nCurrent situation: \n\n1. Currently a 20 year old undergrad student studying music performance\n1. I am receiving a full merit scholarship to attend, receive approximately $2,000 a year as a stipend. \n1. I have close to $3,000 in savings with no monthly bills to worry about other than Netflix/Amazon Prime.\n1. Good credit score with 2 lines of credit, always paid in full and early!\n1. I have two campus jobs, totaling 9 hours a week, which both pay $10/hr. I get paid bi-weekly\n\nMy question/\"what should I do?\":\n\n1. I really want to buy my first beater car to be able to have a car on campus and to get to and from my home during school breaks. I go to school in Tennessee and live in Minnesota. I traditionally fly to and from school for breaks and for the summer, and I always buy my own airplane tickets because I don't want my parents to pay for my expenses. With the remaining work paychecks and a potential award I may win at my music school, I will have over $4,000 by the end of April. Being limited to what I can bring to school because of airplanes is a hassle and with a bigger dorm lined up for next year along with a smaller meal plan, I'll have to go grocery shopping which is why I would want a car. This purchase would last me until the car died. \n\n1. I want to buy a new Bb clarinet. I go to school for clarinet performance, and my teacher and I believe it's time for me to get a new clarinet. Again, I wanted to be able to buy my own instrument now because I don't want my parents to have to go through the financial burden. Depending on the models I try and like, a new Bb clarinet can range from $3,000-6,600. I have tried many upper models in the $6,000 range that I just absolutely love but it's a matter of if I can afford it. A new Bb clarinet would last me about 5-10 years until I would need to purchase a new one. \n\n1. I want to buy a new Eb clarinet. As a developing music student with aspirations to win a symphony gig in the future, I need to start having my own auxiliary instruments to be familiar with my own instrument. My teacher suggested this was my best option because it's time for me to have my own Eb clarinet and start learning. My school does have instruments that students can borrow for ensembles but they're not too great and a thing about Eb clarinets are that they are a very finicky instrument and each one can be wildly different from one another, so his argument was that I should get my own and get used to only that. Secondly, and most importantly, I cannot travel with school-owned instruments and therefore cannot take them out of the building. Eb clarinets can range in price, from $5,000-7,500. A new Eb clarinet would last me 10+ years, potentially my whole career. \n\nI realize that spending a huge chunk of my savings isn't a smart option, but I thought that with the remaining stipends I have and 18 hours of on-campus work lined up next fall I could afford this purchase and save again starting in the fall. I have never bought a car and I have almost no prior knowledge of cars and what kind of potential purchase or deal I could get with $4,000. With clarinets though, I know exactly what I want and how much it should cost. \n\nThanks!

{"id":"d1p9ihy","author":"illbeing","body":"I started doing this in November, but with a slight twist. I get businesses up and running with an ecommerce site consisting of Wordpress and a premium Theme that links to eBay and Amazon. Effectively turning Wordpress + Woocommerce into a multi channel sales platform that juggles stock and can automatically fulfill orders from FBA. Also has the added bonus of being really easy for clients to use.\n\nI put clients on a monthly subscription and so far everyone has made a positive ROI within the first month. Sites generally take no longer than a couple of days to put together for these SME's. Sometimes I even mock a site up in a couple of hours as part of the quote to really seal the deal, the process is that fast. Spin up a droplet on digitalocean, upload a few plugins, a theme and some images and you can knock someones socks off!\n\nMy angle is that I get businesses up and running with sales online with a minimum of effort on their part and they get to see the benefit almost instantly in most cases. I will advise on anything that my clients need, whether it's marketing advice, how to create a process for picking, packing and fulfilment etc - I'm more of a business consultant than a web designer most of the time!\n\nThe beauty of the subscription model is after setting them up you don't have to do an awful lot (use infinite wordpress to keep plugins, themes and core up to date and schedule backups), but you still have that direct tie to sell other services:\n\"Oh I see your Amazon and eBay sales are going great, seems like the perfect time to start driving some traffic direct to your site - have you thought about facebook marketing?\"\n\nThe beauty of Wordpress is that there is a plugin for most things you'll ever need:\n\n-  I just did a quick site for a Salon, noticed their booking system didn't work - found a plugin that's awesome and upsold it! Furthermore, now I have a robust Salon platform to sell. \n-  I picked up another client that needed to smooth out their ordering processes they required a form to be downloaded, printed, signed and then FAXED back to issue a veterinary prescription so I found a plugin that works with Gravity Forms where you can fill out some fields, digitally sign and BOOM, your order gets emailed directly to the dispensary.\n-  I have a friend who has made a platform for personal trainers where they have a client portal which they can track clients progress through, send food plans, log vital statistics etc...\n-  Don't even get me started on what's available with Zapier... \nOrder created in Woocommerce-&gt;Customer details and order details imported into Quickbooks Online-&gt;Customer details imported to mailing list and asked if they're interested in subscribing for offers-&gt;Customer details imported into a CRM for followup/customer care list goes on and on (and that's just for customer orders).\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is... I think there's much more scope than just being a guy who sells wordpress sites with theme customizations - if you're able to apply a little thought and really empower the businesses you work for you can provide a ridiculous amount of value. No need to feel guilty either - not many people can actually make a wordpress site + theme look good!

{"id":"d1pp933","author":"giantdingleberry","body":"It was a hot summer day in July, 2011. I was still working my corporate management job at the time, but I scheduled extra help so I could leave work 3:00 P.M., in order to attend an estate auction at 4:30 P.M. I dashed out the door as soon as my assistant manager arrived at work and made my way to the auction. When I arrived, there were a fair number of people in attendance, but man was it hot. Standing in the shade and sweat dripping down your face hot. I surveyed the crowd, saw two of my primary competitors and thought I was going to be headed for a bidding war. \n\nThe auctioneers started off selling box lots in the back yard, so I proceeded to look at the merchandise that was going to be sold off the auction block. Some of it was okay, but I knew there had to be more merchandise based on the ad. I strolled through the bedrooms and basement of the house and was wondering where all of the books I saw in the ad were located. I moseyed up to the attic and what did I see? Hundreds of books about the U.S. Presidents from Washington all the way through Obama. All of the books, except the Easton Press Library of the Presidents series, was arranged in chronological order from Washington to Obama. My heart started to race as I was looking at the books. All of them were first editions, first printings and most of them were obscure scholarly texts. The former owner was an academic librarian librarian at a local university and this collection was his passion.\n\nAfter looking at the books concerning Presidential history, I rounded the corner of the attic and saw even books. Oversized books about art, history and much more. I started to peruse them when I noticed a plain blue binder. I proceeded to open it up and flip through the pages. The first half of it was just family photographs, but I contained to thumb through it when I turned the page and a Confederate Civil War medallion was staring me in the face. My heart started to jump. I continued flipping through the pages and what did I find? A box glued to the page with 10 ounces of pure sterling silver coins inside. My hands start quivering at this point. I continue to flip through the binder and what am I looking at this time? Authentic photographs of William McKinley's funeral procession. Not postcards, stereoviews or commercially reproduced photographs. Original, professional photographs of the funeral procession.\n\nThe auctioneers are still selling box lots in the backyard and I have to go walk out to my car to contain myself. I start pacing around and call my friend who owns a pick-up truck and box trailer. He doesn't pick up. I call him again. No answer. All I can think about is that I am driving a Chevy Cavalier and there is no way I can fit all of the stuff I want to buy into my car. FUCK!!! I go back to the auction and the auctioneers are selling off the podium. I sit down under a tree and try to contain myself.\n\nAn hour and a half goes by, and the auctioneers are finally moving onto the stuff inside the house. I walk up into the attic and wait for them to come upstairs. My two main competitors who buy books are also upstairs and I try to avoid eye contact. I just keep thinking to myself, how much am I going to have to spend? I hope it isn't over $1,000. The auctioneers finally make their way into the attic. They start selling books by the shelf, and start with the Easton Press series. My two competitors start bidding each other up and pay a fair amount for the set. The auctioneers them move into the other books. They start with the oversized books, which contained the blue binder with the Civil War Medal, silver and McKinley photographs and sell them all together as a lot. I purchase the whole section for $80. My hear skips a beat. FUCK!!!\n\nThe auctioneers move onto the regular books. They pull out a series of books about Andrew Johnson that sells for $400. I start shaking and sweating even more. Sweat is pouring down the auctioneers face and you can tell he just wants to get the hell out of this attic because it is literally 110 degrees at the moment. All I can think is, the only thing I am going to be able to purchase is the section of books that I just purchased for $80. The auctioneer pulls out a 60 or 70 volume set of The Complete Writings of Woodrow Wilson. He starts the bid out at $300. Nobody bids. He keeps lowering the opening price. Finally, he hits $10 and I raise my hand. Nobody else bids. He moves onto the other books and starts selling them by the shelf. I tell him I will start it off at $5 and he accepts my bid. Nobody else bids. I take 8 shelves that start with books about John Adams and end with Abraham Lincoln. I am looking at all of the stuff I bought and am thinking, \"There is no way I am going to be able to fit all this stuff in my car.\" \n\nThe auctioneer continues to sell books by the shelf and my competitors purchase the rest of the books. Now, the auctioneer is selling three 30 drawer metal organizers filled with Presidential memorabilia. I want to purchase them, but I will not be able to fit them into my car. Someone purchases all 3 of them for $20. The auctioneer moves onto a nice wood desk and filing cabinet filled with documents pertaining to the Presidents. A local guy who does estate/basement/garage and junk clean outs buys both pieces are $10 a piece and the auction is over. I haul all of my stuff out to my car, almost pass out from heat stroke and was somehow able to fit it all into my car. I drove away $130 poorer and I am driving down the highway and I hear a thunk. I am thinking that doesn't sound good. I manage to make it home, put my car up on some jack stands and notice I broke one of my rear struts. Most have been due to the weight of all the books.\n\nA few weeks go by and I finally have some free time after work and I start to research some of the books I purchased. I cannot find any information about a lot of them, but the ones I can find information on look amazing. The asking price for a single volume of the Woodrow Wilson set on Amazon is $80+ and I have the complete set. Holy shit, I am thinking, I only have $130 in everything I purchased! 70% of the books I purchased appear to be very collectible. My heart starts racing and I run upstairs to tell my wife. She seems totally uninterested, but I immediately call a well known regional auction house who holds specialized auctions of historical American artifacts and tell them about my Confederate medal and McKinley photographs. They are definitely interested, so I tell them about the book collection. They don't seem interested in the books, so I am resigned to listing the books on eBay.\n\nWell the auction house ends up selling the medal and photographs for a little over $1,600 and I end up getting almost $2,000 out of the Woodrow Wilson set on eBay. The rest of the books sell for a little over $4,500, so my $130 investment ended up turning into a little over $8,000, before fees and taxes. You are probably thinking why in the hell did I just spend an hour writing this up when this thread is about your biggest mistakes in flipping. Because I screwed up by not purchasing EVERYTHING! I should make purchased the entire collection and figured out how to get it home later. $200 for a U-Haul would have hardly dented my bottom line. Who knows what the hell was inside the metal cabinets with all of the Presidential memorabilia and the desk and filing cabinets full of documents. I could have possibly made 10x what I did, but I let a logistical challenge get in my way. If there is an amazing opportunity staring you in the face, DO NOT HESITATE TO JUMP ON IT!\n\nTLDR: My biggest flipping mistake was not purchasing an extremely valuable collection of Presidential memorabilia because I could not fit all of it into my car. \n\n\n \n","name":"t1_d1pp933","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-04 21:20:48","week":14}

End users will need multiple subscriptions, apps, and devices to get all of the shows and movies they want.\n\nSide note: many big streaming services are not independent. Comcast owns a nice chunk of Hulu via NBCUniversal. Fox owns another major chunk of Hulu.

{"id":"d1r2ko6","author":"empoweredh22","body":"So I've read the personal finance sub a bit and they're obviously coming from somewhat different schools of thought. They complement each other, sure, but they have different priorities. The idea behind churning is opening multiple cards, often multiple times, for the sake of more rewards.\n\nA pre-approval is, for all intents and purposes, an advertisement. It's often a targeted ad based on a \"soft pull\" of your credit (where they can see some basic information about you without affecting your score) but it's an ad nonetheless. If you actually respond to it, they'd still need to do a hard pull. If your goal is to minimize that, then definitely don't go with Cap1 because they will do 3 hard pulls (one across each bureau) whereas any other provider (Citi or Chase recommended here) will only do just one on a single bureau.\n\nIt sounds like you're settling on the Double Cash. It's an awesome card and I've recommended it to many a person as a solid simple everyday spend card and a way to get a little free money. Still, it's r/churning, so we'd be remiss not to mention other great cards. Ink+ and Simply Cash were already mentioned as good options, depending on your spending habits. Another great option is Discover It. It doubles all your cash back for the first year, so you'd be looking at minimum 2% cash back. But you get 10% back in the rotating categories, which are typically things like restaurants, gas, Amazon, etc. If you have spend in those, it may be worth a look too.\n\nIn response to your thing about your hard pulls for your loan last year, basically the FICO model expects that you'll shop around for a loan for a large item like a car or mortgage. You're only penalized once for any number of hard pulls over a short period when the pulls are for something like that. That's why it was only reported as one. It's good to be mindful of hard pulls, but don't be super worrisome because it doesn't matter that much. It typically affects your score by about 3-5 points for a couple of months. If you're approved for whatever card you're going for, then the increase in available credit will positively offset your score way more than that slight drop.\n\nFinally, if you're still confused about product change, you can only do it between different cards of the same bank. So folks were suggesting you convert your old Citi card (although...what is it?) to a Double Cash card. It's a great move because with product changes you don't get the sign up bonus on the new card, but the Double Cash doesn't have a signup bonus anyway so there's zero opportunity cost. On the other hand, if you apply for the card fresh you'd be likely to get it and your score would be likely to increase since you are getting that new credit. Good luck!","name":"t1_d1r2ko6","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-04-05 21:11:02","week":14}

Business casual is fine at my job, so I have several pairs of chinos (green, blue, gray, brown). Most of my closet consists of button down shirts. I have long and short sleeve since I live in Arizona. It gets very hot for most of the year. I have two or three pairs of jeans, since I don't often wear them.\n\nOutside of work I'm usually wearing shorts over the weekend. I probably have about ten pairs (maybe less). I don't own many tees and wear the ones I do have on the weekends. I'll sometimes wear a polo or Henley as an alternative. My others are strictly white undershirts. I have two pairs of casual shoes I consistently wear outside of work (both Puma Suedes - one black and one blue pair). \n\nI grew up in the Midwest and still own some winter stuff like jackets/coats and whatnot, so I still have some although I never have an opportunity to wear them here. I keep them in case I travel home or go somewhere cold. I don't plan on staying here forever so I keep them for when I eventually move.","name":"t1_d1r2ttr","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-05 21:16:15","week":14}

My daughter is a excellent sleeper and I haven't needed an alarm clock since she was born (2 years). You will be always tired. Always. \n\nFinancially:\n\nMake sure you understand your health insurance and how much it likely going to cost you for all of the pre-natal care, delivery, and god forbid, anything major. So know your deductible, know your out of pocket max. Most babies come out without a hitch, but when they do need extra care, the cost goes thru the roof in a heartbeat. Preemie babies that are in the hospital for weeks or months easily hit 1 million in costs. So you'd definitely hit your out of pocket max. That might be 2500, it might be 12000. Stuff can go wrong for mamma too. \n\nAfter that, understand how you are going to pay for child care once baby arrives if you are both going to work. It can be as cheap as free, leaving her with grandma, or cost 700 a month for good daycare, or cost 3000 a month for a private nanny. \n\nAfter that, don't buy so much shit. They need a safe place to sleep, a safe car seat, and food. After that, there are a lot of expensive gimicks out there. Some of the stuff for infants is used for 3-6 months and then never again. I have an $89 plastic bathtub that was used a dozen times and now just rots in the closet. They don't need a million toys, strollers can go crazy in cost, they don't have to have a 4000 bedroom set. \n\nDiapers will set you back a decent bit, cloth can save money, but are a hassle. Amazon subscribe and save is your friend with stuff like diapers and wipes. Shit just magically shows up at the door every few weeks. \n\nAfter that, they aren't THAT expensive. At first formula is expensive, but if you breast feed, you don't need much. But then eventually they eat regular food. Now that she is too, she just eats what we eat, so we make MAYBE 5% more than we would for 2, and just share some with her. \n\nGood luck.

{"id":"d1sjmjr","author":"Pyro636","body":"Holy shit finally my time to shine!\n\nSo for a while now these and VCRs have sort have been my bread and butter. I've learned a lot and am still learning. Here are some quick take-aways.\n\nLaser printers I'll almost always grab, unless they are HUGE and even then I'll probably take them if the return seems to be good. Test them out (if you can figure out how to print a config page even better) and as mentioned list exactly how they function and estimate the remaining supplies. Often these will still have paper in the trays so hey! Free paper!\n\n\nInkjet printers are much more of a gamble, and I rarely buy them anymore because enough have not worked that it doesn't feel worth it. Every once in a while however I'll see one in a box or with it's original papers that looks barely used and I'll pick it up if it's less than $10 and seems to sell well. Epsons always seem to have printer head problems so I try to be very careful with those, and in general it seems inkjets are made to be replaced than to last.\n\nThen you have your oddball dot matrix/large format/huge scanner bed printers that will probably start jumping out at you when you see them if you're looking at printers often. These almost always sell and sell well (still look them up though if you aren't sure) since they are more rare/hard to find/serve a specific function (sublimation printers for t-shirts, for example).\n\nI would probably not use Amazon for any of these, unless I could verify they were new. To me people have much higher expectations on AZ than eBay for used stuff like this so I think it's more likely you'd get returns even if described properly. \n\nI'll almost always do calculated shipping on these (usually fedex ground) since the difference between shipping to NY and shipping to CA is going to be HUGE for me. Also in my experience, FedEx insurance claims are pretty easy to do and I've never not gotten a refund when something has gone wrong.\n\nA lot of people will say not to bother because a lot of times stuff doesn't work or will have parts broken, but to me it's a worthwhile gamble for two reasons. One is that I can almost always make my money back by selling a non-working printer as \"for parts or not working\". And two is that no one ever seems to touch them at thrift stores near me; they're always in such abundance. \n\nThis niche is like any other one. You have to be able to identify the good stuff from the junk, as well as knowing your own level of acceptable risk when buying.","name":"t1_d1sjmjr","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-06 21:38:13","week":14}

We want to encourage companies like Amazon to do well, but they have very little incentive to invest into the communities that they compete with.  We compete with that by raising minimum wage which in turn gives their employees more spending money for those communities. However they often spend that extra money right back into those companies,  and the companies like you mention mechanize the labor involved &amp; can bear the cost better than the smaller retail companies they compete with who are more likely to be spending their proceeds back at the local/state level. It's just a fuzzy problem all around, it's not inherently bad for Amazon to put retailers that can't compete out of business... but with no incentive to invest back into all of the areas they are operating it makes for a decidedly 1 way exit path of money from those areas.

As per Amazons policy that YOU and YOUR COMPANY agreed to follow, all such listings are the property of Amazon.  That's a neat concept though.  I would encourage you to thoroughly read Amazons policy regarding your misinformation located here where it clearly states that all pages become the property of the Amazon Catalog.  \nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200202130\n\nI understand how frustrating it might be to put time and effort into creating a new listing.  Please know that sellers like me truly appreciate that effort when we list against you when we have extra that we don't need to use anymore.  It makes it a lot more convenient to list our items when we don't have to take the extra step of creating a new listing, since creating an identical listing for an identical ltem is also against Amazon policy.  \n\nSecond, I want to talk about how you said you \"understand\" that Amazon is a free market and have no issue with me creating my OWN ad, for the same exact item.  What you do not seem to \"understand\" is that I am simply NOT allowed to create an identical listing for an item that is already in Amazon's catalog.  You would be encouraged to read the rules regarding that located here.  \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200414320\n\nLastly, it is a violation of Amazon policy to send threatening letters to people and to flat out TELL me to violate Amazon policy by telling me to make a new listing which would be duplicating your listing.  This would be covered here, under the harassment policy under the inappropriate communications policy.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200414320  (you'll note it's the same as above)\n\nYou actually have violated Amazon policy today, and I confirmed with them five minutes ago that I was clearly understanding things properly. As such,  I have taken the additional step of reporting you to amazon for a violation of the communication policy by lying to me and threatening me.  Ive also let them know you tried to get me to take a course of action that would have gotten my account banned or suspended by telling me to break Amazons rules.   \n\nIt's a good thing I have taken the time to thoroughly review Amazons rules or I might have gotten in trouble.   I would highly recommend you do the same to prevent any further issues.  \n\nI would also like to thank you for the time you spent creating that well crafted listing on Amazons Marketplace.  It made listing the item much faster since it was already there and I did not have to spend any of that time creating a loving, detail filled, ad listing.

{"id":"d1unbc1","author":"jrossetti","body":"Oh for the love of god.  That's fucked up.\n\nWell, for what it's worth I am pretty good at operations analysis (I was an area trainer for a few years)\n\nYou may already know all of this but here's a few suggestions.\n\n  You should stop doing all listing's immediately and outsource 100% of it.  While they are listing your stuff, go source. If you're taking that much longer to list you are much better off upping your minimum ROI needed in order to purchase and pay someone else to do all of it.  Every 2 or 3 hours you do that you could let someone else work for an hour and you source for an hour or two and it only costs you one hour of labor.  So you could source for 8 hours and probably have enough stuff for them to list for another 2 or 3 hours.  \n\nKeep doing this as necessary and money permitting! \n\nYou're splitting your profit by having to pay another person (Contractor!) but your savings + your extra profit from sourcing more items will more than make up for it.  \nClearly spelling and making listing is not your strong point and you should play on your strengths.  In this case that's your sourcing game.  \n\nAlso I might suggest doing Amazon.  Much much easier to do listings (since you're almost never really NEEDING to make your own) and then you can cut out any help until you're working as much as you can and can't expand without hiring someone.

{"id":"d1uotnp","author":"garyk1968","body":"Yes you can but its not really worth it unless its fairly large sizes of cash as you need setup costs, advisor costs and potentially legal costs when IRS/HMRC come after you.\n\nIn the UK there was a programme called 'fair tax town' where a group of small businesses clubbed together to see if they could use the same loopholes that Google, Amazon and Starbucks use. Bottom line is that absolutely they could. Setup a company in the Isle of Man and that *owns* some sort of IP which it charges the UK business the rights to use so in effect the IoM company makes a profit on a tax free island but the UK company makes no profit.\n\nNot quite that easy as HMRC introduced a 'with holding tax' to stop this very thing happening. No problem setup a company in Holland so basically the money moves to IoM from UK via Holland, all sweet, all legal.\n\nOnly issue? HMRC will come after you if you have a business showing zero profit where once it did. According to a barrister hired by the big boys it will go to a tax tribunal, can take 3-4 years to get to court and you have to fight it, i.e. legal bills. The guy on the programme is hired by people like the mighty G, his fees? £5K to £30K....A DAY! Yes five to thirty THOUSAND POUNDS per day! Thats some legal bill!\n\nTL;DR You're a small business that wants to use the same loopholes the big boys do?

I'd submit a new post but I don't have the karma yet and there's a question regarding the FDA I'm burning to ask (a long shot but you seem to be experienced with imports to the US in general, so...). Please ignore if you've no idea what I'm talking about.\n\nI want to start a sub box selling candy to private customers in the US. This'll be done in a country foreign to the US. At this point I've come to a complete stop as I've been told that the production facilities where said candy is manufactured has to be registered with the FDA.\n\nI've read alot on fda.gov and, as I'm not a native speaker, am having trouble interpreting their rules and regulations. Being completely new to US legal speak also doesn't help. E-mail conversations with various parts of the FDA have led to an inconclusive answer I feel. However it's leaning more towards a registration being required than not.\n\nErgo no business, right? Well, the thing is that the very same products I'm going to put in my box are all over Amazon and Ebay and most of them ship to the US, some even by FBA. So far I've spoken to one of these (foreign) manufacturers and I was told on no uncertain terms that their production facility is **not** registered with the FDA, because \"we feel FDA and CBP is too complicated\"...\n\nThere are also some standalone sites also selling these products to the US, albeit very small ones. This all doesn't make any sense to me. One or several of the following statements has to be true, but I can't figure out which one(s).\n\n* [at least some of] FDA isn't sure which rules apply\n* said rules aren't applied in practice\n* none of several online businesses don't do things by the book, including Amazon \n* registration of the production facility isn't required\n\nBecause of the above I've been advised by a serious business consultant to send a few parcels and see if they get through or not.

{"id":"d1v2qlh","author":"RESERVA42","body":"Amazon has a system similar to Reddit's upvote system-- people mark reviews as helpful. So if you sort by most helpful (the default, actually), you'll get the crowdsourced opinion of the best reviews.\n\nI personally almost never left reviews unless something was really crappy and pissed me off. That's just my natural tendency, and I think it's the same for a lot of people. Do you leave reviews? Anyway, with this, I'm leaving reviews for things I like or for things that I think are decent and fine, and I put some effort into them so that they are informative. If you sort by \"most helpful\" and go to the end of the list, there are often a bunch of 1 sentence reviews like \"Shipping was fast, good seller, seems okay\" (like it was an ebay review). Those people didn't get it at a discount. My point is that getting a discount for a review doesn't necessarily mean that you are getting a bad review, and it does mean that you'll get more reviews in general, because people like me are writing reviews for more than just items that pissed them off. \n\nOne thing I should admit-- my opinion of a product is affected by how much it costs. Like, something that costs a lot should perform much better than something cheap. So when I write a review, I have to remember to write it from the perspective of what it actually costs, not what I paid for it.

The company is attempting to reinvent itself in some regards, which is rarely successful. See their purchase of ThinkGeek, for example.

{"id":"d1wi2d7","author":"Jancy52","body":"AS you get used to cooking, learn to cook from scratch the most frugal way.... and build your pantry up payday to payday with staple items so you pay less for food.  Storing is easy, there are plastics or long term solutions, maybe you can find stuff cheap at a thrift store.... I often wash and reuse plastic sour cream containers or jelly jars for putting cooled down  oils/fats/grease  so it doesn't go down my drains and can just put into the trash instead of plugging up the plumbing (a dumb waste of your hard earned money if you are used to flushing FOB down the drain.... FOG= Fat, oil, Grease. )\nMOst people in this frugal community reuse, recycle and repurpose jars, and all kinds of containers as much as humanly possible, and many of us have learned how to also ferment, can and dehydrate foods.    Seriously at age 22 you should be feeding yourself thru your own cooking, and not just reheating pizza.    There are plenty of good cooking programs on TV and on YouTube.  Maybe arrange to spend time with your family or parents who cook, and stay in the kitchen and learn.   I currently spend about $200 a month on three of us for fresh produce and foods and you are spending $25.00 a day on fast food?  Goodness! That's a lot of money in one month. I'm spending only $66.00 a month on each of us... about $2.00 a day!   I buy everything in largest sizes I can find...  rice, flour and sugar  in at least  50 lb containers and store it in resteraunt size large clear rubbermaid totes and containers with well sealing lids so I can see at a glace how much rice I sill have and now only buy rice quarterly instead of monthly.   I do the same with bread flour, beans, coffee, hard dog food, sugar and buy item like baking powder, spices,  baking soda, and citric acid(used in canning)  in 20 pound bags on Amazon and get free shipping thru prime.  I share large bag items with a neighbor, taking her to the big box store to use her card for both of us,  and one of  my sons go  with us as we shop and he loads and unloads,  we breakdown large items and share costs. We use her card, so I drive us in my truck.   I also make our own homemade bread, paying pennies per loaf instead of $2 - $4.00 per loaf. I save all food bags when getting fresh produce at the market and reuse those for storage in the freezer nad use t-bags for daily trash  tossing  out scrapes of food that can't go into my compost.  ONce a week I make a \"backburner\" soup using any leftover food in my fridge in order to get rid of all leftovers in my crockpot, or my dutch oven.     Once you learn to cook you soon discover little hacks that pay off in both time and money.   IF I have to run my oven, I make enough for multiple meals.... \nLittle life hacks help every cook.  For instance when dicing an onion if you have any onion left overs - put it in the freezer for later use in a recipe so you won't have to deal with chopping another fresh onion and this save you some time and effort and you'll have no waste.  Wasted food is money out the door with the trash.  When I get home from the farmer' market with fresh onions, I peel, chop and put them thru my food processor all at once and freeze the entire bag load  in a produce bag... removing only the amount I need as I go along, and do the same with peppers, bells, celery and carrots.  That's how seriously frugal cooks do it.  Don't waste your money on frozen onions or frozen bell peppers, do it yourself.   Being frugal also means being smart about your time. \nI have one vendor at the farmer' market I use for my honey supply - returning a clean empty jar to her in exchange for a discount on the honey when I need it  (calling her in advance to be sure she's going to be there.)    \nSeriously, arrange to watch and participate with some good cooks.  Back in my day (yeah I'm old)  we had home Economics classes where we learned to cook and sew, and make a food menu &amp; budget based on daily nutritional needs.   Schools got rid of those classes for whatever reason... a stupid mistake!  I now like to watch TV chef's on the food network on the weekends, and any show with foodies.   I like garden fresh herbs, so that means I  have to grow them myself.  I started in a container garden inside my own kitchen!  NOW  I have a 100 x 75' field in my backyard where I plant my organic no-till elevated beds and plant by the square foot system. I compost and raise worms (which I also sell and use for worm tea.)   \nTake it another step forward, we also take cut off carrot heads, celery and lettuce hearts to regrow in our garden.... I restart green onions, and toss potatoes with eyes into the potato bin I keep for this purpose as well.   I barter for old \"hay or straw\" with the local rancher and do chores in exchange for eggs and raw milk... my sons muck stalls and we bring home the manure for compost needs - sharing with neighbors.     I let carrot heads grow into 6' tall stalks then harvest the seeds for the following years crops.  I also now use a \"4 sisters style\" garden along with my elevated beds for gardening.   I harvest seeds at every opportunity from both the grocery store and my own garden.  I share non-GMO heritage  seeds with neighbors.  \n   When my children were young i was in my late teens,in the military as an enlisted WAC, an army nurse.   I did cooking by the book from my education in school...  and honestly barely could heat up premade foods, I hated cooking because i hated being stuck in the kitchen... slowly over time began to listen to my friends and elders and watched them cook.  My EX cooked and i let him!   I grossed out he first time I watched a goat and then a gater being butchered, but learned real quick how to eat it after my uncles and EX  cooked it on the BBQ.   Learning to cook led me to learning what to buy for our tastes now so I could customize our pantry so I never run out of dried staple items, including nuts we harvest from our own  trees.  In an emergency I have enough supplied for lean times, including cases of MRE's to fall back on like a Prepper...  Learning how to grow your own food later on.   Life is more than just fast food....  as i tell my nephews, learn to cook -  most women find a man who can cook to be absolutely irresistibly sexy.  I tell my nieces, find that man and marry him!                        ","name":"t1_d1wi2d7","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-09 22:16:16","week":14}

{"id":"d1wnhux","author":"carolineschwartz","body":"Yes we have sold on Amazon it has pros and cons like everything. the major cons is the 20% right of the bat you are giving up however they handle everything for you (we do FBA) we sell sets of decor and the box the set comes in are large so it was easier for us in regards of storage while the inventory sells. Additionally you don't have to worry about your inventory being stolen, damaged etc so you lower your liability big time. For some people its not worth it because they rather do it all themselves and i completely understand that point of view but when we first started doing the fulfillment ourselves we were running around like headless chickens, our packaging is very intricate since we fit a variety of products in one box so we decided early on to package everything and send it to amazon for them to fulfill our orders. Additionally, as a small business the shipping cost is a killer but once you do it all thru amazon you get the amazon shipping rate which is phenomenal for large items like ours we had full pallets going into FBA so we def saved some money there.  \n\nIn regards to being a small fish yes that is so true you can however benefit from creating the listings with an amazon pro acct in which they help you create a listing that can come up higher in their search results. We had the same concern specially amazon has a weird way of calculating how they populate their products, its a complicated (secret) recipe. I do think you should try it maybe not send all your inventory out keep some and since you are creating a shopify store you can start seeing what selling channel works better. Our site is on shopify also lol (lots in common here!) FYI when you sell thru shopify you can have the fulfillment done thru amazon. and by the way i ABSOLUTELY LOVE SHOPIFY!

{"id":"d1wzqfv","author":"Jed2Bed","body":"Yes.  I have two of them.  As long as you use the card each and every month - for any amount, I buy a $0.50 Amazon GC each month, many other people set it to pay a monthly bill, like Netflix - and pay it off in full each month, you will receive $25/qtr.  If you have a BoA bank account, it's $30/qtr.\n\nIf you don't have a BoA account, I recommend that you also open a BoA Savings account ($300 minimum, 0.01% APY), and direct the quarterly payout to this account.  This has two advantages: 1. An extra $5/qtr, which on a $300 balance is ~6.67% APY.  2. If you take the $25 as a statement credit, then that month you will have to make sure to charge more than $25 that month, or else you won't owe them anything, and that month won't count, messing you up for the next quarter.\n\nThe card will get you $100/yr ($120 with a BoA account), every year, until they cancel the program (hopefully not for a long time).  If you put a monthly recurring charge and set up autopay and the Savings account, it's pretty much automatic.\n\nI *don't* recommend you use this card for regular expenses, since the cash back is a flat amount no matter how much you spend.\n\nI *do* recommend that you consider this card, if only to offset your monthly cost for &lt;insert $10/mo service&gt;","name":"t1_d1wzqfv","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-10 07:07:44","week":14}

{"id":"d1x44a5","author":"tanuma","body":"It is probably the best cash-back card for general spending available at the moment, along with the Fidelity card.\n\nYou can do better if your circumstances concentrate your spending in specific places. For example, if you travel a lot for work, and always use the same airline and hotel, you could get credit cards that maximize your points with that airline and hotel. I know a few people who do this, and because of what their company spends on these trips, they earn a ton of points without spending their own money (they pay the fees and the company reimburses them, but they use their own cards and keep the points).\n\nIf you really wanted to maximize your rewards, you could combine the 2% cash back card with a few other cards that offer category-specific bonuses. For example, you could use the Discover It card or the Chase Freedom card for purchases in the rotating categories those cards offer 5% back on, and use the Double Cash card for everything else. \n\nIf you travel internationally on a regular basis, you will probably want to add a card with no foreign transaction fee.\n\nBut if you want to put all of your spending on just one card, the Citi Double Cash is probably the card to beat right now.\n\nBy the way, if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, look into the Amazon Store Card. This is not the same card as the Amazon Visa. The Store Card gets you 5% cash back on Amazon if you are a Prime member. The cash back gets deducted from your balance automatically.","name":"t1_d1x44a5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-10 11:02:12","week":14}

I'd think the best way to label it would be to stamp/ sink your brand directly on it while in production phase? Do you use some kind of stickers or something? Any tips here? \n* This is something that bothered my a long time: How do you go about shipping? Is there a way to mass-export shipping-adresses from WP and import them into a some printing-software? Are you actually printing each post-label out yourself? This seems like a pain in the ass.

There is no \"one perfect card.\"\n\nI will give a shout out to my Amex as it is my personal favorite of all the cards I have had in the last 20 years.  But again, the best card is really determined by your lifestyle and spending habits.\n\nMy American Express Blue Cash Preferred card offers: \n\n* Cash back at the rate of 6% at grocery stores (up to $6000 per year, and you can purchase gift cards for other stores if you don't normally spend $6k a year on groceries which allows you to \"cheat the system\").  I will often buy Amazon.com cards at the grocery store, but obviously there are dozens of stores to choose from.\n\n* 3% at gas stations.\n\n* 3% at major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others). \n\n* 1% on everything else.  \n\n* Varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back, $10 off a $10 purchase at walmart, $5 off a $5 purchase from itunes/app store, I have used all of these personally) that vary with time.  There are usually close to 100 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods.\n\n* An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.  Your eligible purchases can be covered when they're accidentally damaged or stolen for up to 90 days from the date of purchase with your Card.\n\n* Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).  A free yearly FICO score.\n\n* And perhaps the most important thing of all,... \"among the best customer satisfaction\" of all the credit card companies ( http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-us-credit-card-satisfaction-study ).\n\n* Last tidbit is a story I would like to share.  I was in Dallas, rented a car, apparently they have toll roads with no toll booths (not sure how a non-local would even pay the toll).  Got a $17 charge from some company in Arizona which I did not recognize.  Reported it to Amex as not authorized and they reversed the charges.  I later found out that it was for the unmarked toll (I guess they use some kind of out-of-state billing company).  So Amex gives you free tolls on rental cars (Joke,... but not really).\n\nThere is an annual fee of $75 but you get $150 as soon as you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months.","name":"t1_d1x8hxe","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-10 15:29:52","week":14}

These days Amazon algorithms are different where the book actually has to be quality and read to be paid. Years back you could post anything you wanted and you'd bring in money. The Youtube channels don't seem to mention this fact, they still act like a ghostwriter for a few cents a page will work but no one's going to keep reading. Amazon pays by the amount of pages read now.\n\nDo I still do this?

Do you pull these off first or just slap the Amazon UPC on top and call it a day? Is there even a way to clean books up without destroying them?\n\n* I have a two book set that needs to stay together. How do you keep them together without having a heat shrink machine or similar? I'm looking for a one-off solution.\n\n* I have a few books that publishers would send me that I never used. They're unread but have some shelf wear. Can I sell those as new or should I just consider them used?\n\n* Related to the above, I assume \"not for resale\" stamps mean are for real? Or are they more of request from the publisher?\n\n* Should I go through the effort of describing why each book is in the condition it's in, or just pick a condition and list it without comment?\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment, thanks!","name":"t1_d1xo030","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-10 22:50:15","week":14}

{"id":"d1xpfwh","author":"zirconst","body":"Short answer - A resounding \"YES\".\n\nLong answer - Still yes. You won't achieve any entrepreneurial success by not taking action, and exhaustive planning isn't a requirement either. My experience has been that it's better to start something, even if it's rough around the edges, even if you mess up and don't quite know what you're doing, and refine from there, than to over-plan and get nothing done at all. \n\nI have a successful business now, but 9 years ago we were making 1/100th the money, our website looked awful, we had no proper bookkeeping/accounting, no assistants, no staff, no web tools, no ecommerce system, I was writing all the contracts myself, etc etc. But all those things improved with time. \n\nI would say the only things to really think about hard before you start are:\n\n1. Can you do this without spending a lot of money? \"A lot\" depends on your financial situation of course. If the thing requires a big investment upfront, don't do it. Start SMALL so your risk is minimized.\n\n2. Start with something you know. If you really like biking, don't try to start a food truck, or an eSports blog, or try to make money flipping electronics on Amazon. Do something related to biking. You have experience and knowledge in that area - something not everyone has! - so put it to use.

{"id":"d1xpn5m","author":"strudelcheeks","body":"* Check ebay for cheap leashes, collars etc in tough nylon. You shouldn't have to pay more than $5 for a leash.\n\n* Buy bulk size dog food *once you know what your dog tolerates*. Don't get stuck with a big bag that fido is allergic to.\n\n* Take a training class and really do it. Petco's are relatively cheap and we had great results with them. This will save you a lot of time and frustration and allow you to build a better relationship with your dog.\n\n* Old socks and rags knotted up are really cool toys to your dog, and free for you. Don't spend money on toys if you can avoid it.\n\n* Watch youtube videos on grooming and DIY. Buy a Dremel nail tool on Ebay or Amazon; you avoid $20 a pop for every nail clipping (~every 2-4 weeks depending on the dog)\n\n* The Furminator is worth the money, look on ebay\n\n* Depending on your financial situation, the local ASPCA can provide checkups, vaccines, etc. Stay up to date on these!\n\n* Brush teeth every few days with dog toothpaste, peanut butter is the no-fail flavor. Use an old people toothbrush. This saves you money on teeth issues when the dog is older just like w/ a person.\n\n* Not $ related, but touch your dogs paws and teeth frequently and give them a treat when you do so if there's ever an issue your dog won't resist being checked up. \n","name":"t1_d1xpn5m","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-10 23:32:02","week":14}
