{"id":"3anmco","author":"TriWrite","body":"I am a 20 year old university student, new to the credit card game. I was approved for an Amex BCP ($2k) earlier this month and was just approved for a Chase Freedom ($4k). I have an existing BankAmericard ($3k) with 2 years of spotless history. Neither of the new cards have yet generated a statement and the BankAmericard auto-CLId to $3k from $2k just this month, so as far as my credit report is concerned, I have $2k credit.\n\nI've got my finger on the trigger for a Discover it application. I'm interested in the monthly FICO score and the double cash back sounds attractive. What are the downsides to applying for another card? I am willing to eat the hard pull, but I have three other cards and do not foresee needing to spend more than $9,000 in a month. Is there such a thing as having too much credit extended to you?  \n\nMy plan, if I apply for the Discover, is to meet minimum spend on the Amex and the Freedom then maximize rewards between BCP 6% on groceries, Freedom 5% on gas, Discover 5% (effective 10%) on Amazon. The rewards calendars for the cards seem to be fairly complementary. \n\nI think that the Discover it could play a useful part in my wallet, but I just wanted to check with PF before I committed to the application.","name":"t3_3anmco","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-22 02:00:20","week":26}

{"id":"3anvii","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hey Redditors, this is a short summary of how my clothing line is performing after 3 weeks, should I call it quits or keep going?\n\nI have always preferred basic clothing over branded but the problem was always finding great quality unbranded clothing. The plain tees from American Apparel, H&amp;M, Topman etc could never compete with the quality of the Abercrombie, Superdry, Ralph Lauren etc.\n\nThe only similarity between the elite brands which the lesser lack is the cotton type, 'Sueded' to be exact. Sueded Cotton is not only extremely expensive but it is on average 5x heavier than your standard cotton, this results in superior softness and strength.\nhttp://imgur.com/RUFDeib\n\nAfter a year of sampling and another year selling on ebay and Amazon, I made the decision to open my own store! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ITCLsnM.jpg\n\n**The Launch?** I have no prior experience building a site so watching all the youtube videos and reading reviews was a long process but I opted for shopify. Its been decent, traffic has been okay and I have made 7 sales thus far totaling around £200.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C33AS14.png\n\n**Advertising** With Shopify you get £75/$100 free google ads vouchers when you sign up so I used them and managed to drive a decent amount of traffic to my store but it didnt really help with sales. I also read about facebook ads and spent around £20 to see if it was worthwhile, it wasn't worth it at all. I think for £20 I received around 50 clicks and 20 likes.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/musclefitbasics/\n\n**The Future - Instagram** What a beautiful app, its made my advertising more effective and really fun. The interaction I have had is really promising, I have sent a few of my tees to some fashion bloggers and in exchange they have worn the tees in their posts and left reviews on their blogs. I only started contacting people through instagram a week ago but it has been by far the most useful. I'm in talks with a couple of 100k followed fashion bloggers so if that goes through it could take my business to a whole new level.\nhttps://instagram.com/musclefitbasics\n\n**Site** www.musclefitbasics.com\n\n**Contact** email me (Ahmed) Info@musclefitbasics.com or please comment in the thread with your ideas/suggestions and I most definitely get back to you.","name":"t3_3anvii","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-22 03:27:28","week":26}

{"id":"3aprpz","author":"Jiggerjuice","body":"Many people nowadays are recommending stocks, funds, what have you, for investing. Many many questions come on here like \"Hey I have X amount of money what should I do with it\" and the responses are invariably \"put it in a low cost fund close your eyes and wake up rich!\" or \"you will never beat Mr. Market so just go index\" or \"depends on your risk tolerance, but stocks are a safe bet\" or \"you are young and have time, young kimosabe, go market and wait 20 years\". \n\nSo here's my counterpoint to all the responses - stocks are at an all time high, and people are still recommending stocks. But... have you ever wondered why? Ever thought a little bit more than the perfunctory answers? \n\nDiscounted Cash Flow valuation - DCF for short, is the classical method developed by Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffet's mentor) to value a stock based on all its future cash received, discounted to the present. \"Security Analysis\" is the book, the Bible of value investing. This means... Company X, worth one million dollars in the market now, will receive 100,000 per year for the rest of eternity. So what is purchasing that 100,000 worth of cash flows worth NOW? What is a fair price to pay? You then compare the DCF result to the current market price to come up with whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its current price. Due to the time value of money, you add up all the money you get in the future, and discount that value to what it would cost today. \n\nThe key here, nowadays, is the interest rate. Interest rates have been ~0% for half a decade plus. How does this affect a stock's price? \n\nPV = CF1 / (1+k) + CF2 / (1+k)2 + … [TCF / (k - g)] / (1+k)n-1\n\nSo... blah blah blah, maths. Here is the key point from the link: \n\n\"DCF analysis shows that changes in long-term growth rates have the greatest impact on share valuation. Interest rate changes also make a big difference. Consider the numbers generated by a DCF model offered by Bloomberg Financial Markets. Sun Microsystems, which in 2012 traded on the market at $3.25, is valued at almost $5.50, which makes its price of $3.25 a steal. The model assumes a long-term growth rate of 13%. If we cut the growth rate assumption by 25%, Sun's share valuation falls to $3.20. If we raise the growth rate variable by 25%, the shares go up to $7.50. Similarly, raising interest rates by one percentage point pushes the share value to $3.55; a 1% fall in interest rates boosts the value to about $7.70.\" \n\nThere you have it. So Amazon, growth rate is nuts, so high value. Doesn't actually make money, but that's a side-point. Aside from the intrinsic stock's growth rate, interest rates are the biggest factor in how a company's future CASH is valued at the present. 1% in the example above, makes a company appear worth WAY more than it would if current rates were 5% instead of 2%. \n\nThis is the factual reason that the stock market is \"overvalued\" - the interest rates literally have nowhere to go but up. 1% up on interest rates will destroy any company's present value, and therefore, their stock price, which is why many call the current market \"priced to perfection\". \n\nSo just think about this before jumping into the low-fee 401k fund bandwagon. You have to think critically about how these values are concocted on Wall St, and then think about what will happen if the Fed raises interest rates - even in the slightest. \n\nSo bonds will go down, yes. But... not as much as stocks. Not by a longshot. Conservative people who want to hold on to their money would not be all-in investing in the stock market at present. \n\nI recommend bonds, which will be destroyed less than stocks. I would recommend a money market fund, except if you read the fine print on your 401k's plans, MMF can be looted as soon as they have any hiccups. It isn't \"parked cash\" for you so much as a \"nice juicy piggy bank to be raided whenever there's an issue\" for your 401k. So yes, aside from your personal account, if you have a 401k plan and want to reap the benefits of your company match, you have to allocate to SOMETHING. MMF out, stocks out, find the most conservative bond fund you can. \n\nThat's it. Wait for blood in the streets to reallocate to stocks.

{"id":"3aq6ka","author":"localcasestudy","body":"First off, I want to highlight how business for us has never been a straight line. A lot of folks think that things need to be perfect before you get going. You'll see how laughable that idea is in a second.\n\nSome of you may have seen some of these pics from our [big case study](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/) but there are quite a few additional ones in here as well.\n\nThe number of mistakes we made along the way was ridiculous haha.  \n\nPeep the *[quick photo tour](http://imgur.com/a/ak534)*, I do think though that some of the stuff will really help folks to see that there is no magic involved in any of this.\n\n----\nOkay, on with the post:\n\nSo this post was prompted by a question someone asked a few days back about not being able to compete with a big company. I responded by saying \n\n*\"Your biggest risk of failure is yourself and the typical cognitive errors new entrepreneurs make: misappraisal of competition, trying to compete on price, poor branding, trying to reinvent the wheel, offering too many options, and the list goes on. The biggest risk of failure will NOT be your competition charging less than you do\".*\n\nI thought I'll expand on this a bit.  \n\n**Here's what's stopping folks from launching and growing a successful business!**\n\n**WANTREPRENEUR MISTAKES**  \n\nMost of these end with folks convincing themselves that their thing won't work. They're not even business mistakes, because there is no business. They are \"How can I stay safely on the sidelines\" mistakes. Some of these also fall nicely into the \"lies we tell ourselves that sound awesome\" mistakes as well:\n\n1) I won't be able to compete with Amazon or &lt;insert huge company&gt;?\". Stop this silliness. This is not how any of this works.\n\n2) \"I won't be able to offer it at that price?\" And? Most decisions happen in isolation on your site. If your brand connects, you price at what you want.\n\n3) \"Let me add a twist to this idea\" So, with no knowledge of the industry, you're better off reinventing the wheel vs executing on what you can SEE works? I mean I get little twists, but the bigger the twist the more risk of failure you introduce.\n\n4) \"Let me figure out how to tie in Zillow's Api\". People complicate things, get overwhelmed, and never get out the gate. If you can do it with a spreadsheet, do it with a spreadsheet to get started.\n\n5) \"I can't figure out what to use\": shopify or woocommerce, wordpress or squarespace, blah blah blah or blah blah...at the end of the day, expect less than 0% impact on your success from any of these decisions. Choose one and get to work!\n\n6) \"The market is saturated.\" No it isn't! This is the greatest bullshit ever. Beats everything else in this post actually. This is a convenient, socially acceptable way to say \"I'm scared\".\n\n**LAUNCH MISTAKES**  \nA lot of these fall into the let me do the minimally viable product thing that is the commonly accepted startup mantra du jour. \"I've heard the concept repeated so much, let me try to apply it.\"...well, we'll see how this often turns out.\n\n1) \"I'll get out the gate with an ugly site just to validate\". Great! Nobody will put their credit card into your shitty site and you'll conclude it won't work.\n\n2) \"Let me see how many emails I can collect to prove this will work\" Hmm, I validate with credit card charges instead. 5 people buying from me is more of a validation that 500 emails captured on a pre-launch page.\n\n3) Validating at all! If your idea is so unique that it needs validation, you've increased your chances of failure. Why make your first business risky, when there are gazillion things that other people have already validated for you?\n\n4) Making people guess what you're selling. People should know what they're getting on your site in a split second. If you can't say it in one quick sentence on the above the fold section of your site, something is wrong.\n\n**OPERATIONAL MISTAKES**  \n\nNow if you've gotten to this point, you actually found a way to have a functioning business. It's incredibly hard to get there. Yet the opportunities to mess up at this point are still substantial.\n\n1) \"Let me lower my prices so I can compete\". Unless you're selling widgets, you should be competing on brand, not price.\n\n2) \"Would be awesome if the customer can customize everything\". One product/service at one price is the holy grail as far as I'm concerned. As a new entrepreneur each additional variable increases your logistical challenges, and confuses your customer. The more options, the lower the conversion rate, all things being equal.\n\n3) The Peanut Allergy problem. I came up with this phrase to describe this problem:  A simple solution will fit 95% of your customers. You'll need some additional solution to fit the other 5%. That additional solution often ends up hurting the 95%. Do you take nuts out of your chocolates because some people have peanut allergies? Hell no you don't. You let that go and focus on serving the majority of your customers.  I see so many people fall victim to this one.\n\n4) Long ass forms: Collect the minimum data you can collect to close the sale. Anything extra you need ask AFTER the sale is completed. The more fields the lower your conversion rates, all things being equal.\n\n5) Being fucking cheap! I'm not even in the mood to put this nicely. You don't buy the cheapest jeans, you don't buy the cheapest watch, you don't buy the cheapest phone. You go all out buying silly shit, but you want the cheapest (or free) everything when it comes to investing in YOU. This shit kills me every time I see it.\n\n6) Focusing on the wrong things: What matters? GETTING CUSTOMERS. What does it take: Branding &amp; Marketing. If these aren't taking up 90% of your time, you're shooting yourself in the foot. What folks spend time on instead? \"oh this sweet widget that will cross populate emails to my cms so I can save 30 seconds on client interaction..and on and on...all of this fancy stuff can come later. Build a business first, get revenue and then go to town. I was doing $60K per month off of Google spreadsheets, google calendar, and gmail. Focus on Getting CUSTOMERS!!!!!\n\n**Wrapping it up!**  \n\nAnd that's it. A non-exhaustive list, but this captures most of the stuff that I see folks doing and saying to either stay on the sidelines or set themselves up for failure.\n\nWill everything here apply to every single situation, of course not. But I bet for quite a few of you that are stuck, there are quite a few things on here that will connect right away. \n\n**And I know that because I've been there!** \n\nI want to see you guys win, but this is [my reaction as I'm reading a lot of comments on reddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ0yD-9CDwI&amp;t=0m17s) haha.  \n\nHopefully this changes some of that.\n\nFor more of this stuff, [our FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groovelearning/?fref=nf), and [my free books](http://localcasestudy.com/free-guides/) with the full wetshaveclub casestudy and similar writings.\n\n","name":"t3_3aq6ka","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-22 18:43:01","week":26}

{"id":"3aqwqi","author":"BAMFAR","body":"Hi all, long time lurker here.  I searched a bit but was unable to find anything recent on this.  Discover is currently offering a promo for their IT card for all new card members that will offer double cash back on all cash back money for a full year.  Discover card usually offers a $50 promo to refer a friend, $50 for each person.  This promo will essentially double the bonus to a $100 for each person.  \n\nPerhaps more importantly, discover has rotating categories for each quarter (https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html) that give 5% back on all purchases in that category, as well as a standard 1% on all other purchases.  This promo will double these to 10% back on the categories and 2% back on everything else for a year.  The categories include things like gas, restaurants and amazon, so it will add up quick.  They also have a portal that you can make purchases through that I use often, and the cash back rates from portal purchases (typically 5%-10%, sometimes up to 20%) also are doubled with the promo they are offering.\n\nI have quite a few cards now, but discover was my first credit card and has been great to me.  They have highly rated customer service, and is one of 2 (chase freedom is the other) cards I highly recommend for any credit card user, beginning or existing, because they are no fee no BS cards and both have rotating 5% categories for cash back.  The 10% cash back rate for this promo is unheard of and worth it alone, but the extra 100 to sign up should be the cherry on top. :)\n\nOne other random perk of Discover that they offer price matching and don't exclude black Friday.  So if there are any limited quantity door buster deals that you don't feel like getting up/waiting for and maybe not even getting, you can buy it before and discover will price match it to the sale price for you.  Haven't actually done it myself but it has been documented well online.\n\nAnyways, if you found any of this to be helpful I would be grateful if you use one of my links to sign up as we would both get the 100$.   I have to email or PM them if you want one due to the way they give the links.  Feel free to PM me or ask in the comments.\n\nHere's a no referral link if you want to have a look or sign up without using my referral, but it doesn't have a sign up bonus:  https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/index.html\n\nIf you have any questions about the card or company, or credit cards/credit in general, feel free to ask!\n\n\nEDIT:   Whatever you have earned in cash back during the 1 year promo doubled after the 12 months is up, not right away.  \n\nI will also throw in a $5 Amazon GC for anyone that uses my link.\n\n","name":"t3_3aqwqi","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-22 21:57:55","week":26}

There's a referral link to one of them towards the bottom. PM me for the email used to sign up for Elitedealclub, because you need to be \"invited\". I don't remember how I got in to begin with.\n\nI'm pretty sure I've scored several thousands of dollars worth of stuff. This is the list I complied for a few of my friends who wanted to start doing it.\n\nHave fun!\n\nhttp://Ilovetoreview.com  THIS is my absolute favorite one and what got me hooked. They send out the best stuff, and it's usually free. I get my emails at 9:30am (Pacific time) they're sent out usually 12:30EST and they also send text, but I never seem to get them. My friends do though.\n\nhttp://etekcitizen.com This one is hard to get accepted for. I applied several times and finally got approved tonight after updating my amazon profile, and I'm just under 100 products reviewed. \n\nhttp://homeproducttesting.org/\n\nhttp://www.reviewerdeals.com/ Haven't gotten anything from them, the deals are cheap but they're kinda meh.\n\nhttp://productelf.com/ Browse what they have, claim coupon\n\nhttp://honestfew.com/reviewers/ Email signup, haven't gotten anything yet. They're supposed to email you as new products arrive.\n\nhttp://dealsforreviews.com/ Browse what they have, claim coupon.\n\nhttp://shopwithreviews.com/ You have to request items, and the merchant can approve or deny you. Haven't gotten anything yet.\n\nhttps://www.amzreviewtrader.com LOTS of stuff, you have to request from the merchant but I've gotten a few things so far. I like this site.\n\nhttp://reviewloop.com/ You can sign up and have to get accepted, everything is completely free and you earn points for every review, unlocking more valuable things.\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure how I got into reviewloop. I got an invitation email from them one day. I thought maybe I signed up for a wait list but I don't see one on the site. They may have contacted me via my Amazon profile to be a member. I don't have any invite codes, sorry.\n :(\n\n\nhttp://amazingdealsgroup.com/ You get \"coins\" to use for reviews, so you can only have a couple pending items but they have neat stuff for cheap.\n\nhttp://snagshout.com/ Lots of awesome stuff, can only have one item our for review at a time. Got a few good things.\n\nhttp://www.dollardealreviews.com/?mref=475 Small selection, goes quick. This is a referral link. You can sign up for text alerts for new items.\n\nhttps://www.giveawayservice.com/ Just signed up last night, looks like you have to request items. They have different rules for each.. Some you have to do a blog review, or just an amazon review. Read the info before you request.\n\nhttps://elitedealclub.com/  lots of neat stuff sent out at 7am, 11am and 5pm (pacific time) They send an email out in the morning with a list of offers for each time. You have to be super quick. PM for referral email.\n\nhttp://www.uberzonclub.com/ Sends out emails throughout the day. You have to be quick. Mostly supplements, skin care, vitamins but occasionally awesome stuff worth your time.\n\nhttp://m.vonbeau.com/offer/get-free-and-discounted-products-to-review-on-amazon.htm   A list of good sites if I missed any, the ones I listed are my favorites. This also has the mailing list ones that I didn't include.\n\nhttp://www.guide2free.com/home-and-garden/free-cheap-products-amazon-reviews/  another list of sites\n\nI'm on a few facebook groups, and they are awesome if you don't order lots of stuff. I have a hard time keeping track of where and what I got and from who. The facebook groups sometimes require you to fill out google forms after you have reviewed the product to make sure you are doing your part. Most of the websites listed above automatically detect your review.\n\nIf I missed any good sites, feel free to list them in the comments!\n\nEDIT: If you are interested in seeing the stuff I have reviewed, PM me and I will give you my amazon profile link so you can get a better idea of what kinds of products these sites offer. The types of products change constantly... sometimes all you see is skin care, then a week later it's phone cases, home goods, outdoors... ect.","name":"t3_3asyfa","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-23 08:52:03","week":26}

I was planning to keep this card as a permanent staple in my wallet for those times when I am not meeting min spends but have expenses in 5% cash back categories. I figured I would take advantage of a $50 Amazon bonus which I found [here](http://www.amazon.com/Discover-it%C2%AE/dp/B00AW3IXZO). Unfortunately, I was busy trying to do two things at once and did not notice when I was redirected to a page to apply for a Discover IT *chrome* ([link](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LXNZRVU?plattr=ccmp&amp;pf_rd_p=efe3aa60-5f15-405e-b413-75748506c2c5%2Fc4a8a422-ff15-467b-a2ef-b5d864d55f20&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=3561432011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1C4ZS1TYAGBR88GT69D9&amp;ref_=acs_ux_hsb_5s_3_m_ccmp_sbb_tcg)). Yes, I am a moron.\n\nI filled out the application and was accepted immediately for the IT chrome. However, the chrome version of this card is not very useful to me as it gives 2% cash back on restaurants and gas and 1% everywhere else. I really wanted the rotating 5% CB of the regular Discover IT! \n\nAny recommendations on my best strategy for getting this card converted to a regular Discover IT rather than the IT chrome? Should I call recon right away? Once the card arrives? Send a SM? I'm fine with giving up the Amazon bonus as long as I get the card I want. \n\nedited: clarity","name":"t3_3au9gi","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-23 17:40:53","week":26}

{"id":"3aukoi","author":"TheCudgeler","body":"Hey everyone. I’ve got a quick question regarding when new accounts hit your credit report and what bearing it has on new applications shortly there-after. I know they can see the hard pulls instantly, I’m just curious as to when they can see that it was approved and is a new CC account.\n\nTrying to not have this turn in to some kind of personal “What-Card-Tuesday,” but I feel I should include my card background and the prospects I’m looking at.\n\n\n\n* My CK Fako is 789\n\n\n* Capital One Kohls Card – July 2000\n* Citi Forward (w/ 2x dinning/Amazon TYP) – Aug 2011\n* AmEx Blue Cash – Jul 2013\n* Chase Freedom – Jul 2013\n* Citi Forward Authorized User (w/ grandfathered 5x dinning/Amazon TYP) – Aug 2013\n* Citi Double Cash – Sep 2014\n* Discover It – Nov 2014\n* Chase Ink Bold – May 5th 2015\n* Chase SW Premier – May 13th 2015\n* Chase SW Plus – June 13th 2015\n\n\n\n\nSomething of note is that I only see 1 hard pull in May, one on the 13th. Not sure why I don’t see one for the Ink? Alas, that’s a question for another time... Another quick note is concerning my SouthWest cards. I applied for both simultaneously. I had to recon my SW Plus, but I did it within the 30 days, so it should still only be one HP.\n\nAnd finally, where to go from here…. I would ideally like a CSP.  But, I have the Double Cash, Discover It, Ink, SW Plus, and SW Premier. With all the “5 account” talk I’m worried I will be denied with my latest SW card. So my question is, will Chase register my new SW card yet, or will they only see 4 new accounts until the next month? In addition, if you think Chase won’t register this new card yet and CSP approval is good, is there any risk to getting it? Would Chase be upset at the 4 new cards in what amounts to about a month?\n\nI really appreciate any help or comments!\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR – Frankly, I wouldn’t have wanted to read that wall of text either. Long story short, I’ve got 3 new cards in the last 3 months and 5 in the last 6 months. When will Chase “register” my latest card, impacting my CSP approval chances? \n","name":"t3_3aukoi","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-23 19:04:18","week":26}

I've been doing this for a year in July and have built up a decent credit score, so now my options are more open. I just took out a car loan, too.\nMy goal is not necessarily to build credit anymore as right now my only real thing hitting me is how many accounts have been open in the last year and the age of my accounts, but I'm looking to get the best rewards and interest rates of someone with a credit score around 700. I do have a couple of credit cards and charge small things (Netflix, Gym Membership) on each of them to keep them active. I have yet to pay interest on any of them.\nCurrently I have:\n$500 limit card with my credit union, 12% interest, first card/oldest account, the highest limit it will go, rewards program is more or less useless, plan on keeping this one around just because it's my oldest account with the lowest interest.\n$1300 capital one student card, 19.8% interest. 1.25% cash back rewards. Looking to upgrade to a better Capital One card?\n$1500 Amazon/Chase card, 22% interest, 3% cash back on amazon purchases, 2% on food and gas, 1% everything else.\n$1000 Paypal Card. 19.99% Interest.\n$500 Victoria's Secret Card.\nJust approved for a $3,500 Sallie Mae Mastercard for the 5% cash back on gas and groceries, not sure of interest rate yet.\nI only owe about 1200$ (will be paid off by the time they are due) between two cards, the Capital One and Amazon Card, looking to transfer $600 from the Capital One to a different card if that's what's best.\nI don't travel so I have no interest in miles.

Do I go for a balance transfer, just eat it and keep paying monthly installments, or pay it off completely and run it back up with my other daily expenses to avoid more interest accumulating?\n\nI'm 23 years old, one year out of school, working a full-time, well-paying job ($50,000 annually).\n\nSix months ago, I got a $2,000 Chase Amazon credit card offering no interest for six months. Well I was stupid and forgot about the 6 month period and maxed it out three months ago, brought it down to $1,000, then maxed it again going to Bonnaroo. I'm terrible with my money. I just realized the 22% APR (I know...I know) became effective on 6/2 with a last statement date of 6/1 and closing date of 7/1.\n\n\nI've been told I will have to pay the interest on the balance up to this point in the month (close to $444), regardless of if I pay the balance completely before month end. Is this true? I thought interest was calculated at the end of a period?\n\nThe $2,000 card is my only debt aside from a $400 Wells Fargo student card that is still not collecting interest and then my car payment.\n\nI get paid $1,380 twice a month. The first check (around the first of the month) covers all bills except cards which total $1,290 (370 car, 250 insurance, 670 rent). The second check I blow on food, gas, and misc stupid things. I have no savings except for my company 401k which totals $2,500 currently. I have $200 cash on hand and get paid Friday 6/26.\n\nI was contacted by Regions (my main bank) a few months ago and offered a credit card with a free balance transfer and APR lower than my current one, although I don't remember the exact rate. I think my best option is to try and get this card and do a balance transfer. Then work on paying that card.\n\nI'm thinking about paying only my rent with this upcoming check (first check of the month for July, 6/26) and using the other $710 to pay down a portion of the balance on the Chase Amazon card. Then use my second check of the month to pay my late car and insurance payments (they'll be less than 30 days late).\n\nIs this a good plan? I really don't know what I'm doing and need advice. Should I try and apply for a different card with a balance transfer?","name":"t3_3av9k7","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-23 21:56:35","week":26}

In essence a “side hustle” can be seen as a way to generate extra income from your free time, which you can fit around your “real” job.\n\nThe problem is that there are so many options available when it comes to side hustles – and so many tempting ebooks and products that promise easy riches – that it can be hard to figure out which side hustles are worth your time and which are really pipe-dreams that only a tiny percentage of people succeed with.\n\nOver the last decade or so I’ve become obsessed with internet-based side hustles. There are many reasons for this including…\n\n1) Time Flexibility\nPhysical side hustles like dog walking or lawn mowing typically force you to commit a certain amount of time to them on a regular basis. No matter what the weather is, how busy you are at your main job or what else is going on in your personal life, if you’ve promised to clean someone’s windows on Saturday morning you better stick to it or your reputation will suffer.\n\nCompare this to an internet-based side hustle such as running your own website and you’ll find that online hustles have far more flexibility. You can work on your website when it suits you. You can write new blog posts when you’re feeling inspired and queue them up ready to be published even if you’re working solidly at your job for the rest of the week.\n\n2) Profitability\nMany physical side hustles are service-based – meaning that you charge a set fee to clean someone’s house or tutor them in a foreign language. When you stop working, you stop earning.\n\nWhile that’s not necessarily a bad thing, when it comes to online hustles there are far more options to earn extra income even when you’re not working. For example as anyone with a successful website will tell you – they’ll still earn revenue from articles they wrote months ago whether they’re currently online or are busy doing something else.\n\nThis means that the profit potential of online side hustles can be far greater than many physical alternatives.\n\n3) Value Added\nIf I arranged to bath local dogs for a set fee I’ve really just created an extra job for myself. Unless I “go big”, take on premises and staff it’s not really a business – at least not one that I can sell in the future.\n\nIn contrast many internet-based side hustles *can* be sold in the future. For example there’s a buoyant market in buying and selling websites. If you’ve built a successful site then there are all sorts of people who might be willing to buy it off you for many times it’s monthly earnings.\n\nThis means that you not only build a regular monthly income while you’re growing your side hustle but additionally you can “cash out” in the future for a large one-off payday.\n\nThe long and short of all this is that I believe that for my own needs – and those of many others – having some kind of online side hustle is one of the most flexible and profitable ways to earn extra income from your free time.\n\nOf course the next question is really what actually works. After all the internet is buzzing with new product releases, courses and software that promise to make you millions for no work.\n\nSo let’s cut through all the hype for a minute. You see over the years I’ve tried all sorts of things online. Some were raging successes but more often than not the results disappointed me.\n\nI thought therefore that it might be useful to highlight some of the side hustles that have personally worked for me over the years. If you’re currently looking to increase your income with a new side hustle these are the “winners” from my own experience and will hopefully provide you with some hype-free guidance on where you might want to consider looking.\n\nAffiliate Marketing\nAffiliate marketing involves promoting another company’s products or service in such a way that when someone makes a purchase, you earn a commission.\n\nAt it’s simplest I’ve built a number of websites and blogs over the years that:\n\n(a) Offer high quality information and advice to visitors\n(b) Attract free visitors from the search engines thanks to all this content\n(c) Include a handful of affiliate links to products/services that I truly believe in\n\nMy content attracts free visitors, and a number of these end up clicking my links and buying a product. As a result I earn commissions. Market your site well and promote the right products and it’s possible to do quite well from the process.\n\nWhile it can take some time to learn how to do affiliate marketing properly I believe it’s within the limits of most people. Even better there is more information and advice around than ever before on what works.\n\nBuilding &amp; Selling Websites\nSome years ago I launched a new affiliate website for ecommerce entrepreneurs. Over a few years the site really started to perform well and started to match the income I was receiving from my day job. Sadly, at the same time I was getting bored with the website and wasn’t giving it the love it really deserved.\n\nAs a result of this situation I eventually turned around and decided to try and sell it. Much to my surprise there was a lot of interest and I ended up taking a five-figure payday as a result of selling that one website.\n\nSince that initial success I’ve built and sold a number of other websites to investors. And while the process takes time – you’ll need to build a website, promote it and wait until visitor numbers and income are reasonable before selling – it can lead to some nice income in the future if you’re willing to work on your site for some months before putting it up for sale.\n\nWriting Ebooks\nThe benefit of publishing your own ebook is that once the work of writing and producing the book are complete you can keep on earning profits from your work for months or even years to come.\n\nOver the years I’ve written dozens of ebooks with varying levels of success though I’ve had a few “home runs” during that time. My most successful launch generated over $10,000 in 7 days though this is far from the norm.\n\nThese days I publish almost exclusively on Kindle – a process that removes many of the problems with promoting your book. By writing a top-quality ebook and using the various marketing tools Amazon provides you can quickly start to generate additional monthly revenue solely from writing about topics that interest you.\n\nFreelance Writing\nFreelance writing was really where I started my online side hustle journey. There are a range of sites like Odesk where business owners will pay you to create content for them in the form of articles, ebooks, PDF manuals and so on.\n\nOver the years I’ve tried a number of these sites but always found I had greatest success at Elance which is where I would recommend you start looking for writing gigs.\n\nThe reason I put this hustle last is that I no longer do any freelance writing because it’s more of a job than a business. It can be a great way to earn some income from your free time but of course once you stop writing you also stop earning.\n\nMany people do very well out of it – and some people even turn it into a full-time business eventually – but I decided to transition from writing for other people to writing for myself and creating my own network of profitable websites.\n\nIn this way my writing had the capacity to earn me revenue long after I’d actually written it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nNone of these internet side hustles can be characterized as “easy”. In comparison to baby sitting for your neighbor there’s a far steeper learning curve so please don’t be under any misapprehensions.\n\nI don’t want you to feel like these are necessarily “easy” ways to earn some extra income – it can take quite some months of learning and hard work (and some money to invest) before you really start to see your efforts pay off.\n\nBut they are the side hustles I’ve personally had success with. The question is what’s working for you right now? What side hustles are you considering?

I have a Wells Fargo credit card, Amazon Store card, PayPal credit, One Main Finical loan and a Wells Fargo loan. \n\n\nI am currently behind a payment on both my Wells Fargo credit card and PayPal accounts. And now my minimum payment for both are over $400 which I cannot afford to make or I will not be able to pay rent, internet, cell phone etc, as I make that a priority. The pay pal credit is maxed at 4,498.37 and Wells Fargo is over limit by $200 at $5,700.\n\nI have a One Main Financial loan for $7500 that I used to pay off 3 separate school loans I was forced to pay a monthly payment for each a month that was about $300 a month so instead I pay 200 a month for this loan. The balance of this loan is now down to $6,300\n\nRight now I am focusing on the two balances that are the lowest. Which are my personal Wells Fargo loan ($860) and amazon store credit ($883)\n\n\nSo here is a quick rundown of my current balances and their APR’s for reference of my situation I’m in\n\n* Wells Fargo Credit Card - $5,700 – 23.99%\n* Amazon Store Credit – 883.43 – 25.99%\n* Pay Pal Credit – $4,498.37 – $19.99\n* Wells Fargo Personal Unsecured Loan - $860.62 -13%\n* One Main Financial Loan Unsecured – $6,033.52 -26.70%\n\n*Edit I clear about $1942.96 after taxes from my current job I am an IT Consultant and work 8-5 Monday - Friday*\n\n*Edit breakdown of my expenses*\n\n* Monthly Expenses\n* Rent - $719.67 (I do not pay any utilities)\n* Cell phone - $35\n* Internet - $89.95\n* Car Insurance - $70\n\nEveryday Expenses (This is for me and my g/f)\n\n* Groceries $200-$250\n* Fuel - $120-$140\n* Other Food, Fast Food, Games, Etc. total $367 - $400 (I am seeing there is where i need to cut back thanks to YNAB)\n    \n\nI just started using YNAB and I am still in my first 25 days of use and I can see where my money is going, so this will help cut back on unnecessary spending. I am also in the process of selling all of the stuff I have accumulated over the years, 40k models, electronics etc. for extra money. Any tips or guidance is greatly appreciated!

{"id":"3b3gpc","author":"jpczcaya","body":"Retargeting ads are a powerful yet unexplored tool for companies. While tech giants like Amazon have been using them for years, few small business have actually tapped into their potential. \n\nIf you’re new to the concept, retargeting lets you create ad campaigns for users that performed (or didn’t perform) specific actions in your website of platform. In its most basic form, you can serve ads to your website visitors, but you can be as specific as users who completed your onboarding funnel, users who read your blog or even users who clicked on other ads.\n\nOn our presentation tool [Slidebean](http://slidebean.com/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/smallbusiness&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing), we are using ad retargeting through Facebook and the Google Display Network (GDN) with amazing results.\n\n**How to set up retargeting ads?** \n\nBoth Google and Facebook provide thorough guides on setting up retargeting campaigns. In a nutshell, you need to add a tracking code to your websites (in Google, this is done through a variable of Google Analytics) that the ads engine then uses to target your customers. \n\nIf you are not familiar with the Google Adwords interface, then you might want to take a step back and work with a tool like AdRoll. They provide a simplified interface that lets you set a campaign in minutes. \n\nAlso, I’m holding a free webinar next week called [5 Retargeting Campaigns you should be running](http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/smallbusiness&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing).\n\n**Whom do we target?** \n\nThe number of ads we serve and the amount of money we spend on each campaign responds directly to the step of our acquisition funnel in which those users are in. The closer an audience is to becoming one of our customers, the stronger our campaign will be. \n\n1. Anyone who viewed any presentation\n2. Anyone who visited our blog and didn’t subscribe\n3. Anyone who visited our landing page and didn’t sign up \n4. Users who signed up but have not activated yet \n5. Users who are active but haven’t selected a paid plan \n6. Users who visited our upgrade form but didn’t complete it\n   \nAs you can see, the top audience is extremely broad, a lot of users visit our website simply to view someone else’s presentation, but they are not real customer prospects for us. The conversion rate % for this group is the lowest, and thus our bid per click is only $0.06. \n\nOn the other hand, a user who already visited our upgrade form (where you type in your credit card info to activate a plan) and didn’t complete it, are extremely valuable prospects. They were just about to convert and probably just need a final push.  Our bid for this group is $2.00, which pretty much outbids everyone else, meaning that they will see our ads EVERYWHERE. \n\nOnce a customer completes a specific step of the funnel, they immediately get taken out of that segment so that no budget is wasted in serving the wrong set of ads. \n\nFacebook and Google also let you do deeper retargeting within your audience. For example, you can exclude users under 18 years old, target them only on specific websites or even increase your bid for specific locations. The level of customisation is huge, and you’ll be able to tweak that more deeply as you start getting traffic and conversion rates for your ads. \n\n**Budget**\n\nAs I mentioned, the budget for each retargeting campaign varies depending on how close that audience is to your goal. Both GDN and Facebook Ads have the advantage of being relatively cheap compared to equivalent campaigns for new users. \n\nThese are the stats for our Google Display Network Retargeting campaign last month:\n[Stats](http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads-work?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/smallbusiness&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing)\n\nA few remarks: \n\n* Notice how bids get higher the closer a visitor gets to converting to a paying user. \n* The average cost per impression is less than $0.001!!! This is extremely useful to reinforce your brand on your users. For many of our audiences we actually don’t design ads with a Call to Action, because that’s not what we’re looking for. In other words, we don't want them to click on the ad, we want them to see and remember our brand.\n* Also, notice how the bids for blog visitors are significantly high. This is because our blog audience is very targeted, we know that our blog readers are likely to become users and that their Lifetime Value is very high. \n* In total, we spent $450+ for 700,000 -targeted- impressions. I don’t believe any other advertising channel can beat that. \n\n**+ traffic, + audience**\n\nThis is the core reason why we've been focusing on generating a lot more content for our blog (welcome, hee hee!). \n\nWe've discovered that we can generate blog articles that our potential customers are not only interested in reading, but also bound to share on their own social networks. Thus, our blog is one key initial element in this conversion funnel, one that allows us to gain organic traffic that we can then retarget with our campaigns. \n\n&gt; Our blog would be close to useless without our retargeting campaigns; it lets us convert readers into customers.\n\nBlog content allows us to get in front of new users, quite organically. We then user our retargeting efforts to convert you, I mean, them. \n\n**How do the ads look?** \n\nThe design of the the ads is also crafted according to the step in the funnel. Visitors who are not yet users need to know what the tool is and what are its advantages; while users who are already active will probably want to know about advanced features. \n\nWhile the most served ads are usually on 300x200 format, it’s useful to create ads in multiple formats to ensure you get maximum exposure. Furthermore, unpopular formats might allow you to get cheaper clicks because there’s lower competition, so don’t leave any out. \n\nWe've created a couple of template Adobe Illustrator files that you can use to create all the ads you need for GDN and Facebook Ads. \n[Download Here](http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads-work?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/smallbusiness&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing)\n\nWe also understand that creating a bunch of ads in different formats is exhausting, which is why we are developing adbean.co, an automatic ad designer that uses the same technology we’ve developed for Slidebean.

{"id":"3b3ibb","author":"jpczcaya","body":"Retargeting ads are a powerful yet unexplored tool for companies. While tech giants like Amazon have been using them for years, few small business have actually tapped into their potential. \n\nIf you’re new to the concept, retargeting lets you create ad campaigns for users that performed (or didn’t perform) specific actions in your website of platform. In its most basic form, you can serve ads to your website visitors, but you can be as specific as users who completed your onboarding funnel, users who read your blog or even users who clicked on other ads.\n\nOn our presentation tool [Slidebean](http://slidebean.com/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/entrepreneur&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing), we are using ad retargeting through Facebook and the Google Display Network (GDN) with amazing results.\n\n**How to set up retargeting ads?** \n\nBoth Google and Facebook provide thorough guides on setting up retargeting campaigns. In a nutshell, you need to add a tracking code to your websites (in Google, this is done through a variable of Google Analytics) that the ads engine then uses to target your customers. \n\nIf you are not familiar with the Google Adwords interface, then you might want to take a step back and work with a tool like AdRoll. They provide a simplified interface that lets you set a campaign in minutes. \n\nAlso, I’m holding a free webinar next week called [5 Retargeting Campaigns you should be running](http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/entrepreneur&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing).\n\n**Whom do we target?** \n\nThe number of ads we serve and the amount of money we spend on each campaign responds directly to the step of our acquisition funnel in which those users are in. The closer an audience is to becoming one of our customers, the stronger our campaign will be. \n\n1. Anyone who viewed any presentation\n2. Anyone who visited our blog and didn’t subscribe\n3. Anyone who visited our landing page and didn’t sign up \n4. Users who signed up but have not activated yet \n5. Users who are active but haven’t selected a paid plan \n6. Users who visited our upgrade form but didn’t complete it\n   \nAs you can see, the top audience is extremely broad, a lot of users visit our website simply to view someone else’s presentation, but they are not real customer prospects for us. The conversion rate % for this group is the lowest, and thus our bid per click is only $0.06. \n\nOn the other hand, a user who already visited our upgrade form (where you type in your credit card info to activate a plan) and didn’t complete it, are extremely valuable prospects. They were just about to convert and probably just need a final push.  Our bid for this group is $2.00, which pretty much outbids everyone else, meaning that they will see our ads EVERYWHERE. \n\nOnce a customer completes a specific step of the funnel, they immediately get taken out of that segment so that no budget is wasted in serving the wrong set of ads. \n\nFacebook and Google also let you do deeper retargeting within your audience. For example, you can exclude users under 18 years old, target them only on specific websites or even increase your bid for specific locations. The level of customisation is huge, and you’ll be able to tweak that more deeply as you start getting traffic and conversion rates for your ads. \n\n**Budget**\n\nAs I mentioned, the budget for each retargeting campaign varies depending on how close that audience is to your goal. Both GDN and Facebook Ads have the advantage of being relatively cheap compared to equivalent campaigns for new users. \n\nThese are the stats for our Google Display Network Retargeting campaign last month:\n[http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads-work](http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads-work?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/entrepreneur&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing)\n\nA few remarks: \n\n* Notice how bids get higher the closer a visitor gets to converting to a paying user. \n* The average cost per impression is less than $0.001!!! This is extremely useful to reinforce your brand on your users. For many of our audiences we actually don’t design ads with a Call to Action, because that’s not what we’re looking for. In other words, we don't want them to click on the ad, we want them to see and remember our brand.\n* Also, notice how the bids for blog visitors are significantly high. This is because our blog audience is very targeted, we know that our blog readers are likely to become users and that their Lifetime Value is very high. \n* In total, we spent $450+ for 700,000 -targeted- impressions. I don’t believe any other advertising channel can beat that. \n\n**+ traffic, + audience**\n\nThis is the core reason why we've been focusing on generating a lot more content for our blog (welcome, hee hee!). \n\nWe've discovered that we can generate blog articles that our potential customers are not only interested in reading, but also bound to share on their own social networks. Thus, our blog is one key initial element in this conversion funnel, one that allows us to gain organic traffic that we can then retarget with our campaigns. \n\n&gt; Our blog would be close to useless without our retargeting campaigns; it lets us convert readers into customers.\n\nBlog content allows us to get in front of new users, quite organically. We then user our retargeting efforts to convert you, I mean, them. \n\n**How do the ads look?** \n\nThe design of the the ads is also crafted according to the step in the funnel. Visitors who are not yet users need to know what the tool is and what are its advantages; while users who are already active will probably want to know about advanced features. \n\nWhile the most served ads are usually on 300x200 format, it’s useful to create ads in multiple formats to ensure you get maximum exposure. Furthermore, unpopular formats might allow you to get cheaper clicks because there’s lower competition, so don’t leave any out. \n\nWe've created a couple of template Adobe Illustrator files that you can use to create all the ads you need for GDN and Facebook Ads. \n[Download Here](http://blog.slidebean.com/blog/retargeting-ads-work?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=r/entrepreneur&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing)\n\nWe also understand that creating a bunch of ads in different formats is exhausting, which is why we are developing adbean.co, an automatic ad designer that uses the same technology we’ve developed for Slidebean. But more on that later. \n\nAnother extremely useful tool is moat.com. It allows you to (literally) spy on the competition and discover the designs they are using for their display ads, a great way to find inspiration and to differentiate yourself. \n\n\n**Measure, Measure, Measure** \n\nThe most important variable here is your ability to measure and act fast. Make sure that you’ve setup your Google Analytics tracking correctly, as well as your Facebook Conversion Goals, otherwise you’re pretty much advertising blindly. \n\nThe quicker you can optimise these ads, the faster you’ll find profitable numbers on your CPC.

Why not give away an iPad, coupons or Unicorn meat (yep, it's on Amazon)?  PffffffT! those don't create a list of leads of the people that Shopify values most... potential online business owners.\n\nBut an entire business?!?!? Shopify demonstrated how Hello Matcha was created. That's great, but what would push people to open up a Shopify site? Probably having a product or service to sell in the first place.  So they've done something brilliant using a method that's been around longer than Carson and McMahon (oops... my age revealed).  They created a giveaway, but they put the lead funnel in the hands of people that already have a Shopify site... and the fish are flowing in. They might not have a business, but when they do, they'll be swimming around Shopify's marketing efforts.  Here's how they're gaming the giveaway:\n\nWIIFM X 13\n\nShopify is using a service called Gleam to use a point system for the giveaway.  More points equal more chances (entries) to win the contest.\n\nTo earn a point, simply click on one of the shameless plug instructions. \n\nThis gives more awareness to Shopify and for the lucky winner of the contest, some lovely Instagram followers sprinkled on top of their insanely valuable prize. The \"Refer Friends For Extra Entries\" is probably the fastest way to build the email list, but here's my favorite:\n\nSee what they did there?  They widened the funnel to get more entrants and narrowed down the funnel to those that are interested in creating an online store or business.  They also made it easy to get the lead into their list. \n\nClick 1 - Interested visitors are on their merry way to learn about dropshipping.\nClick 2 - They see how to get a virtual 'thing' that they can also print along with the perceived value.\n\nClick 3 - A little pop-up... not as annoying as most since it's a reminder of the 'thing' and how to get it.\n\nType, type, type and Click 4 - Shopify now has a lead in one hand with an understanding of where they might be in the main sales funnel while the visitor looks at a PDF in the other hand.\nI have a Shopify site myself but would like to add more products... Gleam is one those tools that I'll be deploying to start building, but it wouldn't hurt that have an extra matcha business on the side... so how about a little help for more entries?

{"id":"3b78fm","author":"miparasito","body":"Every year it takes me a few weeks to recover after the holiday rush is over,. I'm a one-woman operation, so some of it is just exhaustion and the sound of the tape gun rings in my ears for at least a week. By the end of January I dust off and look ahead at what I'm excited about working on for the year.\n\nBut in 2014, I didn't bounce back. February, March... These are my slowest months so I gave myself a break. In April I was invited to sell to Amazon, and by May had that all set up.\n\nFor someone still recovering from logistics fatigue, dealing with Amazon's vendor processes was a nightmare. I spent all last summer trying to learn their system, making mistakes, getting hit with chargebacks. My hope was to have it all figured out before the holiday season. \n\nImagine a tangled string. Trying to get Amazon vendor stuff to work was basically me saying \"maybe if I roll this knot into a big ball, it'll come untangled!\" By the holiday season I was outright resenting purchase orders. Not good! But I was so frustrated and more importantly I was so mentally exhausted that I made more mistakes which meant redoing stuff which... You get the idea. It was not a successful holiday year for me.\n\nThe problem is that burnout feeds itself. It's like the gambler who starts losing so he digs in and gambles more, hoping to hit it big and fix everything. \n\nSo. Here it is June. I have taken some big steps back to improve things:\n\n1. Did a lot of thinking and writing about why I have this business. What do I want it to contribute to my family? Why am I in this particular industry? What is the actual goal?\n\n2. Temporarily paused the madness. I put several of my various seller accounts on hold and went to visit family for two weeks. It had been years since my last real vacation.\n\n3. Cleaned out and reorganized my workspace.\n\n4. Began pruning away products that create a lot of work for lower return. This was hard! People really like our textiles! But they're a hassle to produce, a pain to keep track of (x designs times different shirt types times different sizes) and at the end I make maybe a dollar per shirt. \n\n5. Now with a core group of my best selling, most profitable items I am getting back in the groove of FBA. Also focusing on doing more license deals. Passive income is my new best friend.\n\n6. After clearing away a lot of the stuff that was bogging me down, I started updating all of my artwork. Designing is what I love doing, and the end result is fresher, brighter happier products that I have renewed excitement about selling. Response so far has been great.\n\n\nSo yeah! Things are better. I'm still working on this whole process. Next step is getting back into the swing of marketing. In 2014 I went basically silent on social media and avoided customer interaction. I was in an awful, self-loathing mindset and figured they wouldn't really want to hear from me anyway. But now I'm feeling my energy back, I'm looking forward to sharing and promoting in time for the holiday season. I'm getting things back on track and am determined to avoid burnout in the future.\n\nAnyone else survived burnout? How do/did you recover?

{"id":"3b9344","author":"[deleted]","body":"**TLDR:** Had an idea to make educational cards for Product managers. Rolled my sleeves up and got on with it. Kept cost and risk low. Designed, labelled and boxed cards myself. Put them on Amazon UK to sell. Briefly peaked at rank 399 on Amazon UK. Sold around the world. Profitable. Won’t be retiring soon.\n\n[A few behind the scenes photos to skim through.](http://imgur.com/a/KmdJU)\n\nWarning! ~10-15 min read. \n\nHope it's useful. Thanks.\n\n***\n\n# Passion and hard work\n\t\nThis isn’t about ‘growth hacking’ or some magical get-rich formula. I don’t have that. It’s about being passionate and hard-working enough to follow through on an idea, risking a bit, and hustling myself out of my comfort zone. It’s about the  steps that I took to create, publish and sell something.\n\nI love products and new ideas and I’ve helped others with products for their companies. I’ve worked hard and helped them to turn **their** dreams into reality. And I enjoy that. But I also wanted to create my own product that was part of my **own** dreams. \n\nAs much as anything, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.\n\n# Experiment\n\nI decided that I’d treat creating and launching my own product as an *experiment*. In my mind, if I called it an experiment, it felt a lot less serious. Whatever the outcome of the experiment I’d learn something new. Each time I got to a roadblock, I’d remind myself it was all an experiment.\n\nThe experiment goal was to see if I could create my *own* product, learn a bunch of new things, and hopefully make a profit. This is never guaranteed, but I was hoping it could provide me a bit of money in lean times between jobs.\n\n# The Idea\n\nI started with a simple idea — make something educational to help Product Managers. I started thinking about books and blogs and video training.\n\nI settled on the idea of something pretty simple. Printed cards to help others learn about product Management and to help product management teams. After a few false starts naming them, I came up with *Product Snacks* — Bite-sized learning for Product Managers.\n\nI'd noticed that lots of entrepreneurs and product managers were stuck in the digital world all day, and that they still yearned for physical things. I also noticed that many had less and less free time and needed information they could digest in small pieces. This helped shape my ideas.\n\n#The Stages\n\n##First Prototype\n\nI started by creating some [simple slides](http://i.imgur.com/5VKpJ2J.jpg) to describe my idea and shared them with a few people. Friends seemed to get the idea, but I had the strong feeling they needed to **see and feel** real cards for them to really ‘get it’.\n\n##Second Prototype\n\nI quickly moved forwards, brainstorming further and writing content. I designed a handful of cards with Adobe Indesign. I wasn’t sure if the idea was going to work, so I didn’t pay to hire a designer. I wanted to keep costs as low as possible. I just did everything myself, as best as I could.\n\n[I printed the first cards](http://i.imgur.com/UBi4RSM.jpg) at the local high street print shop. They were relatively expensive to print just a handful! But I did learn from this that the font was a bit small, the cards needed to be thicker, and I wanted rounded corners to prevent them dog-earing. And now I had something to show to people, to get feedback and to test. So that’s what I did. \n\nI showed the cards around, talking about how they could be used. Having something physical made it easier to have conversations. And each person I spoke to gave me new ideas. Ideas of how to use them and how to describe them. And ideas for future products.\n\n##Minimum Loveable Product\n\nI kept pushing forwards, wrote more content and cards, and printed some more. I kept testing with people, asking them to review the cards and content. Finally I had enough content and something that I thought was valuable and useful to my target audience: product managers and people interested in learning about product management.\n\nI searched for a local printer to help me print my first proper batch of cards to sell. I paid about £400 for the first batch of cards to be printed. I knew my first cards wouldn’t be hugely profitable as I was doing a relatively small print run. But I’d calculated my costs and knew **if** I sold them they would nevertheless be profitable.\n\nI had been searching online and bought a [bunch of different boxes and packaging](http://i.imgur.com/psH1w2S.jpg) to try out, to hold the cards. I narrowed them down to a simple brown card box, originally designed for jewellery, but it worked fine for the cards. I just needed to take out the black jewellery velvet and clean each box.\n\nI printed transparent matt labels for the front of each box and applied them by hand. This is quite tricky to get them straight, and it took quite a while working at a rate of labelling about 18 boxes per hour. [The finished box and cards](http://i.imgur.com/bgcTE0l.jpg).\n\nI created a listing for the cards on Amazon UK and a friend was really helpful and mentioned the cards in an email he was already sending to some product managers on his mailing list. I wasn’t quite ready for the response. I sold out in a few hours and briefly peaked at 399 on Amazon UK with the sales velocity! Wish I’d caught a screenshot of that! \n\nI spent the evening and early hours hand-labelling and packing boxes to mail the next day. People in the post office hated me as I had so many packages to post.  Oops…\n\n#Scaling Up\n\nPeople bought my product! They liked it! I even got an invite to chat to some people about it. I used the profits from selling the first batch to go towards printing a much larger second batch. This allowed me to negotiate a better print price for each deck of cards.\n\n[The production line got really busy.](http://i.imgur.com/BExCCf9.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n# How have things been so far after the first couple of months?\n\n1. I put Product Snacks on Amazon UK and sold out of my first batch in a few hours and briefly hit no. 399 on the whole of Amazon UK! I wish I’d taken a screen shot but missed it. A friend told me about it.\n2. I’m profitable! Yippee! Although I won’t be retiring anytime soon! This is NOT an easy way to make lots of money.\n3. I’ve sold around the world: England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Malta\n4. I'd now started appearing on Amazon UK search for ‘product management books’ and ‘product management’, so people were discovering the product organically.\n\nAs I write this today, I'm coming [top of the search](http://i.imgur.com/d03PRvU.jpg) so I captured a screenshot while I'm so lucky :-)\n\n\n# My biggest obstacles\n\n1. Fear of failure when it's your own thing.\n2. Learning all the new things to make stuff happen e.g. mailing lists, shipping through Amazon, using social media, website building, designing, etc. It was quite a lot of new stuff to learn. Some things I knew quite well, others had a steep learning curve.\n\n# My biggest lessons\n\n1. You don’t need a super-complex idea requiring lots of money and risk to learn a lot and to get a lot of personal growth.\n2. Keep going, even if you’re doubting yourself. You need courage. Don’t stop at the first bump in the road. Keep positive forward momentum. Trust yourself to solve problems as they arise.\n3. Amazon has a lovely business model. They make roughly 15-20% on your sale price of books in their market place, even if they don’t dispatch for you. They make a bit more if they pick/pack and dispatch on your behalf. But there's a reason for that. They do a great job. And that’s where most people go to search and buy books. \n4. Getting logistics and stock levels right is quite a skill! I'm still learning. I hadn’t been involved with this before and I now have a new found appreciation for people doing that job.\n5. Marketing and getting the message out is harder than I imagined. I was also surprised at the effectiveness of direct email vs tweets. A direct email to about 7k product managers was about 20x more effective at driving website traffic and sales than tweets out to 10's of thousands.\n6. [Product Hunt](http://ProductHunt.com) was super-effective at driving traffic to my [website](http://ProductSnacks.com) and driving sales. I was lucky enough to get Product Snacks on there, getting into the top 10 on the front page for the day.  \n7. Doing your own thing is satisfying, but very hard work. The experience also gives you a new appreciation for people who’ve set up successful companies and created great products. It quickly adjusts your perspective of the **pro’s and con’s** of a 9-to-5 job!\n\nIf you've got an idea, think of the positive actions and steps that could move you forwards in some way. You can always do *something* to keep moving.\n\nGood luck with getting your own projects moving. \n\nEddie","name":"t3_3b9344","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-27 01:41:34","week":26}

The individual could pickup a valuable product and damage it during transportation, deliver to the wrong location, have the product 'stolen', steal the product themselves, or not deliver the product on time\nPossible solutions: Requiring the transporter to make a deposit based on the posters own valuation of the product. This deposit could be done with an app. Inspecting the product before pickup to make sure it isn't damaged so that the transporter won't be scammed by picking up an item that was intentionally damaged prior to shipment. This solution takes away some of the simplicity of the transaction which limits the value of the service. At some point, the complexities of this service could make using UPS or another commercial delivery service the better option.\n\n-Problem: Liability for illegal packages. The transporter could arrive and inspect a box of miscellaneous goods. After deeming the products in satisfactory condition, the transporter could leave and unknowingly be transporting hidden drugs or illegal items. If the transporter was pulled over, there could be problems. Solution: Transporter assumes liability. Transporter must inspect packages and at risk of legal consequence determine that a package is safe to transport.\n\nThose problems and solutions were quick to arrive at, but what about others? What problems do you guys see? What solutions do you have?","name":"t3_3b9mmn","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-06-27 04:50:37","week":26}

{"id":"3b9x5e","author":"blasphemybagels","body":"Hi folks,\n\nI have the opportunity to pay my rent by credit card now. It's Bay Area, so the amount is a huge portion of my budget. However, there is a fee involved, so I would like your advice on the best way to take advantage of this. The credit card fees are also tiered based on the amount.\n\nI split the rent with my housemate, so up to this point we have been paying separate checks. For sake of argument, the total rent is about $2000 and I pay about $1000.\n \nOptions:\n\n1. Pay my $1000 monthly - there is a 2.6% fee if paid by credit card. \n\n2. Convince my housemate to pool finances on this (would probably have to give a big kickback to him since he strongly prefers to pay directly instead of through me) or prepay 2 months at a time - there is a 1.8% fee on a $2000 payment.\n\n3. Prepay 1.5 (both) or 3 months at a time - there is a 1.3% fee on a $3000 payment. \n\nThe payment portal accepts Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Diners club, and JCB.\n\nI will be at this apartment at least another 9 months. \n\nWhat's the best way to make a profit on this?\n\nEdit: I'm pretty much a beginner in this forum.  Right now, almost all my expenses are split about $1500/mo at 2% cash back FIA Fidelity Amex, the 5% cash back Amazon charge account, and the rest ~$500/mo on Chase Freedom for the bonus categories or whenever I can't use Amex.","name":"t3_3b9x5e","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-27 06:40:33","week":26}

{"id":"3balw5","author":"PRATTARAZZI","body":"**TLDR:** Had an idea to make educational cards for Product managers. Rolled my sleeves up and got on with it. Kept cost and risk low. Designed, labelled and boxed cards myself. Put them on Amazon UK to sell. Briefly peaked at rank 399 on Amazon UK. Sold around the world. Profitable. Won’t be retiring soon.\n\n[A few behind the scenes photos to skim through.](http://imgur.com/a/KmdJU)\n\nWarning! ~10-15 min read. \n\nHope it's useful. Thanks.\n\n***\n\n# Passion and hard work\n\t\nThis isn’t about ‘growth hacking’ or some magical get-rich formula. I don’t have that. It’s about being passionate and hard-working enough to follow through on an idea, risking a bit, and hustling myself out of my comfort zone. It’s about the  steps that I took to create, publish and sell something.\n\nI love products and new ideas and I’ve helped others with products for their companies. I’ve worked hard and helped them to turn **their** dreams into reality. And I enjoy that. But I also wanted to create my own product that was part of my **own** dreams. \n\nAs much as anything, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.\n\n# Experiment\n\nI decided that I’d treat creating and launching my own product as an *experiment*. In my mind, if I called it an experiment, it felt a lot less serious. Whatever the outcome of the experiment I’d learn something new. Each time I got to a roadblock, I’d remind myself it was all an experiment.\n\nThe experiment goal was to see if I could create my *own* product, learn a bunch of new things, and hopefully make a profit. This is never guaranteed, but I was hoping it could provide me a bit of money in lean times between jobs.\n\n# The Idea\n\nI started with a simple idea — make something educational to help Product Managers. I started thinking about books and blogs and video training.\n\nI settled on the idea of something pretty simple. Printed cards to help others learn about product Management and to help product management teams. After a few false starts naming them, I came up with *Product Snacks* — Bite-sized learning for Product Managers.\n\nI'd noticed that lots of entrepreneurs and product managers were stuck in the digital world all day, and that they still yearned for physical things. I also noticed that many had less and less free time and needed information they could digest in small pieces. This helped shape my ideas.\n\n#The Stages\n\n##First Prototype\n\nI started by creating some [simple slides](http://i.imgur.com/5VKpJ2J.jpg) to describe my idea and shared them with a few people. Friends seemed to get the idea, but I had the strong feeling they needed to **see and feel** real cards for them to really ‘get it’.\n\n##Second Prototype\n\nI quickly moved forwards, brainstorming further and writing content. I designed a handful of cards with Adobe Indesign. I wasn’t sure if the idea was going to work, so I didn’t pay to hire a designer. I wanted to keep costs as low as possible. I just did everything myself, as best as I could.\n\n[I printed the first cards](http://i.imgur.com/UBi4RSM.jpg) at the local high street print shop. They were relatively expensive to print just a handful! But I did learn from this that the font was a bit small, the cards needed to be thicker, and I wanted rounded corners to prevent them dog-earing. And now I had something to show to people, to get feedback and to test. So that’s what I did. \n\nI showed the cards around, talking about how they could be used. Having something physical made it easier to have conversations. And each person I spoke to gave me new ideas. Ideas of how to use them and how to describe them. And ideas for future products.\n\n##Minimum Loveable Product\n\nI kept pushing forwards, wrote more content and cards, and printed some more. I kept testing with people, asking them to review the cards and content. Finally I had enough content and something that I thought was valuable and useful to my target audience: product managers and people interested in learning about product management.\n\nI searched for a local printer to help me print my first proper batch of cards to sell. I paid about £400 for the first batch of cards to be printed. I knew my first cards wouldn’t be hugely profitable as I was doing a relatively small print run. But I’d calculated my costs and knew **if** I sold them they would nevertheless be profitable.\n\nI had been searching online and bought a [bunch of different boxes and packaging](http://i.imgur.com/psH1w2S.jpg) to try out, to hold the cards. I narrowed them down to a simple brown card box, originally designed for jewellery, but it worked fine for the cards. I just needed to take out the black jewellery velvet and clean each box.\n\nI printed transparent matt labels for the front of each box and applied them by hand. This is quite tricky to get them straight, and it took quite a while working at a rate of labelling about 18 boxes per hour. [The finished box and cards](http://i.imgur.com/bgcTE0l.jpg).\n\nI created a listing for the cards on Amazon UK and a friend was really helpful and mentioned the cards in an email he was already sending to some product managers on his mailing list. I wasn’t quite ready for the response. I sold out in a few hours and briefly peaked at 399 on Amazon UK with the sales velocity! Wish I’d caught a screenshot of that! \n\nI spent the evening and early hours hand-labelling and packing boxes to mail the next day. People in the post office hated me as I had so many packages to post.  Oops…\n\n#Scaling Up\n\nPeople bought my product! They liked it! I even got an invite to chat to some people about it. I used the profits from selling the first batch to go towards printing a much larger second batch. This allowed me to negotiate a better print price for each deck of cards.\n\n[The production line got really busy.](http://i.imgur.com/BExCCf9.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n# How have things been so far after the first couple of months?\n\n1. I put Product Snacks on Amazon UK and sold out of my first batch in a few hours and briefly hit no. 399 on the whole of Amazon UK! I wish I’d taken a screen shot but missed it. A friend told me about it.\n2. I’m profitable! Yippee! Although I won’t be retiring anytime soon! This is NOT an easy way to make lots of money.\n3. I’ve sold around the world: England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Malta\n4. I'd now started appearing on Amazon UK search for ‘product management books’ and ‘product management’, so people were discovering the product organically.\n\nAs I write this today, I'm coming [top of the search](http://i.imgur.com/d03PRvU.jpg) so I captured a screenshot while I'm so lucky :-)\n\n\n# My biggest obstacles\n\n1. Fear of failure when it's your own thing.\n2. Learning all the new things to make stuff happen e.g. mailing lists, shipping through Amazon, using social media, website building, designing, etc. It was quite a lot of new stuff to learn. Some things I knew quite well, others had a steep learning curve.\n\n# My biggest lessons\n\n1. You don’t need a super-complex idea requiring lots of money and risk to learn a lot and to get a lot of personal growth.\n2. Keep going, even if you’re doubting yourself. You need courage. Don’t stop at the first bump in the road. Keep positive forward momentum. Trust yourself to solve problems as they arise.\n3. Amazon has a lovely business model. They make roughly 15-20% on your sale price of books in their market place, even if they don’t dispatch for you. They make a bit more if they pick/pack and dispatch on your behalf. But there's a reason for that. They do a great job. And that’s where most people go to search and buy books. \n4. Getting logistics and stock levels right is quite a skill! I'm still learning. I hadn’t been involved with this before and I now have a new found appreciation for people doing that job.\n5. Marketing and getting the message out is harder than I imagined. I was also surprised at the effectiveness of direct email vs tweets. A direct email to about 7k product managers was about 20x more effective at driving website traffic and sales than tweets out to 10's of thousands.\n6. [Product Hunt](http://ProductHunt.com) was super-effective at driving traffic to my [website](http://ProductSnacks.com) and driving sales. I was lucky enough to get Product Snacks on there, getting into the top 10 on the front page for the day.  \n7. Doing your own thing is satisfying, but very hard work. The experience also gives you a new appreciation for people who’ve set up successful companies and created great products. It quickly adjusts your perspective of the **pro’s and con’s** of a 9-to-5 job!\n\nIf you've got an idea, think of the positive actions and steps that could move you forwards in some way. You can always do *something* to keep moving.\n\nGood luck with getting your own projects moving. \n\nEddie","name":"t3_3balw5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-27 12:55:01","week":26}

{"id":"3be1ga","author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm hoping I get the promotion I wanted that would tentatively bump me to at around ~120-130k but I won't find out until a few more weeks.  I don't pay for rent but I help out around the house and get groceries and such whenever I can.  Already paid off all my school loans after dropping out twice.\n\nOnly traditional debt I have is a new auto loan (Oct '14) that's at 37k (originally 45k) with a monthly payment of 680.  I have two credit cards: one at 0/4k (balance/limit) that I pay after every transaction and the other at 6.5k/41k that I also pay after every transaction now (and pay an extra 700 a month to get it down to 0 eventually).\n\nInsurance and all that good stuff is through my employer.  My take-home is ~2.7k every 2 weeks (so ~5.4 per month).  Now that most of my debt is gone and I'm passed my \"frivolous spending\" phase and paid off all my debt from a failed startup when I was younger, I'd like to tighten things up further in order to buy a nice place ~30 minutes away from the city and near the mountains (houses that I generally like in the areas are anywhere from 400-600k).  Without breaking it down into too much detail since I don't really spend that much anyway anymore (gym paid for by employer, exercise supplements ~100, gas at ~350, food at ~350, dog stuff or random impulse small buys on Amazon) I probably spend ~1k a month.\n\nSo rough math: 5.4k - 1k (spending) - 700 (rounded auto loan) - 700 (card payment) - 300 (helping out around the house) = 2.7k.\n\nAlso should note that I fucked up my 2013 taxes (was my first time doing it myself) and left out ~6k worth of income, which resulted in my finding out a week ago I owe ~3k to the IRS.  I'm not too worried about it since I have some company RSUs that vest in a week that I can cash out (and I won't make the same mistake of not reporting it on this year's taxes) and equates to just about ~3k.  So while it was an unfortunate fuck up on my part I am fortunate enough that those RSUs are vesting in time to balance things out.\n\nI have ~10k liquid in the bank currently.  I could throw it right at the card and obliterate it easily but I'm only paying ~75 a month in interest that will continue to go down as I get the card to a balance of 0 so I figure it doesn't hurt to keep it a slow process and have a low card utilization rate ~15%.  It's a little motivating to see a balance of at least 5 digits in my bank account, too, especially if it is to grow and eventually be used for a down payment on a mortgage.  The last time I checked my credit score was in the low 700s.  Two credit cards I defaulted on a long time ago should be off my record by now.  I bank with Navy Federal and they have really great 100% financing and 5/5 ARM rates, no PMI, and down payment not required (of course recommended).\n\nI could cut maybe ~200 on some of my spending habits if I really needed to crunch them.  Overall, what's the best way toward approaching the mortgage-hunting and house-buying experience as a first-timer?  Should I save up for a ~10% down payment?  20% (would take longer)?\n\nEven if I went, and somehow got approved, with no down payment or 5%, a house in the extreme ~600k range at 2.25% interest and down payment of ~30k (~5%; if I went with a 3/5 Jumbo ARM from Navy Federal) would be ~2,275 a month (tack on another ~400 in utilities -- guesstimate) and one paycheck at my current salary not the tentative one; that ends up being less than 30% of my gross monthly income.","name":"t3_3be1ga","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-28 11:49:27","week":26}

{"id":"3bftm8","author":"fsvec","body":"Hey guys, I'm fairly new to beermoney, but I've doing my homework and have an okay routine with minimal (to an extent) work that pays out.\n*****\n\n* First, I started out with [Amazon MTurk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome), which is a micro-worker site on which you do small tasks like transcribing audio, surveys, and odd things like watching a video and counting how many people leave a store. I do about 4-7 hits on a daily basis, mostly surveys, that pay out about .20-.75 cents on average, as well as the occasional transcription, which averages me about $5-15 a week, depending on how much time I devote to it. It pays out with Amazon GC or you can link it to your bank account and cash it through that.\n* Secondly, I run [TrafficMicro](http://trafficmicro.com/user/startwork), which is sorta similar to MTurk. You do about 11 daily tasks, which are going to a site, looking up a specific text, going to a second site, then going to a third site, which is a relevant paid advert from the original site. You get paid $.10 (for doing it on a PC) for copying the URL of the second site, and a piece of text from the third, or $.15 (for doing it on mobile). This pays out to PayPal, and in a week I make about $11.55, doing it daily.\n* Lastly, is [FreeEats](https://freeeats.com/), which is a site that pays you for sending you texts. You get $1 just for signing up, $2 for referrals, and it pays $.25 for each text its sends you. This pays out to PayPal as well. Can't say it makes much, because I've only gotten 1 text from them, but I made $6.25 just for 2 referrals (parent's phones), which the $ went back to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nSo on a week, I make about $25 from doing minimal work\n\nEdit: I am from the US.\n\n*****\nPayment Proof:\n[Amazon MTurk](http://gyazo.com/0cdf8c623d47a0fc6b422b28092c686f)\n[TrafficMicro](http://gyazo.com/9e71c724d10b3660787d012ff972473e)\n[FreeEats](http://gyazo.com/2df92291e27997850c6ea83d15d35a94)\n*****\n \n \n\nAmazon MTurk:\n[No-ref](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)\n \nTrafficMicro:\n[Ref](http://trafficmicro.com/?affID=1000&amp;campaignID=1)\n[No-ref](http://trafficmicro.com/user/signup)\n \nFreeEats:\n[Ref](http://ftr.io/r/M7FTTX91)\n[No-ref](https://freeeats.com/signup)","name":"t3_3bftm8","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-28 23:10:54","week":26}

{"id":"cseqizs","author":"alisonstone","body":"Despite Spotify's dominant market position, they still don't make money. 70% of their revenue goes to the record labels / artists and the rest go to operating costs. What I think a lot of people don't realize is that there is basically no profits to be made in the streaming music business. If you increase prices, someone else will offer it for cheaper. You can't squeeze the musicians and labels any more because they are barely making anything from streaming music. The only way Spotify can hope to make money is if they get so big that the economies of scale (development costs, servers, etc) work to their advantage so their operating costs as a percentage of their revenues go down. They probably have this advantage over other streamers like Pandora or Tidal already.\n\nThe problem is that there are big tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, or even Netflix that have tons of servers already. It's much cheaper for these guys to host a music service. In the long run, I think it is pretty much natural one or more of the tech giants to be running all the streaming music. An independent music streaming service can never get the same economies of scale that these tech giants have. Worse yet, these guys would likely compete on price by intentionally running their service at zero profit or even at a loss just to funnel users into their primary method of making money (i.e. search for Google, iPhones for Apple, etc). They would be willing to run at a small lost just to bring and keep users in their ecosystem. That's bad news for a stand alone streamer like Spotify.\n\nI think there is a very good chance that Spotify will get wreaked by Apple. Spotify has 15 million paying users supporting 60 million, or 25% of their users, but all of Apple's users are going to subscribers. Both pay out about 70% of revenues. So Apple is going to be paying out roughly 4x more per stream on average to the record labels / musicians. If Apple can steal some of the paying subscribers from Spotify, then that could go to a 5x or 6x advantage. This can snowball very quickly and result in bigger name artists pulling their music from Spotify and only putting it on Apple Music and that would exacerbate the effect even more. If the ratio of paying users to free users drop for Spotify, then there would be huge pressures on their margins and I don't think they can squeeze it out of the artists any more without them all going to Apple.\n\nIf you've read headlines today, Taylor Swift's open letter to Apple has convinced Apple to pay the musicians during the 3 month trial period. So Apple is going to run at a loss (easy for Apple as it is negligible to their iPhone profits) for 3 months to get a bigger library than Spotify and have exclusive / newer music. I can imagine a lot of premium Spotify subscribers cancelling their subscription, at least for 3 months to save $30, and that can really hurt Spotify because they are still not making profits yet and they are dependent on raising private capital to keep running.","name":"t1_cseqizs","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-06-22 15:43:38","week":26}

Probably around 30%, even if their income is quite low. If you're writing business expenses off and you're employed by someone, yes, it is much harder to prove yourself. \n\nMy point is, just because he sucks at his job or is hyper-selective of clients, doesn't mean these miles are technically fraud. Dishonest, sure, but not fraud. And while I've never been a Lyft driver, it seems like you're allowed to deduct miles for when you could potentially pick up clients. It's not like he works for a company and is saying he might be called up to pick up the VP randomly, so just in case this happens he is logging his miles. He is actively logged into Lyft's system and able to be contacted for rides. Although he doesn't take clients if they are out of his way, it doesn't mean he isn't propositioned for jobs or that he never has an intention of taking them. They just have to be the \"right job\". Similar to a graphic designer writing off a home office space but only selecting/accepting clients whose projects were manageable or worth their time. \n\nIf Lyft/Uber/FedEx/Amazon/etc were to technically employ their drivers, this would be a nonissue.

This is not how any of this works.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) \"The market is saturated.\" No it isn't! This is the greatest bullshit ever. Beats everything else in this post actually. This is a convenient, socially acceptable way to say \"I'm scared\".\n\nThese aren't mistakes though.  6 years ago I could have tried to compete directly against a major competitor (I'm talking the only one in my space that has IPO'd and is worth around $100M, advertises everywhere, and everybody knows their name) but I didn't.  I chose a different business model instead that makes my product somewhat complimentary instead.  6 years ago I was able to see that one market in particular for my product was completely saturated with a race to the bottom in price.  So unlike everybody else who came after me I didn't enter there.  It seems to have worked extremely well for me.","name":"t1_csf5d5j","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-22 22:34:46","week":26}

You could probably find a late-2000s Honda Civic for about this much.  This way, you avoid having to take out a car loan at all, which is definitely something you want to avoid, especially at 5.2% interest.\n\nRegarding a credit card, many of the offerings from Chase (Freedom, Sapphire, Slate) are highly rated.  Discover cards also offer great rewards.  My latest is the American Express Blue Cash Preferred which gives 6% back at grocery stores and 3% back at gas stations.  Another great one is the SallieMae Mastercard by Barclaycard, which gives 5% back at grocery stores, gas stations and bookstores (which includes most Amazon purchases).\n\nRegarding the masters, I can't really say whether it's worth it or not.  You'd better know for sure that you're in your career of choice before going through with taking on that additional debt.  If you aren't sure, you can always enter the workforce for a while and go back for your master's later if you believe it would be beneficial.","name":"t1_csf65qh","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-22 22:55:32","week":26}

{"id":"csfcak5","author":"DGLGMUT","body":"Sorry for the lengthy post. I probably should just start my own thread. Posted last Wednesday and got some good info but now that I have read about Chase's new policies I think my plans may have changed. I currently have 3 new accounts in the last 2 years which means that my next 2 apps could be the last (and only) time I ever have the opportunity to snag the Freedom and the CSP combo. I haven't really looked into how UR points will factor into my goal of a \"Round the World\" ticket with American Airlines (or ANA as a poster suggested on Wednesday) but I feel like it would be foolish not to pick them up. I honestly have a couple years to plan this trip and currently have 68k Skymiles and 57k AAdvantage Miles.\n\n**Scores**:\nBarclay's FICO 721\nCK is 739\n\nUsually under 5% Util, one inq on TU and one on Experian, 3 late payments from 2009 are the only negatives.\n\n**Current cards are**:\nVisions FCU Visa Classic (11/12 $750)\nAmex Delta Gold (8/14 $2000)\nBarclay's Sallie Mae WMC (12/14 $2000)\nBarclay's AAviator Red WMC (12/14 $5500)\n\n$10,250 total available credit.\n\nI spend about $1150-$1200 on average on credit cards monthly with a reported income of $25k.\n\nNow is the Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select with the 50k offer that I can still find links for a better offer than the 65k UR points between two Chase cards? I know UR is more flexible and this is my only chance to go the Chase route with their new rules but is it worth it over the more easily attained Citi co-brand card? Definitely seems simpler/less risky although I am pre-qualified for both Freedom and CSP.\n\nBefore I was gonna go for the Discover It but the sign up for the Freedom is better than the It's $50 Amazon plus double categories to me. Putting my quarterly amount of $500 for gas spend leaves me with $500 amazon shopping (the only other category I will seriously use) before I break even with the $150 offer Discover floats around every year. All that spend just isn't enough of a difference over my 5% categories on my Sallie Mae to offset not getting the optional $150. If someone has a $150 targeted offer link for the Discover I would sign up for that in a heartbeat to get the $300 bonus on top of 10% categories. Otherwise I think I will go with the two Chase cards.\n\nAny advice on going for the Chase or what reward program is best for Round the World tickets? Whatever miles program I don't end up using for it will probably just fund random free trips to see my friend abroad or something.

ResaleRabbit's bullet points are spot on; you have to be willing to go out to retail stores and have a good sourcing budget. DDR is not the right service for everyone. We have an intake survey designed to make sure that DDR members will be able to benefit from the info shared. \n\nThe DDR contributors are very transparent. Over a dozen fulltime sellers all doing $500,000+ with several over $1,000,000 in sales. And DDR is much more than 'just deals'; membership includes access to a private DDR Facebook Group where we teach people to find their own deals. What is the value of full access to successful sellers like this? I'd say significant. \n\nIt's the end of June. Imagine Q4. The info shared through DDR to make money in Q4 will be staggering. Anyone who has flipped products in Q4 knows that making $300 in profit is easy money. Now add the combined info of the entire DDR team? It's a no brainer.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the easiest value proposition out there. Either DDR adds $10/day to your bottom line, or it doesn't. If it does, great!

{"id":"csg8kbf","author":"lukerawks","body":"Devil's advocate here.....\n\nWhile it's true that much work has and is being done to paint the confederate flag as something aside from a racist symbol, its designers and proponents of the time made it specifically to show that it was the \"white man's flag.\"\n\nYou're making conflicting points in your argument. One, you're saying that even though a majority of both whites and blacks want the flag taken down, the fact that 39% of blacks polled in this survey (that isn't cited) didn't say they wanted it taken down means that they support the flag or are okay with it flying. That may not be the case.\n\nSecond, you claim that 'most' people who fly the flag don't see it as a racist symbol, then why would an overwhelming majority of whites want to take this down? Couple that with the fact that the kid who carried out the massacre burned american flags and flew confederate flags, it's safe to assume that the flag does exist as a racist symbol to a group of people....the depth of which you can't really quantify because these beliefs and feelings are rarely reported or shared outside of close-knit social circles in the US.\n\nWith all of that being said, do you think that people who fly the confederate flag are unaware of the history behind it or the racial suggestions that it makes when they raise the flag in their front lawn?\n\nI don't think people should be banned from owning or displaying it, but also I think ebay, Amazon and Wal Mart are all free to sell (or not sell) whatever they see fit. It doesn't mean that it makes it impossible for people to own these items, it just means that the people who are seeking these items out can take their money elsewhere. I doubt this will have any noticeable impact on any of these companies' bottom line.\n\nAs an aside, I grew up in a small town in Georgia.

{"id":"csgb4n4","author":"matterhorn1","body":"in the case I am referring to, it was a list of books I saw online and I looked the titles up on Amazon/ebay to see how much they are selling for. I realized that there were a few very good titles in there and bought the lot.\n\nIn general though when I buy books in real life, I scan the barcode on the back (if there is one). I use an an app called Profit Bandit which I pay for, but you can use the free Amazon app which works also but is less convenient.\n\nIt really comes down to scanning tons and tons of books. To start, stick to non-fiction. Most fiction books are worthless, so I don't often bother with those. I have had some luck with a few Manga titles, but most of those are worthless as well. textbooks are the best (but then only ones printed within the past few years). Sometimes you find a textbook that is 10-15 years old which is good, but it is rare. Many other non-fiction books are valuable as well, but it's the same story that you need to scan 20 books to get 1 decent one. When deciding which books to scan, I usually look for an obscure sounding title, a very specific sounding subject, or one with big words in it. If there is a word that I don't understand in the title, then that definitely gets a scan :)","name":"t1_csgb4n4","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-23 22:37:02","week":26}

{"id":"csgbfr3","author":"BoobiesMcDoobies","body":"Thank you for taking the time to answer my question and not just saying pay it off immediately, which I obviously know. I appreciate that.\n\nYou say not to balance transfer. Is it because you think ill max that out too? I can avoid using the new card if I transfer the balance. The reason im in this situation with the Amazon card is I bought stuff for a bunch of people who didnt pay me back as planned. It is definitely possible to not spend more. I'm concerned about the ~$450 a month in interest. Would transferring my balance not save me that $450? If not, what am I misunderstanding about a balance transfer that offers no or reduced interest on said balance (aside from the one time fee if there is one)?\n\nEdit: Fuck I'm stupid. I was assuming 22% of my balance monthly....not annually. Ignore my comment. I see why people are saying just pay it down now.","name":"t1_csgbfr3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-23 22:44:45","week":26}
{"id":"csgbnkq","author":"GFreg","body":"&gt;I've been told I will have to pay the interest on the balance up to this point in the month (close to $444), regardless of if I pay the balance completely before month end. Is this true? I thought interest was calculated at the end of a period?\n\nRead the terms that they have sent you when you initially got the card.  Chances are that in the small print it will mention that after the \"promotional\" or whatever they called the interest free period, if the entire balance is not paid off then they will retroactively charge you for the months that were \"interest free\".  If anything like that is stated, then you are on the hook for the interest.\n\nIn your situation, I would apply for that card with your bank that offers no cost balance transfer.  I don't know if this will work but see if your Chase Amazon card will allow you to transfer all the money owed, balance and interest owed.  Pay that amount down as aggressively as possible.\n\nDo not use a balance transfer as a handout and keep abusing the credit system.  You can and probably will get yourself into a lot of financial trouble if you don't change your habits.  Do not carry a balance on your credit cards from month to month.  You will never have to worry about the rate you get if you never carry a balance.  Use the card like you would use cash and only buy things that you can afford.\n\nMake a detailed budget and find out where exactly all your money is going.\n&gt;The second check I blow on food, gas, and misc stupid things\n\nIt sounds like you need to reel in your spending on \"misc stupid things\" because it is really hard to spend $1380 a month on food and gas.  I'm not saying that you should completely cut out entertainment and other things but you have to be more detailed with how you spend it.  If you want to go to Bonnaroo, that's fine but realize that just putting it on your credit card all willy nilly will get you in situations like this.

{"id":"csgpy5p","author":"kalabash","body":"It sounds like you all are playing telephone and the information is getting confused somewhere in the process.\n\nFinancial aid is a convoluted subject, but often times it will go straight to your school. I had this happen with loans I accepted. I would sign the loan agreement, the loan would process, and then the financial payment screen on my university account would show that the bill was paid, but the money never routed through a personal bank account to only be automatically drafted out again a few days later. It just went straight to the university.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like your mom may be confusing money leftover after such loans are applied. If the loan amount you sign for is larger than the money owed to the university, the difference is given to you in whatever manner you choose. They can either cut you a check or you can have it deposited in a bank account. Once it's there, though, it's yours. There might be stipulations in the loan agreement you signed about what that money can and cannot be used for, but they can't just debit your account (a.k.a. remove the money) for no legitimate reason.\n\n----\n\nThat doesn't even touch on personal money. Money you earn on your own and deposit in a bank account on your own is yours. For anything not covered by financial aid, the school has zero reason to know where your money comes from. If Grandpa has a trust fund, great. If your aunt won the lottery, great. If you're working 50 hours a week to pay for school, great.. If your mom took out a personal loan and then sends you checks which you sign over to the university, great. Point is: you can pay for the rest of the schooling however you want, just like paying for a pizza. The pizza driver doesn't give two shits 'til Sunday if the money was in the couch cushions or you and your friends pooled it or one person paid or you stole the money or you're using a girlfriend's credit card. You can pay _online_, just like you can with university bills, but that's a payment that's authorized on a payment screen just like buying something on Amazon or eBay.\n\n----\n\nNote: the only exception I can think of is that some schools offer the option to pay tuition/board and such in payments throughout a year. This is designed to help ease the payment burden of people who are working their way through college. Not everyone has $6,000 to fork over at the beginning of every semester (or however much), so most colleges/universities provide a payment plan to allow people to pay off the amount in installments. _AND_ those types of plans can allow for automatic withdrawal of those funds at regularly spaced intervals so as to ensure you don't get dropped from classes for failing to pay. \n\nThat may be what she is referring to, but to be honest it sounds more like your mom is being shady and wants to monitor your money while passing it off as a way of doing you a service. To be fair, she probably will do you a service in this regard. Young adults generally suck at budgeting. If you're really only working in the summer, though, then there's no reason why you can't/shouldn't just pay off the semester right as soon as summer ends. Then you won't need to have random money floating around in her account, mixing with her money. You're going to have to learn to stand on your own financial feet at some point, and her mollycoddling you is only going to slow down that process. I have no doubt she's just worried about you, but \"protecting\" you isn't going to help make you stronger (metaphorically.)","name":"t1_csgpy5p","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-24 06:01:35","week":26}

(Edit: Oh wait, I was thinking poly mailers... welp, this post is mostly useless.)\n\nFor the plastic bags, I've heard that's the rule from several sources. Then again, I've heard it's the rule that you **MUST** sell complete items on Amazon and yet see dozens of sellers selling things with missing pieces or Guitar Hero guitars without dongles, etc.\n\nSo whether or not it's something they'll actually catch right away or react to with an iron fist, I do not know.

I wrote a quick post about it yesterday, but I am right on the threshold of the 5 card in 2 years for the CSP. With this in mind, I’m split between two options\n\n\nOption 1) I have a 50,000 mile Citi AA targeted offer from Citi that expires in August. I was thinking I would apply for CitiGold before that offer expires, then apply for Citi Prestige, and then use the targeted offer for the AA card. Doing so seems like it would work, however, it would rule out me getting the CSP (see below)\n\n\nOption 2) Wait until September (thus CitiGold and my Citi AA offer expires) and then try and go for the CSP, before I get more cards making it much more difficult to get in the future. Alternatively, I could apply for the CSP TODAY, before my SW Plus account hasn’t showed up on my report (not entirely sure when the account “shows up”)\n\nAny advice/suggestions are appreciated!","name":"t1_csh39u9","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-24 16:51:51","week":26}

It appears that while you do get \"5% cash back\" from the Sallie Mae card, that 5% comes in the form of points, which the T's &amp; C's say are redeemable in a 2500 points=$25 ratio, or effectively 1%.

{"id":"cshan5u","author":"yo1k2tog","body":"The 5% category in this upcoming quarter is gas stations and Kohls.  Many gas stations have attached shops that sell gift cards (never shopped at Kohls, couldn't tell you if they sell other gift cards).  And the spend limit is $1500.  Assuming you don't need a new transmission or have a truck or boat with dual tanks, it's unlikely you'll spend that at the gas station over the course of 3 months.  So, you go into the gas station shop and pick up $$ in gift cards.  The trick is to either get a generic card with no activation fee, or a card to someplace you are going to spend money anyway - [here is a page](http://millionmilesecrets.com/2012/09/27/chase-freedom-gas/) describing one such strategy.  She buys cards that work at her local grocery.  My brother in law prefers Lowe's gift cards.  I usually go for Amazon gift cards, which are pretty much as good as cash for most people.  Lord knows I spend enough there.  \n\nSee those eBay cards in the picture there?  Another more advanced strategy is to get those, and then use them at eBay to get other discounted gift cards to the place you really want to buy stuff.   You have to have a certain amount of trust in the eBay seller and the cards need to be available, but some cards regularly sell at a 7%+ discount.  So you get your 5% discount at the gas station, plus 7% at eBay (plus eBay bucks if you are enrolled or maybe 2% eBates rebate  through their portal) and you've racked up a pretty serious rebate on the stuff you really wanted.  Throw in a few coupons and you're talking some serious extreme discounting.  \n\nMS - manufactured spend - a churning secret. 8-)","name":"t1_cshan5u","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-24 19:55:57","week":26}

{"id":"cshlnjq","author":"cuteman","body":"&gt;They've pressured their suppliers over cost, yes. But that is not what this is in my opinion. This is ~~manipulating~~ *dictating* manufacturers profit margins by adding another layer of cost.\n\nThey've already been doing this for years. This change is such that it's going to impact almost every vendor now except those exempted. (most likely the huge huge consumer brands) \n\n&gt;I have to disagree though, it is not in Walmarts interest to put their vendors out of business, they already have been beaten up over job loss with Mom &amp; Pop retailers, the last thing they need is a story about how they put a supplier out of business by using predatory terms.\n\nExcept they've already put lots companies out of business or set them back years trying to recover from the missteps of their relationship with Walmart. It's a very common topic, recovering from the problems of being a small to medium Walmart vendor. \n\nIt's a lot like Amazon, it's seen as a necessary evil, and a lot of big companies can't afford to get out of Walmart, they try to pick and choose products and models to bolster their profits but the only constant is the unrelenting pressure from Walmart buyers for them to constantly reduce cost, offer discounts, rebates, promotions, Mdf, you name it. And if you try to resist, you're shown the door. \n\nThe only way a vendor could protest now would be to get together with other suppliers and try to collude to boycott Walmart. But if course the huge ones like P&amp;G, Kellogg, Coke, Frith Lay/Pepsi, etc. Have special agreements and their own buying teams.\n\nHave you ever seen a Walmart vendor fair? There are literally lines of vendors, all trying to get their products on Walmart shelves. If they can't meet Walmart's requirements they are shown the door if they're even allowed into the building to begin with. \n\nThe simple fact is that Walmart has almost all of the power and can make or break brands with their purchases or lack thereof. \n\nIt's almost like politics, don't want to play ball? We will advertise the shit out of your competitor. Happens all the time. \n\nYour products aren't selling well. We are going to pay that Net 30 invoice in 60 and take 1% off the balance as well. That's not uncommon. \n\nThe fact is that the majority of suppliers are replaceable and Walmart is the largest retailer in the history of the world. You seem to think negative stories about hurting suppliers would cause issues but Walmart probably receives more negative press than any other retailer by a very wide margin. \n\nReddit alone probably has 5:1 or 10:1 more submissions with negative headlines referencing Walmart than the next closest entity. \n\n&gt;Every company that I can remember ever doing something like this has gone bankrupt, Fleming Foods, Kmart... etc.\n\nNone of those had the National and global reach of Walmart. They have the most sophisticated supply chain the world has ever seen. There's never been anything like it. \n\nThe companies you listed had much bigger issues than vendors: mismanagement, inefficiency, failure to adapt, poor financial management, etc. As primary reasons for going out of business. I don't think they're comparable to any kind of risk Walmart current weighs. \n\nThe next closest competitors are Amazon and Target and they do the exact same things albeit not so badly in some areas, yet worse in others. \n\n&gt;Edit: word\n\n","name":"t1_cshlnjq","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2015-06-25 00:36:25","week":26}

I am going off my personal experience and former companies I've worked with. It's happened more than once at more than one company where the team or executives meet with Walmart and Amazon and come away dejected and wondering if they should even be doing business with them because of the questionable ROI after everything comes out in the wash. \n\n&gt;&gt;You seem to think negative stories about hurting suppliers would cause issues but Walmart probably receives more negative press than any other retailer by a very wide margin.\n\n&gt;No, this has no purpose to cause issues for Walmart, i posted on reddit instead of linkedin for this very purpose. I've worked at the home office and for both large and small retailers. Merely continuing a lunch discussion from earlier today, obviously the discussion at lunch vs. reddit has taken two different direction, but that's my intent.\n\nWalmart and Amazon leverage their supply chain like the world has never seen. They lean on. Pressure. Coerce. Threaten. Cutoff. Seek revenge via promotion of competitors. \n\n&gt; I think this is totally against the EDLC model that Walmart preaches. How do you ask vendors to put all costs into COG to get best EDLC then levy (basically) a shelf charge that wasn't originally included in the into COG? How does that even fit the model? How is there an expectation that suppliers won't input this into their pricing model and update (increase) cost?\n\nWalmart is like Darth Vader in that situation. They have all the leverage. The agreement has been altered. Vendors should pray that they do not alter it further. \n","name":"t1_cshoboa","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2015-06-25 01:54:38","week":26}

But it's seen as a necessary evil and has suppliers vying for creative ways to gleen a profit if only they can maintain the the volume. This has anomalous effects in the case of reformulation of common consumer products to reduce costs (value deflation) to meet Walmart's demands.

{"id":"csij0fz","author":"ilovebeermoney","body":"Here's how it works:\n\nVisa and Mastercard are basically the same company and charge right about the same rates. Discover comes very close to matching Visa and MC rates for the merchants.\n\nAmex is much higher and starts at 3.5% but as your amount of amex charging increases, they lower that rate. They never get down to visa/mc/discover rates though. That's why some companies don't accept amex.\n\nVisa, MC and Discover rates can be negotiated with your processor and so basically, the big companies get a much lower rate. Small mom and pop shops will be charged like 1.75% when the card is present and swiped, but around 2.3% when it's an internet transaction.\n\nHowever, the big guys like Walmart and Amazon have way better rates. They're down closer to 1%.\n\nAlso, all of these fees don't go to the same company. They go to multiple companies that are involved in charging. So by the time the credit card issuer gets its cut, it's much lower.\n\nSo basically, there is no way the credit card companies profit off these 2% cards if you max them out and pay them off every time.\n\nSource: 15 years in business and multiple large negotiations with various credit card companies.","name":"t1_csij0fz","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-25 20:43:52","week":26}

{"id":"csiktl4","author":"scrollhand","body":"&gt; Which ones are good for this?\n\nI mainly use Wattpad and CritiqueCircle. \n\nWP's quality barrier is pretty low and finished pieces are rarer still. So much so that a \"finished\" book with basic spelling/grammar in place is simple (today) to get featured. Just send an email and be patient. [More info](http://www.wattpad.com/forums/discussion/890267/%27Featured%27+on+Wattpad).\n\nYou won't get much actual beta feedback but it's a very validating experience, and I'm definitely going to use the presence and experience I'm building there as bullet points for a prospective agent if I decide to go that route. Wattpad is a major, major player in the brave new world of \"reading things digitally.\" It's effectively the YouTube of writing (with all the good and bad that that entails), with a recent VC injection of 40 million or so.\n\nIts \"Improve Your Writing\" and \"Industry Insiders\" forums can be useful for teaching and learning respectively. There are a lot of user run book clubs too. Tough to find serious ones that aren't just stat-exchanges, but they do exist.\n\nCC is a whole other beast, where you participate in a token economy that runs on feedback. Said feedback ranges from crap to legitimate editors who are bored/generous. It's free to use but the paid account isn't expensive and allows you to post up entire novels into a pretty robust system. It's also got a billion little bells and whistles that are actually pretty awesome vs annoying.\n\nBoth WP and CC will have people and links that will fill you to the brim with how2ePub knowhow, if you're willing to look and (like Reddit) be a part of the community. \n\nOther communities I've heard of are the AbsoluteWrite forums and GoodReads. \n\nAs a P.S., getting your book onto something like Amazon is completely self serve. You could do it right now with some basic knowledge of the KDP system. But to actually move copies requires the story to be, well, good. Scratch that: it needs to be saleable.

{"id":"csimqlu","author":"balloonanimalfarm","body":"It looks like you're going to be on $4.10 a day, if it's all spent on food. This month I spent $118 on groceries, so it's doable.\n\nOatmeal and Malt-O-Meal are decently filling breakfasts and they're easy/fast to make, eat a banana at the same time and you're looking at &lt; $0.50 breakfasts. Bagels and toast can mix it up. Pancakes can be frozen and you can get a huge bag of pancake mix that'll last you the year or mix up your own pretty easily.\n\nLunches: peanut butter and jelly/honey can be super cheap, you get different tastes with the jelly and protein + calories of peanut butter, you can add an apple to that (my Kroger sells them 3/$1), total for lunch can be $0.60, add Graham crackers for something sweet if you like. Salads go well too, I recommend learning how to do a DIY ranch or a vinegar and oil, much tastier and better for you. Add chicken for protein and/or wrap it in a tortilla to make wraps.\n\nNow you're down to $2.10, buy your chicken in larger batches and freeze what you're not going to eat in baggies. Learn to cook Asian food, little meat, lots of rice for calories and some veggies; stir fry is easy, there's a lot of stuff over at budgetbites, sesame chicken. Look over at /r/slowcooking for some recipes that'll last you all week (I really like loaded baked potato soup).\n\nFinally, take a multivitamin because you might be missing out on some nutrients.\n\nNever buy books from the bookstore, Amazon is better and wait to buy them until after the professor announces sometimes they put up books that they don't actually intend to use. Some schools require that the library have a copy of every textbook they use, so that might be an option too.\n\nThat leaves fun money, like others have recommended try to get an on-campus job or an off-campus one, you may find that classes don't take up as much time as you thought it would. If you have a Psychology department a lot of times they do paid or free food studies.\n\nCheers!","name":"t1_csimqlu","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-06-25 22:16:19","week":26}

{"id":"csitkyk","author":"ThatAardvark","body":"I'm a college student too, these are the ones I currently use and I've been pretty happy with what I've been getting so far:\n\n**Swagbucks** (not allowed to post referral here) - I'd say this is definitely one of the best ones for me, I just run the mobile apps(SBTV, EntertaiNow, Lifestylz, Sportly, there are more if you're on android but I'm IOS) and do the daily tasks and try qualify for a few surveys a day(I usually only try ones that are around 15 minutes or less for like 40+ swagbucks or the ones that are like 20 minutes for 75+). If you really press at the surveys every day you can get $25 like every two weeks, I've cashed out $25 in paypal 5 times and the most recent 3 were on the 10th of this month, and the 21st and 11th of last month and I'm around halfway to another one right now but I've been slacking on surveys lately. You can also just do $5 amazon codes which are cheaper and faster.\n\n**Bing Rewards** (not allowed to post referral) - I use it with 5 accounts, if you have an Android device, the YABRB bot works well, I just use it with the BlueStacks emulator on my computer. You can use another bot called BingPong in your browser though. This gives around $25 a month, 2 of my accounts got banned though so I made 2 new ones and I'm going to try to cash those out tomorrow, I cashed my other 3 out for $15 2 days ago though.\n\n**FreeMyApps** [Ref(click from a mobile device)](https://m.freemyapps.com/share/twitter/62e80872)| [Non-ref](http://m.freemyapps.com)- if you have an IOS/Android device, basically you just download the apps that show up periodically and open them for ~30 seconds to earn credits. 300 credits is about 1 dollar and you can cash out in Amazon at the 1, 2, 5, and 10 dollar amounts and they have other things like 20 dollar Steam codes. If you have multiple recent devices this is pretty good, I get around 10 dollars a month between two devices, sometimes one device will get more higher paying apps than usual and I'll get an extra like $5 on the side. There are other sites like this like Featurepoints and FreeAppLife but those don't credit for me for some reason but I heard they work for other people.\n\n**ClixSense** [Ref](http://www.clixsense.com/?7531073) | [Non-ref](http://www.clixsense.com/) - I'm new to this one, but it seems like the things that are worth doing besides the Clixgrid when you're watching videos or something are surveys and the tasks once you get your level on Crowdflower up after grinding some lower paying tasks(I'm still low level so I haven't gotten there yet). This place is a bit more iffy with surveys but there are also rare surveys that'll pay you like 2.80 like 3 minutes so it's been worth it trying the ~20 minute and lower surveys. The first cashout has to be through a check they send to verify your address and then you can redeem to paypal with a $1 fee if your balance is $6 or more. I started like last month and I got my first check for 20.19 like 2 days ago and I currently have 7.71 in my balance that I'm trying to build up for my next cashout. \n\n**Amazon Mechanical Turk/MTurk**  - If you have a driver's license/id(apparently they don't always ask but they asked me and I don't have one so I can't use it ;_;), a lot of people recommend it here and I think you can earn more than you can with Swagbucks if I remember correctly. /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor is a sub for the good tasks I think.\n\n\nFor the places that only give amazon giftcards, if you want actual money just go to /r/giftcardexchenge and people will trade paypal for them. A lot of people trade at a rate of 85%($13.75 paypal for $15 Amazon, etc) but some do it at 90%, depends on timing).\n\nAlso your college might not do this, but check if the Psychology/Sociology/Linguistics/Business departments do paid studies. I found out about the ones at my school 2 weeks before the semester is over and signed up for a few and earned $64 by the time the semester was over and I could have made more if my last final was a few days later. It's usually stuff like doing tasks on the computer and/or filling out surveys. The 1 hour+ ones at my school pay 10 dollars an hour and there are shorter ones that last like 10-20 minutes and pay like 3 or 4 dollars, and it looks like there are some that have multiple sessions over a few weeks that pay even more.

You can save a bit more money by shipping the textbook yourself, but also receive more problems that way.\n\nThe unfortunate reality of flipping in Canada is that our shipping is unforgivably expensive.

Another option (seeing as you stated you live in a city with multiple colleges/universities) is to use Kijiji/Craigslist.

The market for these items I know are very competitive by nature, with thousands of sellers. I hope I painted a decent picture of what category I'm in. \n\nWith eBay I was able to enter the market and raise my listings to be at the top of the search within less than a year. Competing with much older sellers and even sitting with super cheap China based sellers. I was able to raise through good customer service and receiving a lot of feedback. \n\nNow on Amazon I list the same product, brand, and when I look for it in the search engine every seller that is selling my product is put on the fifth or even lower pages. I guess the pitfall of my Amazon listing is that my product has a crappy sales rank? I haven't really failed so to speak because I thrive on eBay, but I wonder how else a seller could be higher up in the search engine or is it impossible. \n\nI'm not sure if I even addressed your question but, I guess my pitfall on Amazon is that every product I sell that is successful on eBay is put so low on the search engine of Amazon that it's impossible to even get a sale a day maybe whereas eBay I'm a power seller \n\n\n\n\n\n  ","name":"t1_csj6evi","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-26 08:59:16","week":26}

At times I don't even bother with JunGroups, nGage or encrave.  If the Swagbucks apps are having issues on my wifi and my mobile network I don't even bother with them.\n\nI'm getting to the same point of no longer being motivated. What keeps me going is I'm looking to get a house so everything I can get from my apps is less money I have to spend on something.  So that money can go to a bill or in the bank.  I'm saving for AMC gift cards now so that when I go to the theater I don't have to pay.  After that it's going to be split between Lowe's and Amazon.  My goal for Lowe's is to get enough to get a Kobalt electric lawnmower.  For Amazon it's just going to be things that I need or wants.  Might try to save so I can spend on their Black Friday deals.  \n\nI'll second what someone else had said and set a goal.  At the start of the year I set 2 goals for myself.  The first being to be able to use my gift cards to start a Perk farm.  For a USB power strip and 5 LG Realms I only spent 60 bucks out of pocket.  My next goal was to save up enough gift cards to get a 200 dollar Omega juicer for free.  Between Perk, Swagbucks and my Citi Thank You points I was able to do that.  After that it's just been to get whatever.  I really haven't had a goal to the past few days.  I'm thinking with AMC gift cards, a 500 dollar lawnmower and about 500 into Amazon by Black Friday isn't a realistic goal.  At least not one that wont leave one feeling burnt out.  \n\nTL;DR: Make a realist goal and mostly just stick with the passive stuff.  If you feel up to it do some other things.

{"id":"csjhe95","author":"bravezombie","body":"There's a guy, Dan Kennedy, who has done fantastic for dentists. His books are book prices and you can get them on Amazon. He's a great place to start.\n\nThe reason I mention him is your answer is much more detailed than I can write from my phone, but he gives examples of how he's marketed to dentists.\n\nThe general way to embrace direct marketing is to get to know your customer. If your leads are inbound, start gathering data: what do they have in common? What separates your customers from your non buyers? What do they all seem to want and for how much?\n\nOnce you know these answers, the next step is to make sure you ask for the sale whenever you get a call. Then ask for an add on whenever you get the sale.\n\nFrame it as helping them more. \n\nFrom there, it's just a matter of testing. Test what offers get the most results. Test the wording or the pricing. And once you've got a good offer, start doing outbound calls with it to dentists with similar demographics.\n\nFrom there, refine your process: do a two step instead of one step sale. Measure your results to minimize waste spend. Survey your clients to brainstorm new services. Copy then improve what your competitors are doing. Partner with your competitors. Partner with your clients. Put your best phone script up as a sales page. Test and tweak that. Partner with dental schools to give away free training to new dentists before they get started. Partner with the people who loan money to dentists in the same way. Partner with people who sell dental equipment. Create ways to make income from the dentists CLIENTS buying. Etc.\n\nThe principles are know your market, give them what they want, test and track your data.\n\nDo it creatively enough and you can't help but love direct response marketing. It literally becomes a cash machine where you spend x to acquire a new customer and make y in profit.","name":"t1_csjhe95","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-26 17:30:52","week":26}

So you might have to sit on some stuff from less likely categories for a little longer or price it more competitively.

{"id":"csjj6ga","author":"fba20150626","body":"We haven't failed yet but there's been some issues. I can give you my limited perspective after doing FBA for 4 months now. This is our first experience doing any type of reselling or even being self employed. We do about $5000 in sales a month with 25% profit after everything.\n\nI apologize, this will be a bit scattered and sound like a bit of a rant at times. I do think the main points are things people need to consider, while it may be obvious to some.\n***\n####Watching Youtube videos is not research.\nA family member decided to start selling through FBA after watching some Youtube videos. This was the only \"research\" they did, watching hours of video each day where the presenter would go on and on about how easy FBA is and imply you make a lot of money. It took us 3 weeks to learn that 95% of Youtuber are full of shit. It turns out they either do not know what they are talking about, or they lie and mislead you. \n\nI also see some of those people selling classes on how to do FBA. That really angers me because they have no idea what they are talking about.Cody Hawk is the biggest fraud I've seen in this area but that's not the point.\n\n**The point is you ~~cannot~~ should not start a new business without doing anything other than watching Youtube videos**. This seems like it should be obvious. Sit down and read Amazon's rules and guidelines. Learn how the entire business is supposed to work beyond \"buy some stuff at Walmart and sell on Amazon.\"\n\nThere are a lot of rules you need to be aware of and follow. I see these ignored constantly on these forums. eg: you cannot print labels on plain white paper and tape them to products.\n\nThere are condition guidelines, shipping guidelines, prep and packaging guidelines, and more. Lots of stuff you need to read and learn about before you start buying items to resell.\n***\n####Learn how to use a computer before starting an online business.\nThe family member asked me to help them out because they don't know how to use a computer. They can browse to a website by searching on Google. They get to Google by closing down Chrome and reopening it so the home page comes up. They do not know how to do anything else, including logging on to a website. Even browsing beyond the front page of a site is extremely difficult for them and they will get frustrated very quickly.\n\nOne morning, I received a very angry text message (yes they can text) because I had turned the computer off the night before and they couldn't figure out how to turn it on.\n\nI didn't know it was this bad so when they first asked for help \"doing the computer stuff\" I said yes. Turns out \"the computer stuff\" means doing literally every aspect of the business that involves a computer. From creating shipments and listings, to managing reports and even bank and credit card accounts.\n\nTurns out an **online** business requires the ability to do basic computer tasks.\n\n***\n####Working with Family is difficult\n\nI've tried teaching them how to do basic things but it always ends up in huge arguments. Part of that is their refusal to learn: \"why should I learn this, you do this computer stuff\" and my impatience: \"how the fuck do you not know how to do this?\"\n\nIn a normal business, you can criticize and critique each other. It's not your job to teach employees how to do basic tasks. It's hopefully not your job to do half their job for them too. If there is an issue, you can likely deal with management to find a solution.\n\nIn a family, things are personal. You can't get frustrated or lose your temper like with a coworker, because the family member is going to say \"you shouldn't be mean to family\" when they do something stupid you've told them not to 5 times now.\n\nThere's no management to help out, there's no training, there's no screening before they are even hired.\n\nFamily will take advantage of your relationship in some way. It might be minor like \"do me a favor\" or it could be severe like \"run my business for me (for free)\" and \"why are you always so stressed out, all you do is the computer stuff, I buy all the products!\"\n***\n####There are fees.\n\nYou'd know this if you read ahead of time and made a basic spreadsheet.\n\nThere are costs every step of the way that I know from my personal experience and from reading many posts on various forums, people are not aware of until after the fact.\n\nSome of the costs:\n\n1. Sales tax when you make the purchase. You need to account for this or track this for later when you need to pay your quarterly sales tax to the state. You are collecting sales tax right?\n\n2. Shipping costs. If you buy an item online for $100 and the shipping is $20, you paid $120 not $100. Include this in your COGS.\n\n3. Packaging, prep and shipping materials. Bags and labels cost money. So do shipping boxes, tape and dunnage. \n\n4. Shipping costs. It costs money to ship your items into Amazon. You get a great discount but you still need to be smart about it. Don't spend $10 to ship 3 items that are only making you $15 in sales. Don't buy large or heavy items that you have to ship across the country and then pay higher FBA fees.\n\n5. FBA fees. This will bite you if you are starting out in Retail arbitrage. You bought some grocery item for $2 and it sells on Amazon for $8. Wow 4 times your money! No, at a maximum, you will make $2.13 profit before the cost of steps 3 and 4 above. Do the math, how many of those items will you have to sell to make a decent return? You need to sell 20 a month just to cover the monthly cost of having a professional account.\n\n6. Monthly fees. Every nickel adds up. You're paying for a scanner app on your phone, a monthly fee to amazon, maybe inventoryLab, maybe Excel, maybe some other online services. make sure you remember they are there.\n\n7. Your time. I know, it's not a fee, and you save money by putting in more time. But make sure you are comfortable with how much time you are spending on the business vs how much you are earning. Running a small business is a lot of work, is this how you want to live?\n\n***\n####Your home is going to become a hub.\n\nKeep in mind how much space you are going to be taking up with products and supplies.\nNo matter how small you are, you will at the very least, have a table full of items you are prepping to ship to Amazon. \n\nWe have 3 rooms full of supplies and products, including one room that's a pile of boxes, another that's full of shelves. \n\nIt's in the middle of the living space. You're going to be living in this mess.\n\nEven if your home isn't the main center of operations, things can still find a way to clutter up your home.\n\nThere's going to be a lot of deliveries coming and going. Supplies and products coming in, products going out. \n\nMake sure you are ready for this. Can you leave packages outside for UPS to pick up and drop off? Do you have to worry about weather or thieves? Will delivery trucks be able to get to you easily, is there room to maneuver a truck down your street and driveway.\n\n***\n\nThat's about all I can write for now. It's already been over an hour.\n\nI hope the main points mixed in amongst the ranting gave you an idea of some of the problems we face as a new FBA merchant.\n\n***\nOh! One more thing and it's a big one.\n\n####Starting a small business requires initial capital.\n\nThe resell business is a cash flow game. You need money up front to buy the products and then you need to constantly reinvest that money if you want to business to grow. It can be expensive to start and risky.","name":"t1_csjj6ga","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-26 18:15:55","week":26}

You want your item to take as little shelf space as possible because if your item sits on their shelves for a long time you may be charged a storage fee for the space used. \n\nMerchant fulfilled is less fees but you have to handle boxing/shipping yourself.  \n\nFBA usually means your item will sell faster and once you ship it off to Amazon you can sit back a bit, but again, you're giving up a little bit of your profit for that convenience.  \n\n&gt;can I send in 100 items to FBA in their normal retail packaging and then FBA packs them and sends them?\n\n__tl;dr:__  Yes to this question as long as each item is individually barcoded.","name":"t1_csjja17","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-26 18:18:27","week":26}

I am primarily using the site as a means to learn SEO, but have been failing, which is frustrating. I have been focusing more on nuanced aspects of my niche now that I know I obviously wont rank for \"top 5 boots for men\" etc., such as boot construction, long tail keywords, etc because there is no way I will rank for anything else. Do you think this is impractical, and also too competitive? I still have to master the art of finding non-competitive, profitable keywords.\n\n&gt;Your site looks like crap \n\nI have been playing around with themes, but I agree the theme is quite ugly. \n\n&gt;and your content isn't good.\n\nREKT. While I feel that the content on some of the pages, for instance top 5 boots, are lacking high quality original information, I honestly attempted to provide high quality information for all pages, and believe the both the leather guide, as well as the GYW construction post both provide valuable insight, which was well received to those who viewed it. That said, you're completely entitled to your opinion, and I appreciate the honest feedback.  \n\nAre there things content wise that are not SEO optimized, that may be holding me back as well, or is it simply you don't believe the content itself is valuable?\n&gt;Your backlink strategy will never rank.\n\nWhy? What am I doing wrong? I have been trying to diversify my backlinks, through social, and web 2.0's with high PR. I have now submitted to around 16 Soicial Bookmarking sites to further diversify.

I appreciate the input, I am planning on doing more articles on boot care, as well as elements of boot construction in the near future, and appreciate the tip. Glad to hear I was headed in the right direction. \n\n&gt;Then, circulate it to every hiking blog you can find. \n\nI feel like this is a major component that I have been missing in my back-linking strategy. I have been taking the time to submit articles to random web 2.0 submission sites, but not taking the time to reach out to authorities in my niche asking for a backlink presumably because I know I am going to get turned down 99% of the time. I hope that in adding some high quality niche related links my position in Google will improve and I will start to see them gains. \n\n&gt;Before you do any of this, I would improve your site's design. It just matters so much, so put a lot of time into it. \n\nThis seems to be a reoccurring theme as well. I will need to dedicate more time to this, as I agree with the comments that it is horrendous. That said I just switched themes, and have been updating the information to be more visually appealing. \n\nYou are awesome for taking the time out to help, and provide quality insight regarding my blog, I really can't express my appreciation enough.

{"id":"csk6a9v","author":"cdegallo","body":"7500 is practically a joke, it would not even cover the cost of living difference.  You could get that much just by finding a new job in your current area.  Much less the consideration that you are being asked to significantly change your current life by moving.\n\nIf this is Amazon we're talking about, they are super stingy with employee compensation, so that might be a tough bargain.  However, you should focus on negotiating the base salary, forget about rsu's for now.  If I hear 75k in Seattle for a tech company job, I would probably equate that to the ballpark of 100k in silicon valley for the same job.  For San Francisco specifically, it's almost 40% higher cost of living than Seattle, and depending on where in silicon valley you end up living, it might be close to that (take into account that the housing market is ridiculously hot right now everywhere from San Bruno all the war to San Jose, with houses going for way over asking.\n\nWithout divulging specific info you are not comfortable with, can you identify where in sv you might be living?  I mean, there is a big difference between somewhere like Menlo park and somewhere like south San Jose...which would affect relative cost of living and hence negotiating.\n\nBut to be honest, if they are asking you to relocate and it's not because of a company downsizing or something, you should at least get the difference in cost of living.  Check out http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;city1=Seattle%2C+WA&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city2=San+Francisco%2C+CA and tell your work what you've researched for the relative cost of living difference, and that you aren't interested in relocating for less.\n\nI assume they are also offering relocation?  If they offer either a service or a monetary payment option and you don't need cash asap, take the service option as the liability for the service lies with them, instead of you hiring a service on your own.","name":"t1_csk6a9v","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-27 05:23:39","week":26}

That is, a good blend of quality, price and predictability in the supply chain. I was using one company and suddenly they went out of stock for 2 months, just when I was about to get a run of boxes printed! This meant I needed to start a supply search again, getting samples, forming a relationship, etc. Lesson learned: have some supply chain backup.\n- I made a really trivial decision that I didn't think would have any impact. I agreed with the printer that I would have the cards 'laminated' - just like a smooth coating - to give the cards a lovely feeling. What I didn't realise is that over the entire deck of cards it would increase the stack thickness! They 'just' fitted into the box. \n- Postage and mailing has been a pain. I had bought a large batch of bubble envelopes that were perfect for a single deck of cards. Then when orders came in, I would have orders for 2, 3, 4, etc. I wasn't ready for this and had to start sourcing the right box with the right size/strength.  This all takes time and effort to find the supplier, test the boxes out, understand the impact on your profitability etc.  Packaging and boxes can be surprisingly expensive and of varying quality. And then you need somewhere to store everything. This is where using Amazon FBA (fulfilment) is a great option, as they deal with all the different package sizes and mailing issues.\n\nRegarding research, I'm a lifelong learner and a product manager, so I'm familiar with the market.

I've been on Reddit before trying to get spoon fed ideas for something and then realized all the success stories come from people who thought of an idea and immediately took action. \n","name":"t1_cskmq61","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-27 19:22:39","week":26}

{"id":"csknd8n","author":"PRATTARAZZI","body":"You're welcome. Thanks for taking the time. Yes, feeling your supplier pain!\n\nWith Amazon there are two main models:\n\n- Fulfilled by vendor - Your product is listed on Amazon. Amazon takes the payment, deals with fraud checks, etc. and then passes the order details over to you to package and send it out. The substance of the fee is a % of the sales price based upon the type of item e.g. media, electronics, etc. with some additional fee elements.\n- Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)- Your product is listed on Amazon. Amazon takes the payment, deals with fraud checks, etc. and then sends out the item (that you've previously shipped and stored in their warehouse). In addition to the fee elements above, there are additional fees for pick &amp; pack + weight handling + warehouse storage fee (based on cubic volume).\n\nIn addition, there's a kind of platform access fee with two options:\n\n- Per item fee (for people doing only a handful of monthly transactions)\n- Monthly fee if you're planning on selling a reasonable volume and to allow you to run promotion/discount codes.\n\nIt takes a while to get your head around, but Amazon has worked examples (on your country Amazon site, try a search for FBA fulfillment fees or FBA ratecard). All I'll say is that there are lots of variable e.g. item type, size, weight, storage, etc. Worth popping it all into a spreadsheet and you'll need to understand this when setting your pricing.\n\nAmazon settles up periodically, where you receive a bank transfer of net sales proceeds minus their fees.\n\nThe benefit of having something held by Amazon is that you don't have to be in the loop for shipping it. If there's an order and you're on holiday, it's them who's handing it. You just have to do your best to keep the right level of supply in their warehouse. This can be tricky if your sales are very peaky/sporadic. You could just send a ton of stock to them, but then you're paying for monthly storage, and if it sells slowly that can mount up. You can also run both vendor and Amazon fulfillment side by side to give you some flexibility.\n\nBest suggestion is to try it out!\n\n","name":"t1_csknd8n","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-27 19:44:15","week":26}

{"id":"csl5rzu","author":"[deleted]","body":"I've taken a look at your site, but I'm really curious: can you explain how you expect your concept to work? From your landing page:\n\n&gt; Don’t you hate it when you buy a book that you thought you’d like, only to find that it isn't worth your time after the first couple chapters? We hate that too, but what can you do when you love books but hate the gamble that accompanies every purchase? Simple. You can log on to chappters.\n\nYou're going for a digital market, and there are three really important things I know as a reader that make me immediately indifferent to the concept. First: On Amazon, I get a 10% sample to assess whether or not I like the book. That's also generally true on other platforms, and in some cases rises to 15%. So I can adequately decide my thoughts on a book without spending any money, and the longer the book, the more effectively I can do so.\n\nSecond: digital content from independent authors is significantly cheaper than trad. published authors in 99% of cases. If I pick up a book for $2.99 or less, which is a price point a lot of indies go for, and I decide sometime after that initial 10% I was wrong, I'm not quite as bothered as if I had spent $7.99 or more on a cheap print book (for which my sample options are also more limited). And if I am bothered ... \n\nThree: Most digital retailers offer full refunds within their grace period. On Amazon, this is 7 days. It's a fair amount of time, and it's a very easy process. I also get the full amount refunded, so all I've lost is time. \n\nFor those reasons, I'm already dubious to Chappters. The 'gamble' is primarily one of time when reading free samples. Any purchase I'm unhappy with, I can get my money back. There's nothing wrong with this system.\n\nBesides all this: why would I want to split my purchase up into many disparate pieces? It's incredibly inconvenient. If you're safely billing your customers, you'll require them to enter a password and confirm each purchase when they'd like to unlock the next part of a book. I don't want to do that. I want to read. Some writers split their works into lots of very short chapters. There are scenarios where I could be reading for 4 or 5 minutes, then need to enter a password, confirm a purchase, wait for another file to download ... Readers want immersion, and this system will break that - in some books with alarming frequency. \n\nLooking at your benefits to writers:\n\n&gt; Wider Audience: Before potential readers may have shied away from your title because of the high cost, but now they are more likely to pick it up, and if they enjoy it (which we are sure they will), buy multiple chappters.\n\nAgain, most independent authors price low. I am one, and have been doing so for over 4 years. I know this game. $2.99 is a very common price, as is $0.99. We know readers are very happy with these price points. Those who are not gravitate toward the reams and reams of free content available - content you presumably will not be offering, based on your proposed delivery system. I'm also not concerned about a 'wider audience', because at this point, your site doesn't have one, and even when it does, unless it grows large enough to control even a fraction of a percent of the ebook market, my bases are pretty well covered with the likes of Amazon, Nook, iBooks, Kobo, Google, and Smashwords. That's not to say platform diversity isn't a good thing, but I don't believe my nets will widen by any appreciable degree unless you can capture a decent portion of this marketplace.\n\n&gt; Write as You Go: You no longer have to have a perfectly completed product to put it out there, writers. With chappters you can publish as many, or as few, chappters as you’d like. Even better, you can get feedback from your audience to help you develop and grow your story.\n\nThis concerns me, primarily as a reader, but one with a knowledge of writing. With the books I read already, I expect a certain degree of polish. The opportunity to publish chapter-by-chapter as it's written doesn't suggest the same level of polish to me as a book written to completion and edited after the fact. I also know from my writing that I can go right the way to the end of a book and realise I have introduced inconsistencies which need to be cleared up in the edit, or changed some details toward the end which then need altering elsewhere. By completing my book and polishing it before publishing, I can guarantee it's as tight as possible. If I release each chapter before the entire thing is done, I can't. \n\nCould this work for serial content? Yes, I think it would, as you've identified. But as a reader, I would expect to view serial content in larger parts than individual chapters, which tend to be significantly shorter than parts of a serial would be. Regardless, you can argue that down more to personal preference than I think you could my other issues, so I'll defer on this one. \n\nI understand what you want to do, but I don't see it catching on in any reasonable way. You say yourself at the top of your landing page:\n\n&gt; What ITunes did to albums, we're doing to books, a chappter at a time.\n\niTunes, and digital music as a whole these days, took off for a combination of reasons. First is the entry cost of an album, which is fairly high. Second is the nature of songs. A listener isn't guaranteed to like all songs on an album, because they are disparate; they have different styles, and do different things. Of a 13-track album, a listener might only like 6 songs, or 7 - or 3. Being able to buy these individual pieces is fantastic, because it means no more wasted money. But narrative content, unless we're talking about short story collections, is not typically disparate. Each piece forms part of a whole. The writing style does not hugely vary section by section. Chapter 1 is technically similar to chapter 8, chapter 14, and chapter 36, so as a reader I'm not at risk of suddenly disliking the way the author strings together sentences. The story itself may turn me off, but free sampling allows me to get a look at this upfront, and if things become too dire I can get all of my money back. \n\nAlso, as an actual piece of advice: in your Google docs survey, you mention the cost of a chapter from a book with 10 chapters will be one-tenth the book's cost. Chapters deviate in length, sometimes *hugely*. Flatly dividing book cost by chapter number for individual chapter price is going to be very inaccurate, when one chapter might be as short as 4 pages and the next as long as 40. You should use word count instead.","name":"t1_csl5rzu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-28 06:50:57","week":26}

{"id":"cslgmvo","author":"NeedsAUsernamez","body":"Oddly the more stuff I bought the less I tended to make per item because I wasn't being as picky with my purchases. I spent around a grand per month on bulk electronics from police auction. Mostly propertyroom.com stuff as I lived close enough to pickup pallets of things in person rather than having them ship the stuff. Cost of items varied greatly but I was always rather picky when buying. My belief was you make the money buying, not selling, as I can dictate the buy price while the market dictates the sell. I would try and pay about 7% of the sale price for an item and my win percentage was less than 10% of the auctions I bid on. Cell phones made good money until one day I was watching a documentary on cell phones in prison only to slowly think \"ooohh nooo… the phones I'm selling have been up someones butt.\" and I quit doing that.\n\nThrift stores, there's a Goodwill in Santa Ana I would go to, they specialized in electronics and I always made money off their audio equipment. Home theater amps they have for $20, pop it on eBay for $89 or so and it would sell usually across the country in about a day. For reasons I can't figure out to this day they still seem to price stuff stupidly low, which is out of the norm for Goodwill, picked up a pair of Bose 901's there with the equalizer for $60. They do have two daily auctions there though, so I imagine the electronics store might be a last ditch effort to get rid of the stuff quick.\n\nYup, definitely a grind. I hated the receptiveness, the weeks where people don't buy could be predicted though. Usually it was the same schedule every year. Around tax time you'll make buckets of cash while thanksgiving to new year if you sold used stuff like I did, might as well just take a month long vacation. No one buys used stuff for gifts. Right now it's kind of a toss, I would get lots of offers on things during the summer for some reason and sales will tank for a couple weeks when back to school season starts.\n\nIf you want to make your life easier, assuming you aren't already doing this with 400 listings over various sites, I'd recommend looking into either a Shopify store or WooCommerce ontop of WordPress. I never got many sales off my own website but it let me make a listing on my website and it would automatically go to eBay and Amazon. Say if something sold on eBay, it took the listing off Amazon and my website. I did a 10% discount on my website, the software added 10% to eBay/Amazon listings to cover the fees. For me Etsy wasn't worth the time, Craigslist could do very well but 90% would only do local pickup so you'll have to be setup for that. As a bonus your website keeps track of analytics so you can bring up charts for sales per week and do things like auto generate an estimate of sales once you have a full year or more of data. Gives you a bit more consistency or you can do category reports which can show that say audio equipment sells well but you aren't doing too hot with printers.","name":"t1_cslgmvo","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-28 17:40:07","week":26}

{"id":"cslnpkm","author":"capnbozzy","body":"I think a problem a lot of entrepreneurs have when they're starting out is they think too big. You don't need to reinvent the wheel, and you don't need to be innovative. Once you're successful and have money to spend, then you can start taking on bigger problems and being more creative (was Elon Musk's first project SpaceX? Of course not!).\n\nSo, for example, look at [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org). Craigslist is a very simple website that is extremely useful for millions of people every day. It's a reliable *source* of something. You can go there every day and find local listings. Nothing fancy, it just works--it solves people's problems, whether they're looking for a job or to buy a fuckin' couch.\n\nCan you imagine how much money Craigslist would make if it ran targeted CPC/CPA/CPM ads next to its listings? I get hard just thinking about it!\n\nSo what if you made a site that targeted just ONE niche and had daily updated listings? Nothing special, but it'd be useful to people looking for what you're offering kinda like, I dunno, a *subreddit*! Holy shit.\n\nYou could then promote your site for free using Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, even Reddit, etc. It's easy to build up a user base with social networking if you just get in there and grind every day, following people, talking to people, helping people find what they're looking for. Check out [LazyAssStoner.com](http://lazyassstoner.com) for GREAT information on internet marketing (see how I just promoted that site for free? I don't own that site or even know Jay Wessman, the guy who runs it, personally, but I'm promoting it because his content is fuckin' *gold*).\n\nSo there are a million different niches you could do this with. And by the way, what are porn tube sites? Just porn video listings. And what is [thisiswhyimbroke.com](http://thisiswhyimbroke.com)? It's basically just a big Amazon affiliate list of goofy products. In other words, these sites at their very core are just Craigslist for specific niches. Never underestimate the power of an updated list!\n\nThe bottom line is, keep it simple. Focus on providing real value and remove the fluff. People don't give a shit about your fancy schmancy site, they just want to get their fix (if they're at your site to be entertained) or solve their problem (if they're at your site to get information).\n\nAnd lastly, think about what knowledge you have to share with people. What do you do every day that tons of other people love to talk about or would really like to learn? Start talking about it every day. Start a website and post pictures of cats licking their fucking assholes and people will eat that shit up, and have a store page with recommended books from Amazon about other retarded cat shit. It really is that easy, my friend. People are really not that hard to please (no offense fellow people).\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_cslnpkm","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-28 21:44:06","week":26}
{"id":"cslnu1g","author":"joshw220","body":"A lot of pro's and con's to this argument. A lot of the people do not know what they are doing and will run out of funds or get stuck with the products. I follow the amazon forums closely and also an avid seller over the past 3 years that has not received one warning or violation. Amazon is banning tons of accounts on a daily basis. It is like the show storage wars. I knew someone that bought storage units back in 2000 and they would sell from $30.00-$200.00 when the show came out people were looking for the quick buck and were bidding as high as $700.00 for someones old IKEA furniture and dirty laundry. Over the past year storage auctions have gone down dramatically. RA is easy money if you know the rules and know what you are doing. So many people don't know the rules that they sell black listed items, and items that you can not sell as new. I do very good and have not sold a single item out of target, walmart, toys r us. All the new RA people are flooding these locations, but I have my own sources I am going to.
