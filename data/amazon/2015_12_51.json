I did pretty well for my age, but had very small margins on high risk items. In the last 2 years I was able to save up enough for my down payment by flipping cellphones, but over the last summer I saw how dried up the market was. \nI stumbled across this sub in August, lurked here for about a month, and began selling on Amazon the last week of September. I thought I would prefer eBay since I was very comfortable from selling large amounts of cell phones on there. I sold merchant fullfilled for a week, before completely switching to FBA. I have not even had my Amazon account open for 90 days, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/seHSLa9.png) are my last 30 days of sales. This is all part time, while working 30 hours a week, and taking 21 credit hours in college. I had to rent an 800 square foot garage to package items, and hold items I haven't been able to send in.

I've tried a lot of things to keep growing the business, we're on all social networks including YouTube, we've done some a/b testing, we've improved our seo (with limited success), we have even tried some viral marketing campaigns (with limited success).\n\nThe website is very scalable, the more traffic we get the more revenue we make. We don't need to increase employees or anything like that, as we are an affiliate site and don't carry any inventory.\n\nWe are considering developing an app, but right now we are more interested in trying to build some kind of a community around the site. We have nearly 300k registered users, but there is no depth to having an account. We don't really want to try and get users to comment on stuff, because its always shallow comments like \"want!\" \"need!\" etc.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n---\n**Edit** Many on here are asking for more details on the business. I will provide as much as I can publicly.\nWe are an affiliate site who primarily earns our revenue from Amazon. Amazon significantly outperforms most affiliate programs because of their huge inventory, 85% of all of our commissions come from products purchased on Amazon that we didn't even feature on the site.\n\nWe are first and foremost an entertainment website - we're trying to shift slightly more into having products people would actually want/buy, but we don't want to alienate the userbase that just wants to see weird and interesting products - and of which has helped make the website so popular.\n\nWe post 6-12 new products every single day, and we do have extensive product categorization (look for the \"Browse\" and \"Search\" buttons at the top left of the site).\n\nRetargeting/Ads is very difficult for us to work with because we're a middleman and affiliate programs such as Amazon provide very little details to connect the dots, and since we're only getting a small portion of the sale we need very high traffic numbers for any ad campaign to be effective.\n\nWe e-mail our userbase of 300k once a week, the engagement is strong at a 30% open rate but the sales generated from it is very low.\n\nI'll add more details as I get asked questions.","name":"t3_3wubwq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-14 23:05:25","week":51}

{"id":"3wxgnq","author":"2016budgetthrow","body":"**Background:**\n\nI do quite well for myself, and now, for my wife. However, I still feel, possibly erroneously, that I am still not saving enough.\n\n**Facts/Considerations:**\n\nI am 32M, and the sole income earner. I work overseas, so while I file a tax return annually, I have not and do not expect tax liability. \n\nMy wife, 27F, does not work except very occasionally ~ total earnings are expected to be &lt;$2000 for the year and are not counted here.\n\nThese numbers include a fully-funded ($18,000) 401(k) through my employer. (That is, my starting number is expected net pay, after all deductions including 401(k) contributions and health insurance.)\n\nSo, here goes:\n\nExpected net pay: $105,450\n\nForeign household bills: $1500*\n\nFuel: $100\n\nMortgage (stateside house): $670**\n\nStateside Utilities: $40\n\nGroceries/Personal care: $500\n\nShopping/crap my wife buys that we \"need\": $100\n\nCharity: $100\n\nMy \"Fun money\": $300\n\nWife's \"Fun money\": $300\n\nJoint \"Fun money\": $600 (used for \"date nights,\" eating out, etc.)\n\nTravel: $600\n\nCar repair fund: $100\n\nGeneral Savings Fund: $1000\n\nSpecial Item Savings Fund: $100\n\nLife Insurance: $150\n\nGifts to people: $100\n\nAmazon Prime: $8.25\n\nKindle Unlimited: $10\n\nRoth IRA Max (mine): $458.33\n\nIncidental/Buffer: $250\n\nSave/spend on baby expenses: $500\n\n*This amount includes car insurance in the foreign country, 2x cell phone lines, internet access, and rent on our flat.\n\n**This includes a $100 overpayment every month that is applied directly to principal.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBy my math, this puts monthly outflow at 5328.25 (money that is spent, that I don't receive some kind of tangible investment. I'm including the house payment in this, because it's not liquid). So I am spending 61% of my net, and living pretty damn well I would assess.\n\nIt puts monthly savings at: $1700 (this includes the baby line item, because we don't have one yet and probably won't until 2017. Not actively trying to become pregnant).\n\nSavings rate: 19.3%\n\nWith a fully-funded Roth IRA at $5500, they show an investment rate of 5.2%. (But don't forget, I'm also fully funding a 401(k) at $18,000.)\n\n\nDoes anyone see any opportunities to maximize investments, minimize spending, or generally do anything better?\n\nEDIT: cleaning up some grammar.","name":"t3_3wxgnq","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-15 12:55:17","week":51}

{"id":"3wzayf","author":"bikeboy1360","body":"tldr: Always look for additional amazon policies\n\nIll start this out by saying this case is still ongoing, but seeing as it has been going for over a month I don't have much hope. \n\nA few months ago I was able to get a great deal on some larger Samsung TV's. I was able to get 10 TV's total, 5- 50 inch and 5- 55 inch. I had previously shipped these units FBA (which sold out quickly), so I was excited to be able to scale up a bit. The TV's arrived in over-pack boxes, with each TV wrapped in 6+ inches of bubble wrap. I inspected each package, and shipped them out through the preferred carrier (UPS). \n\nFast forward a week and the packages are not showing up in my inventory, but tracking information was showing as delivered. I opened a case, and the next day nine units show up as unfulliable - distributor damaged, and one unit is MIA. \n\nI opened another case, asking them to explain how nine, NIB units had been damaged, by the distributor (me). They explained that the units had been bundled on their sides (by UPS we assume), and thus were automatically classified as damaged and unsalable. Additionally, they stated that TV's of this size cant be shipped UPS, and thus they could not help me. My only option would be to have them return the units to me, and then have me ship them by truck. \n\nI did some research, and was able to find the policy in question in seller central, which lists TV's over 40 inches (i think) must be shipped via less then truckload. However when creating this order there was no mention of this in this shipping instructions, and UPS still showed as the preferred shipper on the shipment selection page. \n\nTo make matters worse, at one point during our email exchange a rep told us amazon would reimburse us (yay!), only to tell us a week later that they decided not to. \n\nLong story short - I am out $500 I spent on shipping these TV's to Amazon, one is missing, and it sounds like I am going to have to take them back, and either ship them to Amazon, again, for another $500, or just figure out how to liquidate nine TV's locally. We missed out on all of the holidays (having 15k tied up in these damn TV's), and honestly, this might be the point we call it quits. We are debating if we should try small claims court (since we followed the listed directions, and can prove we shipped the TV's individually, not the way Amazon received them), but I honestly dont know if that is just a waste of time.  \n\nSorry for the rant, I just needed to get that out there.  \n\nEdit: \nWhat we sent: http://imgur.com/a/IcUoI\nWhat Amazon got: http://imgur.com/a/0VK8n","name":"t3_3wzayf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-15 20:47:51","week":51}

We've(she) recently decided we don't want to move out of our hometown so we can now begin looking into purchasing our first home. We're both in our early 20's and have had a pretty decent start in our respective careers (IT+Nurse). A breakdown of our situation:\n \n**Income**\n \n* Wife - $58k Gross.  $1,500 take home every 2 weeks.\n \n* Myself $40k Gross. $1,100 take home every 2 weeks. (Promoted once w/ 40% pay increase. employer wants to get me back to school and certified in more systems we plan on implementing)\n \n* Estimated take home ~$67.5k\n\n**Emergency Fund** - $5k (after spending $7k on our Wedding/Honeymoon)\n\n**Set Outflows ~$1.3k**\n \n* Rent $745, 2br 2bth 10/10 location\n \n* Corolla $300\n \n* Student Loans - $155\n \n* Auto Insurance - $65\n \n* Internet - $60\n \n* Cellular - $ 90\n \n* Spottily - $ 14.99\n \n* Hulu - $7.99\n \n* Renters Insurance - $15.99\n\n\n**Varying Outflows ~$855**\n\n* Electricity/Gas - $65 winter, $155 Summer\n\n* Barber/Salon - $50-$100\n\n* Fuel - $100\n \n* Eating Out/Bars - $100\n\n* Mani/Pedi  - $75\n\n* Home Products - $50\n\n* Movies $50\n\n* First Aids/Medicines - $25\n\n* Tithing - $200\n\n**Debts**\n\n* 2011 Corolla - $4k\n\n* Student Loans - $12k\n\n* Credit Card $220\n\n* Amazon Card $220\n\n**About the Debt** \n\nThe credit debts are going to be taken from our pre-budgeted Christmas fund and will be paid for when they show up on our next statements. The Corolla only has 45k miles and has been maintained extremely well, we plan on driving it into the ground. The loan is under her parents from before we were married so it doesn't count towards our DTI Ratio. We are going to pay off the remaining balance at which point they'll gift us the car. The Student Loans vary from 3.5%-5.5% and we plan on aggressively tackling it after we pay off the car. To my knowledge they won't affect our DTI Ratio. \n\n**Plan of Action**\n\n\nI want to get our emergency fund back up a bit but I may put it on the back burner. $5k is fine for 3 months if one or both of us lose our jobs which isn't likely but still don't want to risk being caught with our pants down. \n\nHistorically, we've been able to save pretty well and if we can tuck away $2k/month I think we can have a down payment by April. We'd still need about $5k more for closing costs, but I want to at least have the DP down before starting the Pre-Qual process and seeing what's out on the market. \n\nAs for the home buying part. The homes we're looking at are in the 200k price range at most, but 170k would be more reasonable. Using [this mortgage calc](http://usmortgagecalculator.org/), I've plugged in both 170k and 200k homes with a 5% interest rate, prop tax of the areas and a high PMI rate to come out to mortgage payments of **$1,270** and **$1,500** respectively. Plugging these numbers in to our budget there still looks like there would be enough money available at the end of each month to put to savings/vacation/etc..\n\n**EDIT for TLDR**: Taking home $5300, spending $2200. Looking at homes in the $170k - $200K price range with $1,200 - $1,500 mortgages over 30yrs.

Mailing their Christmas presents got really expensive, plus one year my family had to pay a lot of duty. So now I prefer to use British websites like Amazon.co.uk, Fortnum and Masons etc. For two years this worked really well. This year however, my card was declined on every sale. I had to call the number on the back of the card and get the card validated for overseas use. OK, I have to do that when I travel to see my family anyway, no big deal. Except my card is still declined. It turns out the card company has placed a block on it. Six calls later, I manage to get three of the four sales through, but I am unable to get the last item paid for. The card company says the purchase has to be made within 24 hours of the block being released - well, it was. I know the vendor tried within the 24 hours. I gave up in the end. The card company says that there is so much fraud in international card sales that they just block everything. This seems insane! How can I travel next year, not knowing if I'll have access to my money? Is this a problem just with my bank (Regions) or Visa?

For example, if I ask 'Who do you prefer?' and the options are 'Rudolph' and 'Frosty The Snowman' if 80% of the people select frosty, they will all move on, while the 20% who selected Rudolph will be disqualified. \n\n# Prizes\n\nAll users who answer ALL questions in the majority response will be entered to receive some amazon gift cards :) Each user can only win one gift card.\n\n* x1$25 Amazon GC\n* x5$5 Amazon GC\n* x10$1 Amazon GC\n\n# Who can enter?\n\nIn order to enter, your reddit account must meet the following requirements:\n\n* You must not be on the universal scam list\n* Your account must follow rule 2 of GCX, and have plenty of activity (not sure if you're active enough?

{"id":"3x5o9g","author":"thedenverbookcase","body":"*Sorry in advance for the long details but honestly any advice would be appriciated.*\n\nI have been a small business owner (Amazon and eBay) for about four years.  We are a two partner company and have been talking about hiring a new employee to handle listing our eBay inventory.  \n\nOur debate is that we want a baseline value for how much that employee should be listing per hour (more specifically how much per item) to maintain their own employment and profit the company a fair amount as well (Yes this amount is debatable so feel free to comment on what you believe is a minimum if you would like.  \n\nBased on my four years in business here are a few of the values we are very comfortable using.\n\n- Each hour our new employee will be able to list 4 items per hour (includes pictures, listing and getting items properly inventoried in the warehouse)\n\n- We have a basic calculation we use of 55% (retail value to actual cash value) on listings. This is based on a 66% selling rate overall and netting 82% of the value after online fees. NOTE: If we list a $100 item we expect to see $55 in the bank in the long run which has been calculated over our last 3 years of sales.\n\n- The total cost of employment will be $15 / hr to our company\n\n\nI have a simple calculation that I have used which has been debated by my partner so to avoid swaying anyone's opinions I am not going to list it yet.\n\nMy question (in 2 parts) to anyone with experience in this type of figuring is: **What is the minimum retail dollar value per item our new employee should be listing (which ends up being 4 / hour) and what is an acceptable rate that we should be looking to profit from as a company from their employment**.  \n\nMy experience in the past with unrelated businesses has been between 1.5 - 3.5 times their wages. Also as a side note this person will be responsible for about 2/3 or more of all eBay listings.","name":"t3_3x5o9g","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-12-17 02:41:59","week":51}

{"id":"3x6863","author":"housedreamer","body":"Hi /r/personalfinance!\n\nA little about me, I am 30, male, single, and I recently got a new job that has bumped my salary up quite a bit. Been in a modest apartment for 3+ years. I am pretty happy here but owning my own home is the ultimate dream for privacy, having a garage, being able to work on cars, projects, use power tools, etc.  \n\nI'm interested in buying my first home and was looking for some feedback on whether this is feasible given my financial situation. Looking for a typical single-family detached home in Phoenix with an enclosed garage and no HOA. Here are some details:  \n\n**The Basics**  \nIncome: $46k/year  \nMonthly post-tax income: $2640  \nSavings/Checking: $14k  \nHigh Yield Savings: $14,600  \nEmergency fund: $5,500 (4 months expenses, would like it to be 6)  \nRoth IRA: $30k  \nStocks and cash: $2500  \n\n**Credit Cards**  \nChase Slate MasterCard (opened 01/2007, limit $4,100 )  \nChase Freedom Visa (opened 11/2011, limit $6,000)  \n\nThe Slate card is not used at all at all; the Visa one is a cashback card which gets everything (all bills, rent, etc) on it and pay it off in full every month. Average monthly charges are ~$1800. The essentials (insurance, cell phone, electricity, groceries, gas, and Internet) account for about $1300 of that and the rest is dining out/Amazon/entertainment and travel. Minimum req'd payment is $25/month.  \n\nCredit score: 739 (last checked in Jan 2014 with Credit Karma)  \n\n**Monthly Payments**  \nNo car payment and no plans to take one on. Student loans are paid off (lived at home until I was 27 and worked full-time while attending school). I live a frugal lifestyle and owning a home is a huge dream of mine.  \n\n**Mortgage Calculator**  \nChecked out my credit union's website and based on my salary, their super basic calculator says I can spend $154k to $196k on a house with a mortgage payment of $730 to $920/mo. Median home price in Phoenix is $201,000. I like working with my hands and am not afraid to do a little work on a fixer-upper. I don't need a fully-renovated, HGTV-style place with granite countertops or anything.  \n\nBased on my savings, I feel I could comfortably do $20-25k as a down payment which is short of the $40k (20% down) recommended for a $200k house.  \n\n**My questions:**  \nCan I afford to buy a house up to $200k?  \nIf so, should I wait until I can put 20% down? Is PMI really that bad?  \nMentally, should I be thinking of this as a \"for now\" house or a \"forever\" house?  \nDo I want to buy as much house as I can or keep it reasonable ($140-$180k)?  \nWould it help to post a more detailed breakdown of expenses, DTI ratios, and credit utilization?  \nI haven't even started looking at properties or finding a realtor until I know about how much I can spend.  \n\n**Thank You!**  \nI know there are a dozen of these threads posted every day and it warms my heart that people (who I presume know more about this than me, either from their job or personal experience) are willing to read through these and help out newbs like myself.

The Chase Freedom is offering 10% cash back on Amazon purchases so it'll balance out with eBay's fees.\n\nI want to pay off the Discover card because I don't want to use it anymore.

Keep in mind, I have a 100%, 5.0 star rating through over 3k transactions over 6 months.\n\nThe first one was for a used DVD player. \"I guess I didn't read closely enough, because I thought I was getting a new one, but clearly I was wrong.\" No complaints about the condition... Just that it was used, not new. There were literally *no* offers for new models of this DVD player, so this person had to click a link from the search page that said \"6 *used* from $xx.xx,\" then choose mine, with the condition notes and photos displayed and all, without ever realizing they were buying a used device. Not to mention that the price paid was only about 30% of MSRP.\n\nThe second one complained that *both* the first *and* second discs stop playing about 3/4 of the way through. *Both of them??* Seriously? They bought a light-up star to hang in their window for Christmas. Absolutely no discs or DVDs whatsoever.\n\nThird, they \"thought I was buying a DVD, but I guess it was a VHS.\" Just like all (most?) of you, I am not approved to sell DVDs.

{"id":"3xa7a6","author":"katecruel","body":"I have receipts for everything except for garage sales. I do have the date/time/what was spent, however, recorded in a book. I specialize in selling media and antiques. This is my first year in the business.\n\nI made a lot of mistakes earlier this year that involved buying a TON of inventory and then only finding a few items in it that were sellable. I also would find defects with the items I was going to send out and would dropship them. But the BIG problem was items that just devalued and I had to donate them because the profit wasn't worth the work I'd have to put in to get them sent out. I was barely breaking even. I've improved it by the end of the year, but I'm concerned that my expenses going into just the inventory part of this will raise a red flag with the IRS. My current inventory value (what I paid for it) THAT HAS NOT YET SOLD for this year is 1692.50. However the inventory itself at the standard market price is valued at about $120,000; this doesn't affect my taxes, right? Amazon deducts shipping fees before it is sent to my bank account.\n\nBut for everything else I can claim as a deduction, correct? And if this is correct, should I expect to be taxed at about 30% on $9,598.74? Currently my \"real job\" only nets me $12,000/year. This is just something I do for a few hours each week.\n\nI am expecting another $4,000 in revenue this month and have put out about maybe $600 more in deductibles.

I work, she didn't, I work from home make $130,000 at regular job with benefits and run a consulting gig on the side and make over $100,000. A client of mine wanted to give me some extra work so I trained my wife and she has started working from home with me. Not much, about 40 hours a month and now she is going to start a $75 per hour gig with another client for maybe 6 months, hopefully she can make a full time job out of it. 2016 seems to be at least as promising as 2015. \n\nhere are our expenses below\n\nPrimary Residence\n\n- appraised - $350,000\n- mortgage balance - $185,000 (26 years left, made additional principal payments)\n- monthly payment $1,900 @ 4.125 \n- refinancing the balance to a 15 year at 3.5 new payment will be $2,350\n\nSecond Home\n\n- appraised $162,000 (this is my plan B for college fund for kids)\n- mortgage balance $85,000\n- monthly mortgage $1,477 @ 5.25 (17 years left, made additional principal payments) \n- refinancing balance of $85,000 to a 10 year at 4.125 - new payment $1,437\n- rental income $1,300 (will increase rent after lease expires to at least $1,400, still have another year)\t\n\nCar Note\n\n- monthly $250.00 \n- balance $10,760\n\nCredit card for business travel and expenses \n\n- balance $17,615 @15.25% (yikes)\n\nSchool Loan (wife - MBA :( )\n\n- $58,000\n\nCredit Card - wife \n\n- balance $18,900 @5.00%\n\n\n\nMonthly Expenses\n\nGroceries \t- $1,000 (family of 5 lots of impulse purchases)\n\nlight\t\t- $350.00\n\nCell phone  \t- $250 (6 devices)\n\nvonage \t\t- $30.00\n\nAuto Ins\t- $163.00\n\nterm life \t- $63.00 \n\nGas\t\t- $300.00\n\nHeat\t\t- $100.00\n\nwater, trash etc- $120.00\n\nEating out \t- $200.00\n\nParents \t- $600.00(we are immigrants, parents still alive, so we are the retirement plan)\n\t\n\nYearly\n\nSchool fees \t- $20,000(we choose to do this as long as we can)\n\nSchool related  - $2,500\n\nVolley ball Club- $5,000\n\nSoccer\t\t- $350\n\nCostco\t\t- $110\n\nAmazon Prime \t- $100\n\nSkype \t\t- $20\n\nClothes\t\t- $2,000\n\nKids Allowance\t- $2,000\n\nvacation \t- $4,000(impromptu)\n\n\nSavings - checked and was able to save about $26,000 thus far in the accounts below, pretax and aftertax\n401k\n\n- $180,000\n- $12,000\n- $80,000\n\nRoth \n- $10,000\n\n529 for kids \n\n- $15,000 ($5,000x3)\n\nRainy Day fund\n$15,000\n\nMerrill trading account \n- $4,200\n\n\n\nRight now, there is $50,000 in the bank and I don't know what the best option is, I hate debt but yet find it a necessary evil.\n\nWe are going to put the max into an IRA for my wife this year, what to do with the balance\n\n\n1. should I pay off all credit cards and debt totaling about $45,000, put the remaining $5,000 in savings and start saving more towards college and retirement next year.\n\n\n2. put the $50,000 in retirement or savings and attack the debt next year?\n\n\n3.

My wife and I usually buy things in multiple expense categories on a single receipt from these types of places.\n\nFor example, at Costco, we might spend $25 on groceries, $25 on clothing, $25 on home goods, and $25 on gift cards. This is a simple example with nice, round numbers for illustration purposes. You can see how this would get more complicated with more categories and real-world numbers. It gets even more complicated when considering taxed and non-taxed items, discounts, and so on.\n\nTarget and I believe Costco receipts are categorized, but it can be a hassle to match them up with the expense categories in our budget. Amazon's invoices and Target's receipts are especially hard to follow sometimes. When we use the Target red debit card, we get a 5% discount on the whole bill. I then have to figure out how the discount affects each line item and then each spending category.  I tried making a spreadsheet that took 5% off each item, but I could never get the line item costs to add up to the receipt total.\n\nI am looking for ways to streamline the process of keeping expense categories separate for budget tracking purposes.

{"id":"3xe2h6","author":"teho22","body":"#What is the /r/Entrepreneur business startup weekend?\nThis is the second version of this project. Here's [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3vffzy/rentrepreneur_low_cost_business_startup_weekend/).  The idea is to group up likeminded, entrepreneurial people so they can put their heads together to actually create a business. This is a great way to gain some experience in starting a business and will give you a chance to network with other entrepreneurs.  Please don’t hesitate to get involved, everyone is here to learn. \n\nThe last time around the problem was there was way too many people looking to join a team and few people with ideas or people looking to start a group. I assume this is probably down to people not wanting the pressure of leading a team so we're this time round we are going to alter and simplify the process a bit. People are going to post ideas they want to work on and if anyone is interested they can reply to that post. Instead of a leader/team format, we're going to instead just have people join groups based on an idea. The $10 cap/requirement is also gone. We'll see how it goes this week and make some changes if neccessary in the new year.\n\n\n\n#Protect your investment\n\n\nTry to establish trust between your group members. A couple of examples of ways you could do this is to share Facebook details or have funds pooled on someone’s account Paypal account that is somehow able to prove they are trustworthy. It should go without saying that you should be cautious of someone posted from a 1 day old reddit account. **Using bank transfers and Western Union is always ill advised as it is hard to recover stolen funds**. Please remember that it is entirely up to you to protect yourself and **I, /r/entrepreneur nor reddit take any responsibility for your losses**.\n\n\nThis is a great opportunity for us all to learn but it requires everyone to pull their weight and not abandon their team at the first hurdle. The project may not go as smoothly as planned but please try to at least see it through until the end and don’t let your teammates down. Remember that you learn more from failure than you do success so you will just be better prepared for next time.\n\n\nWith that being said, we can get down to business. \n\n#Post an idea you want to work on and find people to work with you\n\nWhat we need is people that have an idea that they want to work on.  If that's you just leave a post using the template that follows and hopefully you will have some people want to jump onboard.\n\n\n##Your idea post template\n\n&gt; \n&gt; **Idea**: *eg \"Nerd t-shirt store\"*\n&gt; \n&gt; **Additional information**: *A bit more information on what you are looking to create. What skillset (if any) do you think the project requires. A bit about yourself if it's relevant*\n\n##Looking to join a group post template (**reply to idea posts only**)\n\n\n\n&gt; **Skill set**: *Don’t underestimate your abilities. Example skills: writing, sales, web design, research, languages, graphic design, marketing, social media. Give some thought about what you can bring to the table, you never know what niche skills people are looking for!*\n\n&gt; **Additional information**: Anything else you would like to add\n\n\n\n\nOne short example of how a group could form:\n\n&gt; “I’m Mr Thompson, an experienced web developer that believes there is a large market of mom and pop stores that would be willing to pay hundreds for a single page brochure Wordpress website. I could produce these in only a couple of hours but I lack the ability to sell so I am looking for someone with experience in sales. Also, while I have no problem making the website itself, writing isn’t my strength so I am looking for someone to produce the written content required for these websites. My time zone is GMT + 6.  We will do all of our communication in a Skype group chat. Any questions?”\n\n&gt; &gt;  “I’m Mr Smith and have 5 years sales experience and am confident to cold call but how will we get the details of these stores?”\n \n\n&gt; &gt;\t“I’m Mr Hank, an unemployed English major who would be happy to write content as long as I’m getting $20 per 500 words.”\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\t“Hey guys I’m Jimmy and don’t have any notable skills but a lot of free time. I’m happy to find businesses that don’t have an online presence for you but I would also expect a cut of the commission. “\n\n\nSome ideas of projects that shouldn't be overly challenging/are popular on this subreddit:\n\n- T-shirt selling business\n- Amazon affiliate website\n* E-commerce (create website and business plan. Stock your goods after the weekend)\n* Subscription box\n* Youtube channel\n* Graphic design service\n* Custom PC building service\n* Drop shipping website\n* Online tutoring\n* Outsourcing any service\n* Virtual assistant service\n* [**loads more ideas**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tpnsy/how_do_you_make_money_on_the_side/) \n\n\n# Resources:\n\n**[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com)** – One option is to create a business account and pool your money on there. I believe you dispute payments quite easily on Paypal which will provide you with some protection. I’m not entirely sure though and you will be limited on what you can spend your money on so don't just take my word for it, do your homework.\n\n[**Shopify - How We Built an Ecommerce Business from Scratch and Generated $922.16 in Revenue in 3 Days**](https://www.shopify.co.uk/blog/34526469-how-we-built-an-ecommerce-business-from-scratch-and-generated-922-16-in-revenue-in-3-days)\n\n[**Google start up weekend**](http://startupweekend.org/) - Google host their own startup weekends, you might be able to learn something from here\n\n[**Some free Wordpress themes**](http://wpthememag.com/2015/free-wordpress-themes-2015/)\n\n[**Slack**](http://www.slack.com) - a team collaboration tool.\n\n[**Skype**](http://www.skype.com) - cheap calls around the world and easy to use group conversations.\n\n[**Top /r/Entrepreneur/ posts of all time**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) a lot of good detailed threads written by people have had success with their start-ups.\n\n[**Namecheap**](http://www.namecheap.com) - the most commonly recommended domain registrar.\n\n[**Google.com**](http://www.google.com) – the most important tool in your toolbox, don’t forget it.\n\n[**Reddit thread on how people have made some money on the side**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tpnsy/how_do_you_make_money_on_the_side/) loads of good business ideas.\n\n**[teespring](http://www.teespring.com)** - cheaply allows you to start t-shirts without the need to stock anything.\n\n**[Printful](https://www.theprintful.com/)** - another drop shopping styled website that allows you to design and sale goods without ever having to deal with stocking or shipping.\n\n**[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)** - create online shop. 14 free trial.\n\n**[Shopify drop shipping guide](https://www.shopify.com/guides/dropshipping)** \n\n\n\nIf you have any other resources that you think would be helpful then let me know and I will edit them in. \n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3xe2h6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-18 22:04:53","week":51}

That sounds very far out but he has thought so far ahead and to calculate the launch schedules needed to make populating Mars viable.    \n\n**[Smarter Than You Think](http://smarterthanyouthink.net/)**\n\nThis is a good book showcasing how technology is enabling those you who use it in new and creative ways to work and think more efficiently.\n\n \t\n**[Screw Business as Usual](http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/books/screw-business-as-usual)**\n\nI am a big fan of Richard Branson and in this book he showcases how he has been disruptive to the establishment while at the same time being ethical and environmentally friendly.  He touches on social issues and creative ways he has solved those issues. \n\n**[The Go Giver](http://www.thegogiver.com/)**   \nThis short book by Bob Burg is a story driven book about a fictional character named Joe who is working hard to be more successful but seems to keep falling short.  Joe is introduced to Pindar &amp; he introduces Joe to a series of successful “go-givers”.  This book showcases the power of connecting with other successful people and show their willingness to help.\n\n\n\n\n**I listen to a lot of podcasts mostly IT industry related but there are are good for business**\n\n**[The Art of Charm](http://theartofcharm.com/)** \n\nThey have some great topics on self growth or just ways to handle life situations.

{"id":"3xj6hh","author":"mmedlen2","body":"Alright. So I'm new to the whole the FBA thing. I've been doing eBay for a while so I'm pretty comfortable reselling items but feel really out of the water with FBA.\n\nMy issue is that I sent my first batch of shipments into their warehouses last week. Two out of the four were received with no problems. One of the shipments was marked delivered but none of the items were scanned in. I waited the 3 days and then filed a reconcile request for the shipment. Amazon paid me full retail for the items and everything was well. But now my fourth shipment is hitting the three day mark and nothing has been received into inventory.\n\nMy question is if this is ordinary for FBA or am I just having bad beginner's luck? I feel like they should have no problems receiving my items. Maybe it's because it's Christmas and they're backed up, but I feel like I really don't want to be a part of a platform that has serious issues with their business.\n\nHas anyone else had these issue? Another question I had was that when I filed for a reconcile they asked for an invoice for an item I bought from a thrift store. They wanted the receipt to show the title of the item, but alas, the thrift store doesn't show the titles on the receipt. Seriously, wtf I am supposed to do with that.\n\nSorry if this came off as a rant but I'm just really frustrated with sending off my product to Amazon and then not knowing if they're going to lose or misplace them.\n\nThanks for you input and happy holidays.","name":"t3_3xj6hh","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-20 02:57:55","week":51}

Yes, I have made mistakes. I have bought bad stock and paid for things I didn't need, but that's how you learn.\n\nIn the run-up to Christmas, I have been buying about 1,000 individual items a week. I quickly ran out of space at home so I rented a self-storage unit. It's only used for interim storage while I apply the FBA labels over the barcodes and pack them into boxes.

It means that I can print out inventory labels and UPS shipping labels anywhere I go. If I buy 20 boxes of something, I don't even need to take them to storage now. I can just print out some shipping labels and send them directly to Amazon (and pay them £0.15 an item to label them at the fulfillment center).\n\nThey are about £250 ($400) to buy new, but I bought mine from an IT Recycler on eBay.\n\nFor the £70 ($130) investment in this little printer, it's really changed how I work and I would recommend it to that anyone who buys large quantities of stock for FBA.","name":"t3_3xlid5","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-20 18:34:08","week":51}
{"id":"3xm5ui","author":"nobhed","body":"**Surveys**\n\nPrizeRebel has a lot of potential for you to earn a good portion of money over time, and surveys are one of the reliable ways to earn easy points everyday. \n\n**[Here is an idea of how much you can earn in 2 hours per day](http://i.imgur.com/YQYvxgq.png)**\n\nI have used PrizeRebel for more than 4 years ([it used to look like this!](http://i.imgur.com/xJwebkm.png)) and would like to share my method of completing surveys in the most efficient way. \n\n[Referral](http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=posh4josh) | [Non-Ref](http://www.prizerebel.com/)\n\n---\n\n**Guide to PrizeRebel Surveys**\n\nSurveys on PrizeRebel usually take 5 to 15 minutes to complete, and earnings take another 2 to 15 minutes to be added to your account (depending on which provider you choose - some are instant!). \n\nBut once you learn the basics and get used to them, it'll take you half the time to finish each survey, **[and your earnings would start to look like this](http://i.imgur.com/yj6kEuR.png)** in less than 2 hours with just surveys. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**1) Firstly, you're going to want to start with the easier, more reliable surveys and reap the rewards from them straight away.** \n\nMousing over \"Earn\" and clicking on \"Surveys\" now [takes you to this updated page](http://i.imgur.com/O1Rqhbg.png), where I recommend that you do the \"Your Surveys\" and \"OpinionWorld\" surveys as both of them can be done 4-5 times a day and award 60-85 points for each one. \n\nYou can then move on to other survey providers and try to squeeze some extra points from them. In my example I will be doing a survey with \"Your Surveys\". \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**2) You will then want to start profiling yourself in these surveys effectively so that more surveys are available to you.** \n\nIn order to qualify for as much surveys as possible, you should identify as a **Male Aged 24** (birth year **1991**), who works **Part-Time** and has an annual **income of £100,000/$100,000**. Those who work in the **\"Executive Leadership\"** department with the job title **\"C-Level\"** or similar are valued more for their opinions, especially if there are **5000+ employees** at your organization and if it has an annual revenue of **£500/$500 million**. Having a **Degree** for the education level and **owning your house** will also help. \n\n[Here is an example of me qualifying for a survey using \"Your Surveys\"](http://imgur.com/a/RXaMA/layout/horizontal#0)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**3) After being accepted to do the survey, focus on the initial questions that they ask so that you know how to avoid being disqualified whilst doing the survey for not meeting their criteria.** \n\nLearning how surveys work gives you a higher chance to qualify for each survey, as they all have a target audience that they want the survey to be for. Therefore, carefully reading the first few questions will prove worthwhile as they usually hint at the type of people they want. This allows you to change your responses accordingly. Once they start asking you questions about products surrounding the topic they gave you, then you have already qualified and the rest is purely based on your opinion. \n\nFor example, the [pre-qualification asked me this question](http://i.imgur.com/k8Z0ufG.png) which clearly hints at a target audience of gamblers, so my response is that I am a gambler. When I am redirected to the actual survey, I use this knowledge to [say that I do not work at gambling industries](http://i.imgur.com/imn5fm8.png). This is important as **they do not want people who are influenced by their job to do their surveys**. [You then apply the same principle further](http://i.imgur.com/57E2AV5.png) and state that you are interested in gambling (or whatever topic that their survey is based on).

{"id":"cxy7yd7","author":"doogie88","body":"There are some equations I'm sure, but I've been doing this for over 15 years, I kinda just 'see' it. Plus I'm confident I can outrank most sites, so I don't let competition stop me.\n\nThe first thing you need is to make sure people are searching for it. I'm going to type up somethign shortly, but Google Adwords keyword planner shows you how many searches per month a keyword gets. Then simply do a search in Google and take a look at the top ten results. Pretty much if you're not in the top three you're screwed, and goal should always be going for #1 (in most cases, I'll explain a bit at the end). Shitty thing is, with Google, is they are pushing out all the small sites and want the big shots to be at the top, Amazon, Wiki, etc etc. And Google is giving them so much power, it's getting hard to outrank them. It's quite frustrating. So if you have a keyword and see sites liek Amazon, Wiki taking up the top five spots, you're pretty scewed, you will more than likely not outrank them unless you're crazy good at SEO. I took it as a challenge with a site I have with a big keyword, and I'm currently sitting #6 on a site that is a year old. It's a long term goal, but I doubt I'll be able to do it. But that's just to check for that specific keyword and how hard it is to rank at the top. But you also have to take a look at the strength of the page listed. For example \"Word War II\" for wiki wll probably have hundred if not thousands of links form other sites referencing it. Thus making the page very 'strong'. While something like \"turkish cotton\" (doesn't even have a wikipage, just using it as example) wont' have a ton of links. So although Wiki is strong, that specific page wont' be as strong as WW II page. I have the MOZ addon for firefox. And when you search for something it will give you the DA and PA. DA is domain authority, so it's the overal 'power' of the site, while PA is for that page. So if no one has linked to that page it will be lower, but if a ton of people linked to it, it will be high. This took is also good to see the DA of the other search results, because even though you've never heard of it, it may be a crazy strong site. ie You see wiki at the top but no recognizable sites. But then you see site xxxxx.com with a DA of 90, it's a powerful site even though you've never heard of it.\n\nAnother way to check competition is putting the keyword in quotations in Google and see how many results come up. \"Turkish Bath Towels\" has 145,000 results. That means there are 145k sites that have that exact term on a webpage. That's actually pretty low. \"ipone cases\" for example has 18,000,000.\n\nSo the thing is, you may have found a keyword that gets 10,000 searches per month, but there's a ton of competition for it. But you might find a keyword that gets 1600 searches per month, but not a lot of competition for. You may not get rich from it, but it's a lot easier to rank, you may making $500-$2000/month from it. Compared to busting your ass and getting nothing from the 10,000 keyword site. I ranked in the top 5 for a keyword that got 600,000 searches per month. I got barely any traffic. Why? Because the top couple sites were so branded for that keyword, that people stopped at the first two results and looked no further.\n\nThere are free keyword tools out there, there is also the keyword tool in adwords that helps you find related key words. And there are paid programs. You need to be creative and find the keyword that is popular but not too much competition. OP is a good example. Bath towels is crazy hard, turkish bath towels is a little easier. But you may find 'cheap turkish bath towels' and even better keyword to target. It takes a lot of time and a lot of work, but it pays off in the end. I have numerous saved spreadsheets with keywords and their searches on it.  What I do is make a site, and without looking too spammy, create pages/sections for all the top keywords. And I'll try and add some of those keywords to articles I make. There are paid programs out there that will help you find keywords, show you the searches, competition, difficulty of ranking, etc. Kinda expensive. I never got much out of it, but I know how to do a lot of this stuff, but for someone new $100 might be a good investment.\n\nI hope that helps a bit, I'm going to type somethign else up shortly as well.\n\n** Wanted to add to the end but forgot. Long tail keywords is another thing. These are even smaller keywords you may target or your aticle picks up and ranks for. Using OP, it might be \"cheap towels from Turkey\". Well this keyword might only get searched 100 times a month, but could be really easy to rank for. If you're ranking number one for it, you could easily pickup a handful of sales every month from that one keyword.","name":"t1_cxy7yd7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-14 03:39:04","week":51}

{"id":"cxypogy","author":"ciabattabing16","body":"You're correct, a lot of students use these for school related expenses.  But the rub is, how much is optional?  It's very situational, but in a lot of cases, you can get a job either on campus or in surrounding towns, part time, and bring in some money to off-set those costs.  Does it make sense to do it?  I'd argue it does, because even if you're making minimum wage, if you can pay things out of pocket, you're saving the cost of the item plus 7% in interest on that item.  On a long enough time scale, that's a gain. It's tough though.  I definitely couldn't have done it without the healthy credit card limit I had.  But I also didn't have the advantage of a higher minimum wage and Amazon (amazon was a thing, but not nearly as popular as today).  However, I also wasn't forced to stay on campus after my freshman year, and the costs of room/board more than tripled for the dorms just in my tenure alone, vs off campus which saved me significantly.  I also would keep some of the refund, front the costs for things like rent with it, but then actually pay it back over the semester.  So, like a short term loan in a sense.  \n\nI consider those secondary costs one of the misconceptions sold to younger people.  They're told \"go to school, put anything related to it on loans, and focus on the education\".  False.  Way false.  Go to school put your tuition on loans, and pay everything else out of pocket.  If you're working full time in the summer, and at minimum part time during the year, it's a stretch, but you should be able to swing a large portion of it.  It's not easy, by a long shot.  You'll have to work all summer.  You'll have to miss parties, you'll have to skimp on food and clothes and other items.  But it pays off, and if you're at work, you're not out spending money.\n\nAll of that though is very situationally specific, but in general, if you HAVE to have loan money for everything (tuition, books, room, board/food, vehicle expenses, misc expenses ) to survive, you're doing something wrong.  You can't just live 100% off of loans the entire time.  I think that's the area that students get screwed over.","name":"t1_cxypogy","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-12-14 16:26:33","week":51}

{"id":"cxyqrtf","author":"withervein","body":"Things that will reduce your expenses once the baby arrives:\n\n* Feed yourself well and nurse as much as possible. Get your free breast pump, all ACA insurance is required to provide one and many will provide a decent double electric pump. Pump in the early days to build a stash. Lansinoh bags will be given out as samples and freebies, but they cost twice as much as the grocery store's brand.\n\n* If you have reliable access to a washer/dryer, consider cloth diapers. 2-3 dozen good quality cotton prefold diapers and 4-6 waterproof covers will keep a butt clean, dry and covered and up your laundering by 2 loads per week. If you don't get drawn into designer covers (seriously, its a poop catcher) you can have more than enough in each size for less than $500 for the whole diapering period from NB to toddling. Considering disposables can cost up to $1500 a year, this is worth considering. It's not that hard. My husband is surprisingly good at keeping up with it when I can't.\n\n* Your hospital will stock your baby with basic linens, disposable diapers, wipes, etc. Bring an empty diaper bag or two with you and let them restock you over and over. Your insurance pays for it, so use it. \n\n* Sign up for samples and coupons on formula, diapers, etc. Even if you only save it for emergencies. My supply is starting to dwindle at 6 months, and the sample formula is starting to look like it will be needed now.  \n\n* While Amazon Prime seems like a big money saver, I'm not finding it that useful for baby products. The amazon brand wipes are about the same price as all the others available and the store brand ones from the grocery store are just as good and even cheaper. Amazon also costs more for baby food like purees, even if you get it on a subscription. \n\n* Check for used equipment/furniture. Second hand toys will save you hundreds. Check church rummage sales, yard sales, consignment, etc. Once upon a Child is big in our area, but local mommy groups and church sales have been much cheaper for just-as-nice items. If you aren't planning on a second child soon, take care of and resell any large items you have that are gently used. Asking 1/3 of what you paid is fair. If someone wants more than 1/3 of the cost of new, keep looking. There is a ton of gently used baby gear out there and you'll find someone who's not being too greedy or wants it gone soon enough.\n\n* Don't buy a single stitch of clothing for your baby. If you have a reasonable amount of family/friends near by you can pretty much expect everyone else will do it for you, especially if you have a girl. There's something weird about women and the need to play dress up with another woman's daughter.\n\nMy most expensive purchases were the car seats and second most has been copays for well-baby visits. We hit the out of pocket max during my pregnancy and she was born right before a new plan year hit. \n\nBest of luck!

Identity Theft and credit card fraud balloons out of control and destroys online commerce.\n\nThat's simply not true. You can have *difficult* encryption which is not *hard or strong encryption.* \n\nThis allows for certain types of transactions and communications to be executed securely in real time, but which would become insecure over time. However, any information gleaned from them could be come useless other than say, that a certain transaction was for $32.34 and occurred between X person and Amazon. So what? If you want to dedicate the resources necessary to break that encryption and sell the metadata, fine, go for it. But the authorization keys need no longer be valid.\n\nThere is absolutely a middle ground between seamless backdoors, and hard encryption, which allows nation State actors the ability to decrypt communications when necessary and important.\n\nFurthermore, the State losing it's ability to investigate, to enforce its laws, to search these communications on a broad scale, is an existential threat to the State, meaning virtually any level of response is reasonable— including fundamentally breaking the internet if necessary.\n\nWhat I am saying is not stupid or uneducated— it is based on a different set of priorities, mainly the priority that the State should be and needs to be the most powerful entity in a given area. In many parts of the world that is not the case, and I do not want it to lose what little power it has left in the US.\n\nStopping strong encryption will go a long way toward enforcing the supremacy of State power over corporations.

I had been charging my subscription to one of my BoA BBR cards, but once Amazon Allowance came around I didn't need that recurring charge anymore so I bought about 6 months worth of Spotify gift cards at a grocery store. Fast forward to 5 months ago and my last gift card expires, so Spotify goes back to charging my BoA BBR card. I had forgotten about it but no big deal, I go in my options and change the payment card to my Citi Double Cash. Fast forward to 2 months ago and I notice my BoA BBR card is still being charged instead of my Citi DC, even though the credit card shown on the payment page in my account is indeed the Citi DC. I contact the Spotify support and they tell me they don't know what's going on and the Citi DC should have been charged, but I could try cancelling my subscription and subscribe again. I did that right away, but a few days ago I was charged on my BoA BBR card *again*.\n\nNow it's not a big deal since I'm only losing 2% cashback (about 20 cents a month), and eventually I might go back to buying gift cards anyway, but it's still bothering me and I want to fix it. What should I do?\n\nSince I've already tried the Spotify support, I was thinking of just disputing the transaction on my BoA BBR. Technically I didn't authorize the transaction, however I'm not being double charged (there is nothing on my Citi DC) so I'm afraid that Spotify will suspend or close my account if I dispute the transaction. I have a bunch of playlists so I'd rather avoid that. On the other hand, since my card isn't in my profile anymore they might not make the connection and I could be getting free premium Spotify.

What do I like about ToM that was lacking on your website?  \n  \n-quality discounts for quality products  \n  \n-simple/lower # of products so I dont get overwhelmed.  \n  \n-there's actually stuff I want. Things like a super well designed knife holder (on sale), cool leather boots (on sale), etc.. Whereas, on your site.. I don't need a \"digital remote bottle opener\" \"jerky crafting kit\" \"glow in the dark mini put kit\". Do people actually want this stuff? Maybe it's just me? Maybe there's an opportunity to simplify your offerings by just getting rid of the products no one purchases.  \n\nJust curious, do you have data that shows you the % of visitors if they're unique or repeat? Are your repeat visitors declining? \n\nHopefully this insight helps!\n\nLastly, I'll just comment that E-commerce is very difficult because of the incumbent being Amazon. That being said, Amazon doesn't have much curation and specialize around a single product vertical. That's where your website comes in, and it does a great job specializing in \"unique\" products.

{"id":"cxzgml8","author":"ak921","body":"First off, congrats on putting so much extra into each debt over the minimum payments. You're definitely making steps to get yourself out of this. \n\nI recommend doing some further research on The Snowball Method and the Avalanche Method for paying off debt. They each have their benefits, and you can pick whats' for you. Based on your question about what is most cost effective, plus the fact that all of your debts are roughly equal in size and don't benefit from the Snowball Method as much, I would recommend the Avalanche Method.\n\nThe Snowball method goes something like this. You pay the minimum payment on each debt, and throw all the extra you can at the smallest loan. This will get paid off quickly since it's the smallest. Then, you take the minimum payment from the loan that has been eliminated + any extra, and apply it to the next smallest loan, and so on, and so forth. The monthly payments toward one single debt will get bigger and bigger, and you will eliminate each line of debt faster and faster. This has a largely psychological component. It's nice to see these lines get eliminated, and your monthly payment never increases(or decreases), you just reallocate where it goes.\n\nThe Avalanche Method focuses on the interest rates and lowering the longterm cost of your debt. This doesn't have as much of a psychological motivator built in unless you really dive into the math, but definitely saves more money. If you're already motivated, this may be for you. (Also since you specifically asked the most cost effective way) You start with the highest interest rate and work downwards. So... in terms of priority, you'd structure it like this...\n\n1. Avant Personal Loan (34%) \n2. Amazon.com (26%) (deferred until June-Aug 2016)\n3. Barneys New York (24%)\n4. Capital One Quicksilver (23%)\n5. Barclay Apple Rewards (23%) (Deferred until April 2017)\n6. Chase Freedom (19%) (Deferred until July 2016)\n\nBasically, keep making your minimum payments to each, but throw any and all extra at that Avant Personal Loan until it's paid off, then you move onto Amazon. Rather than spreading your payments equally across all of your debts as you have been, you pick one and aggressively tackle it until its gone. By going highest interest downwards, you'll save $ this way as well.\n\nIn the case where you have deferred interest, if you get to #2 or #5 before the interest kicks in, it may be best to move onto the next debt. However, once the interest payments start, you would return back to it, as the higher interest now takes rank.\n\nI haven't run the numbers, so I'm definitely susceptible to correction here, but that's my quick evaluation of how to go. \n\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, all of your interest rates are extremely high. Your best bet may be consolidation or a balance transfer, I'm just not too familiar with them, so hopefully someone else can chime in.","name":"t1_cxzgml8","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-15 05:48:16","week":51}

{"id":"cxzkprc","author":"M240G","body":"[Kodi](http://kodi.tv/about/) started as Xbox Media Center (XBMC) back when Microsoft looked the other way as the modding scene worked over the original xbox turning it into the cheapest gaming and streaming machine available.  Since then it has evolved into the ultimate streaming application.  Combined with the limitless options for [Android TV hardware](https://www.wish.com/geek/m/search/kodi) and you can get exactly the experience you are looking for at the best price.  So imagine Netflix only with a massive plugin repository providing access to every shred of streamable content in the world.  It's what Plex wanted to be when it grew up instead of a severely limited sellout mess.  The plugins encompass everything from live Television streams for every channel in nearly every country and every radio station to on demand TV and Movies + Music.  I love it because I can access content that can't be purchased anywhere since nearly every Television show and Movie ever made is available (I spent 6 hours digging through the very well organized TV shows by decade ... everything ever made ... let that sink in).  For paid services I like Amazon Video best since you get a library comparable to Netflix of streaming content with a prime membership and can then rent or purchase anything outside of it providing for a seamless experience, but there is content that is impossible to find outside of bootleg dvds ripped from VHS on ebay and Kodi completely fills in that gap.  Since you can load the Kodi app on any android, windows, mac or Linux machine it is easily loaded onto any device.  Amazon Fire TV (not the stick) has arguably the best hardware for the money and Kodi runs beautifully on the first run.  It's a bit of a memory hog with the default settings so having access to 2 Gigs of RAM is helpful in the beginning but as you delve into the plethora of configuration options you will see that every aspect can be tweaked to suit your hardware configuration.  This is why I hear \"But Now Chromecast allows me to search for things ..\" and I want to cry as people waste their money on yet another hollow Google project with no plans for implementing features (they love to make something and then abandon it ....

{"id":"cxzrch3","author":"ClintHour","body":"Here's my thoughts, I'm long TSLA:\n\n1. Agree with you completely. But, and a big BUT, this isn't the 1980/1990s anymore. Companies aren't strictly valued based on their balance sheets, their dividends, nor their total asset breakdown value. Similarly, TSLA is no longer valued as a traditional vehicle company, just as Amazon and a variety of other companies and unicorns are not valued as a traditional companies. I'll be direct, if there's a formula, I don't know it. All I can see is that it's a mix of the estimated potential flying in tandem with human psychology. Yes, everyone know's it's quite definitely overvalued by traditional estimates. That being said, this point, in the current environment, doesn't hold substance.\n\n2. Competition is exactly Tesla's aim, as MrTesseract, has stated. But it has to be remembered as well, everyone thought this was a crazy idea in the beginning. Now, competition is only validating Tesla's existence. And just like that, Tesla has CREATED a market for itself. They are the brand. THE Brand. In both image and luxury this is everything. I know the Apple references are overdone, but when it comes to competition, Tesla is the Apple of of the EV auto industry. Added (and partially open to varying opinions of the future costs), Tesla is already making their mistakes. This is a good thing, as growing pains should be assumed to be present in any company. Tesla is now probably 5 years (my judgement) ahead technologically than any other EV maker, in brand/image, in products, and in reputation.\n\nWhen you say Apple, you do have a good point. Competition against that brand, as my above example suggests will be fierce. But if you're short, you're likely looking for short-term gains. I don't believe you'll have them in the next half a year with likely high sales figures (as December is best month for luxury cars), potential congressional legislation (their grants very likely aren't going anywhere; more probably coming), and the build-up to the long-awaited Model 3. Note, I said build up. I couldn't know what would happen after the reveal.\n\n3. Around that time, October, earnings were clearly in focus and were hotly expected to not be good. Added, and very importantly, oil was also falling. This point of yours hotly banks on institutions leaving Tesla by the way-side. As evident by #2 above and the brand, this isn't happening. They would have to REALLY fail, worse than a Model S catching on fire...\n\nThe home battery program has yet to even start, but there are some businesses signed on, along with individuals. The climate deal (regardless of opinions) will at least shed a little more light on the value, as evident by the current congressional debate. There can be more expected deals with regards to the battery coming soon. I'm personally anticipating news with regards to India (depending on how the dialogue with Modi went) and curious about Tesla's penetration method in Germany.\n\nAlso of note, Tesla's network of chargers is more robust by the month. Although gas prices are no longer of notable savings, the sheer ease and availability these gives credence to the brand and, and most importantly, to the idea. To be able to stop at one of those and recharge, now that's keeping up with the Jones'. How many brands have done that lately?\n\nI anticipate Tesla will meet their delivery figures with appreciation to high WORLD demand, a 5-star crash-test rating on the X, forthcoming battery news, forthcoming global solar power-based news, and high Model 3 anticipation. It's high-minded to estimate a price, but I'm thinking it'll high 260~280 soon; it's wishful thinking but hoping for 310.\n\nShort case: Tesla needs more money for all the stuff they're doing. They issue more stock; the idea alone hits home to investors (dilution) but this leads to a down-trodden depreciation in value. :/\n(note: I think this is the best anti-argument, but open to thoughts)\n\nI don't mean any of this negatively against your short case, just giving my thoughts as a long.

You may be able to increase your margin that way and start to build a community without having to jump right to creating product inventory yourself. \n\nAmazon might not play that game, but some of your smaller affiliates could.

This is inherently more complicated than having a stocked warehouse (in their most simplistic delivery model) of inventory and delivering it straight to a customer based on the fastest parcel option selected for delivery.  That's a two tiered model, they are now dealing with a three tiered model: Restaurants, Customers, Couriers.\n\nAdditionally, each restaurant is unique to the next.  Each has fixed or different menus, a different level of crazy as it pertains to a chef and staff, daily changing menus, etc.  Then, you have food prepared incorrectly, missing utensils or sauces, poor temperature of food, etc.\n\nOnce all of that is taken into consideration, now you have to figure out what is the most efficient way to deliver hundreds of orders during peak times (such as lunch and dinner) with X amount of couriers based on a city's landscape.

What is the quickest path to delivery and can that courier handle more than one delivery at a time?\n\nI have no doubt in my mind Amazon will be good in this business as they are a logistical monster and are extremely efficient at moving product quickly and pair that with impeccable customer service.

I've tried continuous ink refill systems, off brand refills, refill stores, and now I DIY my refills.  The best advice I can give you is to check Amazon reviews!\nIn my case, I had to make sure firmware updates were turned off on my printer because the updates checks for off brand cartridges and permanently disable the printer if they find them.  I also found out that sometimes the printer won't recognize the cartridge, and I needed to remove and replace it. Once, it took almost a dozen times before the printer recognized the cartridge and if I hadn't read the reviews, I would have sworn off ink forever.\nI've bought ink from ebay and Amazon, and both are great, although I have a preference for Amazon because I learned about the firmware issue in the reviews.  The kits come with a needle that is missing the injector part - completely usable, but so much nicer with the needle. Find a diabetic friend and get one of their needles, the needle part of the injector makes everything so much neater and easier to use, although I still refill over the sink wearing old clothes.

There isn't much in the way of awards hotels there so we are looking into a resort or possibly 2 (one inland and on the islands). My fiancée and I are both able to apply for cards with credit scores ~780. We already have flights handled through the SW companion pass so at this point I just want to get the cost of eating, sleeping and excursions as low as possible with points. \n\nMe:\n\n* Discover IT\n* Chase Freedom &amp; CSP (25,000 pts)\n* Chase Ink Plus (new, waiting on 60k bonus to post, will have 85,000 UR pts after this)\n* Citi Thank you Preferred\n* Chase IHG (53,000 pts)\n* Chase Amazon\n* Chase Marriott (73,000 points)\n* Arrival Mastercard (product changed from Arrival+…should I cancel this and churn to a new Arrival+)? First applied for Arrival+ on 9/7/2014, PC to no-fee Arrival on 9/1/2015.\n\nHer:\n\n* Discover IT\n* Chase Freedom (counted her points with mine)\n* Chase Amazon\n* Chase SW Premier &amp; Plus (used for companion pass 2015/2016)\n* Amex Hilton (not really any HHonors pts to speak of)\n* Citi Hilton\n\nSo, I have 5 Chase cards (6 with the Ink Plus) and she has 4. I think it’s risky to try and have her get a CSP at this point (she's over 5/24 with the Amex,  citi, and chase SW cards). We should probably both cancel our Chase Amazon cards to free up room for a higher value Chase card. I did see that the Chase UR portal offers excursions in Belize for points but I'm not sure this is the best value redemption. \n\nMy thinking was that we could each apply for a Capital One Venture (40k x2 points to put towards travel reimbursements) and she can also apply for a Barclay Arrival+ (another 40k pts). I could try canceling the Barclay arrival and re-applying for the Barclay Arrival Plus for the 40k again. This would allow us to hopefully reduce the cost of a non-awards stay at a resort or pay for ground transportation and excursions. The resorts require deposits and I hear I can pay that on one card and the rest on another, effectively splitting the bill to redeem miles with two cards.\n\nAlso tagging /u/Vail333 as I've been chatting with him on here about his own Belize trip he's planning for for July 2016.

(Your risk profile isn't affected in this case, only your commission structure.)\n\nIf you let it go approaching expiration with the stock between the call strikes, there's a decent chance they'll contact you on expiration Friday afternoon to suggest you fix it before the close. Depending on the underlying, they may close you out of the trade to prevent being short stock in a retirement account over the weekend. (Not many brokers want to assume the risk of someone being short a large amount of TSLA or AMZN over the weekend in an account the customer can't, by law, shore up. In SPY or with a small position...maybe you get until noon Monday to fix it.)\n\nOf course in a margin account, or with puts, none of that applies, but it does alter the risk profile of the trade if one side gets exercised/assigned and the other expires worthless.

{"id":"cy1prto","author":"jordanwilson23","body":"I visit your site often although I never buy.  You could open up a \"deal\" section and start it simple with 1 deal a day.  These deals could still be on Amazon and you would need to reach out to Amazon sellers to secure these deals.  These sellers would then provide you with coupon codes for your customers.  You can do the same process with Ebay sellers.  If most of your revenue is from Amazon customers clicking through and then purchasing other products on Amazon, I would think your goal would be to have customers coming to your site often and clicking affiliate links.  A simple daily deal may help a bit with this.  There would be plenty of reasons Amazon sellers would offer products at low prices with the top reason being the ability \"rank up\" listings.  Have you ever heard of Amz Review Trader?  May be something you could look at for ideas on how to do your deals.\n\nMy company has sold to deal sites for the last 3+ years and I think your site interest me more than any other of the deal sites.  Almost every deal site is flaming out since they have been watered down so much.  1sale has pretty much gone under, dailysteals is on their way out the door, livingsocial turned into a joke and got bought out by opensky, nomorerack/choxi will most likely not be around a year from now.

If you know what's generally happening to the market from week to week, (M-F 9am-4:30pm ET is when the market is open every week excluding certain holidays) then you will soon be able to start narrowing it down to investments or certain industries you may want to put money in.\n\n2. Talk to smart/wealthy people about what stocks they have money in and what the price has done recently.  Ask questions. Ask them what stocks they are looking into. \n\n3.  When someone gives you a suggestion of a certain company, search the stock and try to see what makes them think this is a good company to invest in.  Look at what the stock has done in the last year, the last 6 months, the last month, the last week.  Read about company news and how this news might effect the price in the future.\n\n4.  Use the stock app on your iPhone.  After talking to others and having several stocks you are interested in learning more about, put them on the top of your dashboard on the stock app.  Also include some large blue chip stocks big corporations on your dashboard (I suggest FB, AMZN, NFLX, and GOOGL/GOOG). \n\n5. Look at the stock app daily.  Read or even read the titles of the news stories attached to the stock on the App.  Try to visualize how these news articles will effect the public's opinion about the company and how it will effect the stock price.  Check back to see if your predictions about the price according to company news were somewhat right.  \n\n6.  Also google and uses other sources to get news about stocks you are interested in.  After several weeks or months of analyzing company news and making predictions about the stock price, when you feel you have a pretty good idea of how stock prices work according to the public's access to information about the company, it may be time to start investing.  \n\n7. Make sure you know how to access and navigate your brokerage account.  Many accounts will have live chat as an option, so you can type in a chat box to a real human and ask questions about how to operate your account.  Live chats can be extremely helpful. \n\n8.  If by now you feel your stock intelligence is somewhat par and a certain stock you are looking at is undervalued (priced at less than it should be) with potential of going up soon according to your analysis of its company news, invest into it. \n\nKeep an eye on your stock and keep searching for new companies that may be lucrative.  Decide which kind of investor you want to be (long term vs. short term) and stay smart when it comes to the American market.  Keep up with innovative news and technology, talk and make friends with others interested in Stocks. \n\nWhat you do after this point is up to you.  Hopefully by this point you will come up with a plan of investing and choosing which new companies you want to invest in.  Maybe you want to sell a certain amount of shares at a certain price and put in another undervalued company.  Or maybe you just want to ignore it and let your wealth accumulate more passively.  Everyone is different, but by taking the first steps to learning about investing, you will come up with a future plan of what to do with your money, whether it is more of the stock market, real estate, or bonds.

You're speculating.\n\n--\n\nDo you remember in a previous thread when I mentioned that you being on the tumblr platform has serious limitations? Well here's a fun experiment that might shed some insight for you but since you're on tumblr it's going to be a somewhat tedious process to complete (whereas if you have a custom CMS it'd be a super quick database query). Here's what you need to do:\n\n- Grab your last month's order report from Amazon in a CSV/excel format\n\n- Go to your site and extract all of the amazon ASIN/ID's from the urls you list on your site - it shouldn't be too bad because you don't have thousands of products\n\n- Cross reference how many times the ASINs that you show on your site sell vs how much unrelated ASINs sell\n\n--\n\nSince you're in a similar niche, you should find that the majority of your sales are coming from unrelated purchases once the user gets to Amazon. It'll probably be around 75% of the sales come from unrelated products that you feature on drunkmall (I'm basing this from what I've seen when talking to similar site owners who've been willing to share details with me).\n\n--\n\nSo what it boils down to is do you want to lose that 75% of unrelated sales in hopes that you can make it up by getting a higher margin on every sale doing dropshipping. Yes, selling a product on your own site does increase user retention, but also keep in mind that it's a long shot that you'll convert at anywhere near the rate Amazon can convert visitors into customers too. \n\n--\n\n**Edit** Okay I've got all I need to end this debate. On shutupandtakemymoney at their footer they have a [live tracker](http://i.imgur.com/NJw0SZ1.png) for how many active users are on the site. Here's the [direct link](http://whos.amung.us/stats/5xm1otvidgds/) to it - at the time of writing this comment they have 86~ users on the site. We have similar tracking on our site with google analytics for real time user data, and while I'm not going to say what our active user number is right now, I will say it's exponentially higher than 86. They'd have to be converting at an absurdly high rate for them to even be close to our level.","name":"t1_cy1xusu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-17 06:27:36","week":51}

At least half of SUATMM's product line isn't even being sold on their direct store, if you notice a lot of the links go outbound to Amazon/ThinkGeek/Etsy/etc so you can't even fully make the argument that people go to SUATMM to buy stuff since they are doing a balancing act between the two business models/they follow the same exact model as us.\n\n&gt;You get more traffic. \n\nExponentially more.

Their conversion rate would have to be unrealistically through the roof for them to even be close to our revenue numbers.\n\n&gt;Their business is doing fine at that level\n\nAgain, what is this based on beyond speculation?

But the higher USD value may also mean that companies from there (Amazon, Apple, Google,..) make less money, as less people outside the US will be able to afford what they sell.\n\nThere are a lot more effects this could have, for instance for developing countries, which borrow money in USD. Or maybe more Canadian goods will be sold, due to the comparatively cheaper CAD (then again what does Canada even make?). \n\nThis is sort of an extreme situation. Bonds can literally only decrease in value right now and same kind of applies for stock markets (flow of free money stops, interest rates go up = less people willing to spend money on stocks). On the other hand, this has been anticipated for long and may already be reflected by the current values.\n\nAutomatic monthly contributions are the best thing you can do.

I shopped the 50% off GAP sale and used my Discover card for an additional 10% off.

{"id":"cy2tg6f","author":"therealsangaman","body":"Hello. I think spending your bitcoin on things you truly want (as opposed to spending for the sake of spending) is a great idea. I assume when you mention Amazon, you are using purse.io which can offer drastic discounts on Amazon. If not you should definitely check it out.\n\nI think purse.io is one of the best uses for bitcoin there is today, and if there are other ways you're currently spending bitcoin that saves you time, trouble, or money (such ways are rare) you should keep doing that. The true value of bitcoin lies in the ways it can reduce transaction costs, increase convenience, and expand the ways that we can use money. It would be a shame if you didn't use your bitcoin to achieve those goals.\n\nAside from the spending question, it seems you have three options for the medium-term future: buy more bitcoin, sit on your current amount, or sell some of your bitcoin and invest the proceeds in something else like stocks. This is a predicament I have found myself in many times. \n\nMy thoughts on the subject is that the right option depends largely on your risk tolerance and your financial security in non-bitcoin assets. First of all, if you (like others including some commenters here) suspect bitcoin is inherently useless or only suited for gambling, then don't put/leave any more than recreational amounts of money into bitcoin. I would disagree with that opinion, but I figure that's a topic better left for other subreddits. \n\nIt's wise to only put money in bitcoin that you are both financially and mentally prepared to lose. If you've followed bitcoin in 2010 and 2012, I'm sure I don't need to tell you the kind of nauseating volatility it can experience. But, on the bright side, bitcoin is uncorrelated with virtually all traditional assets like stocks and bonds in a way that provides meaningful financial diversification and (I believe) offers tremendous upside and potential for gains in the medium term future.\n\nSo, if you have high financial security and risk tolerance, consider buying more bitcoin. If you have low financial security or risk tolerance, considering selling your bitcoin. I do think you should leave yourself with enough to continue your current bitcoin spending habits for the near future, and should you run out you can always buy a little bit more to continue using bitcoin with minimal financial risk. I truly think everyone's situation is different so without knowing more about you, it's up to you to decide.","name":"t1_cy2tg6f","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-18 00:47:32","week":51}

{"id":"cy34ubd","author":"Dragon_Kevin","body":"When I've had to make multiple trips to the bank for something I've always been told to go back to the person I first talked to. So, if you talked to a different person the second time, you may want to go back and try to see the first person you talked to about this. Otherwise, try a different branch and see what they say about it. It would probably also be a good idea to check in with PayPal like the Bank Lady said. \n\nAlso, its always a good idea to know what overdraft protection options are available with your checking account. For example, I had a Regions Bank account that charged a $35 overdraft fee per item, but you could also have it take money from a Savings account or Line of Credit, but there was still a $15 fee for that (looks like Wells Fargo has a similar service to this). \n\nI had a similar event where I got hit with a $70 overdraft fee when I ordered a part from Amazon at 11:30pm on the night I got paid and another transaction sat in the pending section for about a week (there was money in the account for this), when I talked to the bank about it, they pretty much told me that they would have done what I did too, but still expected me to pay the overdraft fees. I soon after moved to a local Credit Union that offered better Checking and Saving accounts, where the checking account came with a small Line of Credit ($100) for overdraft protection. While there wasn't a fee for having to use it, the interest rate is pretty steep in my opinion. It's also good to note that I had other grievances with Regions Bank other than this.\n\nLong Story short, If you can't get Wells Fargo to fix this, perhaps its time to look for a new financial institution. If this is only the first time something like this has happens perhaps just see what your options are and see if you have any other issues with Wells Fargo before changing financial institutions. While its not a hard process, it does take a few months. \n\nI hope this helps.","name":"t1_cy34ubd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-18 06:55:25","week":51}

Until then I'd prefer they invest everything back into the company. Assuming they can stabilize and have the same type of margins as Nike, where 10-11% of revenue ends up as net income they would be able to generate 4-500 million in net income this year, which would put their actual P/E at ~ 36-40.

{"id":"cy4dj6m","author":"TheNo1Yeti","body":"First thing I notice when I land on the page is the \"Supported by Amazon Payments\" part of your header.  As an average consumer I don't need to know this information, there is nothing I can do with this information as it does not benefit me in any way, and it does nothing to provide me added value other than potentially cause confusion due to being attached to your logo header and draw the eye away from the rest of your site.\n\nNext, the email subscription popup.  These are sort of a double edged sword.  On the one hand you need a call to action which I get.  On the other hand it popped up within 10 seconds, covered the entire page, and does not have a clear \"Make this go away\" button.  The \"Thanks but no thanks\" link at the top does not stand out and to be honest, I almost closed the page before I finally noticed it.  The newsletter section at the bottom in the footer is great and I would keep that.  I would just think about instead of the half page pop-up subscriber, move it to the side of the page and have it come in horizontally.  I personally am of the camp that the CtA should never interfere with the normal browsing and usage of a site.  That way lies madness and 1990's pop-up ads about being the 1 millionth visitor.\n\nNext up is the navigation.  The main menu at the top of the header is inconsistent. You have bold and non-bold menu items which should not be mixed like that unless you are using one to signify inactive or current selections and the other to signify possible choices.  As others have said, when moving to a mobile version of the site, the menu button does not actually do anything.  Additionally the site feels like it has way to much white space going on between the various sections.  That coupled with there being no real clear deliminator between sections leaves the site being extremely flat.\n\nAs to the pitch, clarity of landing page, and leading me to other parts of the page; I would say that personally to me the first impression that I get is that this site is about Christmas movies and has little value to me outside of that specific time of the year.  Possibly drop the \"Christmas\" part from the tagline so that it tells me that this is a site for family movies and then have a section that lets me know \"Hey, these are movies specific to this holiday that might be of interest to you.\".  Additionally I don't have any desire to look at a \"Movie Catalog\", though I would be more likely to browse the \"Genre's\" to see what other offerings are available.  Movie Catalog sounds like something Blockbuster orders from each month, Genre's are what I browse through on Netflix or Amazon when I'm looking for a specific type of movie to watch.  The same goes for the Shipping Deals.  That is not a category that I am likely to investigate, especially as the links do not actually do anything.  If when ordering I was advised that there was a deal on shipping, or there was some other call to action such as a carousel at the top that one of the things mentioned in addition to a special movie to direct my attention was specials on shipping I would be more likely to pay attention to it.  \n\nAt this point I feel like I should stop as I have been extremely critical of your site that you most likely put a lot of work and money into.  The majority of my feedback comes from personal experience as a web developer in addition to being what I would hope is an educated consumer.

Why do we see so few manufacturers owning their own injection molding machines? For example, Apple doesn't own its own machines. They don't even own their own factories. So why do they do this? Because these are slim margin businesses where you can get contracts to have it made essentially at cost, and if you do the discounted cash flow of buying and maintaining a machine, it makes no sense. You can contract it out to someone who can do it cheaper. This is pretty close to how airline delivery works. Amazon will incur a lot of costs doing this. The only advantage is what we both mention - control over quality (making sure that deliveries are made on time). In other words, ensuring delivery is so valuable to amazon, they've decided to potentially buy 20 planes. Like I said, this isn't a deal because Amazon has decided to *save* money, this is an investment in their quality of service. 95% of the time, it makes more sense to do things like partnership or contracts to handle things like scheduling and delivery of goods.

Their build quality is pretty exceptional (their design quality is up for debate), and they rarely have delivery issues. Premium brands are a business where backwards integrating makes sense (like Hermes owning their own leather shops in Italy) because they need to control quality. Most retailers don't see enough benefit in owning their own planes. The existing companies tend to do a great job. Amazon is using this to differentiate themselves.\n\nYou can contract out pretty core parts of the company if there is someone with the knowledge, resources, and skill to do it for less. This is not something wrong with business.  This is just financial sense. You assume contracting always means lower quality. To the contrary, it can mean access to higher quality tools and more experienced workers. Look at the alcohol industry.

I was using spreadsheets but that sucks up so much time. Spending $50 a month on InventoryLab was worth it.\n\nMake sure you track mileage correctly. That is one of my largest expenses.
