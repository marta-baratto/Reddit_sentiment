Minimum withdraw is $5, and can be done through Paypal. Gift card choices include Amazon, Starbucks, Gamestop, iTunes, and Target. Target cards are $10 only.\n\nPayment Proof: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iXkgdSp.png\n\nHere are each of the sections offers are grouped in. I make almost everything from the Regular and Email tabs, and suggest checking those out first.\n\nRegular: You visit a website for ten seconds then click an ad. Pays 1.5 cents each for \"focused\" and .5 for \"Standard.\"\n\nEmail: Identical to Regular except the link to the website is e-mailed to you. Pays 1.5 cents each.\n\nView:  .3 cents to open a site for 20 seconds, .1 cent to only load a site.\n\nSearch: You have to google a term and find a specific site they ask for. The ones I have right now are 2.5 cents each; I don't bother with these since there only seems to be two or three a day... and one of them is broken. &lt;-&lt;\n\nSpecial: These are much higher paying (20 cents each) than anything else but I've avoided them since it looks like they involve installing programs and the like. I did do one that was very easy (essentially just visiting a website and clicking an ad the same as if it were a Regular offer) and paid out the 20 cents, but still I'm not too sure about these.\n\nTask: It's Crowdflower tasks. Personally never found these things worth it on any sites.\n\nRadio: You listen to the radio and eventually get a captcha that gives you credits. I haven't even tried this since the credits mentioned are so low and at such long time intervals.\n\nSurvey: The same kind of \"surveys' you see on other sites that are more often than not scams to get your personal info. Haven't touched these and don't intend to try.\n\nLive: Either leave a window open that automatically goes to different websites every minute or so, or \"interact\" with websites in a similar fashion.

So, here they are. Feel free to add anything, and I will be around later to ask any questions. \n\n**Food\/Food Shopping**\n\n**Dinners:**\n\nMake a plan is the best advice I can give. Plan out every meal and write it down. Then, take an inventory of what you have in your pantry, and write down all the ingredients you don\u2019t currently have, that becomes your weekly shopping list. \n\n**Utilize the slow cooker\/freezer meals:**\n\nI plan on using a lot of ground beef, or sausage, or whathaveyou, so I can buy a larger amount of it, and split it up when I get home. After shopping (usually a Friday night, since I get paid on Fridays and I like shopping the DAY I get paid) I chop and divide up foods into gallon-size ziplock bags. Basically, I pre-prep the meals, label them, and then freeze them. I do this so I can just grab one of the bags out of the fridge, plop the contents into the slow cooker, turn it on, and go to work. \n\n**Make it a Game:**\n\nAfter making a shopping list of what I need for the next two weeks (I get paid every two weeks, hence meal planning for that amount of time) I also add a price next to the item on the list, and tally it up. I do this for two reasons: 1. So I am not surprised when I get to the register, and 2. So I can make a game and try to \u201cbeat the price\u201d by finding something cheaper in the store than what I budgeted for. And also, if I know I am coming in under budget, and I see something that I want to impulse buy, I don\u2019t feel guilty throwing it into the cart. Example: I am $14 under budget and I am halfway through my shopping trip, and I see strawberry ice cream for $6 (P.S. When did ice cream get so expensive?!) I throw that in the cart. That is something the whole family will enjoy, but I didn\u2019t budget for or plan on buying. I will still come in under budget. \n\n**Where do I shop?**\n\nFor our food, I exclusively shop at Aldi and Nature\u2019s Best Market. I go to Aldi first because sometimes Aldi\u2019s stock changes and they are suddenly missing something. Nature\u2019s Best is a fruit and vegetable co-op by me. For cheap meat, go to a supermarket (not Aldi, but Ultra or Food 4 Less) a half hour before close. All meat they cannot sell the next day will be on sale for AT LEAST 50% off. Buy that shit and FREEZE IT IMMEDIATELY. It\u2019ll stay good for three months. You can also buy rotisserie chickens for a steep discount right before close. \nAll of our food for two weeks usually comes out to about $160.\n\n**Breakfast and Lunches:**\n\nIn my house, dinners vary (no meal more than once in a month) but breakfasts and lunches I absolutely don\u2019t vary (breakfast: baked pumpkin banana oatmeal \u2013 rarely do I deviate from this, since I pre-make it and freeze it in advance. \n\nLunch: leftovers from dinner, or soup I pre-made and then split up into Tupperware and froze in advance, I also decide at the beginning of each week 3-4 things I will bake, and I bake them on Sunday. \n\nFor lunches, I plan ahead the snackie-side, and put them in their own labeled gallon size ziplock bags. So, it\u2019ll say: \u201cMonday-Husband\u201d, \u201cMonday-Superenna\u201d on the front of them, so I can just grab them and throw them in the cooler or lunch bag. I do all this prep work on Sunday afternoons for the week ahead. Some of the things I put in Husband\u2019s bags are: Yogurt and spoon, pudding and spoon, cookies, chips, string cheese, peanut butter and crackers, brownies, a donut, etc. Also, this way, he doesn\u2019t eat ALL THE SNACKS IN THE HOUSE IN ONE DAY. \n\n**Clothes:**\n\nI almost exclusively shop at second-hand stores for my clothes.. Here\u2019s my rules for second-hand clothes shopping:\n\nALWAYS BUY BANANA REPUBLIC, especially if it is too big for you. Banana Republic has some of the BEST clothes out there, they last the longest, and they always look \u201csharp\u201d (if you know what I mean.) Buy them larger than you think you need, because their sizes run a little small. \n\nThat brings up my next point: When thrifting, always go larger than you need, and tailor it to your body. Nothing \u2013 and I mean nothing \u2013 looks better than a properly tailored dress shirt. I tailor everything to fit my body. I plan a night around it, break out the sewing machine, and go to town. \n\nNote: I live currently in a rich area, and rich people do get rid of nicer stuff. I recommend going to a rich area to get better quality clothes.\n \nOther rules to live by when thifting are: Never buy underwear, tights, hats, shoes, scarves. Really, anything that touches the face or head, feet, or crotch. Wash the clothes when you get them home, before everything else, EVEN IF THEY SAY DRY CLEAN ONLY. If they are dry clean only, wash them, and hang or lay them flat to dry. You can dry clean them from now on, but they need a good washing to get the de-lousing powder out of them (shit you never wanted to know, I am sure.) I avoid Goodwill, and stick with the Salvation Army. Salvation Army is half the price of Goodwill, and they literally do more good for people than Goodwill. \n\nI do a seasonal capsule wardrobe now, and try to stick to it. This keeps me looking sharp at work, and everything matches. I do it seasonally to cycle through my clothes properly. I have a cardigan in every color as a result of this now. I recommend the Daily Connoisseur for how to accomplish this: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TheDailyConnoisseur\n\nAlways stop in at Salvation Army in September\/October for a new winter coat. Almost all of my coats have come from Salvation Army, and the last three years they have all been BROOKS BROTHERS COATS. No joke. For $5 or less.  Every season I go to Salvation Army, and walk out with a whole new wardrobe, all for less than $50 (usually.)\n\nThat being said, AVOID THE FUR COATS. They aren\u2019t worth it. However, if you have somewhere fancy to be, you can totally buy one of those coats, and make yourself a fur wrap or stole or muff. I will totally admit to having done this before.\n\nPro-tip: Bag up all your old clothes and BRING THEM WITH YOU TO DONATE. You get a tax write off. I keep a notebook with a list of everything I donated and get a receipt every time. (If you\u2019ve never donated before, they won\u2019t itemize for you what you have donated, you have to make and keep that record yourself for seven years if you write it off on your taxes.)\n\nNext \u2013 taking care of your clothes. I already told you about tailoring. But the other thing I also do is dye my jeans when they get a little worn out. Almost all of my jeans are second-hand, and for some reason they dye wears out of them before the jeans actually wear out. I use Rit dye every once in awhile and they look BRAND SPANKING NEW. This tip might be best for kids clothes, so the clothes look new when they are passed down to the next kid. ALSO \u2013 you need to wash them a few times so the dye doesn't leach out of the clothes the next time you do laundry and dye everything else in the load a light blue hue. \n\nI also darn socks, and once a year, at the beginning of the new year,  All you need to darn socks are a piece of round fruit, a needle, and some thread. Put the fruit in the sock, and sew up the hole. This way the sock, when mended, will conform to your foot better than if you just straight stitched the hole closed. \n\n**Glasses:**\n\nHusband inspired this one. Basically, the man is pretty much blind. We BOTH have eye insurance, so we went to Pearl Vision, and at the end of the day, I was out $600. For one pair of glasses. And we have DOUBLE THE INSURANCE. WTF! So after some research, we now go and get our FREE yearly eye exam, and then buy our glasses online at zennioptical.com. Our glasses cost for both of us last year - $60. Actually, it\u2019s -$60 since my insurance will reimburse you up to $120 for glasses. We then use my insurance for his contacts eye exam, and buy those discount online too (through Walmart.) And that is covered under my insurance as well (We pay like $7 a box or something. Sorry, haven\u2019t bought any in awhile.)\n\n**Freecycle:**\n\nI love Freecycle. Basically, freecycle is group of people who list the stuff they want to get rid of stuff they have, and you have to pick it up. From freecycle, I have gotten: baby slings, a crib, a exesaucer, countless toys, a rocker, basically, I decked out my MIL\u2019s nursery at her house. The best way to describe it is it\u2019s a free garage sale. \n\n**Baby\/Children\u2019s Toys\/Stuff:**\n\nFreecycle and Once Upon a Child have been my go to for my kid\u2019s things. Unless someone buys her something new, everything comes from OUAC. Again, exception shoes. Their hats, socks, and underwear are all new so you can feel safe buying those.  My kid got roughly 12 gifts for Christmas, and it all cost under $40. Merry Christmas to ME. She\u2019s 2 as well, so I know this likely cannot continue forever, especially when she gets older and asks Santa for specific things, but for right now, it works. \n\nFacebook groups can be good for specific toys, and next year, starting around October, I am going to try to find a secondhand Power Wheel for her Christmas gift. These also have been good for announcing where there is a yard\/garage sale in the area, which can be a great source for furniture (BUT KNOW HOW TO LOOK FOR BEDBUGS BEFORE YOU DO THIS https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kTcCfbxj_m8) \n\n**Fresh Veggies**\n\nI became (quite accidentally) friends with people at work who grow gardens. I have enough basil and fresh veggies to get me through winter. I suggest you find someone who gardens and offer a trade or whatever. Like, I would do an afternoon of free babysitting for some canned tomatoes. That kind of thing. \n\nTo preserve the basil\/herbs, I just chop them and put them into ice cube trays, and cover them in olive oil. Once they are frozen, I pop them all out, and put them in a ziplock bag in the freezer, and take them out as needed. \n\nI store all my potato and onions in old nylons, this helps them stay separated and aerated, and therefore last longer. \n\nWhenever I buy celery, I ended up using 2 stalks. I then chop up all the rest of the celery, and put it into a ziplock in the freezer, and then take out as needed. One celery lasts me roughly 4 months.\n\nI take the top of the celery leaves, tops of onions, carrot peels and tops, and any other root veggie peals (except potatoes) and keep them in a can in my freezer. Once the can is full, I buy beef bones and make broth. Once the broth is done, I pour it into a silicone cupcake tray and freeze it. Each \u201ccupcake cup\u201d is roughly 2\/3 of a cup of broth. Then those go into storage bags into the freezer. \n\nI regrow leeks and green onions by putting the roots in water and letting them grow. I make my own sprouts by sprouting lentils.\n\n**TV\/Entertainment**\n\nWe bought a Roku about 4 years ago now. Comcast raised our cable rates, for basic cable and internet, to $230 a month. That\u2019s OUR CAR PAYMENT. So, I canceled cable, got AT&amp;T (for $15 a month) and got Roku. On Roku, we stream Hulu Plus, HBO GO, Netflix, PBS, PBS Kids, Amazon, VuDu, Crackle, Yoga TV, and bunch of other channels for basically free. Here\u2019s the shady part of this deal: I traded Hulu Plus and Netflix passwords for my sister\u2019s Dish Network and HBO GO passwords. So, she gets free Hulu Plus and Netflix, and I get free HBO. I used to torrent shows, so this is at least SOMEWHAT more legal, and soon Netflix is going to do \u201cfriends and family streaming\u201d where you can share your account with multiple people for $5 more, and you\u2019d better believe I will pay them for that privilege.  So my TV costs me (minus the internet) $22 a month. We also get Netflix DVD\u2019s in the mail. We use Amazon to rent movies, and I use codes I search for online to discount the cost of the movies. I don\u2019t have prime so I can watch for free because, basically, I don\u2019t think they offer enough selection vs. Netflix, which we are already paying for. \n\nMy local library has Roku\u2019s you can rent for three weeks at a time, and they come loaded with shows and TV channels they have already logged into. So, say you wanted to watch Game of Thrones, you rent the Roku with GoT loaded up and can watch it for free. \n\nMy library also has magazine, ebooks, and audio books for rental on your tablet\/phone. They automatically return as well, so no late fees. \nFor my child, our library is a gold mine. Not only books, but flashcards, puzzles, DVD\/CDs, and TOY rentals. For longer car rides, we rent individual DVD players from the library that are loaded up with ebooks and cartoons and she is in heaven. (Just don\u2019t lose them, they are something like $70 to replace.) \n\n**Car Maintenance**\n\nI do all my car maintenance myself. I change wiper blades, I change fuses and lights, and I used to change my own oil (I got out of the habit after getting pregnant.) Spend the extra money on wiper blades, it\u2019s worth it. DO NOT spend the extra money on fuses or light bulbs, it is NOT worth it. Never have an oil change place change these things for you \u2013 the mark-up is insane. You can either use YouTube to do it yourself, or ask an AutoZone employee to help, and then TIP HIM. Even with a $5 tip to the AutoZone person, it\u2019s cheaper by FAR to do it yourself. \n\n**Coffee**\n\nWe use reusable K-cups because I don\u2019t drink coffee, and Husband can\u2019t drink an entire pot himself. We use reusable coffee cups, and if you want to do this to, the best piece of advice I have is get the simplest travel coffee cups you can. The more parts \u2013 the more shit that can break and leak coffee all over you. We use those Copco coffee cups that look like coffee cups. \n\n**Furniture and Appliances**\n\nI fix everything. Like, myself, with my own hands. I am super cheap. However, when something cannot be fixed, and I don\u2019t want to buy it new, I go to the Habitat for Humanity ReStore in Joliet. They have fridges and stoves for $25 that WORK. Even if they last two years, that\u2019s two years you have to save up for a new appliance instead of going into credit card debt immediately. The only thing I would buy new is a dishwasher. Too many food particles for me to feel comfortable.\n \nFor fun, as children, we used to take apart appliance to see how they work. I fully intend to allow my kid to do this as well. \n\n(Hit 15,000, rest in comments) \n","29":"Title sums it up.

Since we're outside the US, it is easier to just use points. \n\nWhen i say Amazon based i mean you can get your rewards by buying stuff on Amazon using your points from the actual P2S website, but you can also withdraw to Paypal or just get gift cards for various retailers (Including Amazon cards)\n\nTheres a leveling system, New users get 250 points when they sign up from a ref link, the next level is bronze which is done by validating your address, this is when you can start playing the games, then it goes to silver when youve earned enough points and so on. Higher levels sometimes have added benefits, but mostly its the same for all users.\n\n\nHeres my [Referral link](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/?ref=fanlee100) It would be nice if someone signs up on it, or if you dont want to just use the [homepage](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/)\n\n\nThis has lots of different stuff, offers, surveys, videos, clicks.. \n\n*Ways to earn*\n\n* Surveys - This is the main way, as the site is kinda survey based. It gives you a best opportunity option in the earnings tab which automatically selects a survey for you, and if you disqualify it gives you another, which you carry on until you get your 50 points. Other good places is the SSI page under Earnings\n\n* Offers- Slightly different than just filling out a survey, but a bit more unpredictable, Peanutlabs is the main offer page i normally use. Easy ones to do to start off with is Reward TV, this is found on the Earnings Area homepage, really easy to complete and a easy 75 points.... after you do this it can sometimes pop up in the peanut labs page where it lets you do it again which gives an extra 50 odd points. Another one i do when it comes up is Kingsroad which is an online flash game where you have to follow the tutorial, should take 10 mins max.\n\n* Videos - There are loads of videos you can watch too, some are sometimes under peanut labs, but theres usually lots under Superrewards for 2 points each, plus in the earnings area\n\n* Games - Theres also games that you enter in competitions with other players, usually 1v1, this normally doesn't get you that many points since it pairs you with people same level as you so if you continuously win you'll be pitted against other people who do too... The easiest game (i feel) is Ballery **Be warned, theres currently a glitch on most games, not letting the score submit**\n\n* Emails - little tip that you can do once in a while...... the emails that they send you out informing you of a new survey gives 2 points if you disqualify, so if you just click through them a couple of days after they sent you them it would say this survey is now closed but give you the 2 points anyway, and they often send you a couple of these every day so once in a while you can just go through all the old emails you have and accumulate lots of points. **Note - these 2 points expire after 2 or 3 days if you havent clicked on the link, so you need to click them soon after you receive the email**\n\n* Other - Theres lots of other stuff too, like a weekly lottery run on Wednesdays where you have the chance to earn bonus points, a spin counter where you can earn stuff too, you get a spin token if you earn 50 points each day, a merit system where you earn merits by doing various stuff and try to collect the most in teams of 5 etc\n\n\n\nAn important note is this site lets you exchange Amazon gift cards for points, so whatever $US Amazon gift cards i come across (mostly from places on this sub) i exchange in order to redeem a \u00a3GC on the site\n\n[Heres a bit more detail on that](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/beermoneyuk\/comments\/2ox4r5\/how_i_exchange_gift_cards_eg_to_s\/)\n\n\nThats it guys, thanks for reading!\n\nIf you have any additional questions i would gladly answer them, and one last time, it would be awesome if you signed up via [my ref](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/?ref=fanlee100) :P","50":"I have $130 in Lowes giftcards (in $5 increments) and I'm looking for $80 Paypal or $85 Amazon, but might go down a little bit with some haggling.\n\nThese are redeemable on Lowes.com.\n\nComment before PM'ing please ","51":"I have $80 (in $5 increments) of what's called an options card.

I have a surplus of scholarships and receive around $1.5-3k refund in my bank account each semester after my tuition gets paid automatically. On top of that, I've taught myself software development over the past 9 years and have started a software development business, which isn't profitable yet but I get job offers on a regular basis and have no trouble finding freelance work to create software for local businesses in a very entrepreneurial city. As of now though, I'm unemployed and not seeking work, but rather am working on my own projects for my business from which I hope to profit in the (likely distant...) future. I live with my parents and have practically no expenses (even my commute is super short so I don't spend a lot on gas, plus I barely go out).\n\n\nFinancially I'm very solid. My bank account is nice and chubby, I have zero debt\/loans, and I have a credit card with a $2,500 limit and no yearly fees or any of that. My only ongoing non-business expenses are Netflix, Amazon Prime and similar subscriptions (not much), and my business expenses are even less than that.\n\n\nNow. I don't know much about finances other than the fact that I always seem to have more spending money than everyone around me. I would like to take advantage of this somehow to improve my situation, though I'm not exactly sure what I can do. Increasing my credit score would be nice for the future I guess, in case I need to make a big purchase (car or house?).\n\nSo what do you financial gurus suggest I do? This free ride of mine is going to end eventually, and if it ends before my business takes off, I'd like to avoid falling flat on my face and in a fast-food joint.\n\n\nThe only thing I can think of is to just spend a lot of money, but that sounds dumb..\n","72":"[H] Paypal, Amazon [W] Abercrombie and Fitch","73":"Here's my idea, users who are new or very skeptical of this sub could pay the mods to trade their cards for them!\n\nSay a newb has a $50 walmart card that they want $45 for.

My wife and I also have an Amazon side business with several employees.  This business also has its own checking account.  We pay for supplies, payroll, shipping, fees, taxes etc. through the business checking account.  In addition to the side business checking account - we also have a  personal checking account, and a personal savings account.  I have all 3 bank accounts added in mint.com.\n\nIs it appropriate to have our side business checking account included with our personal checking and savings account in mint.com?  If one of the purposes of tools like mint.com is to obtain a snapshot of your net worth at a given time, I feel like the business account sort of distorts this overview.  The reason for this is we don't really know how much profit we'll have on the business until the end of the year usually - as the bulk of our profit is realized in the couple of months leading up to the Christmas season, and we have to pay a substantial amount in taxes through this account every year.  Also we typically keep any profit from the business in the business account throughout the year, reinvesting into the business when we need to, or transferring into our personal accounts when we need to - as in when we needed to transfer a pretty large amount for a down payment when we bought our house.\n\nAny comments on this?

Was pointed in a great direction by some kind redditors and now I am back for some more info please. \n\nLittle background, I live in queens in NYC. Rent for 1300 a month (sweet deal, and we ain't moving), no debt, his company pays for phone, etc and I have a $40 metropcs plan. We live quite frugally on bills, but can cut major money by minding every dollar and resisting Amazon. I do like to splurge on nice groceries (cook everything from scratch but still spending about $250 per week including wine, toiletries, etc.). My husband has a job earning 140k a year plus a good bonus each year. I'm a stay at home mom, 1 child and pay $350 a month for nursery school 10 hours a week. We have 50k in savings and 132k in our 401k. We also have about 15k in an account in another country. Other expenses are just travelling. No car, no major expenses. Pay off our amex every month. Anyways, I think I need to stop spending like I did in my early 20s and really want to get our financial goals in place and on track. I know we could be saving a lot more and we don't budget ever. So, my resolution this year is to get everything set up and in place and along with investing our savings, budget wisely so we have more to save. \n\nSo far I have decided that we need to keep about 30k in savings for our emergency fund (which we could live on for probably the whole year if push came to shove). The rest I want to put into a good investment. I need help because I think the Roth IRA is a good start but am not positive. However, even if that is a good choice I am only seeing that I can put in $5500 per year. So, what do I do with the rest (about 15k)? \n\nAlso, to get back to the title, I keep looking over our 401k from last year and need some help. We are putting in the max and the employer is matching which is 3% of his paycheck. However, I am looking at last year and seeing a few things I am confused about. It says \n\"your personal rate of return\" \nthis period: -3.11%\nFor last 12 months: 7.12%\nSince your account inception: 4.64%\n\nI believe I keep reading that for our age (29 and 32) we should be aiming for a return closer to 10% and are able to be a bit more risky in our investments to hit that. \n\nSince it is under my husbands name I believe he has to call the company to change things, and since he works a lot I need to be able to coach him to the side and\/or have him prepared with the right things to say\/questions. \n\nDoes that return seem stupidly low to everyone else? Is there something I am missing? \n\nTLDR: Beside roth Ira, what are our other good long term investment options? What is a normal rate of return on your 401k and what do I need to say to the company to have them diversify our investments to better reach it? \n\nThanks so much for any input. Really glad I found this subreddit. Wish I would have found this years ago.\nEdit: spelling and grammar mistakes  \n\n","94":"[H] $25 Carrabba's card [W] PayPal, Amazon, etc.","95":"We got a $25 gift card to Carrabba's from family for Christmas but there isn't a Carrabba's anywhere close to our home.

The Google Play one don't have tournaments in them!**\n\n\nWhen you just start out, you get $2.50 that you cannot cash out and you can use that money to enter tournaments and beat other people. *(You get a bonus 50 cents if you enter a username while signing up as a referral, and the referrer also gets 50 cents.)\n\n\n&gt; How many games do they have?\n\n\nSo far they have 3 games, but they're going to add more someday.\n\n\n* Color Virus *(My favorite and IMO the easiest to earn on)* [pic](http:\/\/www.foosler.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/CV-2-1.png)\n* Ace10 [pic](http:\/\/www.foosler.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/A1-2-1.png)\n* BrickCrackers [pic](http:\/\/www.foosler.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/BC-2-1.png)\n\n\n**All of the apps can be found [here](http:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-keywords=Foosler%20Inc.&amp;index=mobile-apps&amp;search-type=ss)**\n\n\nI'll share my strategies for these games in a separate guide if you guys want. Some of the simpler ones can be found on [my website](http:\/\/www.onlinemoneyz.com\/blog\/what-is-foosler-and-is-it-legit).\n\n\n&gt; Do I have to invest real money to earn?\n\n\nNo, you get $2.50 (or $3.00) in non-withdrawable Foosbucks when you start, and you can use that money to enter tournaments.\n\n\nYou can also enter tournaments by tweeting about the app. (One entry per day up to 3 entries total. *Not sure about the max amount of tweets at this point because I don't use them*)\n\n\n&gt; How do they pay out?\n\n\nYou can withdraw funds by check ($3 fee), and BitCoin, LiteCoin, and DogeCoin (for free). They're working on adding PayPal as a way to withdraw and add funds, but as of right now, it's not an available option.\n\n\n&gt; Is this only for Android?\n\n\nAs of right now, yes. They're planning on, or already working on an iOS version, but it hasn't been released yet.\n\n\n&gt; How much money can I earn per game or per hour?\n\n\nIf you're good at a certain game, you can earn quite a lot!\n\n\nOn average it takes me 15 minutes to enter all of the tournaments for Color Virus *(I don't do the other games anymore because I'm good at this one)*, and I usually win all of them. =)\n\n\nThose 15 minutes of playtime yield around $3-$4 depending on how well I do. Sadly it takes a while for the tournaments to finish because there aren't that many people, and right now you can only enter one of a certain type, but as more people join, I'm sure I could do this for a whole hour and get around $10 an hour!\n\n\n&gt; What are the different types of tournaments?\n\n\nThere are daily tournaments for each game which last for 24 hours, and the payout depends on how many people enter the tourney. (The top third of the scores gets money)\n\n\nThere are also different head to head tournaments with different entries and prizes for each place.\n\n\n4 Player Tourneys | $.5 Entry | $1 Entry\n---------|----------|----------\nFirst Place Winnings| $1.05| $2.10\nSecond Place Winnings| $.70| $1.40\n\n\n2 Player Tourneys | $1 Entry | $2.50 Entry\n---------|----------|----------\nFirst Place Winnings| $1.80| $4.50\n\n\n&gt; Do they have a referral program?\n\n\nYes, if someone uses your referral name when signing up, both of you get $.50 in FooseBucks.

And they waive the annual fee for the first year, then charge an outrageous fee for the second.\n\nI usually get the miles, liquidate them for cash or Amazon cards, then immediately close the account.  I have done this with Chase Sapphire ($625 cash bonus), American Express (50,000 miles -&gt; Cash), and again for my wife with the same American Express.  There are literally dozens of offers in the 20,000 - 30,000 miles range.  I figure I can make at least $1,000 - $2,000 extra per year doing this.\n\nOther than a temporary hit to my credit for opening the card, is there any long term damage that can be done with hustle?","131":"I am very frugal but my husband insisted on taking care of our tv\/internet\/phone through Cox Communications (our other option is Direct TV and I think ATT Uverse). I never questioned the cost until my Mother saw what we pay and mentioned I should look into it. Unfortunately husband is asleep and I forget our Cox password or I would give more specifics, but here it is: \n\n**TV:** Cable with DVR box plus a Sports Tier and HBO (for GOT, Veep, Silicon Valley) \n\n**Internet:** Not sure what package but I tested and we have 55ms Ping, 34.58 Mbps Download, 6.58 Mbps upload. Supposedly they are doubling speeds at some point for \"free\"\n\n**Phone:** Local and long distance, free. We don't actually need this it came \"bundled\" \n\n= **$237.95 a month (including taxes\/fees)**\n\nWe have Netflix and Amazon Prime. We aren't diehards about our HBO shows so we don't mind waiting a few days to see episodes. Reliable access to ESPN and CBS for NCAA football games is a MUST. My husband has only missed 2 home games for his team since he was in the womb and miraculously he's not a tool, so I fully support his fandom. \n\nI keep asking to remove phone and they tell me it would cost the same or MORE because the \"bundle\" is making things SOOOO cheap for me. All they ever offer me is free Showtime or HBO for a few months. \n\n**TLDR; $237.95\/mo for internet, cable (DVR +HBO, +sports package), and phone that we don't need. Too much? Direct TV thoughts? We need TV for NCAA football, all else negotiable.**\n\n\n","132":"[H] $25 iTunes [W] Amazon or Steam card","133":"Selling $50 Amazon card for $45 paypal and $25 Cinemark card for $20 paypal","134":"[H] 10$ Amazon GC [W] 10$ BTC","135":"[H] 10$ Amazon.com giftcard [W] 10$ BTC","136":"[H] 10$ Amazon GC [W] 8$ BTC","137":"I went to apply for health and personal care this morning and got greeted with this nice message http:\/\/imgur.com\/qgbgaiD from Amazon.

I'm going to examine a couple of them I've experienced first hand. \n\nSam's Club's Mastercard: 5% back on gas. For every $100, you get $5 back on gas. If I spend $4,000 a year on gas (something I did for a while), that's $200 I get back for gas. Not a very impressive return on my investment. To be fair, the card *does* give you rewards on other things, so it's not an awful deal. But two hundred dollars isn't going to be the difference between a new car and a beater... which is really important if I'm already spending $4,000 a year in gas. \n\nGiant Eagle: There isn't one of these near me, but someone claimed to get free gas from this company. Good for them. However, some of these deals really suck. For example, there's a promo where you get $0.20 off per gallon if you buy $50 in prepaid phones or cards. FuelPerks last up to 30 gallons, which means if you save $0.20 per gallon, you've saved $6 on this purchase alone (if you have a 30 gallon tank). So on this [Huawei cell phone](http:\/\/www.gianteagle.com\/System-Pages\/Product-Page\/?ec=76750129902), you paid $99 and saved $6. Your effective cost on that phone is $93 (99-6). Meanwhile, Amazon sells that exact same phone for [$80](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Huawei-Ascend-Plus-Android-Prepaid\/dp\/B00D374XGY). With shipping, it comes to $86. In this scenario, the Amazon shopper comes out $6 ahead of the Giant Eagle shopper. \n\nFinally, the worst of the bunch: \n\nKroger Fuel Points: $1 = 1 fuel point. 100 fuel points gets $0.10 per gallon. This means spending $1,000 in one month at Kroger gets you $1.00 off per gallon. However, $1.00 off will only happen if you buy ALL of your groceries at Kroger or a Kroger company... discouraging you from comparison shopping and saving money a lot more immediately. So let's say you're like me and have a 26-gallon tank. If I spend $1,000 a month at Kroger, I get $1.00 per gallon. This is the limit for Kroger fuel points. Thus, the maximum I can save is $26 per month (one dollar per gallon per tank per month). \n\nSo if I spend $12,000 in groceries ($1,000 per month), I get back $312 -- enough for one-third of one month's groceries. Shitty deal... and that's the BEST case scenario. Keep in mind: the vast majority of Kroger shoppers don't come anywhere near 1,000 fuel points (I've worked with this company before). Besides, if you spend twelve grand in groceries, don't you think you can save more than $312 if you shop someplace besides Kroger? \n\nMy point being: fuel savings programs *can* save money, but they're by no means a frugal way to live. They're not going to save you money like cooking your own food, brewing your own coffee, repairing your own car, taking courses on Coursera, etc. With fuel rewards, we're dealing with businesses. Sam's, Kroger, and Giant Eagle exist to **make money**. When they give you $26 off on gas each time, they're making up that $26 somewhere else *each time*. \n\nThis sub is about living frugally. Living frugally is wasting less, doing more by one's self, forgoing things we don't need, etc. Living frugally is *not* circlejerking about how much we've saved on *one tank of gas*. \n\n","170":"[H] $70 Barnes &amp; Noble (2 $25 1 $20) [W] Paypal\/Amazon","171":"Willing to trade a 50 dollar Amazon Gift Card for 45 dollars transfer through paypal\n\nMy Rep profile:http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2ra5gt\/utherealfamous_gcx_rep_profile\/","172":"$10 Itunes GC's [W] Amazon or Paypal","173":"[H] Itunes $10 [W] Amazon Paypal","174":"[H] $20 Target [W] $20 Amazon\/PayPal\/GoogleWallet","175":"[H] $25x8 Amazon.com [W] $22.5 Paypal","176":"I want $22.5 Paypal for $25 Amazon GC.\n","177":"[H] $50 AUSTRALIAN itunes gift card [W] $50 AMERICAN itunes gift card\/Amazon\/paypal","178":"[H] $50 AUSTRALIAN itunes gift card [W] American itunes gift card\/Amazon\/Paypal","179":"Hey guys,\n\nI started this conversation on \/r\/startups last week.  \n\nIt went pretty well I guess.. http:\/\/imgur.com\/pyPwOzj\n\nI wanted to share some of my thoughts and personal experiences on how I built a six figure e-commerce business with zero outside investment. Back when I first started all I wanted was an outline on how to start, but alas, I never found one. \n\nThis is that outline. \n\n1). It all starts with an idea (kinda)\n\nBuilding a thriving web-based business ain\u2019t easy. But it doesn\u2019t have to be risky or take forever. The foundation of any successful business starts with an idea, but it can\u2019t just be any idea \u2013 it has to be the \u201cright idea\u201d. Now, what\u2019s the right idea? It\u2019s an idea that meets the needs of the marketplace. \n\nHere\u2019s the fastest way to prove your idea has million dollar potential:\n\n\u2022 Listen for code words: What are code words? They\u2019re phrases like \u201cI wish\u201d or \u201cI hate\u201d or \u201cI love\u201d or \u201cIf only\u201d. These phrases often express a desire for an alternative of some kind which may not already exist (or be readily available). Create that alternative. Whether scratching your own itch or someone else\u2019s, this is the best way to get started.\n\n\u2022 Scour Amazon reviews: 3 star reviews on Amazon are often an excellent source of information on how your potential market is feeling. Why 3 star reviews? 5 star ratings are too bubbly and 1 and 2 star ratings are oftentimes pure hate. Search for the pain points or points of praise in these reviews and address and\/or improve upon them with your idea.\n\n2). Test, Test, Test\n\nYou know that whole thing about entrepreneurs being crazy risk takers? It\u2019s bullshit. Before you even spend a penny you\u2019ll want to vet your idea in as many ways as possible. The first and best place to do this is via the digital deity Google using their Keyword Planner Tool. Consistently high search volume and competition are good indicators that there is indeed a need for your potential offering.\n\nThe other 2 steps, screenshots, etc. are all here: http:\/\/readsource.com\/business\/from-0-22k-in-30-days-how-i-did-it-and-how-you-can-in-4-steps\/\n\nQuestions I ask manufacturers, sample mockups, a press release that got my brand featured on Hypebeast and other tools I use: http:\/\/readsource.com\/business\/from-0-22k-in-30-days-additional-tools-tips-tricks-and-resources\/\n\n\nAsk away and I'll help as best as I can!","180":"[H] \u00a315 iTunes [W] Steam, Amazon (UK)","181":"[H]25 Amazon [W]25 Target or 23 PayPal","182":"[H] 40$ Paypal [W] 50$ AmazonGC","183":"[H] \u00a315 iTunes [W] Amazon Gift Card, Steam","184":"[H] Paypal, Venmo and Google Wallet [W] 35$ Amazon for my purchase :D","185":"[H] $50 Amazon gc [W] $40 Paypal","186":"[H] 2 - $15 iTunes GC ($30) [W] $25 Amazon GC","187":"[H] 10 $ Amazon [W] Make me an offer (anything useable with Steam)","188":"[H]50$ Amazon Gift Card ( ALOT ) [W]36$ BTC ea","189":"[H] 50 Amazon [W] 40 Paypal","190":"[H] Nike $100 [W] Paypal or Amazon $90","191":"I have one confirmed trade on this subreddit: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2jkzjq\/ubrahelp24_gcx_rep_profile\/\n\nI am also a confirmed swapper on \/r\/braswap (meaning I have had 6+ successful swaps).\n\nI got this gift card for Christmas, but VS doesn't sell bras in my size and I have more than enough underwear.\n\nI'd prefer Target, Walmart, PayPal, Amazon, or iTunes.

Better price than anywhere else I coudl find including online retailers like Amazon.\n\nMore importantly, we have a smallish upright freezer that we keep consistently packed with ground turkey, beef, and frozen chicken.  We also purchase frozen veggies in bulk, and usually have easy lunch food-type stuff (think individually wrapped frozen burritos\/pizzas, wontons).  Milk, eggs, flour, rice.  Even BBQ and hot sauce we purchase at Costco.\n\nFinally, fuel.  I filled up my car before it closed on 12\/30 @ $1.96\/gallon compared to $2.20-ish at the other stations near buy.  So not a huge savings on fuel considering I only put in 10 gallons or so at a time, but because it is equi distance to the Costco station and my local Valero, it saves me a few bucks each time.\n\nOh, and the $1.50 all beef 1\/4lb hot dog with drink is a fun treat when we visit!","260":"I have a $275 Amazon code that I'd like to trade for that MW Vulcan.

Whatever products\/services that you are selling and CUSTOMERS who are buying your stuff.  Having one without the other is meaningless so before you load up on a ton of inventory, make sure you know how to get rid of it.\n\nGood luck.","280":"Yeah, I did.

Is that really a hack? Maybe. It's &lt;$30 and lets you have basic channels for free. If you have that and a few subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu, etc), you're pretty set for TV for far less than someone paying for cable.","331":"The way I think about it is like this. You have court at 1:30. It takes 30 minutes to go through security. According to the law, you MUST BE IN THE COURTROOM at 1:30, but you need to be there at 1 in order to make it through security.\n\nThe law can't prosecute you for not being there at 1 for security, until the point where you've missed your 1:30 start time and are then in contempt.\n\nIn the same vein, I'd think about it the same as a security checkpoint on a military base, and you're a civilian employee at an on-base shop. If you're required to report for your shift across the base from the checkpoint, it's your responsibility to make it through the checkpoint and get to work on time. It's just part of your daily commute. The only difference is that Amazon runs the security checkpoint.\n\n","332":"I usually switch between TurboTax and H&amp;R Block's software (depending on what is cheaper). On that note, H&amp;R Block is having a 51% off sale on Amazon this very moment. (The bot won't let me link, but easy enough to find on their page).\n\nHonestly have found them both to be about the same in terms of usability and overall cost (after any 'hidden' fees). Also, you can import your TurboTax (.tax) files into H&amp;R's software with no issues.\n","333":"If you have until June with zero interest on the Amazon - make sure you get it paid off BEFORE that so that you don't get all of the previous interest dropped on it. Usually these promotions just defer interest until the end of the promotion period. Then, if you haven't paid it off, you get all of the interest dumped on the account.\n\nBeyond that, we'd need to know what the rest of your budget looks like to figure out how much to pay. Also, the interest rates would be important.","334":"At the end of the day what do you want out of the situation?  Getting paid for the 15 minutes and staying in your employer's good graces is likely not an option.  \n\nSome of the questions you should be asking IMO:\n\n* Are you ok with being shuffled off to the side and being seen as a problem by management?  \n\n* Are you willing (and able) to lose the job for this? \n\n* Is that actually the law in Missouri?\n\nTalk to DOL, then consider how you might bring it up to your employer.  Their arguments that you have \"free time to do whatever you want\" don't matter - at the very least, forcing you to be on-premise means that you can't spend the time as you please, and would make it on-call time (same doco as I linked before).\n\nYou may not need to rub their noses in the law to get them to pay (ie don't get overly aggressive about it unless necessary).  The outcome that I'd seek in this situation is for them to revise their \"required to turn up early\" policy to allow you to turn up any time before your shift, combined with stricter enforcement on lateness.  You're obviously not going to be making friends with management\/owners by trying to claw an extra couple hundred bucks each week across the team.  I'd suggest saving raising the idea that you're entitled to backpay as a nuclear option - I don't know your employer, but I've only needed to use something like this once in my life (on an incredibly shady employer who kept making excuses not to pay my girlfriend's last paycheck at a particular job), and unless everyone on the team is behind you 100%, the hassle that you've created at the job means that they won't want you to stay.\n\nIf you've got any correspondence which says that you need to be there 15 minutes before your shift starts (or if you've gotten written up for it or similar) then that's stuff that will be useful if you actually need to escalate it.\n\nEdit: Amazon ruling doesn't apply here unless you're supposed to spend that 15 mins going through a security screening, riding down a mineshaft, climbing a gondola or something similar to actually GET to where you have to work.","335":"There's a huge difference between time required for security and transportation, and simply being required to show up early to ensure that you're present at the time you're supposed to clock in. Since OP's business doesn't seem to be utilizing it for any security purposes, as was the case with Amazon, I think OP has *at least* grounds to justify speaking with the Department of Labor about it, even if it appears probable nothing will happen...\n\nI see a fundamental difference between being required to show up early enough that your passage through security wouldn't impede your arrival time, and simply being told to show up early for no particular specific reason.","336":"Capital one interest rate is 24.90% \n\nAmazon is No interest till 6\/12\/15 then it's 25.99%   \n\nAmazon was $696.76 I gave them $30.76  this month and capital one got $30.22    These are the only bills I have right now.

","337":"&gt; You'd need a jackstand for an oil change, no?\n\nGenerally speaking... You'd need at least two! Before I had access to a lift I'd just hop a curb in my Jeep and get under there that way but I wouldn't suggest it with a Focus :)\n\nIf you're hell bent on your own oil changes and the filter is accessible from above (Toyotas, yes, Subarus, no, Fords, no idea) then you could get an oil extractor ($50 on Amazon) and pump it out from above, change the filter, refill oil, and off you go. No mess too.\n\nCheck Yelp for mechanics in your area. My guy's the #1 rated around here, and with good reason. He *is* a good friend of mine, but at the same time, really really good at what he does and honest. Yelp does a pretty good job of reflecting that because people hate mechanics as much as they hate lawyers, and like to bitch about it.\n\nAlso, be wary of car advice on Frugal... Lots of people here fall under the category of \"think they know better\" than the engineers that designed the car and engineered the service schedule, as well as the actual mechanics that are looking at your specific car (you might have really dirty coolant... ask to see it) and are actually just cheap bastards that ignore routine maintenance (it's a conspiracy!) and then piss bitch and moan when they get a major failure and call the mechanic a thief for quoting them $2k to replace a transmission.... I'd ask around on \/r\/cars or \/r\/Autos so you won't end up with the terrible, terrible advice that usually floats around here (\"Transmission fluid is good for 300,000 miles according to my mechanic!\" was my favorite today, that's so goddamned wrong.) \n\nFollow the book, and don't be cheap, it will just cost you more in the long run.","338":"Still using TurboTax. Unfortunately this year they removed Schedule D from the Deluxe version, which is an important document to many people, including myself. This forces people to buy the more expensive version, Premier. This is what a lot of the Amazon reviews are complaining about\n\nOn the upside, my family and I always share a copy and I am the only State filer, so we split the purchase cost five ways. The very slight cost of increase for my share isn't enough reason for me to switch over to some other service.","339":"I use mint to track all of my spending. You can categorize all purchases and add notes too. I purchase from amazon a lot, so I'll change the seller from Amazon to Amazon-item so I remember what it was months later. Mint made me realize how much I was spending on coffee ($2.50 here and there ADDS UP SO QUICKLY) and helps me see where I stand in real time in my budgets and where I have wiggle room, especially in terms of my \"fun\" budgets. For example, last month I didn't spend any money on food at work because I brought my lunch every day so I was able to spend a little more than I usually would when I went out to dinner with my friends and didn't have to stress about it. ","340":"Yea I'm trying to decide between MCF or AMAZON.uk this year. I hate customer service though so I doubt I will be doing MCF. ","341":"So by ebt I am guessing you mean food stamps? You still haven't included an estimate of how much you make or how much you spend on other things, so I would guess you don't keep track of your income\/expenditures. Definitely start doing that.\n\nIf you put the information on your loans into unbury.me, you can see that making minimum payments it will take until 1\/2018 to pay off your loans. That actually is an underestimate because it doesn't take into account that the 0% interest rate for Amazon is temporary. If you pay the entire $500 I estimate you make each month, you could be debt -free by 3\/2015. If you continue paying $60 per month as you indicate you have in this thread, it will be well onto 2017 before you get them paid off. I am guessing reality is somewhere between there because you also pay for gas, sometimes food, and you may make a different amount. I would suggest figuring out how much you actually make, set a budget for yourself, and put as much money as possible towards getting this debt paid off. Cut up the cards if you keep \"accidentally\" using them despite being maxed out.","342":"If I'm reading this correctly, it's really only useful if you're selling high demand commodity type items - smartphones, toothpaste, lightbulbs, stuff like that. Well that doesn't do me any good because I don't think I can FBA my vintage glass Vodka bottle signed by Al Capone, or my rare and original IBM self correcting typewriter from the 80s that weighs 50 pounds. \n\nThis is probably why it's taking me so long to get started with FBA, almost everything I sell is stuff you can't find on Amazon, let alone sell. So yeah, MCF does sound nice, but it's sort of irrelevant\/impossible for sellers like me unless I missed something. If it's only good for Amazon worthy items, I'm not sure why you don't just keep all your inventory at Amazon since it will sell for the highest price faster than on eBay or anywhere else. ","343":"Yes it's good for new items and not for old rare vintage stuff.  In regard to your last point, certain things like new clothing, still move better on Ebay than Amazon.  Amazon is better for most things but not all.","344":"I know that they require you to fill out your address if you're going to redeem anything, but I'm not sure on the verification... 4K points away from a $50 Amazon GC!

Would Amazon need to pay those people for their time as well?","346":"This is true, but wouldn't you say the reason for that is because Amazon doesn't even allow third party sellers to sell clothes? You can't move clothing on Amazon to begin with when the category is restricted to pretty much only the manufacturer. If you want to sell clothes eBay is basically it.

If I'm able to submit verifiable proof of everything along the way, with photo's and everything, then I am able to defend myself on eBay just fine. The problem is that its not cost-efficient to do that.\n\nSpecifically, if a customer sends an item to me and the serial codes don't match, or if I add a sticker to the game and that sticker is gone upon arrival, or even if the condition is fundamentally different upon receipt of the return and I'm able to verify these problems with photographic proof, then eBay will side with me. Through just me explaining my problem in the case without photos, depends on the rep, but sometimes eBay will just eat the cost themselves to make both parties happy. That opportunity exists on eBay. \n\nOn Amazon, that opportunity does not exist. Amazon doesn't care whether the serial numbers match, the condition is different, or even if you got back a completely different game than the one you sent out. The risk of fraud is part of the cost of doing business on Amazon. Most of the time, Amazon will not even help you with a claim or a feedback unless your item matches the product details page 100%, and you have signature tracking on this item. Fortunately, those fraudulent people are in the vast minority of Amazon customers and most customers using the site know how to use it. ","353":"This is very true.

Each source of beermoney has its own Beginning Balance, Ending Balance, and Redemptions column, so that I only have to enter the numbers instead of looking stuff up and doing the math to figure out how much money I actually made for each. Also, since Bing lets you buy $5 SB\/Amazon for 475 points, and since other sites take out paypal fees or whatever, each earner also has a Multiplier column, so I can see how much I actually made vs. how many fake points I earned. Then of course there's a Totals Column and a Percentage column, so I can see what percentage of my monthly earnings came from each source.","355":"The grass is greener on Amazon because the sales man, the sales, holy shit the sales. My Amazon sales outpace my eBay sales 5 to 1. With eBay, you have to understand a few things before going on there. Understanding things like Order Defect Rate, How to list an item in a way that protects you from returns\/feedback\/cases\/defects, how to fight defects and cases, and more importantly, when you should just eat the cost \/ defect and not fight it any further.

Here, there is no Amazon. The average DVD will set you back $20-30, even if it's 10 years old. Video\/console games basically have 1 main vendor that dominates the market. They are able to rip people off on their trade ins as there is no where else for the user to sell. \n\n\"Competitor\" sites do a poor job, and don't address some specific needs of the seller and the customer, but they are still popular and people spent a lot of time trying to get the worth of the item they're selling. Plus, we're free. \n\nThe site is designed to run as a marketplace, not as you'd imagine Amazon, with huge amounts of stock in a warehouse. Users over the country will add their own products. Some might be regular households, some might be pawn shops, some might be established sellers that use Ebay and are looking for something that doesn't charge a commission. So currently, I appreciate the selection really isn't great. But we hope that will grow if\/when the site picks up popularity.\n\nYou're right, downloads are swiftly growing in popularity, but there is still a market for second hand (and new) media. It might not be the biggest, but a business doesn't need every person in the world as a customer, to be successful.

Most promotions are done to keep good talent from leaving when they get close to quitting.\n\nAt Microsoft, the easiest way to get promotions is to really get new jobs by changing teams.  Managers from other teams will recruit you extensively.\n\nYahoo, GE and Google are all mentioned in the article.\n\nThe reason Yahoo is getting all of the attention is because they're not successful.  They keep slipping further and further in obscurity.  Amazon, GE, Google and Microsoft don't have that issue.\n\nMy own personal experience from working within smaller companies is this though: Managers are given discretion about raises, promotions, etc.  There's no need for a stack rank.  Either you're meeting your goals, or you're not.  Nobody wants to deal with the nonsense of arbitrary buckets.\n\nThe point being, the issue is not with people having goals that they should hit.  That's a very basic, and well understood mechanism of motivation and performance review.  It provides something objective for employees to hit.  The issue is if you arbitrarily put people into buckets.  You cause issues for internal morale, and internal teamwork.  Depending on the company, it's performance and culture, some teams\/companies will have bigger issues than others.\n\nAnd lastly, what you end up doing is squeezing out your \"B\" level talent.  These are the people who keep your company running.  They're not the superstars, but the superstars don't want to do work that's boring to them.  So you have to keep them engaged on superstar work, but that means all of the boring work needs to go to either a) bored superstars who will quit if you're not exciting them enough or b) B grade workers who will do a good job on what you assign them, and are happy to do it.\n\nI don't believe that Amazon does the sweeping lowest 25% cuts anymore.  I believe Google does.  Or at least did.","368":"Amazon... You can easily get them for under 8 bucks. You can even find ones on there for 1-2 dollars, but they are hit and miss. I used to lose iphone chargers all the time, but the solution for me was this: stop moving chargers. Buy enough that you have chargers in locations you need them. I have a charger in my bed, a charger in the living room, a charger in the car, and one at work. No matter what the circumstances, no unplugging or moving these chargers. That's how I lose them.","369":"How does the Amazon ruling fit in to that?

The place I talked to was HUGE, they would bring in scrap glass via rail car from cities all over the state. \n\nIf you want to start a business around collecting bottles from bars you should look into making them into drinking glasses and reselling them to local gift shops and such. I used to do that a couple years ago. All you need is a 10\" tile saw with a diamond grit blade (Husquvarna GlasLok+ blade) and a wood lathe with a chuck on it. You cut the top off, chuck the half of bottle (soon to be a glass) into the lathe, start it up and hold a piece of sandpaper to the edge of the bottle to polish the edges. Start with 80 grit, then 220, then 320 and you'll have a super smooth edge.\n\nThe startup costs for this is about $600 or so. Especially if you have a Harbor Freight in your area. They're tools are hit or miss but I put 3-4000 bottles through their tile saw and it still runs great. And buy their 18\" benchtop wood lathe for spinning the bottles. They sell the 3-jaw chuck online, not in stores. The blades for the tile saw are about $90 apiece and sandpaper is cheap at Home depot. \n\nIt's a great business to run. You have your startup costs but once you get into it you're getting your source material for free (used bottles from restaurants). Most bartenders were happy to collect the bottles for me if I made them a set of glasses. \n\nHit up all the little gift shops in the area and sell em' on consignment. Hit up the bar supply shops, craft beer stores, etc. They do well at shows before the holidays too. I also sold them on Etsy, Amazon, eBay.\n\nedit: PM me if you want more info.

The gas discount is up to $1.00 off per gallon for max 35 gallons. You get the discount by spending money in the store. I believe it is $1 = 1 point. Once you accumulate 1000 points, you get the max discount (I assume it is a smaller discount if you have fewer points). So, spend $1000 on groceries (easy to do) and get your discount on gas. However, they have periods where they offer 2\/3\/4 times points on certain things, like gift cards. When the gift cards are 4X points, you buy a $250 gc for Amazon or the like and get your $35 off on gas. Even if you buy a pseudo cash gc like Visa or Amex and factor in the $3-5 activation fee, you are still ahead $30 with the max discount. \n\nIt makes the most sense to take full advantage of that 35 gallons, so they will have their wife meet them there and fill up the both cars or one guy has a handful of 5 gallon gas jugs he takes with him.\n\nHopefully that was clear. ","424":"If you don't mind a VoIP service, I've heard good things about [Ooma](http:\/\/www.ooma.com). You just have to buy the box, then the service is actually free! You only have to pay taxes, which in my area are less than $4\/month. This will vary by state. Ooma lets you keep your own number, if you want. \n\nAs for the internet, did you get your modem from Comcast? If so, you are likely paying a modem rental fee. You can most likely purchase your own modem (from a 3rd party; if Comcast sells them, they're probably really marked up). Comcast should have a list of compatible modems, if not, you can probably google around for it. Make sure it has all of the features you want. For instance, if you get just a standalone modem, you'll also need to get a wireless access point if you want to use wifi at home. They also sell devices that have several devices integrated into one unit. Comcast will probably try to scare you and tell you they won't give you tech support a modem you buy from a 3rd party, but that's not a big deal. \n\nOh, make sure they will remove the modem fee if you get your own. My ISP  charges you the rental fee even if you have your own modem. They claim it's \"policy\". \n\nMost TV networks (CBS, NBC, FOX, etc) will allow you to stream their shows on their websites for free. This is perfectly legal. There are also other places online you can stream shows. This is slightly less legal. Your local library also most likely has seasons of TV shows on DVD (and movies as well).  \nIf you already have Amazon Plus, you can stream some show for free from there. \n\nI'm curious how much you're paying for your cell phone. If you're not already using them, I'd highly recommend [Republic Wireless](https:\/\/www.republicwireless.com\/plans). They are very inexpensive, though you do have to buy one of their phones.

See if any of them are available on Netflix or Amazon Prime. If so great. If not, you'll have to find them elsewhere. Some networks let you stream shows free from their websites (all of the big OTA networks such as CBS, NBC, Fox, etc. allow this). Some shows even have their own websites where you can watch the show ([South Park](http:\/\/www.southparkstuidos.com)) for instance. Your local library also most likely has seasons of TV shows free on DVD. If they don't, they can likely get it. \n\nIf you're dead set on keeping this legal, you might check into [HBO Go](http:\/\/www.hbogo.com\/).

Idk if ESPN is available via a separate subscription. If you want to get CBS, you just have to have a digital TV (or a converter box) and an antenna. This will also allow you to get all or most of the other major networks, too (NBC, ABc, Fox, PBS, CW, et al). \n\nIs a DVR absolutely critical? If you're going to be watching most of these shows via streaming (Netflix, Amazon Plus, or whatever), you most likely won't need it. But if you want to record something from the OTA networks (CBS, et al), you might want a DVR. It's actually possible to build your own. You can create a very simple one by purchasing a digital TV Tuner Card for your PC (they presumably have them for laptops as well). You may need to connect an antenna to this. It should allow you to pick up the major networks and local programming. It should come with software allowing you to schedule and record the programs. If you want, but can build or buy a dedicated DVR (commonly also called a PVR) to put in your living room. There are a lot of tutorials online as to how to do this.

","432":"We are a household of two people and one dog living in an apartment of ~850 sq ft, and we find that it's totally worth it. The caveat for us is that we are within 7 miles of 3 different Costco locations, so we can go as often as we need to, and I think this makes the difference. We find that for the things we buy, Costco is relatively frugal, but it's not a one-size-fits-all model. Here are some examples of why Costco works for us, but this is not a comprehensive list.\n\nThings we buy frequently because they're almost always cheaper at Costco: organic eggs, apple chicken sausage, frozen green beans, frozen or fresh broccoli florets, bacon, organic butter, organic frozen fruit, bananas, plantains, various other produce, feta cheese, goat cheese, dog food, various cleaning products like lysol wipes, tide, bounce dryer sheets, fish oil pills, sudafed, gas\n\nThings we don't buy at Costco: most meat - we get better prices at our local grocery stores. Seafood seems more reasonably priced at Costco, though we don't buy it often.\n\nIncidentals purchased at Costco that were cheaper: tramontina baking sheets (about $8 for two when they were on sale), Kirkland brand Khakis for my husband for less than $20\/pair, wool socks, regular socks, Contigo mugs ($16 for 2 when on sale, compared to about $20 for one on Amazon), our toaster and immersion blender were also cheaper here than at Costco, and we've found 6-pack boxes of fluorescent light bulbs for less than $2 before. Back when we didn't have prescription insurance, Costco's price for inhalers was about $30 cheaper than the out of pocket cost at all other nearby pharmacies. \n\nI also buy my glasses and prescription sunglasses at Costco. I got Ray Ban glasses with prescription lenses and sunglasses with polarized prescription lenses for about $300 total, and the last time I bought glasses\/sunglasses was 4 years ago. \n\nWays to make your Costco membership count: Watch their monthly sale\/warehouse discount circulars closely. We never buy clorox or lysol wipes unless they're also on sale (they'll reduce the overall price by $2.50 or something like that). Be sure to price compare things at the per-unit price to your nearby grocery stores, factoring in couponing.\n\nThe reason Costco works for us, I think, is because we don't eat much processed food from cans or boxes (and these are the majority of items that we see coupons for). Furthermore, we're opportunistic about things that we want and wait for Costco to carry them.","433":"Oh!

There are 2 ways to increase what you have...either live on less and save more or make more so you have more. \n\nWhat are your hobbies or interests? Are you good at anything that you think other people might benefit from? What about your wife? Does she have any niche hobbies that she is good at? Do you or your wife have any skills that you think might benefit others that you enjoy doing or are you guys really good at your jobs? Can that knowledge be reproduced, repackaged and provided to others in the form of a service of some kind? \n\nI understand that your money is tight and you probably have very little to invest but consider this. You and your wife are very young...you are in your mid 20s. That means you have tons and tons of energy, stamina, and creativity. Use all of that to plant some seeds that might grow into something bigger. \n\nMy father was a technician and later Engineer all his life and for most of it he consulted on the side and did side freelance work out of his garage and home to as many people as possible. \n\nFigure out what you are good at or what you like to do and try to do that thing on the side in your spare time for others as a service or for yourself so you get better and better at your craft as that will lead to others wanting a pice of that end result that you create once you reach a certain level of skill. \n\nDon't invest any big money on any crazy ideas (you already got a phone and internet access and a car and storage\/work space), but just provide some small service and only spend money on things you absolutely need to make money and only when you need them not before. When you are doing something already for someone and you realize \"oh shit I wish I had this\" then it is time to go out and get it. (not before when you say if I had  X then I would do Y). Basically you want to figure out how to make due with what you got now. \n\nAnyway just my 2 cents. Cut out your misc expenses wherever possible as well as Fast Food. Instead try to buy wholesome food and make meals. If you spend money spend in on things that can make you more money. The only money you should spend is to take your wife out to dinner or on a date night so you aren't just cooked up at home all the time and to reward yourselves for some job well done. \n\nFigure out if you can make any money on the side with the tools, and parts you got in your garage...right now they are sitting there. Rent them or set up shop so that those tools become your tools to make side money with. \n\nIf you can't figure out what to do with them and your only excuse is I am going to have to replace them, then get rid of that shit its just taking up space and use your home space to have an office or work area from which you operate. Get rid of the storage space and if you need the tools then borrow them and only keep absolutely the essential stuff. \n\nIf you need startup equipment or things...ask around. Ask people if they have some of the stuff you need. Say you are trying to break out on your own and you need some extra things. Some people might have what you need and might give them to you or yo ucan trade your service for what they have starting out or offer a discount to them for it in exchange. It might be the older model but it will do the job until you have some income to get better stuff. \n\nDon't just get rid of stuff and downsize. Its a lose lose situation. Eventually new things will pop up (life emergencies and stuff that you don't expect or haven't planned for) that will drain everything you have no matter what you do. Think in terms of \"how can I make more, how can I market myself so that I get a better return\".\n\nConsider what you do for a living. Is there any way you can get more at your job as far as salary or cut down your hours but still get paid the same? is there any room to negotiate for offering some sort of other service or working a day from home or coming in at different times to free up a weekday or getting a raise? Is there anything you can do to increase your income or free up some extra time? Can you cut down from 50 hours to 40 hours or less while still making the same? is here anything you can do with minimal investment to get to the next level? Can your wife do something from home? \n\nDo whatever that might be to get that result (more time or more money). \n\nIf either of you stays home with the kids and you have wifi\/internet that means you have time\/ability to do something over the web to make money. You can watch the kids and sit in front of the computer if you have one  providing some sort of service or selling some sort of product and marketing it. \n\nIt might not seem viable to you at first glance because you have to raise a family and I am not saying do that right now. What I am saying is to start to reframe from a \"I am fucked what can I do?\" state of mind\" to a \"I have unique skills and abilities, how can I offer them to others for a fee or what can I make and sell that other people will pay for\".  What I am saying so that you start to plant some seeds by exploring your skills and thinking in terms of offering them as a unique service to others. \n\nStart researching some options....start tinkering with some things....ask around. You might know some people who do stuff on the side or who run a service or product business. Get their feedback on what they did to get started. Look into \/r\/freelance and look at other business\/entrepreneurship subreddits. \n\nYes all of this will take work and time and if you dismiss what I am saying then its most likely because you are still comfortable in your established routine. Fight it and begin to step outside of that bubble of thinking. Recognize that you have a family to raise and this is a marathon not a sprint. You need to start to think outside of the box and find creative ways to maximize your time and your value. \n\nif you can write or tell stories or use your voice (as in a recording) consider creating an information product\/e-book\/podcast\/video\/whatever or instructional manual of some sort and publishing it on Amazon or some other platform. Think of ways to help others fix problems you already fixed for yourself. Others might need help too, solving those same problems. \n\nInvest some of that misc money you are now blowing on some cheap hosting at like squarespace.com or WIX and put together a basic site that says \"I do X\". Spend $30 on some business cards that say \"My Name consulting service\" and start handing them out. Set your rate at like $65-75 an hour to start with. Knock on some doors. There are probably lots of businesses in the area or people who ight want your help. Give out some cards at church or when you hang out with others. Let people know you are now doing X whatever X is. Do it on weekends or make some calls from home to local businesses and ask if they need any help or what problems they are trying to solve to see if you can help. \n\nReframe into a mindset of wanting to make more not just spending less. Still you need a tight budget and a basic  ideology where you only spend money on things you need and only reward yourself with things you want only after you got paid and took care of the things you need not before. The idea here is to think of delaying instant gratification until you do whatever service you are going to be doing and imagine all the cool things you will have when you reached your goal. \n\nYou would be amazed what you can create when you put your mind to it or when you walk away from your current habit that you are stuck in. Half the shit you have you probably can go without or you don't need at all. They are just distractions that are sucking your life away. \n\nWhen I ran into some financial difficulties I cut off everything from Netflix to my Sprint phone to going out to bars, alcohol and eating out. I sold most of my shit in my home and in the garage and never looked back. Even my TV...never even bought a new one later to replace it. \n\nFor example you can get a nice Android 4.4 Kitkat Smartphone (4.0+ inch quad core 1.2 with 16MB ram) for $75 on sale at Walmart from Boost Mobile. (the one I bought was $75 or $125 half off). No contract and I own the phone immediately. Its comparable to my old Samsung Galaxy 2 in performance. Good enough for business. \n\nI paid like $90-$100 with all taxes, fees and whatever. Boost Mobile cards were $35 for 1GB data and unlimited text and talk. $45 for 5GB down and unlimited text and talk. I don't know if they have a similar plan now . All I pay now is $45 a month and use Google Voice in addition for a business number and at home when I am on the computer. (which also is set up on my cell phone so I can take both calls).  \n\nSimilarly Sprint has a great family plan and there is a subreddit here where you can join other people's family plans and have your own account with your own billing for unlimited and pay like $30 a month on your own separate account (its like a referral). \n\nLots of ways to cut down. When you cut out the shit that distracts you from your life you will find out that you have lots of time to be creative and it will free your mind to figure shit out. The thing is cutting things only gets you so far. The next step is thinking of ways to make more. \n\nYou already bring something unique to the table now you just need to figure out how to make a buck out of it. \n\nedit:grammar\/spelling\/small typos","447":"Yeah, the only benefit is gas.

For those that don't know, this is \"Mechanical Turk\" which is a service through Amazon where you, the \"worker\", do \"human intelligence tasks\". This means things like partake in a brief research survey for a University or company, do some sort of simple task, etc. etc. etc. I actually got quite good at it, and was making an easy $50 per day in my free time while listening to music or doing it at work when things were slow as I had the sort of job that I could swing this at.\n\nSome of the tasks were quite interesting, many were very boring, some were easy and others were time consuming. I got pretty adept at doing \"high paying\" (I.E. $1\/task) that took like 3-5 minutes. Sometimes you'd get lucky and find a batch of tasks that paid well abd you'd be set for a day...I found a few that paid $10-12 and took about 45 minutes to complete.\n\nUltimately, I didn't do MTurk very long, probably about a month, and made $600. The reason I stopped is because it just became too tedious for me. At the same time, my job became much more demanding and I got a raise, but I did go pretty hardcore for that month to help pay for a sweet roadtrip. If you have a desk job with a lot of freedom and the ability to do whatever (without it negatively impacting your work obviously, though it's really none of my concern about the ethical nature whether you should be doing this at work...) or don't mind spending a bit of time in front of the computer, it's not a bad way to supplement your income.\n\nMany will argue that getting even the most menial part-time job would likely have larger finanical gains, but I would respond by saying that as a professional I really didn't feel like devoting a lot of time to this, didn't feel like answering to a boss for some potentially menial job, could do this from home whenever I wanted or even during work, and could stop whenever I felt like it. Personally, the benefits far outweighed the costs when it came to MTurk vs. a part time job on top of my full-time.","473":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n If you are requesting Amazon, [W] Amazon, please do not include a dollar amount.

Budget: You need a better idea of your budget than this.  How much do you spend on cars, food, baby, etc.?  I can guarantee that it's more than you think. Mint.com can do this for you based on your credit cards.  It's a scientific approach.  You can't solve a problem you haven't actually measured.\n\n2. Mortgage: your mortgage is way too high for your after tax income.  There is no way around this.  If you aren't underwater, it's time to bail.\n\n3. Cell phones: Move to Cricket ($35 per month for unlimited calls, texts, and data with 1 GB at 4G\/rest at 3G on AT&amp;T's very good network with no contract).  You can get referrals on Reddit for nice discounts.  They have free phones after rebate.  You can have essentially all the functionality you like for way less money.\n\n4. Landline and Cable: Landlines are an unnecessary legacy product.  Get Netflix or Amazon Prime and use an antenna for your TV.  You internet will increase in cost, but you will save a lot of money overall.  Absolutely need NFL?  An online \"follow your team\" pass costs $99 per year.  Plug in a cheap, used computer to your TV and you're good (or perhaps Chromecast, Amazon Fire, etc has it.\n\n5. Utilities: Your electricity and oil are also very high for the continental US given the implied size of your house from the mortgage.  I rent in the coldest part of the country and one of the most expensive for energy.  My mortgage would be around the same.  My utility bills are a fraction of yours.  Turn off lights\/devices you aren't using.  Dress your two year old warmer in winter.  Insulate your home with window seals and around doors.  Drop your house to 66 degrees in winter and allow higher temperatures in summer.  I guarantee that you are doing many things very wrong in this category.  You should be able to literally cut this category in half.\n\n6. Financing: Earn at least 2% cash back on your credit card purchases.  You pay off your accounts every month so interest is less relevant.  The Citi Double Cash card offers this.  Get it and make it your primary card for things that are not higher % cash back on your other cards.  Your savings accounts should be in high interest online banks.  GE Capital Bank pays 1.05%.  That's $588 per year before taxes.  If you are earning 0.2% in a shitty bank, move the money now.","508":"Respectfully, I disagree (somewhat).

I was living in Los Angles from 19-23 after starting my first business and I looked at my \"friends\" one day and realized ALL of them were going nowhere.  I moves across the country and switched it up.  I started my business with no contacts and it has been just over 3 years as of now.  I am located in Tampa.  I sell physical products so I end up at some trade shows (Catalyst, ASD, Home and Houseware).  I like to think I am pretty fun and likable and I feel like I have met a lot of entrepreneurs that way.\n\nSome examples of how networking worked out for me:\n\nI was on a message board for a software I use (Shipworks) a couple years ago and someone was talking about an inventory software.  I was interested so I let them pitch me. Come to find out, it is an up and coming software with less than 40 customers.  This led me to becoming friends with the CEO as we see each other at conferences a couple times a year.  I built my own app that is similar and he has helped me with the process.\n\nReddit -  I have met the following people on Reddit:\nI started a business with a Redditor that lives in China.  We source products together.\nI tried another business with a  Redditor who built a website for a single product.  It did not work out so now he is working on a site for all of our products.\nI cannot program so I found someone on Reddit that built 2 apps for me. \nI found someone on Reddit that fixes my IT issues at work.\n\nI sell on Ebay and Amazon.  I was looking for an \"Expert\" that could help me so I searched Craigslist.  I found 2 guys that teach classes for low level sellers.  I called them up and found out they are at the same level I am.  We currently do business together and also formed a local meetup for Amazon sellers.  It just so happens they have trouble with importing so I am now importing products for them using my partner in China.\n\nI basically network every chance I get.  The situations above contain some luck but they only happen because I am always looking to work with others and keep an open mind.  I kind of go by the \"throw everything at the wall and see what sticks\" model.  I like talking business more than anything.  So much, that I really don't have much to say to others that do not want to talk business.  I use other options like Score, YEC, local chambers. I have some people local but the most valuable people I have networked with all live in other states or countries.  If you do conferences or trade shows, a lot of good networking can be done around alcohol and just being a likable and fun person.  I know this does not work for everyone but I have opened a lot of relationships outside of a business setting.  I have done the formal networking events but my best networking seems to come at random times and is a direct result of always putting myself out there.","519":"...  but you created this thread to complain about how Amazon is selling the 3DS for $120.

The issue of people with money not caring about saving money is invalid.  People with money did not get there by overspending.  Also, a lot of people shop online for the convenience.  I have a buddy that sells name brand last season clothing to the tune of about 10M in revenue a year.  There is 100% a market for these items.  \n\nIf you ask an outlet manager about buying up their stuff in bulk, there is a very good chance they may not sell to you.

We use Shipworks software to pull these orders from the MPs in the morning.  The items are sorted by SKU and shipping method although you can use Shipworks filters to sort your orders a million ways.  \n\nWe then highlight all similar items and select the method to ship.  Labels are generated to our thermal printer and packing slips are also printed.  The labels are stacked on a table and 1 of 3 packers then grabs the labels and picks the products.  They then pack the products and put them in a bin.\n\nWe also use SkuVault to manage our inventory.  When a label is generated, that inventory automatically pulls from our warehouse.  Our locations are also stored in the software.  We do a lot of daily deal sites so if we have 2K orders on a Monday, 1,500 may be just 2-5 products.  My guys pack between 40 and 50 items per hour.
