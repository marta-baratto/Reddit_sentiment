{"id":"3njyp4","author":"DanTheManWithAPlan","body":"**eBay**\n\neBay is probably the bread and butter to all online ecommerce marketplaces. It’s used around the world and most known for finding “cheap alternatives” for items online.\n\neBay is perhaps the most seller-centric of all the online selling options. While other websites center around which products are for sale, eBay centers around which sellers are offering any given product. \nOn the other hand, eBay has been a bit in flux lately. They’ve been spinning off or dropping major parts of their services, such as PayPal, and claim to be entering “a new chapter”. \nIn short, eBay is a great place to begin selling and a great way to make some extra side cash.\n\n**Amazon**\n\nMany of you have shopped on Amazon before. It’s large inventory base, fast shipping, and easy checkout makes the entire shopping experience a breeze. Most people did not know they can sell their personal branded items on Amazon as well.\n\nAmazon has an advantage that Ebay does not have: its customer base. It’s almost impossible to compete with the exposure or potential purchases that Amazon can offer third-party sellers. You can google any item, and Amazon, without a doubt will be ranked on top. \nAmazon’s goal is to keep its customers happy, and it shows. Millions subscribe to Amazon Prime and untold numbers more frequent their website on a regular basis. \nSellers may need to price higher to beat Amazon to the Buy Box, but there’s a reason all or most major sellers have a presence on this platform. They’re also headed towards the drone delivery field!\n\n**Jet.com**\n\nJet’s the new startup on the block, Jet promises to feature the cheapest prices on the market. They’ve come up with a streamlined process for selling that saves money for all parties involved, including third-party sellers. For instance, shoppers are encouraged to buy multiple products from the same seller so that the seller can ship it all in one box, or will strongly push the shopper to buy from the seller closest to him, to save both sides money on shipping. \nWhat’s great about Jet is that it is still rather new. Good things happen when you enter the game early, so here’s your chance to leverage Jet’s benefits and make some magic happen.\n\n**Taobao**\n\nTaobao is China’s personal ebay. It’s a pain to get your item listed and noticed on Taobao, but you can always leverage people in China to do it for you. There’s a type of business in China called, “Taobao buying agent service”. These people help you list your brand on Taobao and help you deal with all the sales side.\n\nSo why list on Taobao if it’s such a pain? Taobao has a bigger user base than Ebay and you’re attacking a market in a country that is populated and crazy about online shopping. More people shop online in China than around the entire world.\n\n**Your website**\n\nThis is probably your best option because you have full ownership of your own products, brand, rules, and most importantly your reputation. If one day eBay decides to shut down, all your inventory and listings will be gone. There will be no way for you to notify your loyal customers and you might just go bankrupt.\n\nWith your own ecommerce store, you have full control of what’s going on. You have a list of customers and their contact information and you have full control of how regular shoppers find you around the web. You can also run native advertising to drive more sales.\n\nSource: http://blog.shoprocket.co/which-ecommerce-platform-is-best-for-your-online-business/","name":"t3_3njyp4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-05 10:55:39","week":41}

Thought it might be spam, but if you press 'reply,' the email address was selling-services@amazon.com(amazon domain).. So I entertained it.  \n\nWent through a little back-and-forth with the application, a questionnaire, they asked for 3 customer referrals, etc. Then today receive email we were accepted. I think it's legit Amazon because instead of following the link in the email, I google searched to that part of their website and voila, I was (still) logged in from the registration I did from the email link, even though I came in to the site another way.

{"id":"3nlx2g","author":"pierreglendinning","body":"The best format for selling clothes on eBay (they'll tell you) is Buy It Now listings with free shipping and best offer. This is according to other flippers' testimony, and also the structure of economic incentives on eBay (free BIN listings, some search optimization for free shipping). Clothing, they'll tell you, is an item that will sit on your shelf for months.\n\n\nI have been flipping clothes for a living for a year, exploring this conventional wisdom. This winter it seemed like eBay was leaning hard away from the auction format, trying to live in Amazon's world. I tested all BIN, free shipping, Best Offer for a while. It did not work like I hoped (I sold a lot less, continually cut prices to try to sell more). \n\n\nThis format has the most direct pricing for buyers, and in principle sellers sell more things because of their low price. But people don't pull the trigger to buy clothes just because they are the cheapest (as you might for, say, printer ink). There isn't a totally direct correlation between the price of a sweater and how fast it sells (you could sell the same sweater to the same customer for $15.99 or $24.99 within the same span of time).\n\n\nA few months ago I started experimenting with auctions again and I have been happy with the results. I sold $3000 net last month of mostly men's vintage clothes. Here are some observations:\n\n\n* Desirable clothing on auction sells faster than BIN. For my most desirable clothes, an auction means I know they will sell in a week. However the same clothes on BIN will accrue views and watchers, but usually take much longer to actually turn back into money. The auction format adds some pressure for people to push the button at a certain time.\n\n* Bidding wars still happen. We wish everything got bid up, and it doesn't happen super often, but it happens often enough to justify auctions. All it takes is two people that want the same thing. I can sell Ralph Lauren shirts on BIN for around $16.99; at auction I have shirts that sold for $35, $50+ in the past few weeks. I would never list these shirts BIN for that much money. \n\n* Auctions aren't that expensive. They used to be free with free re-listings, now they're $.25 / week, but you get it back if it sells (so it's like $.25 if it will sell in two weeks, and $.20 if it sells BIN within two weeks). I would list more auctions if they were cheaper (I've got 300 listed, about 50 auctions). Perhaps 1 in 5 auctions I have sells for more than the minimum bid; but this extra profit ($5-$25 more) easily pays for the fees cost of the stuff that doesn't sell.\n\n* Auctions make eBay more fun. I turned off Best Offer -- my eBay account had turned into a stream of people haggling with me. eBay became bidders trying to bid me down, instead of each other up. Now I'm excited to see whatever happens unexpectedly in my account. I think auctions can be fun for buyers too, add some emotion to the game, and make the clothing seem more desirable.\n\n* I mostly charge for shipping, a flat $6 or $4. I like the idea of the buyer seeing that part of their money is going to the Post Office, acknowledging them as a third party, and the (definitely not free) energy costs of getting a thing to them.\n\n\nI get that auctions are old school, but so are many of eBay's users. People will still participate in auctions out there. Not everyone cares about one hour delivery on the thing they buy on the Internet. Are you other clothing flippers on the auction train?\n\n","name":"t3_3nlx2g","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-05 21:00:08","week":41}

{"id":"3nqbt6","author":"jrossetti","body":"Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/3lcw6x/check_out_this_gem_of_a_return_policy_by_a_third/\n\nSo after about 20 messages back and forth, several where I pointed out to them what the policy was on Amazon.  Pointing out they were not allowed to charge me insurance, restocking, return shipping, and must give a full refund resulted in them saying they could no longer help me unless I called their warehouse to troubleshoot.   \n\nSo began the waiting game.  I sent a final message reiterating every violation they did including the intentional overcharge of shipping and refusal to refund that. \n\nA couple of days later I get a notice that a decision has been made on my A to Z claim.  Of course you can't tell from the title and have to click through so i'm hoping things are okay. (Item was $95 bucks)\n\nJust flat out laid the hammer on the seller.  Full refund, don't have to return the item at all and apparently they are investigating them for the shipping claims after I pointed out several sellers have commented on their feedback.  \n\nThis guy had thousands and thousands and thousands of feedback.  Do not think that lots of feedback is ever a determiner of someone doing something right.  More often the case is no one has taken then to task for their bullshit.  \n\nMorale of the story and why I posted it here.  Amazon is NOT Ebay.  You cannot make up any rules you want, you have a bare minimum to follow. Your return policy must meet or exceed Amazons.  You cannot provide less them than in ANY area.  Don't be that person who loses his/her account over some bullshit.  \n\n*Edit: (I was referring to Amazon and Ebay are different. You can't just write what you want on your return policy and decline returns like this guy did. I can definitely put those kinds of rules on Ebay though.\nOn Ebay you CAN decline returns assuming you set it up that way and you can put additional terms or conditions in a way you cannot do on Amazon.*\n\n\nLastly, if you buy something on amazon, dont take shit from third party sellers.  There are rules that are to be followed on Amazon and I feel no sympathy for those who can't abide by it.  If they dont follow policy, A to Z them and be done.  Just give em 2 business days to do you right as YOURE required because most sellers will fix their mistakes. \n\n\nCoup de grace?  I called the manufacturer, filed, and received a replacement under the manufacturers warranty which is all I wanted to begin with except it wasnt my job to pay for the sellers issue.  It was their job to fix and they refused to follow policy and lose the claim and sale.  \nedit:  Proofread fail.\n\n","name":"t3_3nqbt6","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-06 19:27:28","week":41}

{"id":"3nv2fk","author":"RiceIsTheLife","body":"I've hit rock bottom and it's the absolute lowest I've ever been. I'm doing nothing, eating very little, and want out of this situation.  \n\nNow, I should probably clarify. Even with all this crap I am dealing with, I have **NEVER** in my entire life felt so happy and content. Which is odd. But, I guess having absolutely nothing really does change your perspective on life. I am getting straight A+ in my classes, I'm in the top 5 percent of a couple hundred agents in my company, I'm meeting new people, and I'm truly happy.\n\nI'm currently 24, working full-time with a decent 9 to 5 job, and am a part-time student. I know that 24 is not \"old\" but I'm also not as young as I was and I have made terrible financial decisions that could easily bleed over into my 30s. Which is not the least be okay with me as I have goals. Which I will meet but I need to figure out how I am going to get there as soon as possible. For example: I want to travel, move, hangout with friends, date, be able to eat more than rice... and simply... Live Life. Due to recently \"errors\" and miss communications with my apartment complex I had to pay upwards of $800 to settle the miss communication which ultimately dried up every penny I had been trying to save.\n\nTLDR of my intro. Rock bottom. No money. Ive never been happier. I need help.\n\n\nSo, I'll just lay those wonderful cringe worthy balances and bills out. \n\nEdit* I should have probably clarified: Gross: $1700 Take home: $1300\n\n--Mandatory Expenses--\n\n* Rent: $445/month\n* Electric: $30 average\n* Renters Insurance: $205 /yr\n* Car Insurance: $ 330/6 month\n\n---Slightly Optional----\n* T-Mobile: $90/month\n* Student Loans: $18,000 - $120/month\n\n-----Credit Cards-------\n\n* Capital One: Max: $1250  Rate @ 22.90%  Balance $1,156    Monthly: $37.00\n* Chase:         Max  $3500  Rate @ 22.99%\t Balance: $3,395   Monthly: $135.00\n* Bestbuy:      Max: $1100  Rate @ 25.24%   Balance: $969     Monthly: $30.00\n* Newegg:      Max: $2000  Rate @ 25.99%  Balance: $1933     Monthly: $61.00\n* Amazon:      Max: $1400  Rate @ 25.99%  Balance: 1462      Monthly: $46.00\n* JCPenney:    Max: $1400  Rate @ 26.99%  Balance $464       Monthly: $25.00\n\nCombine Credit Card Balance: $9400\nMonthly Credit Card payments: $335\n\nTotal Average Monthly cost of just bills: $1100\n\nThis does not include books, food, gas, spending money, or anything else. That is simply how much I pay per month to prevent my credit from flopping and to keeping a roof over my head. I have no finances to fall back on. I have a car which is worth less than $2,000 and its falling apart. The most expensive possession I own, that is worth anything, is my PC (Maybe $1,000 to $1,500). \n\n\nI simply do  not know what to do, where to start, who to speak too, ways to pay off these debts... Which, is why im reaching out to you wonderful people.\n\nIf you've made it this far you're awesome. I would value any advice or opinions on how to get kick this debt asap. Thank you!

{"id":"3nvor4","author":"blakmirror","body":"It’s Amazon course season again and I have to tell you don not buy these courses for abhorrent prices.   There is so much free information on the Internet it should be a crime to charge so much.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI see a rise in posts concerning Amazon and decided to re-up my post with a few updates.  Today, I'm going to save you $6000 (keep in mind there are many complexities to Amazon you will not run into 99.9% of them) \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s been a full five months since my last post and there is absolutely nothing new occurring in the marketplace.  Do not fall for them giving you the basics and claiming they have some “secret” inside.   You want a community of people, join the many Facebook group, you’ll be okay without them.  Need a guru(s) to follow try a podcast like SellerDojo.com.  Simply follow the steps below and add a little ingenuity and you can have a successful private label business.  I suggest going after lower competition products at this time (average number of reviews less than 600). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf any of you have Facebook, and have any entrepreneurial aspirations you have seen it. It’s Amazon course season and the prices are more ridiculous than ever. So I’m a going to tell you to push the pause button on buying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese courses promise you the world. They offer “masterminds” cool software, and fancy getaways to Vegas, maybe even Miami. Well, I have made this post to steer you in the right direction and tell you everything you need to succeed in the products business. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUpfront Costs\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStarting small with $500 is ideal because you want to test your product before diving in.   Of course, shipping and other fees can put a hankering on this budget it may not be realistic at this point in the game.  It is important you start with the least amount of money/inventory possible.  Do not be a miser, but do not go overboard when it comes to how much inventory you purchase. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven if you think you have found a great product, anything could happen.  Hollywood’s glamorous tales of entrepreneurship simply choose to skip over testing as a part of good business.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf something goes wrong you will need the resources to rebound.  So be smart and have intentions of starting small. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo profit massively and have free time on your hands use FBA, Fulfillment by Amazon.  You will need a Professional Seller account. It is $40.00 bucks a month. Don’t cry these cost is necessary as there are many benefits to this service.  For those in foreign (non-US) countries with your own Amazon (France, UK, Canada) I suggest starting in the US marketplace.  You simply register your business in your local government.  Register your business with the US federal government (you will receive a FEIN number).  You would then use this FEIN to register with all the states Amazon FBA warehouses are stored in. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere some additional benefits for applying to Amazon FBA program. \n1.\tNo having to hold product in your house\n2.\tNever having to buy your own shipping supplies\n3.\tNo daily trips to the post office\n4.\tNo matter how many units you sell the cost is always $40 (plus fees from each sale)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCreate a Brand\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe nature of any Internet marketing is the niche. Pick a product category you are interested in and that makes money. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe top categories on Amazon are Supplements, Health and Beauty, Kitchen and Dining, and Mobile Accessories. There are other categories, but these are the major players. Choose a category with low competition your rise to the top will be quick. Choose a high competition category and moderate success can still be very profitable. It is best to aim for a mix of both, although it comes down to preference. A creation of multiple brands might become a must for the more lucrative entrepreneur. Two lower competition categories are “Sports and Outdoors” and “Travel”…you are very welcome. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe In-Demand Product\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is the hardest part of the journey. Luckily, Amazon has a ranking system.  This is called the “best seller rank.”   Additionally, you may want to make Google Trends your best friend. You can consider any product that is in the 1-2000 range as a good in demand.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo find products past the 100 BSR mark use this search string on Google: [\"Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #200 in Kitchen &amp; Dining\" site: Amazon.com] Replace the desired best seller rank number and replace the desired category you want as well.  Sometimes the number you want will not come up, the results will jump around, this is because of Google's algorithms concerning traffic and the fluctuations of the best seller ranks on Amazon.  Amazon is vast and ever-changing Google simply cannot keep up. You can consider any product that is in the 1-2000 range as a good in demand.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDo not get hung up on trying to find the “perfect” product. You want to build a brand; you will be investing in many products. See your products as stocks or investments. Make sure your product is lightweight and small to help you when it comes to shipping cost.   All your products do not have to be in the 1-2000 BSR range, in fact, up to 10,000 BSR is perfectly fine.  Do your research on regulations and certifications for your product in your country (ex. Supplements and electronics, I do not suggest these on your first go around).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSourcing \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother level of difficulty, but you can make it easier if you know what you’re doing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTwo ways to source: You can Google [private label/wholesale/OEM (insert product name here)] –or- you go to these sites (a couple tips next to each):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlibaba.com: When looking at manufacturers use Gold Suppliers with one million in sales. A tip to avoid getting scammed is using Paypal instead of a bank transfer. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAliexpress.com: wholesale marketplace, smaller order quantities, not for long-term purchases\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDhgate.com: Wholesale marketplace, full OEM services sometimes, free shipping sometimes (free shipping is a huge plus)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWHEN SOURCING PRODUCT ALWAYS ASK FOR SAMPLE, NO EXCEPTIONS\n\n&amp;nbsp\n\nTrust me, save yourself the headache. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShipping\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you can get free shipping go for it. Shipping is a lot to fit in here. But it is not complicated at all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCourses try to confuse you, to make you think it is difficult, but it is not. Factories have a lot of experience and can guide you through the process you follow. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWant more details you go to: http://www.chinaimportal.com/blog/sea-freight-shipping-from-china-guide/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCustom fees and charges come when shipping products that have a combined value of $2000.  If you are shipping by sea you will need the help of a freight forwarder.  Google can assist you in finding a good freight forwarding company. Calculate custom charges and shipping cost before it arrives, you do not want any surprises. \nYou need help talk to a freight forwarder. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFBA Requirements\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMake sure you are not shipping more products than you are allowed to have. You will begin with 5000 unit limit, unless your product is oversized like a yoga mat (then you are limited to 500). \n \n&amp;nbsp\n\nHave your supplier limit any additional instructions or papers on outside of the boxes your product is shipped in. Amazon provides a shipping label; tell your supplier it should be the largest thing outside the box. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYour product should have what is called a UPC, you buy one here: https://www.cheap-upc-barcode.com/bc_cheap.php\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf this is not present in barcode form on your packaging, you will need stickers applied to the packaging of each item you ship. Sometimes your factory will provide this service free, or Amazon can apply them for you for a fee. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI usually have my first package from a new supplier shipped to my house first to see if they followed my instructions. After the initial shipment, which should be small, I then ship them off to the assigned FBA warehouse. After correcting the factory you should be able to have them send your products directly in to the FBA warehouses. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow your Products on Amazon\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3 things matter on Amazon, NOTHING ELSE.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPICTURES: Picture quality correlates with sales, this is not a theory this is fact. Stock photos from your manufacturer are not going to cut it. You need pictures that feature your packaging and cast your product in a professional light. Follow Amazon’s rules regarding pictures like representing the actual quantity you are selling in your main photo.  For example, if you are selling your product in packs of two your main photo should have two products. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nREVIEWS: You will need them to get sales. Start with friends and family, if they are not supportive do a giveaway on niche forums and Reddit, get their email address, bug them respectfully until they leave a review.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSALES: You will need them to bump your BSR. This raises you for keywords your product should appear for in Amazon’s search result pages.  After about 20 or so reviews from redditors, friends, and family then go to a…\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLaunch Service\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe “big” secret courses are pushing. You probably heard of Zonblast, great but overpriced. A cheaper service to get the same exact results: Viral-Launch.com\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFollow up with customers who take part in your launch for reviews. You are buying reviews and a bump in keyword ranking.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRepeat/Diversify your Bonds\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh, you’ve gotten some success…selling about 20-30 a day now with no ad dollars spend on your part. Good, pick another product and start again within your brand.\nThen create a new brand and begin again. \nRepeat, repeat…diversify your bonds (brands)\nAnyone can do this… it is easy. I even revealed the “secret”… the launch service.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy US Platform\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI want to highlight again that you should start with the US platform.  This platform has the most traffic so it will be easier to get traction. There are also more services that can benefit you that work the Amazon US api.  Services that can assist you in finding the right keywords:  Merchantwords.com and AMZShark.com.  Services that operate as software suites to aid you in your business and help you run it on autopilot: Amazooka.com.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPersonal Crusade Rank (feel free to skip over just a message)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am really getting sick of the parroting that occurs on the Internet.  All the articles spout the same information and use the same words without testing and seeing what is actually effective.  This leads to entrepreneurs throwing things at the wall.  Amazon has been cracked all you need is the resources and time to put in the work to build your business.  If you are having trouble the symptom is most likely you picked a product with too much competition or a product with no real advantage when it comes to quality or features and do not have the resources to swing yourself into the positive. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPick your niche, find your product, find your keywords to target, promote…that’s really it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDropship stores are getting popular, but remember you will have to fight for traffic and trust from customers.  Marketplaces like Amazon make it easier to get a foothold.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFacebook ads and other PPC platforms including Amazon’s:  These will not save a business they are merely tools that will add revenue, most of the time you will receive average results. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just saved you $6000 dollars.\n\n","name":"t3_3nvor4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-07 21:46:28","week":41}

Fast forward 7 weeks and I have recently received one of the books, and it is a cheap international edition. I haven't even received the other 25 books. I messaged the seller a few times last week, but he never responded. It seems like the obvious thing to do is file A-Z claims, but I don't want to open up 26 claims since that might flag my account and Amazon might ban me. What would you guys suggest that I do?

{"id":"3nzu9p","author":"throwawayeveryday7","body":"Hello forum this is my first post.\n\nI have a lot of credit card debt and some medical bills.  Objectively, it is not a lot of debt.  But it is for me and my current income.  \n\nI am working on increasing my income by looking for extra work.  \n\nBut the problem is mostly my personal failure to stick to my budget.\n\nI have enough money to live comfortably and I have tried making a budget.   \n\nI repeatedly fail to stick to my budget. I have changed and altered the budget to try to be more \"realistic\" but really, I'm just not sticking to what is a reasonable budget. \n\nI have made progress in terms of cutting down large frivolous expenses. I used to make large frivolous purchases, and I have stopped doing that.\n\nBut I still spend a little bit of money here and there and everywhere, on things I do not really *need.*  Small daily or weekly purchases that add up.  \n\nExamples: Cigarettes. Starbucks.  A random sandwich or salad for lunch from somewhere.  4 new tires when I only really needed 2. Random drug store purchase of a random nail polish or mascara when I am already there for something I actually do need. Books. Amazon lets me \"one click buy\" and so I stock up on things I don't read.  Music.  New headphones when the ones I have are fine.\n\nI am aware of these random purchases, but my issue seems to be two things:  1. when I cut back on a particular random purchase, I alternatively make different new random purchases. 2. It would appear I really lack foresight.  I know these things right now when I am typing this, but not when I am out seeing things and buying things.\n\nI am reading over the tips on this forum.  I do not have debt big enough to need to do anything drastic.  I have bad credit so I can't balance transfer. It is mainly my consumer credit card, and also I have some medical bills.  I have not yet done anything about the medical bills.  I make the minimum payments on my credit card and I have stopped using it. However, realistically I think I could pay more on the credit card, as well as address the medical bills, if I learned to actually stick to what I believe to be a quite reasonable budget.  \n\nI am annoying myself a lot at this point. I used not to care about my money issues and decided many months ago that I actually do. Now my credit sucks and while I am far from in a great financial position, I could be doing better than I am.\n\nHas anyone had a similar situation of poor spending habits and money-management skills, that could help me with my issues with poor spending? This is less about me not knowing what to do about the debt, and more about my own problems with spending and money management.  \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI fail to stick to a reasonable budget due to my poor spending habits in many small random purchases","name":"t3_3nzu9p","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-08 19:22:51","week":41}

{"id":"3o11t2","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Kirsty Millar. I have always had a passion for animals and business. Back in 2005, I married my two loves and started my own professional dog walking and pet sitting service: www.pawsinthepark.com.au. \n\nTen years on, I have streamlined my business to operate completely online which I am able to run from anywhere in the world.  I had the luxury of studying my Master’s degree in Los Angeles for three years whilst still running my business in Perth, Australia. On average I work one to two hours per day and my business currently grosses almost $200,000 per year. My plan is to expand my business nationally across Australia, then into New Zealand and the UK. My goal in the next year is to make it a million dollar business.\n\nIn addition to animals, I have two other big passions: Writing and helping people. I firmly believe that if people follow their passion, they will contribute more positively in our world. This thought inspired me to write a manual to help other people who were passionate about animals and business to start their own dog walking and pet sitting business. \n\nI am giving away my e-book manual for FREE just over this weekend. It’s available on Amazon / Kindle (or you can download it directly to your browser from any computer). \n\nThe link is here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IRNTM9C . It stays free until the 12th (it normally costs $3). \n\nI am sure a lot of people are wondering how this type of business might work for them. \n\nSo in this thread in my next posts, I’ll explain…\n\n-\tSome basics about this industry.\n-\tHow to first get started as a dog walker, what to expect, etc.\n-\tTurning it into a business, hiring staff.\n-\tPrice points\n-\tManaging a business like this from your laptop.\n-\tAnd more. Please ask questions here. \n\nThanks for reading my post and I hope I can help out some fellow entrepreneurs on here. \n","name":"t3_3o11t2","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-10-09 00:21:52","week":41}

{"id":"3o1vxa","author":"StudentThrowaway01","body":"When I was 17, I was accepted to a prestigious university straight out of high school, but during my stay there, I agonized with procrastination and not knowing how to live on my own.  After multiple semesters of failing many of my classes, I was academically dropped twice.  I resigned to my home state where the tuition was much cheaper, and with my original state scholarship there along with financial aid, I was being paid to take classes at a local community college.  I spent my time there growing personally, and in time, I began to love to learn--so much in fact that I took numerous classes unrelated to my major, enrolling in 18-21 hour semesters just for the sake of learning.  I even invested my extra money into online retail where I learned the wonders of mostly passive income--something I intend to restart once I have the money again.  All this was hard work, but I did it.\n\nPresent day, many years later, I'm a 23-year-old (24 in two days) part-time computer science student in university who has done a lot of growing up but still isn't completely independent.  I'm nearing completion in a year, but it's a year that I will struggle with.  All those classes that I enrolled in during my time at the college have come to bite me in the butt.  I no longer have financial aid due to excess hours, and my scholarship is on its last year.  The money I accumulated from my online retail is gone to paying rent, and for the past few months, I've remorsefully asking my parents for help with rent, which they gladly paid but via their credit cards which are nearing their max.  I never wanted to involve them and do not wish to impose on them any further.\n\nBecause I have no car, I freelance online (15-25/hr) and have been since February of this year.  I have 33 hours/week allotted in my schedule to work, but work has been dry for the past three months, and though it looks to be improving, I'd be lucky to average $200 a week right now.\n\nMy **debts** are as follows:\n\n* Amazon store card: $750 ($300 of which does not need to be paid until Feb. 2016)\n* Capital One 360 overdraft line of credit: $180\n* Tuition remaining: $300\n* **Total**: $1,230\n\nI did not include my student loans because they are not my immediate concern.  I realize my debts aren't as overwhelming as they are compared to others I have read around here, but I'm at a point in my life where I need to move into financial stability and independence.\n\nMy monthly **costs** are as follows:\n\n* Rent: $600\n* Food: $170\n* Phone: $33\n* Protein powder: $73\n* Misc/unplanned expenses: $75\n* **Total**: $951\n\nToday I began the application for unemployment benefits, though it is something that I am not counting on.  The last time I checked two months ago, my credit score was ~705, and I fear that if I do not deal with my current debt, I will lose such a decent number for my age.  Since the beginning of summer, I also intended to buy a $2K Honda Civic this semester, but I've now accepted that will have to wait.\n\nWork is not well, debt is climbing, tuition is due, next month's rent is looming ever closer, and I have little means of paying any of this.  I am lost on where to go from here.","name":"t3_3o1vxa","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-09 04:22:31","week":41}

I don't know, I figure I'd add to the count or something!\n\nSo I'm 26 and have been married for 2 months. The wife and I have a combined income of about $102 000 per year.\n\nCurrently, on each pay check, we both automatically deposit the same amount into a savings account (don't recall the exact number, but we decided on the particular number because it amounts up to a combined $20 000 per year). We both take $200 off our paychecks and keep that money for ourselves, and the rest goes into a shared spending account that we pay bills out of and basically use any time we buy anything like groceries, gas, etc. We pay $750 in rent right now and we eat out a lot. I honestly don't even know how much we spend every month... All I know is that our joint spending account usually has more than $2k in it, and every time it starts getting a bit higher we have a larger spending like lawyer fees (immigration; I'm Canadian) or car insurance that takes it back down a bit. \n\nI know we could probably be saving more than $20 000 a year with the gross income we have, but I kind of like being able to eat out a lot and buy random crap on Amazon whenever I want. I'm actually not too much of a crazy spender (my own bank account is still steadily going up from the $200 every pay check), but she likes to spend her own money a bit more.\n\nI have $30 000 sitting in a Canadian bank account, and $20 000 in my personal account in the US. I think she only has $10 000 in her personal account.\n\nWe both have 401k's from our jobs where we contribute whatever the employer will match. I honestly have been too lazy to look at the numbers, but I should probably do that.\n\nMainly, I just feel like I just have a lot of money kind of sitting around not really doing anything. I have absolutely no idea what to do with my money, and I'm absolutely clueless about investing. I know I definitely need to open up a joint IRA where we'd dump something like 3-4k every year and we need to do that now, because from what I understand it will be a ton of money in 30 years from now, but besides that, I'm guessing there's probably a lot more I should be doing. Where can I start? I'm not completely uninterested and I would really like to learn to decide what I should do with the money that's just sitting around, but I feel a bit overwhelmed...","name":"t3_3o271k","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-09 06:02:10","week":41}

{"id":"3o93qa","author":"SaviorH","body":"It was brought to my attention this morning that 1000Gift was no longer avaliable in the App Store.\nThis was strange news to me, as I have used the app for months and it was a steady source of beermoney for me.\n\nAfter browsing the App Store for a while, I stumbled across GiftBay. \nGift Bay is an app that has the same developer as 1000Gifts and it works just as well.\n\n**Earning Coins**\n\n\nYou can earn coins from completing tasks, watching videos, or downloading apps. There are two main task centers that offer different activities that can be completed for coins.\n\n\n**Supersonic Task Center** - Completed tasks will reward *double* what they usually offer for a limited time. \n(App Downloads, Videos, Tasks)\n\n\n**Fyber Task Center** - (App Downloads, Videos, Tasks)\n\n\n**Referrals** - GiftBay offers a whopping 30% referral rate. When a friend gets 5 coins or more, you will receive 30% of what they earn\n\n\n**Daily Check-In** - There is a consecutive login bonus that increases over time for every consecutive day that you collect it. It resets every day at 12:00 AM, and it can reach a nice amount once you streak up days. \n\n\n**Social Media** - GiftBay will offer a small amount of coins for liking, sharing or tweeting their page.\n\n\n**Payout**\n\n\nPrizes are redeemed for coins, and will take up to 24 hours to be delivered. Upon request of redemption, the app will ask for your email, and will later deliver the gift card code directly to your email.\n\nLike 1000Gift, the app encourages saving up your coins, as there is a better conversion rate from coin to dollar if you spend more. GiftBay currently offers **Amazon Gift Cards, PayPal, Steam Wallet, Google Play, Xbox Live, and iTunes**\n\n\n*Minimum Payout:* $3\n\n\n* 500 Coins = $1 when you buy a $3/$5 Giftcard\n* 400 Coins = $1 when you buy a $10 Giftcard\n* 360 Coins = $1 when you buy a $25 Giftcard\n* 340 Coins = $1 when you buy a $50 Giftcard\n\nIf you want to try out this app and help me out, use referral code \"37c9622\"\n\n[App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gift-bay-earn-gift-card-cash/id1041272988)","name":"t3_3o93qa","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-10-10 21:49:02","week":41}
{"id":"3o93wr","author":"mcandre","body":"**Problem**\n\nIf you're like me, you might live in a small apartment complex, where packages aren't delivered to your door, but to the main office. And the main office's pickup hours are crappy, forcing you to dock an hour of work to get your mail. If your package technically arrived on Tuesday, you might not be able to get it until Wednesday. If you didn't check your letter mail for the notice, you might not know to get it until next Thursday.\n\nI could get a post office box, but their hours aren't much better (and sometimes they lie about pickup hours). There's long lines, and campus pickup services aren't available at all during winter break.\n\n**Solution**\n\n24/7, around the clock package pickup kiosks. They sit outside a regular post office or grocery store near where I live. I have my packages delivered there, get an email when they arrive, and pick them up at my leisure. No lines, no fuss.\n\n**Competition**\n\nTraditional post offices\n\n* Many locations\n* Inconvenient hours\n* Incompetent staff\n\nAmazon Storage Lockers\n\n* Only accepts Amazon packages\n* Email notifications\n* 3 day window before return to sender\n\nUSPS gopost\n\n* Email notifications\n* 15 day window before return to sender\n* Limited to NY area\n\nFedEx Ship&amp;Get\n\n* Email notifications\n* Limited to TX area\n\nSwapbox\n\n* Email notifications\n* Limited to San Francisco, CA\n\nBufferBox\n\n* Discontinued, acquired by Google\n\n247parcel\n\n* Email notifications\n* Limited to WA, NY areas\n\nPackage Concierge\n\n* Limited to high end apartments\n\nUPS:\n\n* No kiosks available\n\nUnless you live in very specific areas, there's nothing available for 24/7 package pickup. You're stuck with 10 am - 4 pm hours, a frustrating conflict with your 9 to 5 life.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAs a consumer, I'd eagerly pay $1-5 per package, to be able to pickup packages as my leisure.

{"id":"3oavyu","author":"eagle3y3z","body":"I'm still a wantrepreneur but this is the most exciting thing that has happened to me and I just had to share my experience so far. I have been an absolute sponge when I came upon this subreddit out of boredom while in college.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wanted to go the ecommerce route. Through TONS of research I found a product that was trending. The bad thing was the product I liked was already exclusive for the U.S.! Luckily the manufacturer told me a newer model was being built and samples will be sent my way early November. He notified me of the situation mid September. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nInstead of sitting on my butt waiting for the samples, I knew I had to develop a brand. I paid attention to what a lot of entrepreneurs said into what makes a business successful from the start. \"Have people that will already buy your product on day 1.\"  It made sense but how would I go about doing that? \"Build a website, ads, social media, email list.\" Slowly I began to see this shit was going to be harder than I thought. How do I get people to see my website, blog, and social media? \"Build a website, social media, ads, press, youtube, seo, blog, etc.\" OK?! I started to see the catch 22 taking place.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nAfter taking 2 weeks on building a shitty (its ok but not better than my competitors) but functional website, I got two blog posts up. Got a grand total of 0 views! Yay! How would I get people to see my shitty website but quality blog posts (shitty formatting on the blog post though)? Social media accounts! So I got my facebook fan page, instagram, pinterest, and twitter set up. Started following who ever my competitors were following and their followers. Got a couple of follow backs but nothing noteworthy and still no traffic. I then directed my focus on a facebook fan page, knowing I can't get likes organically anymore unless its crazy viral (I still haven't thought of anything viral yet), I still put my 2 blog posts up and 2 memes so the fan page doesn't look totally deserted. Shared my 2 blog posts and put a dollar on each to boost. One ad didn't get any engagement while the other surprised the hell outta me. I managed to get an email signup, 20 likes, 6 or 7 shares, 1 fb fan page like. Wow. So I invested 3 more dollars into it and ended up with 40 more likes and 9 or 10 more shares. 0 comments. Although ok numbers (I think) for the amount of money I spent, I have read a lot of you all mentioning likes and shares don't mean crap without sales. I also didn't want to keep writing blogs knowing no one was going to see it unless I boosted it. So I began to search for how exactly would I bring customers to my business on day 1. I read some more and something got my attention. eBook! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nThe eBook would be a perfect funnel for my eventual product. I would be able to gather an audience, emails, and establish myself as an \"expert\" in my niche (the idea came from 4HWW, reddit, and warrior forum). So for the past 2 or so weeks I managed to finish my ebook even with college (god I was exhausted). Now I had the decision to put the ebook on my website and social media accounts for free! I changed my fb cover to focusing on ebook and put 5 dollars per day for the week to promote the free ebook! Got a grand total of 8 CLICKS for 10 dollars with a reach of 300 people with no email signups! Nope this was obviously going to be too expensive so I cancelled the campaign. Did I settle on the idea of just leaving my ebook on my website that no one was visiting? HELL NO. I looked towards other platforms to promote on, and that's where Amazon came in.\n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile researching I noticed that books were selling for this niche. My competitors are also on amazon and I noticed every time a customer bought a product they would also buy a book (based on the amazon's \"customers also bought\" widget) in my niche. I then look into the books and they're expensive, not available for ebook, or complete garbage ebooks (Amazon has been getting flooded with crap books) and selling for 2.99. The cons I saw for not selling on amazon is the 90 day period exclusivity, %70 percent royalty, and the customer is not \"yours.\" That's until I weighed the pros, I have ZERO traffic to my site unless it's paid for, Amazon is leading in the ebook market, and Amazon has over 244 million customers, Amazon also ranks you higher amongst other books if you sign up with kdp (the other books were not part of kdp or were complete crap kdp books). Pros clearly outweighed my cons. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nI settled on my idea to sign up to Amazon kdp. Learned how to format for kindle, got an ok cover design on upwork, and then came the pricing. I researched on kindle books and giving out your book for free AND signing up for Amazon kdp will net you a large amount of downloads. It's a double edge sword though because I've read the free crowd are just downloading just because it's free and are just ebook hoarders. Initially I was going to give my ebook away for free on my own website to collect a guaranteed email. I now had second thoughts about doing the same for Amazon because although I probably would get more downloads there is no guarantee I would get the email (I included my website in my ebook). So I just decided to put a price on my book. I wanted my product to be better than the competition at a price that's lower than the competition (Frank Lucas quote). I didn't want to be lumped up with the 2.99 books, because my book has a LOT more content and value (~90 pages compared to 30 generously gapped pages), also not expensive. I went for a good price of 4.99 and would do a free promotion week to get downloads and reviews. People are so used to seeing 2.99 and majority being crap, I figured seeing a 4.99 book for free would immediately stick out and be of value. If they look at other books in my niche they'll easily go with mine for price and value. Then I clicked publish and decided I'd go through fiverr this time to promote my ebook to get some buzz for next week on this coming Tuesday and I'd promote heavy during the free week. Little did I know soon as you hit publish it's out,online, and for sale...well FFFFFFUUUUUUUUU.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nI might as well not sit on my ass and I should do something about it. Amazon has this new feature (I don't know how new) where they rank top reviewers and give them a special tag \"top 100 reviewer\" and/or \"vine voice\". These reviewers are normal people who leave quality reviews and who happen to buy and receive a ton of amazon items. That special tag goes all the way to the 1000th reviewer I believe. I decided that's exactly who I need to send my ebooks to in order to get a quality review and get social proof for my ebook. I read EVERY SINGLE bio of every reviewer and sent those who were interested in something related to my niche a free pdf copy for book review.  I only read up to 500 bios (school got in the way). Only ONE responded and he was a top 100 reviewer too (WOO)! He sent me something saying he'll look into it. That very night I checked my kindle report and he only read 34/90 pages (kindle has a program called kindle unlimited) :(. I figured maybe he got busy or didn't like it. Couple days pass until today. I'm still trying to build my social media followers up, get another blog post going, and see what I can do to promote my ebook further. I check my reports on kindle expecting nothing different, or to see if the guy finished. Instead there is this weird red line graph indicating \"paid.\"  I did a double take...someone paid for my book?!?! I had NO PROMOTION AND CONTACTED NO ONE. I gave the reviewers free pdf books WTF IS THIS?!?!  I hope I get a good review on it and they spread it through word of mouth. Anyways I achieved a mini milestone unexpectedly. Aside from regular jobs, this is the first dollar I've earned by myself. Feels good. :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \n\n\nTL;DR Still a wantrepreneur making noob mistakes...but I sold a book. \n\n","name":"t3_3oavyu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-11 07:24:20","week":41}

Me along with a few friends have started on our journey to build Amazon for adventure activities. We are a marketplace for adventure activities. Currently we are operational in India. We started some 5 months ago.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRecently we made the website live and have started running some Google Ads and Facebook promotion experiments. One design of our landing page is this - [Scuba diving in Goa](http://www.mojhi.com/pages/scuba-in-goa?utm_source=reddit_entrepreneur)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe intent of this page is to convert as many clicks as we can to leads. What is a lead? When we have their contact details - email and/or phone number. The 3 ways that can happen is a) They see the number and call us b) They chat with us, the chat also auto pops up in 60 sec and c) They use the \"Free Offers\" form.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCurrently we are converting about 12% of our clicks to leads. I am really hoping to get some feedback on the page to see how we can increase the percentage.

{"id":"cvoo4hq","author":"Dr_Schaden_Freude","body":"ehh this isn't entirely true in my experience.  Almost every manufacturing company I have worked for and with has some form of online presence and lead generation.  Trade shows are great and all but I'd say no more than 2-5% of overall sales for most contract manufacturers are the result of a trade show meet and greet(in my experience).  You are 100% correct about everyone wanting to start a business and buy 10 at a time (you can do that at the same unit pricing as 10,000 right?).  \n\nTo get back to OPs question I agree with u/axejeff that a 'master list of good manufacturers' just isn't how any of this works, whats good for one person doesn't always fit all and then you have the problem of there being a million factories that all do something different tailored to their market.  The complexity of finding a great manufacturer is precisely why Sourcing Consultants are even a thing.  As others have said there is Makersrow, as someone who has a personal account and a business account for my factory I would say it is so-so, the market is absolutely in need of a Makersrow but they are still pretty new and have a lot of developing to do.  MFG.com is a decent resource for gathering potential manufacturers as is Alibaba if you are trying to go to China.  The trick to ALL of these is knowing your shit so as not to get taken.  Have all your documents ready with any notes the manufacturer should be aware of (special processes, important tolerances etc) and vet them the old fashioned way by talking with them and getting a feel for there capabilities.  Depending on what I'm sourcing and where I occasionally throw an obvious problem or impossible spec into the RFQ and see if they pick it up. \n\nManufacturing is it's own culture and beast.  A lot of hardware startups are starting to figure out that you can't just Amazon a custom part and the IoT is still decades away, in order to get something made you have to pick up the phone and talk to people, network etc.  Now after all of that I will say a list of manufacturers that people here have used would be somewhat beneficial as it gives a place to start and network for a lot of people like OP with zero foothold in the industry.

{"id":"cvoo6d5","author":"nnta1234","body":"You also don't need to go overboard with car seats. Here's a trick - look online for discontinued colors. Albee baby is a place to look but so is overstock, Amazon, and buy.com. Babies don't care if they sit in an orange and purple seat, but you can save over $100 just based on the color. \n\nYou also don't need about 80% of the stuff at the baby store. Diapers, cheap onesies, and a car seat are the big things. If breast feeding works that will save you a fortune. Otherwise BJs wholesale has good but affordable formula. Costco isn't far behind. \n\nYou don't need a $50 boppy pillow with 8 covers. If you miss something you can always run out and get it. But you still have to pay for it even if you leave it in the box. IKEA has affordable cribs. We used a changing pad on a dresser. \n\nOne more pro tip - after the baby is born there will be a nascar like pit crew that does all kinds of stuff to your baby. It is kind of incredible to watch. Towards the end they will be putting on a diaper. Before they do have them slather the kids butt with Vaseline or K&amp;D ointment.

I don't mean your t-shirst are going to be flying off the shelves and you need to keep a full supply pipeline, I mean try to create something for a niche market that hasn't been completely tapped yet. \n\n4. You should have a product before you build a website or it will sit there collecting dust and taking up very valuable resources (your money). \n\n5. You can go to Alibaba to order cheap shirts to have them printed on. \n\n6. You are going to need to contact a printer or manufacturer to have your clothing made. \n\n7. You are going to have to sell on Amazon as well as your website. \n\n8. You can test TeeSpring to see if your designs are worth pursuing. \n\nWhy exactly are you pursuing an online clothing shop.

{"id":"cvpb5yz","author":"whattodo-whattodo","body":"Hey, sorry it took me a while to get back to you.  It's been a little crazy.  To answer your questions\n\n&gt; what kinds of products do you think are good targets?\n\nMostly these warranties are eligible for branded consumer electronics sold between $100 &amp; $5000.  So the off-brand MP3 player sold for $20 is a no-go, but pretty much any tablet, laptop, phone, etc is a good fit.  This is a pretty substantial part of the ecommerce retail market.\n\n&gt;  are we just talking ebay? is that just a starting point?\n\neBay is a starting point.  The challenge is to find a worthwhile sales channel.  Each one has it's idiosyncrasies that either add complication, risk or limit success.  IE Rakuten is too small, so barring the top 40 sellers on the entire site, no one is selling any worthwhile quantities.  Amazon forwards e-mails themselves.  So it's still a good idea, but it carries a risk.  I'd want to start with a small account and increase quantities slowly rather than risk a large user's account getting banned.  This is the kind of thing a person can sue me for ;-P.  Newegg has good volume but emails can only come through authorized addresses.  So the seller needs to give me access to send e-mails through that account.  That too comes with it's complications. And so on and so on.  I've just picked the easiest target with the highest potential &amp; lowest risk to start; eBay &amp; Magento.  \n\n&gt;  how many retailers do you think fit the bill on ebay?\n\neBay US?  I can think of about 25 companies that are selling $15M-$30M/yearly. Plus comanies like terrapeak will help me ferret them out if I really need to be sure.  In the $5M/yearly range, I have to expect that it's in the hundreds.  \n\n&gt;  what does it take for a third party warranty provider to want to do business (volume, type of product, etc)\n\nI'm not sure. I've never set up an account.  I can piggy back off a client or I can try on my own.  Though since these people are just insurance companies, I don't expect that they'd be too exclusive.  It just comes down to whether they'd give a good rate or not.\n\n&gt;  how much work in setting up a relationship like this?\n\nI doubt it's complicated.  I expect it to be identical to the relationship I have to my car insurance company.\n\n&gt;  what do players like amazon do vis a vis warranties and their universe of retailers?\n\nI don't know.  I know that eBay allows it and that there is a big enough market there to justify the work.  Amazon is larger &amp; worth a look.  But I don't know the answer yet.\n\n&gt;  also curious to know what how much work/$ would be required to set up the service on your end.\n\n\nThis one comes in layers.  The proof of concept can be quick.  I need a mechanism to collect data from users.  I suspect that eBay has some app or another that can export the data without me (an outsider) having access to the whole system.  Then I process &amp; import.  Beyond that I don't plan on doing a ton with e-mail templates.  It'll be stylish but it will just be one template.  Then I need a mechanism to check the tracking numbers against Fedex/ups/usps/etc.  This is probably the hardest, but it's no more than 20 hours of work.  Lastly a mechanism to send e-mails based on the collected data.  I'm thinking a POC can be done in my spare time in less than 4-6 weeks.  \n\nThe catch (and it's a big one) is that I don't have a call center.  A conversation would have to happen pretty quickly about redirecting the phone calls from the client I have to a call center.  As of now it's based on the trust that I have that he will sell *my* warranty and not his own.  It's also based on the premise that I *can* monitor phone calls.  But both trust &amp; distrust are crappy business models &amp; I'd rather move it somewhere safe as soon as I find it's worthwhile.\n\nThen comes the sales.  Getting the customers on board is just something I cannot measure. Though their integration/setup is minimal and from then on out I only expect to speak to them when I cut them checks.\n\nThat's pretty much it.  What are your thoughts? \n\nFeel free to call &amp; we can discuss\n\n-Sergio\n917-353-6855","name":"t1_cvpb5yz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-05 22:32:12","week":41}

If I feel that I have already paid $70 to get all of my Christmas shopping shipped to me for no additional cost, I might go out of my way to take advantage of that.  And, again, if my X-Mas budget is $500, then $20 in shipping becomes a significant amount and enough that I might alter my behavior or the gifts I buy so that I don't have to spend that $20 on shipping instead of gifts.\n\nSorry if that somehow wasn't clear.  If I use the word 'free' or not, I assumed the point would still be apparent.\n\nThe Prime video aspect doesn't necessarily change this.

That's still the plan, as it would allow me to commute by bus or at least save money on gas and repairs.\n\nI'm getting a lot of mixed opinions about the car.. It seems split 50/50 as to whether I should keep it or sell it.  I do agree with you, considering the condition it's in, and the low insurance and mileage (just over 50k), it seems to make more sense to hold onto it.\n\nAs far as having the BF on the loan, that definitely wasn't my first option for the reason you listed.  It would have been my fall-back, but the fact that I'm having to consider a backup plan pretty much says that I'm not financially ready for a mortgage. ;)\n\nShould I just get the other credit card and cancel the Amazon Rewards card?  I've never owned more than one credit card and I've always felt it was a good philosophy to keep it that way.\n\nI greatly appreciate all of the positive feedback, the advice, and the praise.

This is your story and your selling point. How do you market yourself to customers? Don't make it about poverty. When you're poor you don't have much to spend and you know it. But you put some aside for a website because its an investment in the future and in hope. Exploitation of that emotion is how people get tricked into overpaying. Simply tell them they're overpaying and you want to come in and do it for less. Dont make it about anything else but product for cash. Show your portfolio, demonstrate exactly what they're getting for the price and people should be able to make the decision right there. Most people don't even know they're getting ripped off until someone like you tells them. There's no shame in doing more jobs for less money per job. \"Your margins are my opportunity.\"  &lt;---maybe Jeff Bezos from Amazon?\n\nAlso, make it about entry level into the internet community. Your customer is going to be small businesses or bloggers who have no idea what they're doing.  I imagine the less internet and computer saavy the less they're willing to risk on something that's foreign and confusing to them.  Maybe your business is what helps them understand how important a website could be and exactly what it costs to maintain one. Educate people. In your head, consider education a part of your hourly rate. People will appreciate the \"extra\" time you put in outside creating the website. But really its additional chargeable hours for you. You don't have to break a sweat teaching them the basics, they learn what they need to and you won't feel like a crook because you're not charging an arm and a leg. Everyone wins and no one gets taken advantage of. Just a couple off the top of my head. I hope it helps.

{"id":"cvq1d2n","author":"someredditorguy","body":"The things that have me starting at Amazon, and usually making the purchase there (the first bring the most important):\n\n* The search engine. No other shopping site, aside from Google which usually takes me to Amazon, does as well as Amazon for showing me what I'm looking for when I perform a search. It's ability to combine correct results with reviews, purchase counts, and prices makes it the best place to figure out exactly what I want.\n* The price. Amazon isn't as low-price as it used to be, especially considering the $99 premium I pay for prime. But many times, the cost on Amazon is still about the same as it is in stores, and the availability of different options I don't necessarily have locally plus the third party marketplace brings me to buy on Amazon regularly even of the seller isn't Amazon. That said, I've noticed some types of items are far cheaper in a brick and mortar store. Shampoo and liquid soap, for example.\n* The shipping. Two day delivery for \"free\"? Unless I need it TODAY, that's far better than 5-12 days for standard shipping anywhere else. The excitement is still there in two days. \n* The trust. Relatively speaking, online shopping is still new. When I (physically) go to a retail store, I know that once I pay, I already posses the goods that I purchased. I generally am the only one to touch my credit card, which gives me the feeling that my credit card info is (probably) still safe. If Amazon is handling the transaction's payment and shipping, I can trust them since I know them already and they're big enough that I know there's nobody that manually processes my credit card info. Other online stores? It depends. Some of the smaller ones I certainly won't trust with my payment info, and even on sites like eBay or Etsy, I'm possibly trusting a \"random\" person to send me what I bought, and I won't know if the trust is earned until possibly several days later. \n\nThat said, especially considering prices and my desire to pick the best looking package off a shelf, Amazon is sort of turning into the best buy of the internet. I trust reviews more than I trust boxes. So especially if I'm making a big purchase, I'll look at prices elsewhere online to see if there's a better deal,  and if it's available in a store that provides price matching (Walmart, Target, Best Buy among many others) I might go to the store to buy something for the price that Amazon asks.

For First Class items (under 13 oz) you could offer free shipping or just charge a fixed cost since First Class postage does not change based on location, just weight. There are also Flat Rate boxes and envelopes where you can charge a fixed cost or offer Free Shipping with the shipping cost factored into the price.

Then when you receive your inventory from your supplier, you go through the \"Add a Product\" process in seller central. It will take you through the steps for adding a product to the Amazon catalog. It's super easy, don't worry. At the end, it will create a shipment for you, and tell you where you'll be shipping your products. Then you box up everything and print out the shipping labels that amazon provides. Take the boxes to UPS and Amazon handles the rest from there. They will store your products in their warehouses until they are purchased by the customer. You'll only have them in your apartment for as long as it takes to add them to your amazon account and get them back out the door to amazon's warehouse. Hope that makes sense.

{"id":"cvqfq4i","author":"poorwhitecash","body":"IMO, it really depends on your level of sourcing. If you just scan garage sales and occasionally clearance isles, you can get away with using the amazon seller app. But if you are doing serious retail arbitrage, i would highly suggest getting a scanner and better software. \n\nThe Amazon seller app is nice considering it's free. But to check all of the necessary criteria can be very time consuming. Hear me out here, because I know a lot of people will argue that it's easy &amp; fast enough. It is true that it doesn't take long to get your info using the Amazon seller app. But the extra few seconds it does take, can add up quickly. \n\n(In this comparision, let's assume both the methods are using internet connection). \nIf you use a scanner and paid software, you get pretty much all the info you need at one time. You scan, and the info pops up. Takes one second. \n\nLet's say using the Amazon seller app it takes you 4 seconds to scan the UPC, match the product, click the FBA offers, or new/used, etc. I think that's a fair amount of time. Sometimes just scanning the UPC can be a time suck. \n\nNow, 4 seconds is not very long if you aren't scanning many items. But if you are scanning a lot of items, those extra seconds add up. \n\nSo I could run the numbers here, but any first grader can tell you it takes 4 times longer using the amazon seller app. So if you scan 1,000 items today, it would take you 17 minutes with a scanner v.s. over an hour with ASA. \n\nSo I believe it depends on how much you plan on scanning. If you plan on going to booksales, a scanner is practically a necessity. Because there is usually immediate flipping competition. And someone with a scanner(especially one that has downloaded data instead of internet), will be going through the books 10x's faster than you. Think of that on a greater scale. By the time you have scanned 100 books, they have scanned 1,000!\n\nSo yes, most people can get by with the ASA. Frankly most people probably should use it, because it is free and very helpful. But if you are reselling on a large scale, consider your time vs cost of scanner/software. Sure there is cost associated with the scanner/software combo, but for some, it is definitely worth the money. If it saves you only 8 hours of work a month, isn't it already worth it? \n\nAs far as which scanner to use, I can't attest to which is best, as I have only used one. I use the scanfob opn-2002. It works great with my galaxy s2. Yes I said galaxy S2!(what can I say, I'm cheap. And it does everything I need it to do ATM). I love the discreteness of it. Especially at garage sales, because some people take it personal if they know you plan on reselling their stuff. Which I do not understand BTW?! Do you want to sell your crap or not? Who cares what I do with it afterwards. Anyway... I can hold the scanner with my hand closed so you that you can not even see it.So when I am in a retail store, I set my phone in the basket. Then I can pick up the object, scan it, and peek over into the basket at the info without even touching my phone. So you can't even tell I am scanning unless you are really looking for it.\n\nWell this turned out wayyy longer than I planned. Time to get some junk up on eBay.

Not that Amazon doesn't always take care of it asap, but I feel that with FBA sellers lose the personal touch that makes them really want to manage every order, plus there is extreme competition on Amazon and you can't really distinguish between sellers if you're not paying attention, where as on eBay there may be many of the same products and I can find a seller close to me that has a professional appearance and a good record and be more sure of what I'm getting.\n\nAlso eBay has auctions which can get you some really good deals as well as the fact that I like to sell stuff on eBay. I use Amazon for some generic items and things I won't the same or next day that are typically fairly ubiquitous items, and eBay for most interesting unique items and deal seeking.\n\nI have found a neat thing about Amazon lately though, with so many sellers sending items to Amazon for FBA, many from overseas, you can find some really neat stuff that has a terrible title that doesn't really match it and because the item is already in the US and they are having to pay Amazon storage fees they will sell the item at a pretty big loss and you can find some interesting stuff like that if you really dig down in the search results.\n\nThe biggest problem with eBay is that they suck at suspending users and verifying DMCA claims.","name":"t1_cvqggej","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-10-06 21:51:11","week":41}

The seller charged me for 5 pounds costing me approximately an additional $4 for my shipping which you can't verify until you get the package.  Did this really need explaining to you?  Did you honestly not know this was a thing or did you know this and are just being a twat?\n\n***Honestly this seller is probably too busy or didn't know how to properly respond to the claim. The fact that this cunt filed a claim in 2 days is proof enough, additionally the cocksucker did it over a weekend and wrote:***\n\nThe seller has thousands and thousands and thousands of feedback and responded to me over a dozen times in 5 days.  None of them were to accept the return without conditions as required and all insisted on me spending money to return a broken item.  Do I not have an expectation to get what I ordered or be able to return it as Amazon says?  \n\nI also didn't file a claim in 2 days. I filed the return request on a Thursday, I filed the claim Monday evening after the seller refused a return unless I paid return shipping, restocking, etc.  Meaning, I let them respond and they refused to follow policy.  Hence, opening A to Z claim at that point.   \n\n***making post like this and trying to bust places for showing ppv fights without paying.***\n\nThat's kind of my job.

Ignorance of tax obligations is not good but reasonable given the complications of our system, I wouldn't fault someone for that. Intentional tax evasion however is kind of a dick move.

{"id":"cvqn56h","author":"jrossetti","body":"You're terrible at this debating thing.  You appear to have a lack of critical and logic based thinking.  \n\n\n***Charging you a shipping price. ANY shipping price that you agree to pay is not overcharging you period. If you pay it and agree to pay it then you were charged appropriately. Overcharging is when you agree to pay one price and you are charged a different price. You saw the total before you finalized the purchase, that amount did not change.***\n\nYou're right, I saw a total, and I saw an amount.  I also can't verify the actual weight of the object until it gets into my hands, or are you forgetting that part?  Until then we only have what we are told the item weighs and costs.\n\nI agreed to pay rate + .97 per pound.   I am unable to verify whether the item does indeed weight 5 pounds that I was charged, or whether it weighs 1 pound like it actually weighed until arrival, and then take action.  I'm not sure why this seems to be confusing to you.  \n\n***So Friday and Monday, or should everyone selling online work a full 7 day work week. Also you didn't state how long you had the item. Amazon actually requires that you notify the seller within 14 days if there is any problem, so if it had been longer than that he could have won the claim.***\n\nFIrst amazon policy requires you are available within 48 hours if you are as seller no matter what.  Don't sell on the platform if you can't follow the rules they expect for their customer experience.  \n\nI also want to point out this debate is all academic as you are still arguing they didn't have enough time to respond or were busy while ignoring that they replied to me over a dozen times on 2 of the days I didn't even count towards the 2 business days.\n\n I counted 52 total business hours and 48 non-business hours between return request and A to Z claim.  In that time block I messaged back and forth approximately 20+ times and refused to accept a return against policy several times.  I'm not sure how you can still be arguing they just didn't have time or know how to respond to the claim when they responded to the claim several times.  You're not making sense.\n\n\n***Doesn't mean it's not a dickish activity. You probably chose that job, it's not a conscription that you do it. You obviously like to try and have some sense of power or righting perceived wrongs, real or not. You know it's a shitty thing, you get told that constantly. You like it, because you get a feeling of moral or some other superiority from it. You get to feel like you're a part of these massive corporations that are really making all the money, but you're just a soldier for basic class warfare, like an overseer on a slave plantation 200 years ago. You're getting paid to fuck small businesses over in the interest of huge corporations and that's all there is to it. People like you make things like the holocaust possible, you just have to be convinced someone is right and someone is wrong and get an invitation to the \"good\" side. I was just following orders from my corporate overlords will not be a valid excuse.*** \n\nIt boggles my mind that you can simultaneously argue that I am a terrible person for reporting thieves and false advertising/claims by businesses for personal profit but in the same breath defend the businesses who are stealing and lying to their customers.    \n\nIt's even more fantastic you managed to bring in the holocaust.  Haha.  \n\nTo answer  your question though, no, I don't feel an ounce of remorse or regret for any business who is telling 10 to 300 customers they have to charge them 5 to 30 dollars per head to pay for an event that they are stealing from someone else.  Liars and thieves are the scum of the earth and you might be okay with that, but I certainly am not.  I made 5 figures in 4 hours for Mayweather because of people being greedy thieves and I did it honestly and ethically.   I love money, being able to fuck over a lying cheating business is just icing on the cake and gives me a justice boner.  \n\n\nIf customers are giving money because they are told they have to so the business can pay for the event they want to see, how is that not stealing?  Agreeing to something under false pretenses doesn't somehow exempt the business from what they are doing.  Nevermind the business is stealing from peter AND paul simultaneously.  Something you appear to be ignoring in order to attack my reporting them for what they are doing.   \n\n\n***Several posts in \"petty revenge\". What a fuck. Context matters.\nNot really the subreddit name says more than enough, that you would find it and enjoy posting in it shows all the context we need, just like this post and the others. You are getting pleasure from screwing someone else over.\nTreat others how you want to be treated, not how you think they treated you.\nA lot of people like you exist, it's free world, like in this case you may even be rewarded for it, hopefully karma is real though.***\n\nNow you're trying to argue that context doesn't matter when trying to imply something from a sub that I posted in.  If you  don't know what I post, how can you know whether it's a positive, negative, or no change on my integrity or personality.  \n\nSimply put where you see someone posting means absolutely nothing without other data.

{"id":"cvqveuo","author":"meowhahaha","body":"So this week has been the week for re-learning the **LOOK CLOSELY** lesson for me. \n\nSunday I dropped into a thrift shop I haven't been to for a while. They had a bunch of CDs still in the shrink wrap, so I picked through a bunch.\n\nI had to go to the front of the store to get either my Amazon app or the Amazon website to work. I can get reception for any other site just fine anywhere in a store, but these two seem to need ideal conditions.\n\nI scanned and made a pile of purchase-worthy CDs. I wasn't smart enough to write down the titles of the ones that didn't scan to check at home later.\n\nHowever, when I got home I did remember one CD/artist because it was an unusual title &amp; name. I looked it up and it is selling for $50!! Not bad for a $1.60 investment.\n\nI quickly looked in my bag from the store to see if I'd bought it or not (I'm fairly risk-adverse) and didn't see it.\n\nSo I went back Monday evening (as soon as I could get there) to search for that CD. I noticed the neat stack of newly wrapped CDs that I'd left there yesterday had been scattered. I kept spotting CDs I'd scanned &amp; discarded the day before but not the BIG SCORE.\n\nI went through every CD they had. I walked the store to see if maybe I'd picked it up then left it on a shelf as I looked at other stuff (I do that sometimes).\n\nI asked both employees if maybe someone had found it in the wrong place and put it in a stack of things to be returned to shelves ('no' from both).\n\nI'd left the store Sunday only 15 minutes before they closed, so I knew another flipper had to have been there on Monday, as the other CDs I'd looked at had been pawed over but not purchased.\n\nI went through the CDs again, this time from the other side of the table. I got a chair so I could see all the of the titles very clearly and went through them a 3rd time. I pulled out all the videos and nearby merch to see if someone had hidden it for later.\n\nThe whole time, I'm cursing myself, Amazon and their crappy apps, the mystery flipper, the store's lack of A/C, my own decision making skills, my stupid appointments that made it impossible for me to get straight back to the store when it opened, etc.\n\nFinally, I went up to the area where I'd been sitting &amp; scanning CDs. No joy.\n\nAfter two long, sweaty, pissed off hours of frantic searching, I gave up and went home. I took a Silkwood shower to remove the grime from that nasty place (and remembered why I don't go there frequently). \n\nI finally sat down to suckle some comfort from listing the CDs I had been able to scan the day before. I knew there was one CD in the huge bag of stuff that was worth at least $20. I was looking forward to pulling it and gaining some glimmer of victory &amp; triumph.\n\nLo &amp; behold, I pulled out the CD OF GLORY!!!! Turns out it was in the bag under everything else. I'd not only forgotten I HAD bought it, but had been so frazzled when sorting through the bag earlier that I'd completely missed it. All the cover art was black and it just blended in with other items.\n\nSo, I fretted all Sunday evening, stressed myself out for 6 hours before I got to the store on Monday, searched &amp; sweated fruitlessly, exhausted myself physically &amp; mentally, castigated myself and this 'mystery flipper' for hours...all because I hadn't looked carefully into my shopping bag. \n\nI didn't know whether to laugh or cry. \n\nTL, DR: I keep massively screwing up this flipping thing by not looking closely enough for/at items.","name":"t1_cvqveuo","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-07 04:42:28","week":41}
{"id":"cvqvip7","author":"jrossetti","body":"On the fence?  He sent me a defective item.  What would you have done?  Where was I unreasonable?  I asked for a return for a defective item and he said no, then he said he would if I paid a bunch of fees for it.  \n\nWhy should I have to pay insurance to return a broken item? By itself, I agree, I wouldn't even list it.  As part of a list of complaints, yeah.  Amazon policy states I have to buy insurance to return any item over $100.  Thats what I agreed to do.  I'm not going to pay money out of pocket for a return on an item that's under $100.  I will return it with tracking and it will not be on my dime.   I was expected to pay shipping to me, shipping back to the seller, 25% restocking fee, AND the insurance just for him to accept the return of his broken item.    \n\n\n\nThe real problem is he should have taken and processed the return himself as he is required.  I didn't have time to spend on the phone or wait for a manufacture replacement.  This was an item that I lost several hundred dollars on because it came dead.  I was now stuck without the tool I needed for my job and he was dicking around with a return and calling the manufacturer was also too long.  I had a new one in my hand Monday morning so I could leave to work before this guy had even said he'd take the return only if I paid the extra crap he wanted.\n\n  He should have exchanged or refunded me after he got his old one and handled the manufacture issue on his own.  Had it not arrived dead, then yes, I obviously would have called the manufacturer.  \n\nI am an incredibly active person on Amazon.  I have over 175 non pantry items over 150 + individual shipments ordered in the last 3 months.   I have filed one A to Z claim, requested a missing accessory needed twice, and returned another 12 items.  Half a percent of my orders have resulted in an A to Z claim and 1.5 percent of my orders result in me even messaging the seller with a problem.  \n\nI can tell people all the terrible things I want to about this guy, it's not going to affect his online business at all.  The only way his online business will be affected is if he's not following amazons rules.  So although yes I wish ill will upon his business for being a twat, it's not like I can create the conditions needed for it to happen. ONLY the seller can do that.  \n\n\nLastly, the principle man. I bust my ass 20-30 hours a week sourcing and sending shit to amazon.  I'll be damned if I am going to follow the rules for all of my customers and then get hosed by some jackass for 40-50$.  I'm going to follow the process that every other buyer should follow in the same shoes.  In this particular case the seller doubled down on everything and lost.  \n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cvqvip7","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-07 04:45:42","week":41}

I have an expectation that the seller will charge me for the correct rate in my opinion though and was surprised to find out it wasn't a 5 pound package and weighed less than an ipad wrapped.  \n\nDo you agree or disagree that a buyer should have an expectation that if you are charging someone per pound for a service or good that the weight should be reasonably accurate.  \n\nAs a follow up, if I charged you for 5 pounds of beef and gave you 2 how would you feel about that?  \n\nThis is the charge from his page so it's clear how the charges are listed pre-buy.  A buyer can't confirm the weight until they receive it for obvious reasons which means they are always accepting with the assumption that the seller is being honest.  This isn't Craigslist. It's Amazon.  If it were this would be an accepted risk and something you just deal with if you get caught flatfooted.

{"id":"cvrcr7g","author":"Thr33wolfmoon","body":"I absolutely love Amazon Prime. Here's some tips that have helped me:\n\nSign up for Amazon Mom. You get a discount on subscription diapers. Be on the lookout for coupons for Luvs, Pampers, and Huggies that appear below the product. Those bring the cost down.\n\nLarge purchase? Search camelcamelcamel.com for the product. You'll be able to see item price high and low, recent price changes, and set up email alerts if it ever dips below a certain price.\n\nIf you have a baby on the way, create a gift registry, whether or not you plan on giving that to people. I believe it's a 10% completion discount.\n\nIf you don't need an item right away, take advantage of the $1 credit for delayed shipping. I've found that it usually is there within the week anyway.\n\nI also use a website called slickdeals.net. It's a website here users can submit really good deals that they've found. Many of those deals (for the items that I buy, like paper goods and household essentials) are from amazon or target. I regularly find deals like Charmin double rolls under $0.25 each, $0.88 Suave Professional shampoo, etc.\n\nSubscribe and save can be helpful, but I usually subscribe for a promotion and cancel it until I get another promotion. For example, amazon recently had a 30% off subscriptions of certain products. I subscribed, got the products, and cancelled after I received the item.  \n\nI've found Amazon Prime to be really useful. I very rarely go out for those \"dammit we ran out of paper towel\" runs.

Eneloop and other [LSD cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery#Low_self-discharge) are the exception.\n\n(B) Don't trust a cheap charger for most of these cells, especially if it can't charge a single cell on its own. (Charging two cells in series is like filling two gas tanks from one pump - you lose a lot of accuracy) A decent charging unit on Amazon costs $40 or so, but it will greatly extend the lifespan of your cells and that pays for itself after about 100 recharges.\n\nA few examples of high draw devices that are well suited to NiMH:\n\n* Remote-control cars and toys\n* Game controllers\n* AA-to-USB power packs\n* Cameras\n* Arduino or hobby electronics projects\n\nRemote controls are usually not well suited to NiMH because their 1.2V cell voltage is already lower than a primary cell's 1.5V and that just means they'll brown out faster. This doesn't apply for game controllers, since most of them have an internal voltage converter these days.\n\nWhat you should consider for yourself is *how many* devices you have that you're changing batteries for, and how often.

Here's an example:\n\nLet's say you pick up a second job or some overtime at your current job, and you get a cheaper phone plan, and your after tax and bills income is $325 higher. You can pay off that JC Penney card in just six weeks! That frees up another $25 a month, so now you've got $350 to pay down debt. Now you can knock out that Best Buy card in just under three months. Now you've got $380 to pay down debt. You can pay off that Capital One card in just over three months. Now you're up to an extra $407 a month. That Amazon card will take just under four months. Now it's $453 a month. The Newegg card will take a little over five months, and then you'll have $514 a month for the last card, the Chase card. $514 would pay that off in just over six months. Then you're credit card debt free, in just under two years. You'll be 26, and in pretty good shape. Then start swinging away at that student loan debt. If you've got an extra $600 per month to put at those, you'll be done in just over two more years.\n\nThroughout the above example, I didn't even include the money you're already paying in minimums-- you'll be paying more each month than I calculated (the numbers I quoted, plus your already-earmarked minimum payment), and the balances will be slightly smaller by the time you start to pay off each card in earnest because minimum payments do make a small dent against the principal of the debt.\n\nBeyond that, you need a better job in the long run.

I've found some products where 90% of the first page results are pushed by Amazon and not FBA sellers, and I'm wondering if it's possible or advisable to compete with Amazon for these products.\n\n* What is the biggest difference in the high-volume FBA game you've seen in the last 5 months?

I personally started coaching one on one and was inspired to do so because of the failures of courses. A course can't give you feedback. A course can't analyze your product or weigh pros and cons of your specific situation. But with that said I do think some courses can be valuable tools for people depending on their learning style. But $6,000 is nuts. That is the most expensive course out there, there are some MUCH cheaper ones. \n\nCouple things I would add, the customs fees and charges don't actually only apply for orders over $2,000. Technically any orders should have them since they aren't for personal use. So you can very well get them added on if customs sees 500 garlic presses on your forms. \n\n&gt;4 things matter on Amazon, NOTHING ELSE.\n\nPictures, reviews, sales and what was your fourth haha?\n\nAlso I would definitely say there are other things that matter besides those three.  \n\nLastly I see creating a brand playing a much different role on Amazon than you describe. \n\nThanks for the insightful post.

{"id":"cvrt0hd","author":"burracoT","body":"I used to work Seller Support for Fulfillment by Amazon. Here's a couple of things concerning FBA you should know:\n\n1. FBA can be expensive (and possibly not worth it) depending on your margins. I encourage you to look at the FBA Revenue Calculator (enter in a product, it gives a breakdown of fees) and the breakdown of the Selling on Amazon/FBA fees on the Seller Central Help Pages. I had many Sellers call in angry about fees because they didn't understand how Amazon's fee structure worked.\n\n2. Before going all in with FBA, make sure you understand how the process works. There are many different steps that must be followed from how you package and label the product to how you create a shipment and send it in to Amazon. Seller Central has many Help Pages with a lot of good information on the service and how to package and prepare shipments for FBA. I highly recommend reading and reviewing all of these pages and then send in a test shipment to make sure you understand the process and that it arrived and was processed successfully. Better to mess up first on a small package then shipping 5000 products in and getting hit with packaging and prep fees and possible lost shipments.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to contact Seller Support. If you are unsure about a certain step or simply want to know more about FBA or Selling on Amazon in general, they have a lot of answers. That is literally what they are there for. I can't count how many times someone called in and were upset that they were charged fees or there was missing inventory. If they just would have read the help pages or called us, we could have easily resolved the issue before it became one. You have to remember, Seller Support is reactive. It is up to you as the Seller to be proactive and seek assistance if needed.\n\nThere are many more aspects to Selling on Amazon and FBA in general but here are some important aspects and a good jumping off point if you are thinking of doing this. Also, what the OP said in their post is absolutely correct. DON'T pay for courses or any of that BS. There is so much material online to look through, especially all the material on Seller Central and its Help Pages.

{"id":"cvrucjx","author":"burracoT","body":"Probably a good rule of thumb but make sure to do the math yourself. I did see a good amount of sellers with cheap items who used FBA with no problem. Its definitely a case by case situation as you have to break down how much your own costs are going to be (storing, shipping, packaging, etc) compared to FBA and even with cheap products the FBA service may still be worth it. Not to mention, if you use FBA Amazon also handles your Customer Service if there are any Returns/Refunds/questions etc so that's another cost to take into account if you don't want to use FBA.\n\nAnd agreed on the large objects. Fees definitely go up once your in Oversize territory but usually Oversize items sell for more so you have a better margin. And yeah, when shipping in items the Seller is paying for the shipment to the Fulfillment Center so it can add up  quick if there are many boxes or if you are using a LTL (Less Than Truckload) or FTL (Full Truckload) shipment.

Go ahead and downvote me, but just know, Amazon is not going to be putting up with irresponsible importers much longer.\n\nAs a sourcing agent with an office in China, one of the scariest things you've mentioned here, or didn't for that matter, is the importance of proper sourcing. While I agree with you in some regards, some of these courses are great at selling the dream, some of the better ones (one's I've personally consulted for) and a few more in the space, do highlight on the dangers of proper sourcing. \n\nNot to rain on your parade, but if that excerpt is what you're teaching in your Udemy course, I suggest taking it down entirely and having your students only source locally. \n\nImporting is a serious game, requires a delicate understanding of all compliance rules and regulations, requires a thorough look at tons of potential suppliers to determine which one is most qualified, and needs quality measures throughout the entire process. \n\nWe receive tons of emails from people who got banned from Amazon because they did not take importing seriously. And most, if not all of them, followed similar advice to what you're saying. So I'm not saying this out of belief, but from multiple real life examples and a strong understanding of this industry. While you may have had success with the imports you've brought in, it does not necessarily mean your method is bulletproof and certainly does not warrant teaching others to follow in your footsteps. \n\nOne point you mentioned that kind of scares me is that you tell people to use PayPal. Whoah, hold up. Your ultimate goal is to build a relationship with a supplier that can 1. be beneficial for both parties, 2. instill a level of trust, 3. have a clear and open path towards a more established relationship in the future. Now tell me, how does using an American processing company, notorious for siding with the buyer, has huge fees, and often very foreign to your new supplier going to help you establish that relationship? Not to mention, if you're using your processing company as your failsafe to protect you, you've already failed. That should have been done long before the production stage.\n\nImporting is a very old industry, people using PayPal is disrupting it and labeling those who use it as prime candidates to be taken advantage, since it highlights on their lack of understanding in the industry. After all, no pro importer is going to use PayPal for their order. \n\nI hope this post wasn't taken as me bullying you or being a dick, because that is not my intent. Since you are offering a course helping newbies out, I can safely assume you truly have their best interests at heart. That being said, be careful with the importing advice you offer, as you really can't base it off of personal experience from your own imports, as that is no proof you acted within compliance rules and regulations.

Check the APR even if you plan on paying it off every month, just so you know what you're getting into. This can vary according to your credit score, so the terms will probably give a range.

Even using only half, I get what I paid for.\n* It's given me my new favorite eyeshadow, my new favorite lipliner, my new favorite lipstick, as well as my new favorite nailpolish.\n* I've received products I didn't even know existed, like finishing powder, as well as products I would never think go well with my complextion/eyecolor/haircolor, but when I try them, they're perfect!\n* Replacing the basics every 12-18 months costs about $300 at CVS, and that's drugstore makeup. I've received all the basics minus foundation and concealer from ipsy, and the brands I'm now using are decent-premium. I've also gotten tweezers and an eyelash curler, each I needed desperately and the ones I was looking at one Amazon were $10-$20. \n* Ipsy lets you earn points for pretty much EVERYTHING - points for getting a \"sneak peak\" at the contents of your bag, points for reviewing each products, points for reviewing the overall bag - and the best part? Points always \"requires\" sharing with friends on facebook, but I don't want to do that, so I just click a little \"my friends don't wear makeup\" button and I still get those points. I estimate that each bag is worth 60-100 points, depending on how much point-stuff you do, and that allows for one to two free products each year.\n* If you go to the page that allows you to review products, it also usually features an ipsy exlusive promo code for that product or company. I got a lipstick that was the perfect lipstick, it was a shade I've spent five years attempting to find, it went on easy, stayed on, and didn't clump. I lost it, was devastated, went to the website and bought a new one for 30% off, plus free shipping, plus a \"surprise\" free gift (it was an amazing luxury mint chapstick). \n* the bags themselves are really cute, and useful!\n\n\n\nSo while each month brings some disappointment, it also brings a lot of excitement. It stinks when a product is incompatiable, or is great, but of poor quality (damn you J.Cat eyeliner!), but each month I've gotten at least one product I couldn't live without, and that alone is worth the $9/month, $110/year value!","name":"t1_cvsjqiu","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-10-08 17:19:01","week":41}

{"id":"cvskgrl","author":"tophoos","body":"I second the discover card. I hardly use my Amazon card. Discover had 5% amazon for 2 quarters this year and double cash back for the first year and a current sign up bonus of $50 ($100 when doubled). Apple pay with discover is also giving 10% where ever that works (doubled to 20%). Android Pay will likely come with similar offer later. Double cash back, Apple pay, 5% category, 1% additional on everything else = up to 32% cash back on in store clothing and department stores that accept apple pay until 12/31. \n\nBack to amazon specific purchases, for me who don't have the double cash back. Turbo Tax gives you the option to get part or all of your tax refund in amazon gift card and will get 10% bonus (5% for basic and online versions) I usually allocate couple hundred bucks here. If or when that runs out, I rely on discover. My amazon card is only used for the 2% restaurants. \n\nAdditionally, discover it &gt; chase freedom for general use. Freedom has a bit more initial cash back, but rewards are nowhere close to Discover (chase ultimate rewards vs discover deals). And apparently, chase is classifying Amazon and some other specific stores as being a \"category\" this quarter. Also, unlike chase, discover's 1% stacks on top of other rewards. \n\nGoing back to the original question, $80 is not that significant. I will never [again] sign up for a credit card without at least $150 value in total incentives. However, your situation may depend on your credit rating. \n\nLastly, referring people also gives $50 rewards and is $100 if you have double cash back.

{"id":"cvsqiwp","author":"nopooq","body":"I was given a free membership for Jet a few months ago, and I decided to give it a try. Around the same time, I lost access to Amazon prime and found that Jet was able to offer me things I literally could not purchase on Amazon without being a prime member. (Certain items I use regularly are sold ONLY to prime members, and you cannot buy them via Amazon otherwise. This, among other changes in Amazon*, really annoyed me and influenced me to lean towards buying things from Jet instead.) \n\nJet filled this void, and I was pretty pleased. I've also found that sometimes, the prices are better than prices on Amazon. Amazon seems to not be the cheapest anymore, so I now will compare the prices of everything I want to order on Jet.com too. Prime shipping is definitely convenient, but by planning ahead and comparing prices, I can save a few dollars every order. \n\n*1. More aggressively pushing Prime on non-prime users while simultaneously raising the price of prime. Annoyingly forcing you to click \"No, I don't want 2 day shipping\" as the only way to dismiss a popup that you need to get by in order to get through to checkout as a non-prime member. Pretty obnoxious. It's not that I don't want 2 day shipping. That would be absurd. It's that I don't want to pay $99 a month to be given the granted \"opportunity\" to buy items that are no longer the cheapest on the web. (I've heard some people finding identical products other than Amazon, like on best buy, with free fast shipping too.) \n\n2. Addon items. No option to pay for shipping. Bummer. \n\n3. They changed a lot of products I specifically ordered through amazon for its convenience and price. With prime, you used to be able to order Bounty paper towels for a good price and have it shipped in 2 days. Then (this was back when I still used Prime) they made it so that those paper towels could only be purchased as a prime pantry item.... and if they were the only things you wanted to get, you'd have to pay $5 for them to put it in a \"prime pantry\" box. This is on top of paying for prime. NO OTHER OPTION to have it shipped slowly. It was really annoying. As someone who lives in a crowded suburban area (hard enough to walk through the crowds in streets outside my apartment, even at nighttime) I don't want to carry an enormous package of paper towels from the drug store (where I'll inevitably pay way too much for them). But that's what I decided to do because the prime pantry idiocy made it less frugal for me to buy paper towels on amazon. At that point, I questioned wether or not I really needed prime. I shouldn't have to pay for them to put it in a \"special\" $5 cardboard box labelled pantry, on top of paying $99 for prime. \n\n\nAbsurdities like that, combined with the fact that Amazon is often not even the best deal on items, make me really hope that Jet takes off.

With a little discipline and attention you can have extra money without living like a hermit.\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\nUse your debit card to pay for everything, that way you have a solid record of what you spend.\n\nCook more, and always have some easy-to-reheat foods in the freezer so you won't be tempted to order food when you're tired/lazy/drunk.\n\nIf you're going out, pre-game with some drinks at home (assuming you're not driving) so when you get to a bar you're only buying one or two more drinks all night.\n\nI can't imagine you could find better than $1,100 rent/utilities - I live in Austin and that's only a little higher than what you'd pay here for a good place in a desirable area.  And $1,100 is well within your budget.\n\nDo you ever go over on your phone bill?  If so look at different plans or switching carriers - I used to go over on my minutes occasionally but don't use much data, so switching to a low-data/unlimited minutes plan saved me that $30 or $40 I would occasionally get hit with for overages.\n\nIf you don't know how to cook, don't be intimidated - it is painfully simple to make delicious meals.  Check out https://www.reddit.com/r/eatcheapandhealthy - and look for free cooking classes, especially at high-end grocery stores.  Great way to learn and meet other singles.\n\nPlan your splurges - hit a good happy hour, [find a place that has great food but allows you to BYOB](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/new-york/byob-restaurants-in-nyc) - a bottle of wine bought retail can be a fraction of what you would pay at a restaurant, use Groupon deals or get tickets for a play at the TKTS booth, meet friends for drinks at a neighborhood bar instead of an overpriced club.\n\nIf you're on Amazon, instead of putting something in your cart, put it onto your wishlist - you'll eventually either take it off the list or buy it, but always make yourself wait a little bit so you're sure it's something you want/need.\n\nANd don't beat yourself up for occassional splurges, just make sure they are occassional","name":"t1_cvsrqz4","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-08 20:34:11","week":41}

I still sell the occasional \"large\" item, I just need to factor the shipping into the sale before I buy it. I just assume it will cost me $15 to ship it, so if I can't make a good enough profit while factoring that in, then I won't pick it up (unless it's something I think I can get rid of fairly quickly locally).\n\nSell on eBay and Amazon MF. Some selling on Kijiji and Facebook groups if it's the right item. Source primarily all my inventory from Facebook buy/sell/auction groups and thrift stores.\n\nI absolutely hate how shitty our dollar is right now - I can't find any good deals online it seems. At least it's decent for price-matching on eBay as I can get more CAD than I could before.\n\nI also hate that PayPal removed the \"Ship Now\" option for creating blank labels in Canada after the eBay split.

{"id":"cvtb6i0","author":"lizard450","body":"First you need to automate all of your payments.  You have more than enough in savings to simply have your checks deposited into your savings and all your spending money and bill pay transferred from savings to pay your bills every month. \n\nFirst.  You decide when you pay your bills.  Not your lenders.  Pay all of your bills on the first of the month.  \n\nSetup a free checking that has bill pay on it.  Setup all of your bills on it.  For bills that are due early in the month pay them 1 month in advance.  For bills due mid-late in the month pay them on the 1st of the month they are due.  It's very important that your bank sends out the checks and that your lenders don't debit your account.  Have nothing debit this account.  There are banks that send out \"bank checks\" for bills and the money is removed immediately from the account so you always have an accurate balance. \n\nGet a credit card preferably one with cash rewards if you can.  Capital One Quicksilver is good.  Point all the bills you can towards your credit card provided your limit can accommodate it.  Cell phone, cable, gym, ez pass etc.  Sum up the total amount of your bills going to this card and have your bill pay checking account send this amount to the card every month. \n\nOpen another checking account at a bank that offers to pay debit card fees.  Figure out your bi-weekly walking around money budget.  Include gas and food.  Perhaps 400-500 2 times a month.  Have a transfer go into the account.  Keep sufficient funds in the account in case you need cash, but primarily use this account to pay your credit card.  \n\nIf you use Amazon .. try to get the 5% store card.  Also try to get a 5% cash back card for gas and groceries.  \n\nSee about getting your high interest student loans transferred to a lower interest rate. \n\nThe honest thing to do would be to negotiate with the property management company to pay it off for less than the total amount due and IN WRITING that it wont go on your credit report.  Personally I'd leave it alone and stop contacting them about it.\n\nAfter looking at your spread sheet I'm not sure your limit would really allow for paying all your bills and using it for day to day stuff.  Maybe 500 for the bills and the 800 for day to day stuff.  I'd strongly consider moving the day to day card to paying it every week and the bills (500) dollar limit 2 times a month.  The idea here is to make sure you keep your credit utilization low.  1-9% is idea.  Try to make it so that your statements come out $5-$45 and $7-63$ monthly.  Capital One is great in my experience if you use the card close to max and pay it down every month they will increase your limit in about 6 months.  \n\nI'd also look into paying on your smaller student loans.  I'd target the highest interest first.  If you have 2 loans that are high interest then start with the smallest balance.  It's also possible that these loans aren't incurring interest.  I'd consider taking 2k from your savings and putting a dent in that 7k loan or knocking out some of your smaller loans.  I'd pick a sizable amount of money you can afford and pay on your student loans.  Something like $700.00 a month.\n\n\nBasically what this plan is going to do for you is the following.  \n1.  Eliminate your late payments.  This is the most important.\n2.  Keeping your credit utilization low.  This is a really big help for your credit score. \n3.  Putting your money to good use in terms of knocking down that student loan debt.  Since they are deferred I'd hold off on consolidating immediately in case that might affect there status. \n\n","name":"t1_cvtb6i0","subreddit":"CRedit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qph1","created_utc":"2015-10-09 05:08:41","week":41}

{"id":"cvu4s6z","author":"vglegacy","body":"This is basically what I know about marketing and turnover on mobile games. There is basically 5 ways of getting people to your game and making money. They are:\n\n* 1 - make your game free and put in advertisements - VERY low payout\n\n* 2 - make your game free and put in microtransactions - note: generates hate at your customers\n\n* 3 - make your game paid and contact affiliate marketeers - very effective and you only pay them per sale\n\n* 4 - make your game paid or free and pay for advertisements - can cost a lot of money and turnover might not be as high as you want it. Very risky.\n\n* 5 - paid or free, send free keys to reviewers. - Reviews give you a lot of traffic.\n\nIn my experience, this is how it works per platform:\n\nAndroid: \nAndroid does not have affiliate marketing, no free keys to send out and no gifting apps. If you have a paid game, you are screwed, because your only option is to refund the price of your game to reviewers and they do not like that AND it gives you legal trouble. You either get a VERY good (read: expensive) marketeer or go the Google ads + microtransactions (also by google) route.\n\nIOS:\nItunes wants you to become a developer for $90 per year. This means that they want you to keep developing a lot of apps or games if you want it to be worth the money. If you have only 1 game, those 90 bucks might even be lower than your revenue in 1 year. This does not bode well, thinking of recent activities at Itunes, but as long as you pay the yearly fee, your game is in the store. Fortunately, they have an affiliate program and free keys to give out, so you can look for yourself if you want to make your game paid or freemium.\n\nWindows Phone:\nHaha! No. But who knows, maybe there is some untapped potential here...\n\nDon't bother with alternative stores. Unfortunately, not even the Amazon app store makes a big dent for you in the android market.\n\nI hope this helps.

Proving the ROI is rough because I've noticed a gap between customer retention and proving that's worth $X.

Sadly, couldn't measure how many people showed up because the event was canceled due to the suing issue. Plus side, I got to show them what $100 for promoted posts could do! Downside, they took down some posts due to legal reasons so the only proof I have is on my personal account. Screenshots make for a shitty portfolio.\n\nYour'e right about the SBA loans. Spent a good few hours navigating the website, reviewing legalzoom, and still left with almost no clue how to even apply or what my chances are. There was some small loan program Obama put it and for better or worse I'm a minority but there wasn't a lot of case studies or blueprints for successfully getting funded.\n\n3 years won't look good for me since grad students in the US don't make a lot.\n\nI debated website flipping, even for super niche products like baby strollers or popcorn makers, but I keep having this odd sense people default flock to better known channels like Amazon and with the success of small FBA businesses it doesn't help disprove my gut feeling.

{"id":"cvudo0w","author":"gittenlucky","body":"Ok, this is really an easy fix. First unplug absolutely everything that you can. Turn off your furnace with that little red switch. If you can't turn something off, flip the breaker for it (like your well pump or your electric oven). You will not harm anything doing this.  It is just like a power outage where everything turns off. When everything is off, look at your electric meter and see if it is still spinning or counting. If it is, you missed something or your power is being stolen.  Start turning stuff on one item at a time and see what makes your meter spin abnormally fast. If something is making it spin slow, it is probably ok. unplug it and try something else.  \n\n$300 is a ridiculous electric bill. I am guessing that you have a problem like a hole in the water pipe for your well.  If their is a hole, your well pump would be running continuously and would cost about $100-200 in a month. \n\nIf you need more tips let me know what you have tried and the result and I can try to help more. \n\nEdit: there is a device called kill-a-watt or something similar. It's like $20 on Amazon and it will tell you what a normal device plugged in to the wall consumes. I don't think that is the issue here though since you are using a lot of power.

This means some people believe the market is way overvalued, and is due to pop.\n\nWhen investing in tech, you essentially have to throw away any old books on economics. No old-school methods were written with the comprehension of how quickly (and cheaply) tech companies can scale. For walmart to become a nationwide chain, they need thousands of stores, hundreds of distribution centres, an incredibly advanced logistics process, suppliers and employees.....For Netflix to offer their services to 150m customers in Japan, it's some paperwork (okok, way more goes into it, but hardly the walmart scenario).\n\nI invested in these companies 3-5 years ago (as soon as I could) and right now if you head to /r/investing, they'd run me out of the place for being full of shit and regurgitating the circle-jerk. Either way, if you promise to stay away from that sub, there are convincing arguments why these companies are still in their infancy. \n\nTSLA - in 15 years, cars will hardly be a line on their revenue\n\nNFLX - even with an extreme P:E, they're just getting started at revolutionizing the entertainment industry. no real competition (yet...be weary)\n\nGOOG - they are just getting started. They have almost documented the world's information. \n\nSCTY (and other solar).  according to kurzweil, moores law has been steadily seen for solar for 30yr. After 30yr we just hit 1% global usage. Seems minimal, but that's only 14 yrs away from a theoretical 100 capability (of today's output). Cells are getting more and more efficient. \n\n3D printing (DDD, SSYS, XONE) -- I'd say about 10 years before we see 3d printers in the modern home. It will make everything from clothes to replacement parts. 2013 saw a crazy spike thanks to some media hype and well-timed IPOs, but it has crashed significantly. \n\nAMZN - no brainer. The future is almost here, and they are well-equipped to handle the next revolution in product delivery. \n\n\nYou can easily focus on these giants, and partake in some small-cap companies you feel might be the next \"facebook\". \n\n[I highly recommend this popular book.

A company could issue (additional) debt, which would lower its book value, thus making it seem more deceptively more attractive, assuming profits at the very least, don't drop.  \n\nA better metric (and one that I use) is to see the CAGR of a company's retained earnings. \n\n&gt; tl:dr; I asked questions to see if you are an intelligent investor(one that looks at the financial statements before buying), I showed that I would not buy YUM if I was looking for a good ROI.\n\nProblem is that YUM does have excellent performance numbers: 30+% ROIC/ROE. P/B is a function of ROE: Higher ROE generally entails higher P/B. You want mismatched P/B and ROE: Go long low P/B with high ROE (i.e. JNJ), and short high P/B with low ROE (i.e. AMZN).

{"id":"cvvf4ns","author":"newerredditaccount","body":"I've only banked with Chase my whole life. \n\nWhen I was sixteen I opened up a checking and savings account with them. After a couple of years (when my account was no longer a joint account) I noticed a monthly service fee popping up. I called them up and they told me I just need a $ 25 automatic transfer each month from my checking to savings to prevent a service charge to my account. Not a big deal. I just set it up so it's the day after I get direct deposit from my job into my checking account. I chalked this up to me being a dumb teenager that didn't read the terms of my account when I signed up. After I set this up I never got the charge. They were even nice enough to waive one month charge for me.\n\nThree years ago I got a Chase freedom card with them. This is my only credit card, so I don't want to compare them to other cards. It works great for me.  I can pay online from a computer. The payment is processed same day if it is before 5:00 pm. Otherwise it will go on the next day. I've never had it take longer than this to process. I also try to use my credit card similar to a debit. I try to pay it off in the month before it is billed. In the rare circumstances that I can't do this, I pay it off in full when it is billed. I was just raised to be paranoid about carrying a credit card balance when I don't need to. I also recently got a smartphone and their app works great. Can check balances, make payments, transfers, etc. Rewards are decent. I normally just get it turned into a cash deposit into my account. Once again, I can just attest to the ease of use. I don't how rewards or interest rates compare to other cards.\n\nJust opened up a joint debit card this past summer with my girlfriend. (Trying to slowly ease into an eventual shared finances situation. This is used to pay off shared bills only) We had a two month grace period before the terms set. (minimum daily balance of $ 1500, or balance of $ 5000 between all linked accounts to avoid a $ 12 monthly charge). We decided this was acceptable so we went through with it. It's the start of the fourth month, and we were not charged during month three despite not meeting those terms. \n\nMy only real incident with them was this past summer. I was traveling in a major city that I don't go to, and had a $ 200 charge on my freedom card. This flagged as an unusual charge so my card was declined. After arguing with the bartender about how my card was fully paid off, he suggested that I call the number on the back of the card. I did, provided my information to ensure it was me, and got it released in 5 minutes. I am not mad at this because it was a very unusual charge. Prior to this I have been saving my money very much (paying off loans), and it had been over a year since I made a purchase like this at a bar. Also, it was at a city I don't normally go to. I'm just glad I was able to get it fixed quickly.\n\nIf you have overdraft set up, they will have a service charge for those. I had that once or twice and it sucks. Since then I've started watching my accounts much more closely to ensure that never happens. \n\nThe Chase employees are very nice wherever I go. I've been to 5 or 6 that all around me (Apartment, work, where my family lives, etc) and each one has had friendly and competent workers.\n\nBut yeah I love Chase and I plan on continuing to bank with them for the foreseeable future. Might get a Chase slate card eventually. Right now I have no need for another credit card so I haven't looked into it\n\nEdit: Forgot I have an Amazon credit card I rarely use. This card is through Chase so its balance can be viewed on the same page as my other cards. Apparently has horrible interest rates, but I'm always sure to pay it off right away when using it. \n","name":"t1_cvvf4ns","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-11 04:31:15","week":41}
{"id":"cvvgfb8","author":"yo1k2tog","body":"It depends on what you need.  Dimming bulbs are more expensive than non-dimming.  Many 50-100 watt bulbs are subsidized by local power companies or governments, so you often find weird price disparities at state or county lines.  And oddly, sometimes the single bulbs are the ones with the subsidy, so the multipacks are sometimes more expensive than the same number in singles. \n\nI ended up buying some from Costco (the non-dimmables in multipacks), some from Amazon (they had a fantastic warehouse sale at one point with the frustration free packaging) and lots of dimmable BR30s from Home Depot (coupons, portal, buy online, in store pick up and the fact that the store just over the county line had incredible subsidies at one point)\n\nThe only other advice I have is to pick a brand and stick with it in each room.

That guy was a boss!!!","name":"t1_cvw0ghw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-11 20:10:44","week":41}
{"id":"cvw29ub","author":"zer0cul","body":"Since January I have redeemed $1600 in cashback.  I have another $350 ready to redeem.  I have gotten $1500 Amazon gift cards (not available anymore).  I could redeem UR for cash and get another $2k or so.  I have a week at any Wyndham hotel (this cost around $100).  \n\nSeparate: For Christmas $1000 worth of gift cards for $450.  Last summer I saved around $250 on gas (buying gift cards from Giant).\n\nSide note: lots of this is from MS, but nothing too crazy.  Just $5k per month for me and $5k per month for my wife.  We have opened 14 cards to get these benefits.\n\n**EDIT:** I have paid around $400 in gift card fees.  So profit is ~$5450 and loss is ~$400.","name":"t1_cvw29ub","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-10-11 20:57:34","week":41}
{"id":"cvw4xib","author":"craig4nr","body":"Yeah if you've got nothing in min drigh tnow just keep saving it. The holidays are coming and it'll make easy money for gifts. I live in Seattle, and here we have AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Now, so sometimes I'm able to order groceries via Amazon (though I don't do it often because Prime Now has very limited selection and Fresh has outrageous prices). Otherwise I just keep adding ot my balance. I know I'll need it for something eventually and I'll be glad I have it.","name":"t1_cvw4xib","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-10-11 22:03:06","week":41}

{"id":"cvw97wk","author":"tjd12200","body":"Hey there!\n\nIt is very possible to get a sale within the first few months of launching a business. Running a business is a lot more than just setting up a website and hoping for some sales. You said you have experience in boosting your friend's sales with their eBay and Amazon sales, so what did you do so differently for them? Was it because you were on the outside looking in? Maybe try to apply some of those techniques to what you're trying to do for yourself.\n\nMy wife and I recently took over the [mail order orange](http://mailorderoranges.com) business, which is riding on the coattails of potatoparcel's success. It's a crazy simple idea that is actually turning some profit, to our surprise. Many different companies do this as well, as most people don't come up with their own original ideas.\n\nAs far as marketing, Fiverr is great, twitter ads, facebook ads, etc are all great sources for paid advertising. Free traffic from SEO takes a lot of time and effort on your part, unless you outsource the work. Even local marketing such as flyers, business cards, and word of mouth can be incredibly effective depending on what you're selling. It all comes down to your target audience and who you are trying to sell to. \n\nRemember, friends and family are the easiest to sell to, especially if you want to get a couple sales right off the bat. They will be your biggest fans and best form of personal testimony as well.","name":"t1_cvw97wk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-11 23:54:58","week":41}
