I haven't tracked down a product or found a niche, but I did think building out a space in my bedroom would be a good start.\n\nI gave myself a $200 budget. My main focuses were storage for inventory, storage for packing materials, and a standing desk. 80% of my finds are from craigslist and I will modify or add to as needed. \n\nI'd love to see some of your eCommerce setups as I am sure mine will pale in comparison.  I had a similar setup about 4 years ago with sales on average of $15,000 per month. I stopped when a close relative died but that's a long story and I am ready to get back in. \n\nI will be measuring out my space and writing it off as a portion of my rent. \n\nThanks! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/GgMnf","name":"t3_3vq1rn","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-07 00:59:12","week":50}

With some provisional checking on Twitter, it became clear that many people were tweeting messages to the effect of \"My work's secret santa budget is only $5, what am I going to get with that?\" and \"I just picked out my secret santa and I think I've met this person like once!\"\n\nThe issues appeared to be relatable and I decided to have a go with building a page that would allow you to set your budget and get suggestions based on a persons broad characteristics. Given that I launched the site quite late in the season (a lesson learned for next year) I've so far had reasonably good feedback and even some sales!\n\nThis is my first Amazon affiliate site and I've learnt so much in just going at it and trying.

Especially if you missed out when the promotion was happening this summer.\n\nBasically you spend a few minutes per review on one of their thousands of software options ranging from ordinary programs like Google Analytics and Quickbooks to programs no one outside of your industry has heard of. $15 in Amazon credit for your first review and $10 bucks Amazon credit for each one after that sent to your email.\n\nI've [done several and gotten paid out reliably](http://imgur.com/L6xcV6x), and because the reviews are so short, it ends up being easy money. \n\nWhat you need to know to make this work for you:\n\n* Only taking reviewers from the U.S. \n* English reviews only. \n* No sign-up required. Just leave an email so they can send the gift card codes.\n* Make sure all your reviews are in proper grammatical form. Copy-pasting reviews from elsewhere and plagiarism won't work here.\n* You need to already have an active LinkedIn account with linked email to verify you aren't a bot. No half-built accounts with zero contacts - it's their way of seeing you are a real person.\n* Payouts every Friday; payment is made the following week for reviews and every other Friday for referrals.\n\n**Referral Program** \n\nThey also offer a referral program so you can pass this along to your industry friends, with $5 Amazon gift cards for every person who leaves a review through your referral link up to $500 total (100 people), which they provide after the person you referred completes at least one review. \n\n[If you found this post informative think about clicking here to use my referral link](http://www.findthebest.com/publishers/upload/other/review_offer.html?source=referral&amp;referral=maritza.valle@relationalcare.org). \n\n[If that doesn't tickle your fancy, click here for the non-referral link](http://www.findthebest.com/publishers/upload/other/review_offer.html).\n\nLeave a few and rack up the easy gift cards just in time for Christmas!","name":"t3_3vy5q1","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-12-08 17:50:51","week":50}

{"id":"3vyfts","author":"GombyJabbared","body":"Hello. I have been reading through r/PersonalFinance FAQs. Everything has been really helpful. I am building up an emergency fund. I have taken a look at my retirement accounts to make sure they have been rolled over into IRA's and invested in ETFs. Now, I am looking at credit card strategies.\n\nI had been reading about credit cards. General consensus seems to be that you need two. One card for the specialized sector you might be heavily pinging and one that returns 2% (or so) on everything. The following card looked really promising:\n\nSallie Mae MasterCard  5% on gas, groceries, and books \"read Amazon\" (with caps), 1% otherwise\n\nHowever, I don't know if that particular card is available anymore. When I go to Sallie Mae's site I don't find it. I find something similar, but it involves going to amazon through their mall or somesuch. Basically, my wife and I are Amazon Prime members because the shipping is free and the cost of items is usually lowest. A lot of money filters through Amazon. What I liked about this card is that I could use it and get 5% for groceries, gas, and Amazon. That represents a large portion of what we spend every month. Everything else, I want to use a 2% card like Citi Double or something else.\n\nSo, has that Sallie Mae \"Amazon\" card been discontinued?

{"id":"3vysbm","author":"bpfergu","body":"I received a ton of PMs with questions about how I do niche review sites. First off, I am not even close to being an expert on this and there are many people on /r/entrepreneur that are much more knowledgeable on the subject and have had a lot more success than me.  I have only been doing this since basically the spring and am learning along the way.   I’m sure there are a ton of things I could be doing better such as providing more updates (I do maybe one per month right now), creating a social media presence (I finally created facebook pages for my sites but have done absolutely nothing on them haha), doing more extensive long tailed keyword research, optimizing where my ads and buttons are located, etc.  The key here is that just 8 months ago I had no idea wtf I was doing and I am just learning along the way.  I don’t know how to code worth a shit.  I am no SEO expert.  I don’t have some extensive private blog network that I can instantly boost new sites up on.  I’m just a regular dude who wanted to make some money on the side.\n\nHere are the analytics of my “oldest” site (a whole whopping 7ish months old!), filtered by sessions per day.  \n\nhttp://imgur.com/9vOlSe7\n\nNotice the healthy, linearly increasing upward trend.  This is almost entirely organic searches and as I mentioned above I do essentially no marketing or social media for this site, nor do I make many updates.\n\nIn terms of money made for this particular site, last month I made a little under $230 from Amazon Associates and another $110ish from Google Adsense.  Here is last month for Amazon.  Notice the nearly 20% conversion rate.  I’m quite proud of that.  \n\nhttp://imgur.com/l8tyjyT\n\nInterestingly each month has seen about a 30% increase over the previous month once money started coming in, and so far this month I’ve already made over $140 from the site (again, holidays might have something to do with it.  I have no idea).  Obviously I don’t expect this 30% increase to continue forever but it can continue to for as long as it wants.   I won’t mind one bit.  :)  My other sites are seeing a similar trend.  The key here is that if you can get multiple sites like this going the money can really add up.\n\nAs for how I do it.  There is no magical recipe.  And if there is I sure don’t know it.  I have seen so many articles and blogs talking about how all you need to do is some keyword research, find the perfect product, slap together a simple site with 4 or 5 pages of mundane reviews, and within a few weeks the money will start rolling in.  Unfortunately I have discovered the exact opposite.\n\nI have discovered that the best way to rank well in google is just through good old-fashioned hard work.  There are still plenty of people that take advantage of PBNs and boost their sites up.  There are lots of people utilizing black hat backlink strategies to gain an edge.  I don’t know anything about all of that stuff and quite frankly I decided early on that I would rather produce something that can stand on its own and where I don’t have to worry about google anchoring me at any given moment.  In addition, I have found that if you produce quality content people will actively link back to your site.  You don’t even have to ask them!  \n\nThis is already quite long so I will summarize how I approach each site:\n\n1.\tI spend many hours doing research on keywords.  The key here is to get on the front page of search engine results.  The front page is the Holy Grail.  Very few people click past the first page on a search, and the search engines work very hard to make sure that the first page’s results will adequately fulfill the user’s wants and needs.  However, making it to the front page for “Vegetarian hippo lipstick holder” will probably not net you many viewers because very few people actually search for that.  So you have to find search topics that you can rank well on but that are also actively searched for.  I’m not going to delve into the specifics of how to do that because there are a lot better tutorials out there if you search for them as well as programs that can assist with it.\n\n2.\tAfter I have my product(s), I do extensive research on every manufacturer that produces it and also cross-reference the results with what is available on Amazon.  It is pointless to do a review on a product if you don’t even provide an affiliate link where they can purchase it.\n\n3.\tAfter I have my list of products, I do extensive reviews on them.  I will scrape every source that I can to get UNIQUE and HELPFUL reviews from people that have actually used them.  So many niche sites will simply copy and paste the manufacturer’s description or regurgitate product specs.  This doesn’t help the user.  They can find that shit themselves from the manufacturer.  You need to absorb yourself in all of the existing reviews out there, both positive and negative.  You need to create an overall aggregate review of the product that lists its pros and cons.  That creates value and search engines love when you create value.  Amazon reviews is a great place for this, along with forums, blogs, etc.\n\n4.\tOnce I have the overall reviews, I create rank metrics.   I will think of a few metrics that adequately encompass the product.  For instance, if I was doing washing machines these metrics could be: load size, cleaning ability, power requirements, user interface, cost, and overall rating.  For each of these metrics I will assign a value such as 1 to 5 stars or 1 to 10 or something like that and then break each down each ranking below.  The end result is that you end up with a HUGE review loaded with content and more importantly loaded with organic long-tailed keywords that you will get a majority of your viewers from.\n\n5.\tAfter I have all of the review stuff done, I categorize the items.  So many niche review sites are absolute shit about this.  They go to amazon and do a search for the most popular/expensive items and then slap all the reviews on a single page.  People need an easy way to digest information.  Depending on the product you could create all sorts of categories: small, medium, and large.  Beginner, intermediate, and professional.  Outdoor and indoor.  Budget, average, and premium.  Categorize by manufacturer.  Tons of ways to do this.   I will create drop down menus in the header that show these.  It gives your site depth, makes it easier to digest for the user, and makes it look much more professional.\n\n6.\tOnce you’ve done all of this, take advantage of your ranking system you put in place.  Display on your homepage what the top products from each category are according to your ranking.  I can’t tell you how many people go to the homepage, see the area that basically says “hey, here are the top products for whatever category you are looking for”.  Click that link first thing and simply add that product to the cart without doing any more analysis.  Most online shoppers like to be spoon-fed.  They don’t want to read dozens of reviews.  They want someone in a professional looking suit to come up to them and say “This is the best option.  Trust me.  Look how professional I look.”.  \n\nThat’s the main points.  Depending on the product, this process can take quite a while.  The end result is oftentimes 100+ pages of quality content.  For website design I use Divi by Elegant Themes.  I allows amazing customization with little to no programming experience.  I use SEO by Yoast for optimizing pages.  This is extremely important.  I create buttons with Maxbuttons as it is super simple and allows great customization.  Any other questions feel free to ask and I’ll try to get to them.\n","name":"t3_3vysbm","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-08 20:09:03","week":50}

{"id":"3w2d3i","author":"silveri5","body":"Hi guys,\n\nA little background from me, I am 23 y.o female live in Asia and work as freelance writer. I work for my friends so the payment is pretty shitty. I am going to work with a foreign company but we are going to postpone that for some reasons. \n\nNow, I have been thinking a lot about starting my own business. I have read a lot of stuff here and there about entrepreneurship while working as content writer. However, I feel as if I still don’t know a thing about it and don’t know how to start a good one.  My friend told me that I should make a website since I love writing. We have made a good deal so far but he wants me to send out a good concept so we can start to work on the website. But I still have a lot of doubts in myself because I am a freelance worker and I have pretty shitty personality and sometimes I got too depressed. \n\nWriting is like the only skill I can improve from time to time. Making a website is always my dream and I would like to make it as a business prospect if possible. I think affiliate marketing would be the best decision to make. Now I want to ask several questions. \n\n1. If it’s brand new website, how many percentage I will success to start earning money from it? If the percentage of the success is too low, what should I do?\n\n2. I like to write about automotive, healthy lifestyle, home improvement and yoga. Is it okay to actually put all of these topic into one website only? (I will not be able to host more than one website since I am busy working too)\n\n3. What’s the best solution to start a business other than affiliate marketing?\n\n4. I live in Asia, I am interested in using Goggle AdSense, Click bank and Amazon. The website will be in English, is it going to work if my skill of writing isn’t too good? ( I am not interested in hiring content writer since I have a lot of content already but it has low-quality)\n\n5. I am also interested in using some local affiliate business. Will it work since they use my native language?\n\nI have a little information about business, affiliate marketing, SEO, earning money online and etc. if someone notice my mistake in using the term, feel free to tell me. I am also interested in making friends with some people who are willing to teach me about all of this, so PM me if you are willing to have a good discussion. \n\nThanks a lot for reading it through the end, I hope I can get pretty good feedback here.\n\nEdit 1: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: So sorry for grammar errors \n\nEdit 3: Thanks a lot for all of valuable inputs, I appreciate it. I am taking some notes and I want to discuss it with my friend as well. I am so sorry that I can't reply to you one by one. If I have further question I will ask you directly here or through PM.

{"id":"3w85b8","author":"Tkachenko","body":"Hey, guys. So I've been growing a niche Instagram page that I've started around 6 weeks ago in hopes of creating a userbase to 1) earn revenue from promotional IG posts and 2) direct them to a website with Amazon affiliate links relating to my niche. 1 is currently in progress as I'm speaking to several different companies regarding sponsored posts with monetary incentive. For 2, I'm currently learning wordpress and I think I can get the hang of it, but it will take a lot of time to get my website to look like I want it to. A friend recommended SquareSpace as an alternative to this. I've looked into it, and it seems very appealing, especially the clean look, mobile optimization (I expect the vast majority of my website conversions to be mobile) and 50% off the first year with a .edu email address. Has anyone had experience with SS? Should I stick with Wordpress?

{"id":"3w8tjl","author":"RVelts","body":"This has always been YMMV but most people feel confident that loading Serve from an Amex-issued card would count toward minimum spend, even though it does not generate MR.\n\nApplied for Amex Everyday on 11/4, account opened same day. Offered 15k MR for 1k min spend in 90 days. Loaded 5x$200 to Serve along with some regular spend (Amazon). \n\nI've read that MR bonuses post immediately upon hitting the min spend, and that did not happen. I waited for my statement to close on 12/3 and I did not receive any points. I paid off the statement (1k bill pay from Serve, the rest from my bank account) and still have not seen any points post.\n\nI realize that regular spend MR can take two billing statements to post, and I have not seen any of those yet, but I did not expect to.

We also spend about that much on the adults (and my SO has a HUGE family that all expect gifts--4 siblings and their SO's, plus parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc), but that's another story entirely.  \n\nThe past few months have been a bit tight financially because of some medical bills and I'd like to know if you think my plan for the kid's gifts sounds good. \n\nI'm thinking I can get them all a group gift (costing about $15), and then get each kid a small separate toy.

{"id":"3w9p2s","author":"yalcinbo","body":"A lot of people have been asking about the basics of online marketing and how to get started and make money.  So, I decided to put together this “outline” on the steps you need to take to get started, and what you need to be successful.\n\nKeep in mind this is not a comprehensive explanation on exactly what you need to do, and as with anything else it takes time, patience, and a lot of effort to make any real money in the online marketing arena.\n\nSorry for the length in advance, but I wanted to make sure I give everyone a good layout so they can either ask more specific questions or they can take some immediate action with this information.\n\nWhen I was learning it was nearly impossible to find an affiliate site that I could use as an example, it seemed everyone out there, the guys writing books and charging for this info, were so secretive.  I don’t want you to go through the same trial and error.  So I’m going to post the first site I ever made below for you to look at and see what not to do (I used black hat SEO with terrible content, which led to an 89% bounce rate and no money).  I’m also going to post the site I launched last month which has useful content and no tricky SEO business which ranks on Google after only one month and that makes money.  This way you’ll have a template to use for your own site.\n\nwww.paleodonebetter.com (this is the site that makes nothing)\nwww.lyftsignup.us (this is the site that has generated $750 in just 30 days)\n\nStep One: Find a Niche\n\nYou need to find a niche.  The way I go about this is first search Clickbank.com to see what products are paying well and actually selling.  I look for a Gravity score of at least 50, this means people are actually making money off of this.\n\nAfter I find a couple good affiliate programs I head over to Amazon to see if they have products that I can sell to my readers, you need to make sure Amazon has enough items.  This will supplement your income that you make from the affiliate program that you chose.\n\nStep Two: Do the Research\n\nAt this point you should have at least 2 to 3 products in mind, possibly in different niches, but you need to do the research to see which is the most feasible.  Your going to need a Google Adwords account for this, but don’t worry its free.  After you get your account heard over to the Tools tab and use Google Keyword Planner, click the generate ideas tab to begin.\n\nType in your main keyword, for example if your affiliate program is for weight loss pills you might type in weight loss.  Google will give you a bunch of related search data, export this into an excel file.  \n\nTo get more keywords, long-tail keywords, take that weight loss keyword and put it into a site called ubersuggest.org.  This will give you a giant list of long-tail keywords.  Take that list and import it into Google Keyword Planner to get the data on the keywords.\n\nPut that data into an excel sheet and delete anything that has less than 50 monthly searches.  After this combine the lists, and sort it by monthly search volume.  I don’t target anything over 1,000 searches because the competition is to stiff.\n\nAt the end you should have a list of at least 50 to 100 keywords with a search range of 1,000 to 50.  These are the keywords you’re going to be focusing on.\n\nOnce you have this spreadsheet download Market Samurai, the free version will do just fine, and analyze the SEO completion for each keyword.  Select the 20 keywords with the least completion from your list, we’re going to use that for content creation.\n\nStep Three: Make a Publishing List \n\nWith these 20 keywords you need to start creating content targeting each keyword, this is your gameplan to get ranked on Google .  Make sure each post is between 300 and 600 words, generally lists; along with short paragraphs do well.  Make sure you use your targeted keyword a few times in the post, and once in the first paragraph for SEO purposes.\n\nFinish at least 10-12 posts ahead of time, so you have content on your site as soon as you launch.\n\nStep Four: Wordpress Site\n\nI use GoDaddy and buy a domain name with hosting for a Wordpress site; once you have multiple sites it’s much easier to manage using the GoDaddy platform.  \n\nSelect a theme, if you need help selecting a good theme let me know, then begin planning the design of the site and putting the blog together (include at least one picture for every post and link it to your affiliate code).  \n\nYour site should have at least a blog section, a resources section (for your Amazon Associate products), an about us page, and a contact page.  Use the Yoast SEO plugin to do your on page optimization.\n\nStep Five: Getting Traffic\n\nOnce your site is ready, meaning all your products are up, the affiliate links are placed, and the design and flow are to your liking you’re ready to start driving traffic.  \n\nThe quickest way to get results is Google Adwords PPC, but this will cost you money.  Start slow with a max daily budget of $5 and see what your CTR rate is on the ad (should be at least 2%).  Then use a/b testing to improve these results.\n\nIn addition to this talk to as many people you can about what you’re doing, don’t spam anyone rather help people.  If you have a weight loss website find some weight loss threads or forums and give people some good content, trust me your site will start getting a lot of traffic this way.\n\nIf your content is good and you add content at least once a week to your blog you should start ranking for your long-tail, low completion keywords in a few months.  This will bring you organic search engine traffic and you’re off to the races.\n\nIf you’ve read this far I appreciate your time, and I hope you found the information to be helpful.  You may have a lot of questions now that you know what you didn’t know 10 minutes ago.  If this is the case feel free to contact me, I’ll do my best to either help or point you in the right direction.  Below are some resources that are going to make your life easier; I hope you find them helpful.  Again, thanks for reading and good luck, just work hard and give it some time, if you stick with you’ll start seeing results and dollars soon enough!\n\nProduct Selection (Niche Research):\nClickbank.com (easy to join and start using immediately)\nPeerfly.com (there’s an application process, but its worth having a backup marketplace to find affiliate products)\nAmazon Associates (low commission (4%-7%, but it will supplement your website with pages/session numbers and some income)\n\nKeyword Research:\nGoogle Adwords (free to start an account, you just need a Gmail account, you’ll be using Google Keyword Planner here and Adwords for PPC marketing)\nUbersuggest.org (completely free and it’ll give you keywords that Google wont, great for long-tail keywords)\nMarket Samurai (the full version is $150 if I remember correctly, but the free one is good enough to analyze your competition and see which keywords will be easier to rank for)\n\nWebsite:\nGoDaddy.com (find the hosting tab and chose the managed wordpress option, purchase your domain name and build out your site from here)\nYoast SEO (crucial for on page optimization for your SEO, also gives you good details on what your posts/pages are missing so you can improve them for SEO)\nvCite (great for inputing widgets that call your users to action, or for collecting emails to begin an email list you can blast market to push products)\n","name":"t3_3w9p2s","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-10 21:00:27","week":50}
{"id":"3w9pto","author":"swjedinight1","body":" First off, I would like to preface this with yes, I am going to promote myself. I want to get that out of the way right off the bat. I have a great story to tell along the way, but alas, I really just want you to buy my books. Actually I want you to borrow them.\n\n\nMy journey takes place a lot longer than three months ago. I have always been a fan of Internet Marketing. I treated it as an interest that I would one day pursue or a hobby I liked to dabble and daydream about. Along the way I have tried a great many things in my vain attempt to make money online. (For you marketers, I used the keyword “make money online” when I really didn’t have to just to increase my keyword count.) I don’t want this to come off sounding like a sales pitch because honestly I rather like my story. Suffice it to say though, that I did try a lot of things in the Internet Marketing realm and some of them I’m not so proud of. (As a devout Christian, I even tried uploading porn for paid sign-ups until my morality grabbed hold of my common sense and beat the tar out of it.)\n\n\nI stumbled across Kindle Publishing Direct, or KDP earlier this year and instantly fell in love with it. I am an avid reader and call myself something of a writer. (I suck.) There was something about Kindle Publishing that really called my name. I guess it was the idea of publishing some of my works as well as running a business all in one that really sold it for me.\n\n\nThis is where my Journey for this Reddit post begins. I published my first book in July and had mediocre success in the publishing world, but as an author it was a complete bomb. I didn’t have a clue on what I was doing even with my Internet Marketing background. I doubled down my efforts and went to work researching everything I could on Kindle Publishing Direct. Like any sane person does after searching for minutes with no luck, I went to YouTube. I told myself I was going to look up videos on KDP but really I wanted to check out funny cat videos. I availed myself to search out KDP after a few small hours of hardly laughs, (damn cats get me every time!) and came across a guy who was somewhat of an expert in KDP. I rabidly watched every video in record time.\n\n\nThis actually took me quite a while to do in reality as he had over 50 videos on KDP and most of them were 20+ minutes long but that doesn’t make for good writing. Over the course of a month I started applying some of the strategies I learned from YouTube on my lone book. I learned how to target a keyword instead of a category to increase my sales rank. I learned something else that really increased my sales. Kindle Direct Publishing had just recently changed their payout structure which really hurt a lot of people. They packed up their businesses and went looking for greener pastures. I found this to be a great opportunity.\n\n\nKDP used to pay people two ways. It would pay you for whatever direct sales you made at whatever price point you set for your book, as well as anyone who borrowed your book through its Prime membership. People made a killing by having their eBooks borrowed by Prime users and it was a win for everyone but Amazon. Big Daddy Amazon of course made changes and wrecked everyone’s free lunch. They changed their borrowed structure by starting a new program called Kindle Unlimited. Members pay 9.99$ a month and basically get to Netflix books. It changed from paying per borrow (which was around 1.35$ per book the lucky bastards) to paying per page read (which is around .0048$ now….mean face!)\n\n\nThis is where my empire truly formed. If you have an eBook that is 300 pages you’ll get about 1.44$ granted the person who borrowed it reads the entire thing. But here’s the catch, most people don’t read past the first chapters of even very popular books (I still haven’t finished the Hunger Games!) You need to get the reader to the end of the book to get all your pages read. \n\nI applied one of the strategies I learned from YouTube and offered the reader another eBook right off the bat. I made a pretty and shiny red button that was clickable and said “FREE!” and placed it right below the headline “Get My eBook ‘insert eBook title here’ Now!” The Button would take them to the back of the book where they could click on a link which would take them to a landing page where I collected there email address so I could send them a copy of the eBook as promised.\n\n\nI don’t know if you saw what I did but it was a huge gold mine which makes me a lot of money. When someone clicks on the link it takes them to the back of the book. It actually counts all the pages as read! I have to take a minute here and place my own interjections in here. I emailed Amazon to see if I was actually allowed to do that and it was encouraged! As per Amazons TOS they want you to have a clickable (Hyperlinked) Table of Contents. I asked them one more question, do they allow Boxsets or Collections of books in one book. When I got the “affirmative” from Amazon that, Yes, I could box up my works of writing into one eBook that’s exactly what I did.\n\n\nI started writing my other four books. I don’t know if you know this, but if you have 5 eBooks there are 20 different ways you can package them, (One book can have 4 others in it, totaling 5 complete books in all.) Some of the overall page lengths for these books are 1,500 pages long. That combined with my Free gift at the front means a 7.20$ profit for me. I make around 1.44$ to 7.20 every time someone borrows my book and collects their free book. The books retail for 2.99$ so as you can see I’d rather you borrow my books than buy them.\n\n\nThere is one subtle thing that was missed in all of this which makes up over half of my income and that’s the email addresses I have collected. There is an Industry standard in Internet Marketing that states “each email address should account for 1$ a month in sales.” Thus far I have collected over 5,000 emails. Now I will say that I don’t make 5k a month from my email list (spammers really do profit). But between my Kindle sales and my email profits, I don’t have to work a conventional job.\n\n\nYes I am planning on scaling up my business. No I’m not going to coach you. Yes you can do this too. Those are the three most common questions I get when I breach this topic so I thought I’d just go ahead and answer ‘em now.\n\n\nI would ask that you support me though and borrow my books if you are in Kindle Unlimited and collect your free gift while also putting some coin in my pocket. I do have expenses to cover such as an autoresponder (30$ whole dollars a month) as well as junk food I eat while providing you with great value, (and for the more ambitious readers, an income.)\n\n\nVisit my Author Profile for Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B016TU9RZ8","name":"t3_3w9pto","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-10 21:04:42","week":50}

Would it be a good idea to take out $4000, or $6000 and close out the balance transferred debt too?\n\nObviously I would only accept the offer with a decent interest rate and terms.\n\n-If I should, any suggestions as to a reputable lender without many hidden fees?\n\nI definitely can't afford to pay the cards off any time soon with my current income. I have a ton of student loans in addition, rent, bills, etc. Average paying job but I barely have much $ to throw at my CC's at the moment. I have been paying 2x the minimums on my cards but still not making much progress. IF I take out a loan, these CC's are going in garbage too :)\n\n\n(TL:DR;) About $5000 in CC debt, crappy APR, should I get a personal loan with a better interest rate and pay them off?

{"id":"3wdq0p","author":"wiwa1978","body":"I believe the below issue is something a lot of entrepreneurs have. My question is basically related to the fact that (in general) IT guys have the knowledge to create cool services that could make life easier, while enterprises are in need for tools to make their life easier. To me, it occurs that both don't find each other easily.\n\nI observe three things generally:\n\n1) A lot of small/medium enterprises still working old-fashioned way, would like to pay some money to make their life easier...but don't know a lot about the potential that some tools could bring them (as it's simply not their core business) and as such can't really express what they are looking for.\n\n2) Last decade especially, a lot of IT startups/companies have introduced cool new services that might be beneficial to local small/medium/large enterprises. Very often, they have opened it up to the developers using APIs, so it becomes *in theory* extremely easy to create appealing services on top of what these startups/companies have built. Let me be more specific with some examples/use cases (all of which already exist obviously):\n\n- A decade ago, to offer a backup service to your enterprise customers, you had to buy lots of hardware to provide enough storage, you were probably sleeping bad at night because you were lying awake of not loosing your customer's data, you had to write difficult code and processes to be able to maintain all your customer's backups etc...Today, all of this complexity is hidden to us because of AWS providing their S3 service.\n- Using S3, you could create a web application for photographers to manage all photo's of weddings, ... but effectively use S3 as the storage backend...\n- You could create a web tool for them to manage their offers and invoices...\n- Docker...\n\n3) What is popular in the US, will eventually become popular elsewhere and vice versa. So I feel there is a lot of potential for cross-fertilization between entrepreneurs without having to step on each other's toes (e.g. entrepreneurs having a webshop in Europe are *in general* not really competitors (e.g in this case because maybe shipping costs would be too high...) although there are always exceptions obviously. Example: an entrepreneur who has already a tool/business that focuses on US only could work together with a European based person. Advantage is that the US person gets additional revenue (because he would otherwise never be able to focus on Europe) and the European person is making money (at the cost of providing the local support etc....)\n \nSo in short, I feel generally that recent technology and startups have made a huge toolset available for other entrepreneurs to be able to create a nice service for local enterprises. Boils down to the fact that it has become way more simple than couple of years ago because the hard/complex work (high availability, elasticity...) are taken care of and large investments are no longer needed. Still I find it extremely hard to come up with ideas that would make sense to local enterprises. Simply because I don't know the specifics of their core business (brick and mortar stores, photographers, architects, doctors, psychiatrists.... you name it).\n\nAll in all my ambition is to create a side business by developing sth that makes sense for local enterprises. I know I could buy and sell stuff on Amazon, set up webshop to sell a product,...but that doesn't carry away my interest immediately. I would like to develop a services that I can maintain, work from home, keep under control...\n\nAnyone feeling the same and has an idea on how worldwide entrepreneurs could help each other find ideas/work better together?\n\n","name":"t3_3wdq0p","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-11 15:43:13","week":50}

{"id":"3wgvp9","author":"carl0071","body":"As an Amazon FBA seller, I had not previously thought about renting a self storage unit. I buy stock, take it into my flat (apartment), list it, place the FBA labels over the barcodes and store it with Amazon until it sells. \n\n**Why would I need a self storage unit?**\n\nWell, I was quickly running out of space and I didn't realise how many items I walked past in stores because the boxes were \"too big\". \n\nSo I thought I'd give it a go. \n\nThe prices can be high depending where you go. I live in the UK and the biggest self storage company here is called \"Big Yellow Self Storage\". \nThey are what they sound like.\nYou'll be driving around the outskirts of any town and you see a massive bright yellow warehouse about 5 storeys high. They have a permanent \"50% off\" banner outside too.\n\nEven so, their prices were laughable. 25 square feet, on the top floor is something like £90 ($150) per month! Plus compulsory insurance at £3.50($5) a week, and then you have to buy one of their own padlocks for about £20($35) and even then you don't have 24 hour access.\n\nSo, I went with a smaller company on the other side of town (Not mentioning their name because I don't want to look as if I'm advertising!). For a 16 square foot unit, I was quoted £56 a month, but the first 2 months are half price, same as Big Yellow. However, this is on the ground floor and adjacent to the loading bay. \n\nThis is perfect for me because it would be difficult to have a few boxes lined up in a dimly lit corridor as I was labelling things. \n\nI had a self storage unit about three years ago when I was moving and the lights were on a PIR timer, which means I would end up fumbling in the dark as I tried to get the sensor to notice I was still there!\n\nSo I explained to the staff there what I do, and they found it very interesting. There's only about 3 or 4 staff and they even allow me to print my UPS shipping labels for free! I just email it to them and they bring it out for me! \nWell, they said they are targeted for reducing the amount of paper and stationery they buy, so I gave them a pack of 500 A4 sheets for their trouble (Cost to me is less than £3!) and they were more than happy with that!\n\n**What does this mean now?**\n\nWell, it means that previously when I saw a stack of toys which were £9.99 but reselling on Amazon for £24.99, instead of being limited to what I felt I could fit in my (very small) apartment, I can just take them down there, label them up, box them up, store them there if it's a weekend, and I don't have to worry about having my home filled with stock, even if it's on a temporary basis!\n\n24 hour access is handy too. If I end up driving back late from buying in stock, I don't have to drive it there in the morning, I can just drop it off, go home and deal with it when I have enough to send to Amazon.\n\n**What about the cost though?**\n\nYes, what I pay for the storage is at least TWICE what I pay for my flat (apartment) if you work it out on a per-square-foot basis.\nHowever, it's less than £2.50 a day so if I can make an extra £2.50 a day just by buying in an extra product or two which I wouldn't have been able to do so before, it's worth every penny! Also, it will allow me to accept palletised deliveries should I need them in the future.\n\n**Any tips?**\n\nTry and get a unit on the ground floor, even if you have to pay *slightly* more for it. Even better is a unit adjacent to the loading bay.\n\n**Ask for 24 hour access** \n\nMost companies offer this as standard but some don't. There'll be nothing more frustrating than having a car load of stock late at night and having to wait until 8am the next day to unload it, especially if you need to leave early the next morning for an auction or something.\n\n**Barter the price a little** \n\nAsk if there's a discount for paying for so many months up front. If you don't stay that long, they will have to refund your pre-payment anyway. Also, this will eliminate the chance of any late-payment fees which can cost up to £25 a time!\n\n**Buy your own insurance.** \n\nIf you buy the compulsory insurance at the self storage firm, they will charge you about 5x more than you can buy it online. Just show them the certificate of insurance and they won't charge you for their own. Let's face it, when was the last time a self-storage warehouse caught fire? Thieves don't target these places because there's CCTV everywhere and the chances are, they'd break into the one unit which was being used to store a painter &amp; decorator's half-empty paint tins and paste tables.\n\n**Ask about value-added services**. Can they provide you with an electrical outlet in your unit for a small fee? This might be great for you flippers who buy used electrical goods and you need to test them first. Can they print shipping labels for you? Do they have restroom facilities?

{"id":"3wk6e4","author":"enterprisecaptain","body":"I have been spending a good chunk of today researching credit cards.\n\nBackground: Currently have an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature card. Had this for over a decade. Not a bad card when we order so much on Amazon. Overall, we put between $50K-70K per year on it ($20K limit)\n\nBut now that we have kids and want to travel to the grandparent more often, we're thinking putting these rewards into airline miles would be better long-term. We don't do a huge amount of traveling, but it could increase in the future. Now it's mostly domestic US trips twice a year. I do foresee an international trip or two in the next couple of years.\n\nMost convenient airline for us is Alaska Airlines, but it doesn't seem like a great card, and I don't want to be tied down to a specific airline. \n\nSo I've been looking at the threads here, and have leaned towards the CapitalOne Venture card. No foreign fees, 2% points, looks decent.\n\nI'm looking for a good card long-term, that I would use for about every purchase.\n\nBut the more I look at various cards, the more I wonder how much chasing the mileage even matters. Really, it all comes down to just a few things:\n\n* points vs dollars spent\n* how points convert to buying tickets -- this is a little fuzzier for me. It seems like many of them are just a straight 1% conversion. i.e., if I have 100,000 points, that's equal to $1000 in plane tickets. Is this generally true? Is there a way to get better than this?\n** With Venture card as an example, this is essentially 2% cashback (2 miles per dollar, 1% conversion back)\n* Annual fee\n* foreign transaction fee (will have occasional relevance to me)\n\n**Q1.** So does it even matter chasing the miles? Would a straight cash-back card be equivalent?\n\n**Q2.** Also, if I sign up for this kind of card, do I have to go through their own site to get the tickets, and am I going to get the same prices and seat availability?","name":"t3_3wk6e4","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-12 21:59:41","week":50}

Ship them as \"case-packed\" or have Amazon prep them for you for like .20 an item I believe, give or take. With barcodes on the actual product you could do commingled inventory, but you lose the quality control of having the exact product you sent them at all times. With commingled your items are just added to the pile with some sort of FIFO system possibly to keep the older items moving out before the newer ones do. As far as shipping it to the customer in a box. Amazon will ship it and pack it and that is included as part of your FBA fees. For prep you don't actually pack it into a box of its own to ship. Just bag/seal/label for them to inventory once they receive it. Once you prep all your items Amazon will tell you where to send them. This part can be done all in one box or in multiple depending on the logistics Amazon lays out for you to follow. You must keep your inbound shipments &gt;50lbs and if one item weighs more than 50 pounds it must have a team lift sticker on multiple locations on the package(top/sides). FBA may sound scary and really complicated at first but once you jump in its ridiculously easy to sell stuff(assuming you have a decent selling item). The harder part is finding what to sell IMO. \n\nAlso, since you are mentioning 1000 of an item. I would mention that Amazon also allows you to deliver your inbound shipments via FTL/LTL (truckload). You can even have the FTL/LTL bring a liftgate to you to load it. That may cost you though, I don't do trucks.

There was a checklist with several people signing off on different aspects of the television being ready for resell as it was an open box item. The power wire was not included, instead a power wire that did not work with the model I got was in it's place. I don't believe the remote was present or any of the literature. When I used a power wire from my mother's tv I discovered that the screen was completely obliterated. They gave me a call tag and paid the shipping back and refunded me my entire purchase amount. There was a mixup as they sent a call tag that I had to pay for originally but they fixed the problem and sent a prepaid call tag but it took time and some back and forth e-mailing to fix the issue before I could send the TV back. \n\nI am glad that they did the right thing at the end but all in all given the checklist and how poorly packaged the tv was (this thing must have traveled across the country two or three times) and the sheer amount of headache all the e-mails and phone calls were I can say I would not like to deal with them ever again.

Picked them all up at retail for a couple bucks each, and they are going for $15-$20 at Amazon.  I did spend probably about $20 on packing materials, and then $7 for shipping, for this particular shipment, between a box partition for separating glassware, bubblewrap, and polybags.  Before time and materials expenses, I'm looking at about a $300 profit, though, assuming they all sell.

I use them to seal all plastic bags that I use, just to be safe.\n\n\nI think the \"Ready to Ship\" and the \"SOLD AS SET\" labels are usually used when you have items that are multiple pieces.

My wife just casually mentioned how her Amazon card balance was not going down when she was paying double of the minimum and not using it for new purchases.  So I checked her statements and found out that she had signed up for credit insurance.  After explaining that to her, we decided we should just cancel it.\n\nI dug up the actual policy to look for the cancellation procedure and in that process I discovered that it covered loss of income due to an unpaid leave of absence and if the it's longer than 90 days, they will pay the balance in full.  She was in maternity leave at that time and she was going to be off work for a little over 90 days.  We filed a claim and the insurance ended up paying the balance in full.\n\nI should mention that it would NOT be a good idea to try and game this system if someone is expecting to go on maternity leave. First, FMLA only goes up to 12 weeks which is a few days short of 90.  We had a situation where my wife needed to be off work 2 weeks prior to her scheduled leave.  Second, she did not have vacation days so her whole maternity leave was unpaid.

{"id":"cxqnz89","author":"DorothysRedShoes","body":"There is a ton of information on their website. I've been an affiliate for a little while. \n\nHow the program works? You post links to your website and take a commission from products someone buys after clicking your link. You get a percentage of everything they buy within 24 hours as long as they don't click someone else's affiliate link during that time. So, even if they buy products unrelated to the linked product you can still earn a commission off it. If they add to cart you can get a commission on that item for up to 90 days. \n\nHow is Amazon different? (1) They carry more products than any other affiliate. (2) They have an already established trust among millions of customers. (3) They pay pretty low percentages: 4 - 8 % depending on your sell volume, as well as, what category the product is in. \n\nIf you have any specific questions I would be happy to help. Otherwise I would dive into Amazon's affiliate website for additional information. \n\nside note: This post below isn't necessarily about amazon specifically, but I think it's a great read for anyone considering building an affiliate website: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3rgdby/7_different_styles_of_affiliate_websites_a/ ","name":"t1_cxqnz89","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-07 21:38:36","week":50}

If you think about it, they have ALL the data of ALL the sales so it's easy for them to know what's hot at the moment. They have their \"AmazonBasics\" brand that is usually cheaper than all the other sellers.\n\nThey can also sell name brand products themselves and put themselves on the top of the page for every search. Suppliers give them a crazy good price because they can afford to buy in huge volumes.\n\nThey even restrict certain products just so they can push their own. For example, they banned the sale of Chromecast this fall just so they can push their Amazon Fire TV Stick. If you search \"chromecast\", the Fire Stick will come up instead. Google is a huge company and has no problem selling the Chromecast elsewhere but if it was a smaller company that got a huge part of their sales on Amazon, something like that could've made them go under.\n\nFrom a business point of view, Amazon is doing exactly what a business should do. They are taking every possible opportunity and maximizing their profits.

{"id":"cxqu7o9","author":"BeatDaBest","body":"&gt;fuckle\n\nWell then ;)\n\nAnyway, I'll try to answer some of your questions. I have two Amazon affiliate \"journeys\" that you can check out [on my site](http://onlinemoneyz.com/projects/). My first one is just how I went about setting up my first Amazon Affiliate site, and my second one is me trying to go from $50 to $600 per month with Amazon. *(I'm steadily at around $200, but I made $93 in the first 6 days of December so I might be able to get to $600 with holiday traffic this month.)*\n\n&gt;What type of site is best?\n\nI personally prefer niche sites/authority sites. I've heard of people having success with eCommerce ones, but it has to look **very** clean and professional, and since you're going to send people to Amazon to check out anyway I'd rather do a niche/review site. \n\nWith an eCommerce Amazon Affiliate site where you list the products, and let your visitor add them to cart and then send them to Amazon when they check out won't get you any money for related sales *(but your cookie will last for 90 days for the specific items)* while a regular Amazon Affiliate link will make you money from **anything** your visitor buys after clicking on it.\n\n&gt;Successful Amazon Sites\n\nSpencer at nichepursuits has two niche site projects here: http://www.nichepursuits.com/projects/a-penny-shaved/\n\nhttp://www.nichepursuits.com/projects/best-survival-knife-guide/\n\nYou can also check out my projects using the link at the top of this answer.\n\n&gt;What works best?\n\nI'm almost 100% dependent on organic, but I also have some traffic from related YouTube videos/reviews. \n\nI've had no luck with Facebook, (I didn't try that hard though), and I haven't tried Insta or anything else.\n\n&gt;Content writing\n\nYou can write content like \"best 3 widgets of 2015, blue widget review, blue widgets for kids, etc...\" \n\nI prefer best of and review articles.\n\nWhatever you do, try to target \"buying keywords\" which are basically keywords that someone is likely to search when they're close to the end of their buying/research process. So if it contains words like \"best, review, cheapest, under $20, etc...\"\n\nYou can also put up related content on your site not related to trying to sell something on Amazon just to dilute your outbound links and increase the chance of backlinks (if it's a high quality article). So if your site was about let's say laptops/computers you could put up an article about \"Top 10 things laptop users are doing wrong\" or \"10 things you need to do if you just bought a laptop.\"\n\nMost of all. Take action!!!\n\nI wouldn't consider myself very successful in any way, but I took action and learned a lot about SEO, content writing, and website creation and now the only thing that I need to grow my income is time. (I'm a high school senior so time is scarce.)\n\nBest of luck to you!","name":"t1_cxqu7o9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-08 00:07:26","week":50}

{"id":"cxs5r0p","author":"shoppingadhd","body":"I totally get this! Some people are being a little harsh here. \n\nFirst of all, you have twin 7-month old babies. I have one and when she was a baby, it was exhausting. So cut yourself some slack.\n\nSecond, have you ever researched adult ADHD? I was recently diagnosed at age 38. I never thought I could have it because I have never been hyperactive and I always did pretty well in school. As it turns out, there are various subtypes and after actually researching I discovered that most of the symptoms described me to a T. I went to my psychiatrist who has been treating me for depression and anxiety and she asked a bunch of questions and determined that I was in fact suffering from ADHD. \n\nThe interesting thing is anxiety and depression can be caused by ADHD. Another interesting thing is that ADHD people often do something called \"hyperfocus\". We focus so much time and energy on certain things (almost always things that we enjoy) that it becomes detrimental to the other things in our lives.\n\nSo, I too enjoy the hunt, but I struggle with the listing part. I can manage the motivation and energy for the part I like, but the rest is a struggle and I have to make myself do it. I like the cha-ching sound my ebay app makes when I sell something and I enjoy seeing my account balance go up on my Amazon seller account, but it is still a struggle to make myself list stuff.\n\nYou can do this, but just make sure you set reasonable goals for yourself so you don't get discouraged. I would start with trying to get 1 or 2 items listed everyday. Then maybe increase that if you get faster and more comfortable with it. \n\nAnyway, my point is that you should be sure to take care of yourself especially when you are responsible for two little babies. Do some research on Adult ADHD and see if it sounds like you. If it does, seek out some help from a psychiatrist and don't be ashamed to get help. And, remember to put the other stuff on the back burner if you need a break.\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_cxs5r0p","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-09 00:25:01","week":50}

{"id":"cxtcbnz","author":"curien","body":"&gt;After all expenses, we are looking at about $1200 leftover.\n\nOK, that's pretty good! Also keep in mind that once you have a kid, your taxes will drop quite a bit (probably ~$100/mo).\n\n&gt;At the beginning of the year, my husband's insurance will reset and we'll be stuck paying about 500-8000/month solely in his medical expenses until the high deductible (10k) is met\n\nWhy is the deductible so high, especially since you are expecting a child? It's probably too late now to change this, though (depending on when your husband lost his job). Generally when you know you'll have high expenses for the year, you'll want to switch to a low-deductible plan if feasible.\n\n&gt;Can someone give me an idea of how much i can expect to spend in a month on formula/diapers?\n\nFormula is *expensive*. Like, $30/week. I know it's a huge PITA, but you should consider nursing/pumping as much as possible. You might qualify for WIC. Disposable diapers are also quite expensive, and I recommend going with cloth (not the pricey all-in-ones, just cheap pre-folds with covers and snappis), especially if your husband can care for the baby while you're at work (most day-cares will require disposables, unfortunately). And if he's going to be home and physically able (I don't know the nature of his injuries, if they affect cognition, etc), I don't see why he shouldn't provide care. Early on, you can easily go through 8 diapers per day (both my kids did for the first few months), and based on that it looks like you can get a month's supply of disposables on Amazon for ~$50. (They get a bit more expensive as the kid gets bigger, though.)\n\n&gt;Should I attempt to get a second part time job and work up until delivery?\n\nIt depends on how much extra you could earn.

{"id":"cxtchva","author":"Ol0O01100lO1O1O1","body":"&gt;  The fact is that \"I want it now\" qualifies as \"any reason to use it\".\n\nNobody ever said otherwise. The claim was that if you *don't* care if you get it now you might as well opt for the cheaper way. \n\nWould you disagree that helping to keep the cost of a service down (in ways that have no impact on you) could well help keep the cost of said service from rising if enough people do it? \n\n&gt; If you don't need it faster, and you're okay with waiting, don't pay for Prime. \n\nWell sure, if you never use it. Are you suggesting it's not possible to use Prime enough to get your money's worth out of it but **NOT** still have occasions where it's unnecessary? I probably place 8 orders per month to Amazon on average... and while I definitely want seven of them there as quickly as possible there's usually one I really couldn't care less when it shows up. It's a birthday present, or it's for something I won't use until summer (like the tent stake kit I just bought) or it's for something I'm reordering extra for but won't run out of for two months. \n\nShould I not buy Prime just because I don't *always* need things in two days? When I don't need something immediately, am I gaining any advantage whatsoever for myself by getting something 62 days before I need it rather than than 60? I don't understand what the objection is. \n\nIf you want something in two days for any reason use free two day shipping. If you don't care when it shows up and you still want to use two day shipping, fine, whatever, it's your prerogative. But if you don't care when it shows up and it makes no difference to you why not help keep the costs of the service down? What harm befalls you in that situation? If nothing bad can come of it and something good can potentially come of it it seems like a good practice to me.

{"id":"cxtdiyj","author":"OK_Soda","body":"Yes, in the specific situation where you *need* something in two days roughly 12 or more times a year but also make more purchases that you don't need anytime soon, but for some reason can't just hold off on them until you can lump them in with your two-day shipping order, yes, it makes sense to just use no-rush for those things.\n\nBut I think we're arguing about two separate things. In theory, Amazon is offering this product, Prime, at a price they deem appropriate. In theory, you can use two-day all day long, because Amazon has priced it such that they feel it is a fair price for the service they are providing. Use no-rush if you want, whatever, who cares. But the idea that we need to *help Amazon out* by paying for the service but not making full use of it, is ridiculous. Amazon does not need your help. They have armies of people making sure their products are efficiently priced.\n\nImagine if someone made the similar argument that you shouldn't seed torrents (let's assume they're perfectly legal files) because you really don't *need* to and it would help Comcast keep costs low by not using as much bandwidth. Or that you shouldn't go to the dentist every six months, every 9 months is probably fine and it will help the insurance company out even though you're paying premiums anyway. If you don't have any reason to go to the gym, maybe don't go as often so the equipment doesn't get worn out as fast. It's ridiculous. Sure, don't do any of those things if you don't want to--again, whatever, who cares.

This is impossibly difficult to prove, especially given your age and lack of dependents. A judge will look at you and laugh. This is usually reserved for people with cancer and dying children. \n\nB) You cannot discharge a debt and still keep that thing. So if you want out of the car loan you will have to give up the car. It might be possible to restructure the loan under bankruptcy but it will not save you much and you will still be required to at least pay the value of the car (assuming you qualify, you probably don't). My advice, sell the car you could never afford in the first place, and get a clunker. This will help with your car insurance problem as well. \n\nC) Ditch your fucking phone. 120 month? sounds like you need to upgrade to a flip phone. Talk to your phone company and see what can be worked out. Haggle with them and try to get out of your contract.

My gut instinct says to take this to kickstarter and use your initial list to spread the word about the kickstarter campaign, or get pre-payments from your list of 50 if the price point is high. Also, consider buying an e-course or book from someone who has proven experience launching Kickstarter campaigns. There's a lot about this topic online. Once you get hundreds of Kickstarter pre-orders, then you'll worry about implementation.  By the way, I have no interest here, but you might want to email Stephen Key the licensing guy about this since it seems up his alley (he has a premium course/ consulting service).  I listened to a YouTube podcast where he once discussed the benefits and drawbacks of licensing with a manufacturer. But overall, once you have lots of prepaid people eagerly waiting for your product, manufacturers are going to be eager to work with you/ cut a deal.  For most products these days, it's the marketing that's hard. By the way, one Amazon product sourcing guru who seems trustworthy is Steve Choo from mywifequitherjob.com You can post a question on his blog comment section and tell him your situation and he will get back to you. Just know that he has a premium course, but it's something that I've considered myself since I've been following his blog for years. Overall, I'd email both of those guys and see what they have to say, try to find a consultant who's been in your shoes before, and read up on kickstarter before taking a next step.","name":"t1_cxu8q5w","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-10 17:53:32","week":50}

{"id":"cxu8zwn","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"A lot of niche funds and \"specialized\"/alternative funds really have not done very well, although there have been a few highlights. Whitebox, a hedge fund with a fine record and some very intelligent people, has been completely early and wrong betting against all of the things that it thought were overpriced, like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon. As such, Whitebox Tactical is down huge YTD. Otter Creek (OTCRX) is a newer mutual fund from a hedge fund that has done very well but doesn't have much of a record. The Boston Partners long/short funds are quality, but I think two out of the three are closed. Cambiar Unconstrained (CAMAX) is a super aggressive little fund that has done fine over time, but as I mentioned, can be very hot or very cold.\n\n You have also seen some star managers who have not performed very well in recent years (Berkowitz of Fairholme, Bill Miller basically imploded in 2008 and has only more recently improved but I have no belief that he learned anything from that fund getting wrecked in 2008; Heebner of CGM Focus was basically the hottest fund on the planet until his timing became off after 2008 and basically has yet to return to form, etc.) As for Heebner, Cramer went on Regis and Kelly years ago and said it was his number 1 favorite mutual fund and I knew that was probably it for that fund and sure enough... The Kinetics funds previously did very well, but really have been mediocre since their terrible 2008 performance.\n\nDavid Winters of Wintergreen (and formerly of the Mutual Series funds) was kind of interesting until basically all of his bets (on themes, like the EM consumer for example) went wrong in the last few years and then to top it off, he stupidly tried to go activist on Coke, which anyone could have told him he had absolutely no chance of having any influence on. To me, it was a waste of time and effort that was likely in part an attempt by Winters to get press. Not only was he not successful, he apparently was annoying enough about it that Buffett verbally spanked him on CNBC (and looked genuinely pissed when he said it) in a manner that couldn't have been real good for attracting assets under management at Wintergreen --- **see the bottom of this post for Buffett quote.**\n\n Yacktman isn't bad but that fund's investing has been out of favor in recent years. Marty Whitman is no longer at Third Avenue and those funds have not done very well. Pimco's somewhat promising venture into equity funds where they pulled \"name\" managers from other companies has largely been terrible. Sequoia (SEQUX) had a tremendous problem with their holding in Valeant, which caused directors to leave.\n\nIvy Asset Strategy (WASCX) used to be a wonderful flexible fund, but I believe there was a manager change there and it's done fairly poorly since. Marketfield (MFLDX) is another flexible fund that suffered from taking in way too much money when it should have closed the fund and their macro bets went wrong.\n\nSome newer managers have either already gone to hedge funds (David Rao, formerly of Marsico Flexible) or went and then came back only to do awful - David Iben of Kopernik All Cap. \n\nSteven Romick of FPA Crescent (FPACX) is fine. The Leuthold Funds (LCORX) have done reasonably well. Ron Baron of Baron Partners (BPTRX) is fine - and hey, you can go to their fancy shmancy shareholder meetings in NYC where you can see entertainers and hear from CEOs - but that fund is highly aggressive and is going to get obliterated in a downturn. Akre Focus (AKREX) is good, but Chuck Akre is going to retire at some point.  The Provident fund I mentioned above is fine and conservative when it thinks it needs to be, but it is a concentrated fund and may be hot/cold. Danoff of Fidelity Contrafund is still consistently doing well. Parnassus Core Equity remains a good, consistent choice. There are others, but again, the list is smaller than it used to be.\n\nRIT Capital Partners (aka the Rothschild Fund) in London is a great traded fund there.\n\n\n//////////\n\n* - apologies for all caps, this is copied from the CNBC transcript. Buffett on David Winters: \"WHEN DAVID WINTERS WHO RUNS A FUND THAT HAS UNDERPERFORMED BY EVERY MEASURE FROM INCEPTION, FIVE YEARS, ONE YEAR AND WHO DRAWS A 150 BASIS POINT FEE WHEN YOU CAN GO TO VANGUARD AND DO IT FOR 17 BASIS POINTS AND HE COMPLAINS ABOUT COMPENSATION NOT BEING COMMENSURATE WITH PERFORMANCE AT COKE. AND THEN HE HAS THAT KIND OF RECORD HIMSELF, I THINK HE'S A FELLOW LIVING IN AN ALL-GLASS HOUSE.\" (http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/02/cnbc-excerpts-billionaire-investor-warren-buffett-on-cnbcs-squawk-box-today.html)","name":"t1_cxu8zwn","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-10 17:59:51","week":50}

{"id":"cxufbll","author":"derp_hankford","body":"This is going to go contrary to a lot of the conventional internet gentleman wisdom out there, but a badger brush and expensive shave creams are a waste of money. I bought a $17 jar of fancy pants English shave cream off Amazon that didn't seem to do any better for me than a 99 cent generic store foam for sensitive skin. Granted, it was a lot thicker on my face, but after about a dozen shaves with it I just wasn't convinced that really mattered much, at least not to the tune of $17 for a jar that lasted me less time than a store can.\n\nThat said, the safety razor thing is **great** advice. You can buy 100 name-brand, high quality replacement double-edged blades for about $8. They last about two weeks each, depending on your the thickness of your fur and how long you want to push it, which translates to about $2/year spent on blades. Granted a safety razor itself costs a little more upfront, but not by much. I got the Merkur Classic off Amazon for about $25. I've had it six months and it's already paid for itself. It's solid steel and will almost certainly last the rest of my life.\n\nMy current gear/regimen is this:\n\nRazor: Merkur Classic\nBlades: Feather Hi-Stainless\nCream: Meijer Shave Cream Sensitive Skin\nOther: Dove Post-Shave Balm\n\nA lot of people like to say that the cheap shave creams dry out your skin because of the alcohol.

{"id":"cxuj2x8","author":"ThrowCoachMatt","body":"This is a sentiment that has been shared quite a few times on the board, so I want to share some tough love thoughts.\n\nIf it's easy, then everybody can do it. Amazon, eBay, etc. aren't new technologies anymore. Everybody understands how to use it. Just like everybody can drive a cab (Uber) or everybody can be a hotel (Air BnB), eBay provides the platform for everybody to sell. People have seen the success that others were having, so they gave it a shot (myself included). It was easy. \n\nIf it's easy, profitable, and anybody can do it, you can be damn sure the market is going to saturate. \n\nIf you aren't comfortable with it, (A) get better at it, or (B) start educating yourself in a different field that you can make a living in. If you do this professionally, there has to be a knowledge-base that separates you from casual sellers like myself. If you separate yourself by being 1 person who sells a thousand things, that separation disappears when a thousand different people (like me) start selling 1 thing. And a thousand different people can understand clothes, or video games, or baseball cards, or books. I didn't really have to educate myself to flip those things. So if it takes no knowledge base, and it is profitable, then of course there's competition. If you want less competition, you gotta find an area that people aren't privy to. How many people understand computer components, or metals, or rare doll collections, or &lt;Insert Uncommonly Sold Thing Here&gt;? \n\nSo here's the tough love: if I hardly needed to educate myself in order to compete with you, then how much skill did you have in the first place? The problem isn't the \"industry,\" it's you. You aren't skilled enough. I suppose hustle alone used to get it done. Now it takes hustle and knowledge base.\n\nOn the bright side, the thrift price bubble may have burst. I gave up thrifting near me a couple years ago. I popped in last week as I was driving past, and their prices had dropped significantly. The raised prices must have driven off a portion of their customer base.","name":"t1_cxuj2x8","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-10 21:55:07","week":50}

{"id":"cxujws7","author":"enkrypt0r","body":"Repost of the OP without the goofy formatting:\n\n&gt;First off, I would like to preface this with yes, I am going to promote myself. I want to get that out of the way right off the bat. I have a great story to tell along the way, but alas, I really just want you to buy my books. Actually I want you to borrow them.\n\n&gt;My journey takes place a lot longer than three months ago. I have always been a fan of Internet Marketing. I treated it as an interest that I would one day pursue or a hobby I liked to dabble and daydream about. Along the way I have tried a great many things in my vain attempt to make money online. (For you marketers, I used the keyword “make money online” when I really didn’t have to just to increase my keyword count.) I don’t want this to come off sounding like a sales pitch because honestly I rather like my story. Suffice it to say though, that I did try a lot of things in the Internet Marketing realm and some of them I’m not so proud of. (As a devout Christian, I even tried uploading porn for paid sign-ups until my morality grabbed hold of my common sense and beat the tar out of it.)\n\n&gt;I stumbled across Kindle Publishing Direct, or KDP earlier this year and instantly fell in love with it. I am an avid reader and call myself something of a writer. (I suck.) There was something about Kindle Publishing that really called my name. I guess it was the idea of publishing some of my works as well as running a business all in one that really sold it for me. \n\n&gt;This is where my Journey for this Reddit post begins. I published my first book in July and had mediocre success in the publishing world, but as an author it was a complete bomb. I didn’t have a clue on what I was doing even with my Internet Marketing background. I doubled down my efforts and went to work researching everything I could on Kindle Publishing Direct. Like any sane person does after searching for minutes with no luck, I went to YouTube. I told myself I was going to look up videos on KDP but really I wanted to check out funny cat videos. I availed myself to search out KDP after a few small hours of hardly laughs, (damn cats get me every time!) and came across a guy who was somewhat of an expert in KDP. I rabidly watched every video in record time. \n\n&gt;This actually took me quite a while to do in reality as he had over 50 videos on KDP and most of them were 20+ minutes long but that doesn’t make for good writing. Over the course of a month I started applying some of the strategies I learned from YouTube on my lone book. I learned how to target a keyword instead of a category to increase my sales rank. I learned something else that really increased my sales. Kindle Direct Publishing had just recently changed their payout structure which really hurt a lot of people. They packed up their businesses and went looking for greener pastures. I found this to be a great opportunity. \n\n&gt;KDP used to pay people two ways. It would pay you for whatever direct sales you made at whatever price point you set for your book, as well as anyone who borrowed your book through its Prime membership. People made a killing by having their eBooks borrowed by Prime users and it was a win for everyone but Amazon. Big Daddy Amazon of course made changes and wrecked everyone’s free lunch. They changed their borrowed structure by starting a new program called Kindle Unlimited. Members pay 9.99$ a month and basically get to Netflix books. It changed from paying per borrow (which was around 1.35$ per book the lucky bastards) to paying per page read (which is around .0048$ now….mean face!) \n\n&gt;This is where my empire truly formed. If you have an eBook that is 300 pages you’ll get about 1.44$ granted the person who borrowed it reads the entire thing. But here’s the catch, most people don’t read past the first chapters of even very popular books (I still haven’t finished the Hunger Games!) You need to get the reader to the end of the book to get all your pages read. I applied one of the strategies I learned from YouTube and offered the reader another eBook right off the bat. I made a pretty and shiny red button that was clickable and said “FREE!” and placed it right below the headline “Get My eBook ‘insert eBook title here’ Now!” The Button would take them to the back of the book where they could click on a link which would take them to a landing page where I collected there email address so I could send them a copy of the eBook as promised. \n\n&gt;I don’t know if you saw what I did but it was a huge gold mine which makes me a lot of money. When someone clicks on the link it takes them to the back of the book. It actually counts all the pages as read! I have to take a minute here and place my own interjections in here. I emailed Amazon to see if I was actually allowed to do that and it was encouraged! As per Amazons TOS they want you to have a clickable (Hyperlinked) Table of Contents. I asked them one more question, do they allow Boxsets or Collections of books in one book. When I got the “affirmative” from Amazon that, Yes, I could box up my works of writing into one eBook that’s exactly what I did. \n\n&gt;I started writing my other four books. I don’t know if you know this, but if you have 5 eBooks there are 20 different ways you can package them, (One book can have 4 others in it, totaling 5 complete books in all.) Some of the overall page lengths for these books are 1,500 pages long. That combined with my Free gift at the front means a 7.20$ profit for me. I make around 1.44$ to 7.20 every time someone borrows my book and collects their free book. The books retail for 2.99$ so as you can see I’d rather you borrow my books than buy them. \n\n&gt;There is one subtle thing that was missed in all of this which makes up over half of my income and that’s the email addresses I have collected. There is an Industry standard in Internet Marketing that states “each email address should account for 1$ a month in sales.” Thus far I have collected over 5,000 emails. Now I will say that I don’t make 5k a month from my email list (spammers really do profit). But between my Kindle sales and my email profits, I don’t have to work a conventional job. \n\n&gt;Yes I am planning on scaling up my business. No I’m not going to coach you. Yes you can do this too. Those are the three most common questions I get when I breach this topic so I thought I’d just go ahead and answer ‘em now. \n\n&gt;I would ask that you support me though and borrow my books if you are in Kindle Unlimited and collect your free gift while also putting some coin in my pocket. I do have expenses to cover such as an autoresponder (30$ whole dollars a month) as well as junk food I eat while providing you with great value, (and for the more ambitious readers, an income.)  \n\n&gt;Visit my Author Profile for Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B016TU9RZ8\n","name":"t1_cxujws7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-10 22:14:26","week":50}

In the USA at least as long as we remain a consumerist society, I think there will always be an abundance of unwanted items. The items that you see in the thrift store are items that would otherwise be in the trash in most cases. \nAs the old saying goes one man's trash is another man's treasure. \nI live in a huge city..but more on the outskirts of the city..I think this is a good location for thrifts as rent is probably lower than in the more prime areas of town. \nI don't know what city you are in...but maybe try and look a little further out? \nAlso maybe expand into other types of products. I know a lot of people mention video games..but in my area I don't see many deals on these. \nAlso good to expand beyond thrift stores as well.

Another option would be to get books for birthdays - Amazon's used bookstores have children's books in great condition for $2-5 each.

{"id":"cxv1ieu","author":"BigSlowTarget","body":"Hi. I just checked in with an author friend of mine about the pay per page vs. pay for jumping to the end of the book. She in turn checked on the situation with her author group. It has long been a rumor that jumping forward gets you paid for all the intervening pages. As of June 15, 2015 it is supposed to be pay for each individual page and the time spent on each individual page is monitored. \n\nSo, to questions:\n\n- Could you be mistaken about the amount you are collecting? Amazon's pay systems are built to be baffling. It probably helps them somehow.\n\n- Do you realize you have granted an exclusive right to Amazon to sell that material? Releasing it though other channels (including free) is a violation of the KU terms and can get you banned from Amazon. Is this not a concern for you?\n\n- If you are indeed making the amounts you believe, do you think Amazon considers this an exploit/error and so is likely to fix it soon? If they fix it and your books are locked into the program for the remaining 6 months what are your plans to replace your revenue stream?\n\n","name":"t1_cxv1ieu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-11 06:15:19","week":50}

The sales rank of the books really doesnt mean a whole lot since they fluctuate so much each day. Your friends where right in there suspicion that amazon does pay out for pages read when jumped to the back of the book. You are required as per the TOS to have a hyperlinked or clickable table of contents. I asked them if I was allowed to offer a free book in a hyperlink in the table of contents that linked to the back of the book offering them a free gift. Amazon said that it was NOT a violation of the TOS to do so. In my honest opinion I'm not sure they care really do anything about it. or more aptly, are willing to do anything about it. There are such a small amount of people who are using this strategy. Amazon has a pool of money that all the authors are paid out of called the KDP fund. So amazon doesnt pay anymore or less if i get 100 pages read or 1,000,000. It doesnt make you millions of dollars. more like the low six figures. There are amazon affiliates that make that in a month. I am not selling my material anywhere but amazon KDP. You are free to promote your content on any site you wish as long as they purchase through amazon KDP. If they were to fix this, it would cause a lot of problems. for one, they wouldn't be able to have a clickable table of contents like they want you to have.

{"id":"cxv4fyt","author":"BigSlowTarget","body":"&gt;I'm not mistaken. I have been paid out for pages read.\n\nI would certainly expect this and didn't think anything else. The interesting question to me is how Amazon tracks if a page is read and so if you are being paid for pages not really read, just skipped over. Amazon tracks a tremendous amount of detail about how each page is read and hyperlinking to the TOC in the end causing the system to register all intervening pages as read would be surprising and have significant implications.\n\n&gt;Your friends where right in there suspicion that amazon does pay out for pages read when jumped to the back of the book.\n\nJust to clarify, my friends actually claimed exactly the opposite, that is that Amazon does not pay unless time is spent on each page. They claim that is Amazon's written policy which means if people are skipping ahead to get your free book and not going back to read each page you wrote Amazon is violating their own policies. Obviously this would not be your violation, it would be an error in their page count algorithm. It is a very interesting error as it has in the past been a rumor, is stated by Amazon not to be the case and is not talked about widely in author discussions of KDP.

Obviously the people using your resource aren't going to come close to being in the top 300 sites in the world.

I just checked out Wowhead for the first time in 5 years and I think you're missing a massive affiliate program opportunity with Amazon. I would add a section reviewing PC Gaming accessories and attach an Amazon affiliate link. You get affiliate money over the cookie duration of 3 months for ANY item they buy on Amazon, not just the item you're promoting. With the amount of visitors you get and your reputation, you will easily turn 7 figures a month.

{"id":"cxvnn38","author":"Wild_Space","body":"Well by my count, 40 of the companies in the SP500 are oil companies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies\n\nBut the price of oil affects other companies as well. For example, the railroad industry. The railroad industry had a good run for a while because rail is more fuel efficient than trucking, but now that oil prices are down, they're losing volume. Also, with high oil prices, it improved the cost-effectiveness of transporting oil. And coal, because it's a substitute.\n\nAmerican Express, a credit card company, has also been hurt by the falling oil prices. How? Well air travel makes up a significant percent of their volume, and lower fuel costs mean lower traveling expenses, which equate to lower revenues for American Express.\n\nLower fuel costs can also hurt car companies, oddly enough. They're being forced by the government to produce more energy efficient cars, but if fuel costs are down, then consumers are less inclined to buy those cars. So the car companies will have trouble seeing a return on their investment. (TSLA springs to mind.)\n\nThen you have non-oil energy companies. Building a solar panel on your house or business becomes less economical with falling gas prices. \n\nThose are just a few examples off the top of my head. Im sure someone else could provide a plethora of companies that are actually helped by lower fuel costs. The airlines for example. Trucking. UPS. FedEx. Amazon (I'm guessing a large portion of their expenses are fuel costs, but I could easily be wrong.)\n\nPersonally, I think it all comes out in the wash, and I wouldnt be too worried. Frankly, I feel that cheaper fuel, will mean more discretionary income for consumers to allocate more efficiently across the economy.

In reality it very rarely happens and if the card isn't actually being used fraudulently and you just happened to make a weird, but legit purchase online from overseas then they will freeze the card and call/text/email you about it. You can then either confirm the purchase as legit, or not. If you confirm then the card is good to go \nwithin a minute or two. Whole thing takes youb2 minutes. Happened once to me in about 10 years.\n4. Questions about credit scores can be complicated. Having recurring charges on there is fine. Not any better or worse than other charges. Just pay it off before due, never being late, never incurring interest and over time your credit score will continue to rise. Don't worry much about using ng it for autopay, as any companies charging it and then getting a.decline will try again in a few days, and afyer that they will ask you for a different payment method. Truthfully, not going to be an issue 99.9% of the time unless you are making purchases on scam.com etc.\n5. This is personal. I like cash back cards. Believe BOA offers a $2500 limit to students on their cash back. It is a decent deal. 1% on every purchase. 2% or 3% on groceries and gas. Not sure which is which. Also, when you redeem the cash back as money directly into your checking account they give you an additional bonus of 10% on whatever your bonus would have been. If you prefer travel go with that. I have heard decent things about the Amazon card too, but can't speak to it personally\nBottom line, get a credit card, don't toss debit card just in case, plus also you need it for atm.

I'm seriously considering growing Ghost peppers on our ~1 acre of land this coming year. I ballparked revenues at about $100k+. As an eBay/FBA seller, it blows my mind. So, I can till some land, plant some seeds, and then sell the crops for like $100k? I'd easily take that over dealing with returns from eBay and Amazon. I mean, equivalently, I'd be looking at maybe 4+ *actual* days of ensuring the crops are growing right vs. countless days of dealing with customers, returns, and other issues.\n\nRegardless, I see farming as some new taboo.

Pro memberships reduce Amazon fees by $.99 per transaction, meaning anyone with a pro account is actually making $.99 per box of wipes (4x what you would have paid)\n\n2.) The seller(s) offering the item for such a low price could do large enough sales volume with Amazon to have a completely different fee structure than is available to you or I. Oftentimes, the seller on those very cheap items is Amazon itself, who obviously doesn't have to pay fees at all.\n\n3.) The seller could be trying to liquidate inventory. They could be in a situation where they are about to have to pay a fee to get their inventory items removed or destroyed, so selling them for $0 profit is actually profitable compared to taking a loss on each item. \n\nJust keep a lookout. The profitable items are definitely out there. My girlfriend and I support ourselves doing pretty much exclusively RA.

{"id":"cxwsq2i","author":"redcards","body":"Thanks man! \n\nI agree with most of your sentiments, and I think some context around the portfolio over the year would make everything flow a little better. \n\nFirst, I spent a lot of time talking about the FANG stocks because in our Fund we spent a lot of time talking about FANG/momentum. Or at least, some of our analysts were enthusiastic about getting into some of those names and it was my job to bring every one back down to earth. So personally I agree that the narrative is probably getting a little stale, but it was relevant to what we did over the year so it worked out. For example, the Fund has held AMZN for almost two years up until last February when I got us to sell it. Since then it has appreciated over 100% and had we held it we probably would have outperformed or at least met the market. So I wanted to spend a lot of time discussing why those particular businesses don't meet our strategy and why we don't invest in them.\n\nFor similar reasons I didn't speak about the HY market. We don't do anything with bonds and we tried to keep the discussion about interest rates at a minimum by focusing on businesses that weren't tightly levered to changes in the bond market. There was honestly so much more I could have included into the letter but I was limited by space, and our professor was sort of hamstringing me with what I could say. I had to fight to include the company commentaries in the letter because its never been done before. \n\nI know with the Buffett quotes and section on BRK it makes me seem fanboyish, but I only included BRK because I could 1) quantify portions of the book value and op. income with regard to recent M&amp;A, and 2) I could flip in some language about a \"value chain\" discussion we had early on in the class\". It would have been nice to talk about some of our other holdings in detail, but the fact is that our analysts don't do a very good job at quantifying their analysis and frankly the hurdle for a good grade in the class is fairly low. For those reasons I chose to do BRK because I know it well, MN because I did the work, and AMZN because I also did the work.

Unless you have a job working as management of a Fortune 100 company and you make like 100k; shoot 50k to make it easy, then it's fairly trivial to make more money flipping full time. Flipping makes money, it's the process which has made many people and businesses extremely wealthy.\n\nThe thing I think you got to ask yourself though, do you truly enjoy flipping or are you in it for the money? I started flipping about 11 years ago, went from a single pallet (4x4x4 feet or so) of used junk... microwaves, car amps, etc... to a full time 1,000 sqft warehouse packed to the I think it was 20 foot high ceilings. Early 20's I bought a turbo Porsche, a house, the lot... but I frigging hated the work. I dreaded getting up and going to the warehouse. I hate dealing with customers, it wasn't the job for me, so I closed it up and got a day job in media which I wouldn't trade for the world. Yeah, the pay is less, but I enjoy it. These days I still flip on eBay but it's not much, the money just goes in a separate checking account linked to Amazon that I use for buying things.\n\nThe point being, you might at least debate flipping full time. It depends on things like bills and what not, because the first months will probably suck. In the end you could make a hell of a good living flipping. However, if you don't truly enjoy it, chances are you'll call it quits at some point.","name":"t1_cxwt5et","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-12 22:31:55","week":50}

{"id":"cxww0g2","author":"steefen7","body":"This backlash against living the \"traditional\" life at this point has become so cliche that I honestly can't help but roll my eyes when I hear another person start rambling on about their \"experiences\". Being responsible doesn't preclude the possibility of having incredible experiences, but it's a necessary assumption for these people to make otherwise their world-view crumbles. As long as responsibility and experience are diametrically opposed, this person can argue they've lived just as great a life as you, maybe even better. When it turns out that anyone can have the kind of experiences this author has had and still not break the bank, she's no longer an enlightened rebel; she's an overgrown child. \n\nThe author here isn't talking about 2 year trips into the Amazon or something that would require you to have a job. She's talking about weekend trips to San Diego, San Francisco, Las Vegas, etc. Drunkenly talking politics or philosophy doesn't require me to take on debt. And I swear if you've seen one open-air bazaar with people shouting at each other, you've seen them all. To be honest, her experiences sound pretty tame for what they cost her. Ironically, I've done all but one of the trips she's mentioned and I have about $100 in \"debt\" right now from the dinners I charged on my card this week. \n\nYou can always argue one way or the other that someone should be saving more or spending more for whatever purpose. Personally, I enjoy the balance I've struck between building towards the future and thoroughly enjoying the here and now. I think that's up to every individual to figure out. I won't lecture someone if they don't want to traipse through the snow to go to yet another club nor will I lecture someone who wants to do that.

{"id":"cxx2yts","author":"Downstrike","body":"don't buy coffee at a shop or even Burger King, make it. Get a $25 dollar thermos at Wal Mart and make your coffee for the work day the night before. The mark up on coffee is terrible. \n\nMark up on fries and cheese at fast food places is also kind of bad. If you cant avoid the drive thru, at least avoid these. \n\nGet tea at Asian markets. I have an $11 electric kettle. I get boxes of 100 for under 3 bucks. At the chain grocery stores, I usually have to play 6 bucks for a 20 pack. The dollar tree is carrying green tea [100 count] for a dollar. Sweeten to taste and keep in a thermos. Drink this instead of soda.\n\nGo to fish markets and similar places for your protein \n\nBottled water is for chumps. If you don't want to get a water filter, buy the gallon water jugs for the same price or less. Also remember that the EPA has been watching the tap for years and so it is safe even if you are not a fan of the taste.\n\nGo to the library and it's website. Mine has books and audio books you can download. Also look at LibriVox.org\n\nGet hobbies that pay off or have an initial investment but very little upkeep. You can get a Ready to Fish fishing pole and tackle for under $50 plus whatever the cost of a license is in your state. Spend the day listening to audio books on your phone while breathing the fresh air and you might come away with something to eat. \n\nIf you are a smoker, roll your own. A can of tobacco and papers is going to be less then three packs in a lot of states. I met a guy who bought Prince Albert pipe tobacco and used it to roll cigarettes; never got complaints about the smell of the smoke and the cigarette lasted him a much longer time. \n\nCut coupons. Email companies and ask for coupons. Check with hotels and the like for their newspapers that may have coupons. \n\nFind a couple of spices and learn to cook with just them. Start with the spices that can be found at the dollar store. \n\nLearn to cook with beans. Make beans and rice, chili, bean paste sandwiches and so on. You will feel fuller, get healthier, and save a ton of cash on food.  \n\nIf you are not ready to go to meetings, look at box wine to tie one on. Use Ever Clear when you want a fruit drink where you will not really taste the booze. \n\nGet the big tubs of yogurt if you are worried about your intestines. Also, plain Greek is a good substitute for sour cream so compare prices. If you can stand it, Kim Chi is also good for butt bacteria and cheaper if you have the same Asian Market with the cheap teas.\n\nShop at thrift stores in expensive neighborhoods. I've got Patagonia, North Face and REI pants plus a multitude of name brand dress shirts from a Salvation Army store in Redondo Beach. \n\nThrift stores are especially great for things you dont use often like rain and ski jackets. \n\nHave a grocery store that is too far to walk but a little close to drive to? Get a bike and a backpack at a thrift store. Normally the tires are the problem but often they are in perfect condition, just unused and donated. You can often get bike helmets for cheap too. \n\nWhy buy expensive corn chips??? Unless you are trying to impress your friends with the blue ones, get the cheapest.\n\nGarden simple things if you can. Check with neighbors who may have fruit trees if you can steal a few on occasion in exchange for watering them while they are on vacation or something else like that.\n\nNetflicks, hulu, Amazon, crackle, etc have made cable mostly unnecessary. \n\nPre paid phones allow you to pick your data package from month to month so you can fine tune what you really use. \n\nNow here is my big advice for saving cash, buy coins at the bank. Get a gorilla box or even just a five gallon bucket from Lowes and when you have $50 from a paycheck, get it cashed in dollar coins. Take the coins and put them in the bucket. I have a hard time psychologically spending them but you will not have lost any value in cash.  \n\nSo that is some stuff that works for me. I also play Dungeons and Dragons instead of online video games, go shooting with a Mosin Nagant instead of an AR-15, and watch alot of you tube how to/ DIY/ Life Hack/ reuse items videos. The key is to do things that are right for you and when you see that it pays off, expand into other things.

A 2% credit card (such as Fidelity's amex or the Citi double cash) is essentially getting everything 2% off.  That's like getting an approximate 2% untaxed raise in income (although not quite since some of the largest expenses, such as rent, typically cannot be paid using a credit card).  Some credit cards give like 5% or even 10% off on Amazon purchases, for instance.\n* Online purchases.  You basically need a credit or debit card to buy things at most online stores, and a credit card has much stronger fraud protection over a debit card.\n* Credit history.  Just having a credit card (even if you use it only sparingly) builds a strong credit history and a good credit score.  That's because the \"credit score\" (e.g. FICO score) is basically a game you can play, and getting a credit card is the easiest way to win this game.\n* Transaction history.  As opposed to using cash, credit cards have online statements, so you can generally see where your money is going.\n* You can abuse sign-up bonuses or other credit card perks.

I split tested by taking something such as a SNES Audio Video cable and putting the item on 3 backgrounds:\n1) White, edited, looked professional.\n2) Item nicely displayed on a kitchen table, no background clutter.\n3) Item digitally edited to include a partially transparent SNES console in the background, highlighting a clear image of the AV cables.\n\nI listed all 3, at the same price BIN's.

{"id":"cxxmdqy","author":"AllenFBA","body":"Yes, they are worth something; when you sell your account it will go either one of two ways.\n\nYou will sell it to someone in China or India who will pay you through PayPal for it. A high limit account with TRS status and over 1000 positive feedback is worth anywhere from $1000 to $5000, with many variables.\n\nThe person will use the account and sell in bulk, an abnormal amount of high volume transactions. We're talking about blinking LED lights made to be mounted to bicycles, and they will sell 80 of these things a day. 2 weeks later, their negative feedback comes rolling in. Next, the account is suspended through a MC999, and the account is gone forever. It's no loss to them, as they will reverse the payment through filing a dispute for an intangible item, and they will get their money back. You are left with a negative balance, and no eBay account.\n\nThe second method, the most rare, is someone has a legitimate reason to want to acquisition your account. You can NEVER fully buy someone elses account even with the help/assistance of eBay with the account attached to a business instead of an individual because the PoC of the account will always be considered the owner. What reason would someone have? Someone starts a company making organic coconut flavored baby bibs with built in teething soothers or something and their sales take off on Etsy, and they are making sales on Amazon. This new company had to place an order of 10,000 units and they need their inventory to have a higher turnover so they look at eBay as an open market that will exceed their current numbers on Amazon and Etsy; they open an account but quickly hit their limit and they need those sales.
