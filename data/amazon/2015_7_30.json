{"id":"3dvmrn","author":"Fishering","body":"Yesterday I had another Amazon giveaway. There were over 240 responses, and this giveaway has very shocking results. The concept for this giveaway was to pick the value of the prize that you think will have the least total value in $ of guesses. However, there was a greed factor involved because everyone who picked the winning selection would win that prize. You could either guess $0.50, $1, $2, $3, or $5.\n\n# THE RESULTS\n\nMy best guess, looking at the results was that everyone (for the most part) who entered was thinking that they could get away with selecting higher values, because they were asseuming that other people would take the lower values. In order for $3 to be the winning pick, a lot of people would have to pick $5, but 1/3 more people would have to pick $2, and 2/3 more people would have to pick $1, and 6x the amount of people would have to pick $0.50 (correct my math if you feel like it :)). \n\nSo let's get to the numbers. \n\n**$5 - Total selections: 57. Total Value $285.**\n\nFor my sake, let's hope that this does **NOT** win.\n\n**$3 - Total Selections: 96. Total Value $288.**\n\nJust a little bit higher than $5. $5 remains in the lead. I think it is very cool how the results were so close for these two!?\n\n**$2 - Total selections: 49. Total value $98.**\n\nQuite the drop for this one. $2 clearly takes the lead.\n\n**$1 - Total selections: 32. Total value $32.**\n\nI think it is quite clear that greed from people who selected $2+ clearly is what killed this one. $1 is in the lead.\n\n**$0.50 - Total selections: 5. Total value $2.50**\n\nPerhaps $0.50 may be the most shocking of the results. I am leaving this giveaway with only giving away $2.50. People selected values higher than $0.50 because most people were thinking that 'someone has to select $0.50 so that it doesn't win, but I don't want to be that person'. It was this concept that lead to the downfall of greed. I was honestly shocked that so many people took $3 and $5. If it was between $0.50 and $5, and they were the two options, and we remove $1,2, and 3, in order for $5 to be the winning option, there must be 10 people who choose $0.50 over the $5. \n\nThough I knew before this started that $0.50 was going to be the winner, I was very shocked at how few people selected $0.50. I will surely be having another giveaway soon to make up for the sadness that surrounds this one. I think this is a good 'social experiment' though, and I hope you all enjoyed it.\n\nI think the most funny part is how several messages came to me asking if I was 'OK' and that I could potentially be giving away hundreds of dollars with this giveaway, thank you for caring for me, but unless there were thousands of entries, there was no way this could ever get over $30.\n\nNow, let me congratulate the winners of $0.50!! #Rich!\n\n* /u/heather24242\n* /u/ZephyrPro\n* /u/Rockstar7514\n* /u/zzzomg\n* /u/fuckfiend\n\nI will send you a PM containing your $0.50 amazon gift card (LOL) within the next 48 hours! \n\nIf anyone wishes to see the results, go ahead! \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIKQ4GvnNpDHDj9S672VM5yTX_tj_W8fPIRmlAPy4no/edit?usp=sharing","name":"t3_3dvmrn","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2015-07-20 00:19:09","week":30}

{"id":"3dw4pv","author":"philipito","body":"[Here is our new hot tub in all it's glory.](http://i.imgur.com/vW8OEg3.jpg)\nWe didn't want to spend a lot, so we bought an inflatable hot tub from Amazon. We had a raised garden that was placed in a poor spot in our backyard (too much shade to grow good veggies), so we paved over the garden and put the hot tub there. It runs off of 110V, so we didn't need an electrician to run power to it. We just ran an outdoor extension cord to the hot tub from our garage. I bought a waterproof junction box for where the hot tub plugs into the extension cord to keep it safe from the rain and any water splashing out of the hot tub. We already had a pop up gazebo and string lights, so we put those over the hot tub for some cover and lighting. The hot tub is surprisingly strong (you can actually sit on the edges), and the temperature keeps pretty well with the cover on. It sure is relaxing after a long day at work, and totally worth the money we spent!\n\nHot tub - $330\n\nPavers - $100\n\nFill soil - $25\n\nRiver rock - $25\n\nWaterproof junction box - $25\n\nTotal - With tax and everything, it was right around $550. Compared to the cost of a traditional hot tub, we feel like this was a very frugal purchase!\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to mention that we are leasing our property, so an actual hot tub is not an option for us. Given that, we really do feel that this is the best alternative.","name":"t3_3dw4pv","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-20 02:55:39","week":30}

{"id":"3dws4n","author":"conquistadr","body":"A few weeks ago I began writing about starting a new business and posting about the process as it happens (or when I have a chance to sit and write). You can read the first posts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3bibq4/starting_a_business_follow_along_part_1_the_idea/\n\nI finished my first post with a goal of finding a platform for the subscription service I am planning to launch. At first I was hoping to use Shopify, a platform I currently use. I’ve had no issues using Shopify and the customer service has been great. In the comments on my first post I was reminded about Cratejoy (thanks u/BoomTownOne), a service I had heard about when it first launched in private Beta and never had a chance to check out. Now that its open to everyone, I had a chance to check it out. After some research I decided CrateJoy was the best option to go with. CreateJoy offers flexibility, customization, a great low price, and the reviews from current customers were mostly positive. \n\nNow that I have the platform I wanted to narrow down my subscription idea. Currently the idea is to offer a few main products (ex. chocolate) as subscriptions, where customers sign up to receive a different brand to try out of said product (ex. hershey’s chocolate, Mars chocolate, etc) each month. NOTE: I should point out my product has nothing to do with food. \n\nSince I had previously selected a handful of main products to offer, I felt I needed to narrow it down to 3-4 main ones to launch with. I also needed to get an idea of the best monthly price to offer those products. To figure out my main products and best price I turned to Mechanical Turk. For those that don’t know, Mechanical Turk (MT) is an Amazon company that is essentially a crowdsourcing marketplace that allows businesses (“Requestors”) to use “workers” to perform certain tasks such as data collection, writing, and to TAKE SURVEYS, the latter of which is what I will be using the service for. What’s great about MT is you can create a survey and reach thousands of potential customers to elicit feedback for as little as a few cents per survey taker. I decided to survey 80 MT users, both male and female (you can narrow your search) and paid $0.10 per user. After getting only a few hits I upped the offer to $0.50 per user, still a bargain considering what you get out of it. At $0.50, I quickly got the spots filled and had 80 users answer my 10 question survey. \n\nAfter looking over the results, I was able to quickly eliminate products that had no interest to people and chose 4 main products that a majority of survey takers said they would subscribe to if A. the price was right, and B. if it was offered as a subscription. Next, I was able to narrow down a monthly price that most survey takers said was reasonable. The survey also asked and answered a few other questions I had to better understand/help with the service I want to launch. In total I spent around $40 to get, what I felt, was valuable information that I will use. \n\nAs I mentioned before, I am planning to launch this business with very little money, about $1k - $2k. As a result, I have to get the best bang for my buck and save wherever I can. One way I am doing this is by designing the site myself, which is the next step of the process. Although I will be creating a mock-up of the site I can’t code so I will be searching for developers to code the site at a reasonable price. So that’s where I leave you, I will be creating a mock up and searching for a developer. Till next time.

I also buy damn near everything on Amazon, so something that gives me points/credit/whatever towards that would be perfect. I'm willing to take out a couple new cards and use them, but here's the kicker: I have to be able to set them up on an autopay system. After finding out how badly I'd been screwed before, the idea of having something floating out there that I could forget about and wreck everything I've rebuilt is terrifying.

{"id":"3dzrnm","author":"geekygirl23","body":"My husband and I recently sold a B&amp;M business we owned that also sold a decent amount on eBay. We had been on eBay for years and were unaware of the eBay selling limits that are placed on accounts and incrementally increased every month. \n\nThe plan was to continue our eBay business from home or a smaller office but we found our secondary account was limited to 50 items. We have checked the eBay accounts of all friends and family members and nobody has an account with any reasonable limits. In fact, most of them are limited to 5 or 10 items with a few at 100 items. The business we sold went to a competitor and after finding out about the eBay rules we tried to buy the account back (they have no interest in using it at all) but they weren't having it. As part of the deal we can't operate a competing local business for 5 years but can run the eBay side. They seem to want us out of the business completely even though it doesn't compete with what they do at all.\n\nWorse is that because of the type of products we have the items would need to be listed in a store instead of as auctions. This means that the price of each item counts against these limits even when the item has yet to sell. At our peak we had 1800 items listed and sold $12,000 per month. The total amount listed exceeded $20,000 at any given time. Average selling price was around $44 with free shipping.\n\nWe have on hand about $20,000 of inventory. We have access locally to between $10,000 and $20,000 of new inventory every month. Should that be exhausted we have access to a virtually unlimited amount of inventory through contacts we've accumulated over the years. I'd estimate the ceiling to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000 per year in sales on eBay and about similar on Amazon but with a little different business model. The cost to obtain new inventory is around 15% of retail but the retail does include free shipping.\n\nWe have a 900 square foot building at home to get things started. If we push things to the extreme we would definitely need another location to store and ship these items but that would be far into the future. \n\nWe would be willing to sell 50% of the business to the right person. The #1 criteria would be an eBay account with limits sufficient to earn enough money to pay the bills while things grow. \n\nWe would sell 50% of this business for $10,000 which covers half of the current inventory. We would be happy to break this down into 1 down payment and 11 monthly payments that are paid from the profit only. \n\nBasically, $833 down and the first $833 profit each month would go to us with the remainder of all profit being split equally. After 1 year all profit would be split 50/50. \n\nI can absolutely guarantee that you will make a profit from month one. Sales will come in 24 to 48 hours after the first listing goes online.\n\nI have no idea how this will be received here but figured it was worth a shot. Hopefully some of you have eBay limits that actually give room for a business to operate.\n\nI am aware that there are many unanswered questions. Some things can only be discussed in private but feel free to ask. \n\nThanks","name":"t3_3dzrnm","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-20 23:15:45","week":30}

Due to me and my wife's limited capital we can only handle so many orders based on the amount of available capital that we have. So if we get up to certain point of sales, we will have to wait the 3 days processing time to fill the orders then use next day shipping agreement that we have with our supplier to fill orders. So the customer will recieve the order within 5-6 business days. Do you think the customer's will be agitated on the delayed shipping response? I have posted our shipping policy with this disclaimer on our site and people are still ordering, so I'm guessing it is ok. My wife claims that it is normal for boutiques to take a week to ship, I guess I'm just used to next day airing stuff from Amazon so it bugs me. It's not the speed that I would like but we will be able to change that once sales start to pick up.

{"id":"3e55ry","author":"logdogged","body":"Since I graduated college in 2009, I've accumulated Google and Apple stock in my brokerage account (~$250k value) and Amazon stock in my Roth IRA (~$100k value) by living dirt cheap and taking public transportation despite my above-average income.  I also have a little bit of SPY in each.  Is this OK?  Even though I'm young, is it still bad that all of my net worth is in three stocks?  Apple's big hit today made me think.\n\nShould I rebalance?  I'm worried that the valuations of these three stocks (Google, Amazon, and Apple) are getting way too frothy, and I should consider taking some of the profits I've accumulated over the past 6 years, spreading some more into SPY, picking up some lower-beta stocks or ETFs, and setting aside a bit of cash in case of market correction.\n\nThoughts?  What would you do if you were me, considering my young age (26 years old) and the fact that my fiance's parents (very successful business owners) are going to pay for our wedding and have already put a down payment on a house for us (i.e., no major near-term purchases)?  In terms of liabilities, I don't have any credit card debt, and I recently refinanced my $20k of student loans down to a 2% interest rate (I always made the minimum payments so that I could invest in stocks).  My fiance has no debt (rich parents).\n\nWhat should I do and why?  Please keep in mind that due to my young age I can still be very aggressive, so I am not interested in precious metals or bonds or being overly diversified.  I have played with the idea of real estate, but, like stocks, I'm afraid that the market is getting frothy.\n\nEDIT: I agree that I should diversify my portfolio.  My question now is, should I rebalance all at once or dollar-cost average in?  And if the latter, how would I go about doing that without paying hand-over-fist in commissions?  I do have a Fidelity account and put a little bit into their no-commission ETFs.  I don't want to be caught holding the bag in case we're at a peak.","name":"t3_3e55ry","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-22 03:10:07","week":30}

If you were me, how would you time this rebalancing, especially with respect to rebalancing my portfolio all at once vs. gradually rebalancing my portfolio over a period of time by averaging into low-cost index funds and/or into a service like Wealthfront or Betterment?  I'm worried that if I rebalance everything tomorrow, and we're at a peak, I'll be left holding the bag, so I'm toying with the idea of selling everything, sitting on cash, and averaging into a more balanced portfolio month-by-month.","name":"t3_3e58q8","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-22 03:34:27","week":30}

{"id":"3e64nk","author":"[deleted]","body":"**Background / 2) Motivation** \n\nAmerican, 28 y/o male. BS, BA, MA, PMP, CELTA, considering a CME once I have the spare $. Sorry for trying to keep this anonymous. I use Reddit mostly as a platform to talk about/discuss/follow video games. I think this post may rub people the wrong way when you get to my 6mo/1yr/5yr plan or because of its length. \n\nI had a little gig in Latin America from around Nov 2009 to ~May 2011, right out of college. I was a bilingual executive assistant to a multinational enterprise at the time and was able to sell a corporate service freelance through my bosses, I made a killing for a 21/22 year old kid.. around 120k total. Like a kid, I blew all the money surfing in Brazil for my friends and I. And, like a kid, I researched poorly and did a few illegal tax moves in that country and ended up having our business account frozen and the funds seized not long after the 'epic' vacation. At least I spent most of it.\n\nI sold that project for a few pennies and spent some time in China deploying it as an e-learning product for a company there. I was cut out of the back-end also, they just brought me a new contract one day. So I took what I had already won and left with my head held high and my soon to be deep-pockets long gone again. China problems. lol. \n\nThen, on a recommendation from my LatAm days I was hired by a foreign marketing agency, to mostly take over its USA branch as the USA managing director was leaving. \n\nThis was great. Really knocked it out of the park for a few clients and had a few offers for work but rejected them all because moving the agency to Miami was going to be amazing. And it was. But the owners pulled out. After selling a few projects and finding a retained client or two - after my commission and salary and overhead - it wasn't worth it for them and we parted on excellent terms as they pulled out of the USA.\n\nImmediately, I was offered a position as an account director for a booming PR/Social media agency back home. Long story short: sold too many projects to my assigned accounts with new digital strategies I brought from the previous agency, took over relationships that the owners struggled with.. my guess is I scared the hell out of them because in June they fired me (a week after a glowing 90-day review).. they didn't even have the courage to face me. They just revoked my access to all our systems and gave me a few hours to figure it out. It was a bad move to join them and I should have seen it coming. \n\n--\n**The questions the submit button tells me to answer:**\n\nSo, I've burnt a month. And I've decided to stop shunning the advice I was given by many people. Do what I did as an account strategist for agencies, alone. I just reactivated my relationship with the LatAm agency I was working with. I'll have my brand, logo, website and service deck finished by next week. Furnished gratis by my previous employer.\n\n1) Full service marketing agency in the form of one man, with a AAA agency in Latin America as the back of the house/production. Strategy/Creative Direction/Media Buying/SEO and relationship management by yours truly. I don't like an elevator pitch for the whole scope of this business, because my clientele/audience will receive an elevator pitch tailored to their business and needs. This is project based, no retainer or classic pitch to be a company's marketing department. \n\nElevator Pitch (I'm winging it): You're paying a marketing manager $5,000-10,000/mo and you don't know what they are doing and you cannot measure their effectiveness. Or you've dabbled with agencies but they consistently over promise, under deliver and cost too much. You won't work with an agency again because year long contracts are absurd when you're not looking past next quarter's revenue goals. You want to turn your marketing on to support the sales team, and then turn the costs associated with it off until the next push. From copywriting and sales collateral to digital advertising, design and branding - I provide the quality of a AAA agency with the transparency and working relationship of an in-house manager, at a fraction of the cost of an agency or an in-house manager. I do this through one strategic partnership and no goals to grow beyond a few key relationships. \n\n2) Motivation: see above!\n\n3) About three days now, but I've been performing the exact same service to make *other* people money for two years.\n\n4) forgive the absurd generalizations.\n\n* Six months: Establish seed client via current network/father's network/past clients. Three currently in the pipeline and I've booked meetings with each the week after next. I need a deadline to be up and ready to bill or this will never happen. Break even on my personal expenses with 2-5 clients or projects per six months (min. 3500/mo). \n* One year: 5-8 clients or projects per six months. hire intern/personal assistant\n* Two year plan: 15k revenue/month (3 projects per month)  promote intern / hire 2 new interns - this is it. No growth past this, not sustainable for the business model. See 5 year plan.\n* Five year plan: Student debt paid off, down payment on a house prepared in the bank, sell myself to a hot enterprise (as Microsoft/Apple/Amazon are today) for a nice salary or find a major USA agency willing to bring me in at the director level. Or do this forever if it is sustainable. Honestly, I'm not sure the market for this kind of work will last that long. Companies like GoDaddy and product/service packages like Microsoft's Azure/Dynamics are going to make this kind of work a thing of the past soon enough.\n\n5) Negative: Job hunting for the first time at 28. NYTimes and NPR finally make sense. The job market is absurd. Trying to leave the agency world, where I'm worth 80-100k base + 10% commission... I'm getting automated rejections like crazy for marketing management positions I can do in 15 hours per week. Positive: Leaving an interview for a job I didn't want and realizing the absurdity of not working for myself... as long as I stay in this field.\n\n6) Be patient, don't rush into offers - if the position is too good to be true, it is. Spend 1 month in Brazil not 4. The Chinese are going to cut you out. \n\n\nI realize this whole thing may sound absurd. But I have more or less already locked down a client that will generate between 2-6k a month, beginning in September. My father has spent a long career as a hard money lender, raising capital for new businesses. He has two serious leads for me, one is a brand that would bring in 20k in revenue and 8k in profit over two months and another would be a sales support/automation client that would bring in 8-12k in revenue and 6-9k in profit per project, depending on the creative associated with it. If they want digital to boost it as well, even more. That said, I have some decent leads to seed this.\n\nAlso, a brain dump. Any time I brain dump on reddit I get shit on. But I've never tried this subreddit.\n\n\n","name":"t3_3e64nk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-22 08:31:08","week":30}

Right now I've applied for and been approved for 3 cards in the past 2 years including the CSP, which I just got.\n\nMy credit score went from close to 800 to about 770 after some recent apps and my income is about 110k.\n\nMy desire is to get the Ink Plus (I have a small side biz that has about 80k of revenue a year) and the Companion Pass. I already have the Chase Southwest Plus, the Freedom, the Chase Amazon and now the CSP.\n\nIdeally, I'd get the Ink Plus soon then the SW Premier and SW biz card at the same time in January to have two years of the CP. I'm concerned about getting the Ink Plus though and ruining the chances at the CP since I value the CP MUCH more. \n\nShould I go for the Ink Plus and the CP or hold off on the Ink Plus. If not, once I get the CP cards I'll be over the 5 card limit and would have to wait a while for the Ink Plus. \n\nAdditionally, should I lower any of the credit limits? (Freedom - $16,900, Amazon - $7k, SW - 20k, CSP - $8,600) I'm also going to cancel the Southwest card I have now and possibly the Amazon card too but maybe I should move the credit limits or keep them open with $500 limits?","name":"t3_3e8fso","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-07-22 21:29:42","week":30}

It's quite simple to use to earn a few bucks.\n\nYou can purchase Amazon GC, Google Play GC, iTunes, etc. The current rates look something like this;\n\n500 Coins = $1 when you buy a $3/$5 Giftcard\n\n400 Coins = $1 when you buy a $10 Giftcard\n\n360 Coins = $1 when you buy a $25 Giftcard\n\n340 Coins = $1 when you buy a $50 Giftcard\n\n[App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1000gift-get-various-free/id1009168448?mt=8)\n\nFeel free to use referral code \"75dd913\" if you want to help me out. \n\n","name":"t3_3eacr7","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-23 06:42:01","week":30}

My wife is in grad school, she was working part time and trying to pick up extra shifts at the hospital but for the past 3 months the patient load has been incredibly low and she keeps getting low censused (sent home) so her hours are barely showing up now.  I make a little over $60,000.00 per year, take home roughly $3,000.00 a month.  Total bills per month (not including CC payments)  is roughly $4000.00.  Our emergency fund has been completely depleted and I'm looking at a very bleak fall and winter if I cannot figure out what to do.

To clear up a few repeating questions:    \n* We have 3 cars for the simple fact that my truck has not sold yet.  Prius was purchased at the beginning of the month for lowering commuting costs. Opted not to trade in the truck because I can get substantially more for it by selling.  We owe less than $3,000.00 on it and the remaining balance after sale can be used to knock down some more of the CC debt.    \n    \n*Last year was the first full year where both myself and my wife were working, living in a low cost area, and able to put back savings.  At full time she makes $65-$72,000.00 per year.  She dropped her hours to part time but remained at the same schedule by picking up extra shifts in order to maintain a job but have the ability to free her time for school if she really needed it.  Patient load at her hospital last year was normal and we never really saw any affect from her being sent home early once or twice a month, however this year patient load has been almost nothing, she gets sent home or put on call 3-4 days per week.  The extra shifts she signs up for don't help for the same reasons.  She has been applying to other clinics, hospitals, etc for anything she can but nothing has paid off yet.    \n    \n","name":"t3_3edb6h","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-23 23:09:20","week":30}

{"id":"3edx54","author":"ValueInvestor1981","body":"Well f**k.  Amazon (AMZN) just announced that they made $92MM last quarter versus a loss of $126MM in the same quarter last year.  So what did investors do?  They decided to reward Amazon with an $85 per share increase after hours.  That’s an additional $40Billion or so in value added.  So now they are officially worth more than Wal-Mart.  And that is beyond stupid…and here is why:\n\nIn the last twelve months (TTM – Trailing Twelve Months), Wal-Mart has $485Billion in revenue.  Amazon has $96Billion in the last 12 months.  So Wal-Mart, by sales, is 5 times larger.  But it is worth LESS?!?!?! Ok…maybe it’s about profit…\n\nIn the last twelve months, Wal-Mart has made $16Billion in net income.  Amazon has LOST $188MM.  Wait.  So Wal-Mart has MADE A PROFIT of $16Billion and Amazon has LOST $188,000,000….LOST….Oh but wait, everyone says it’s about the growth…\n\nI know.  So Amazon’s BEST argument is that they are investing in more and more things to make the experience for users better and grow their media collection and blah blah blah.  Ok. Fine.  Then why can’t you make money off of $96B EVEN DOING THAT?!?!\n\nTheir best margins ever were almost 4%…Wal-Mart, which is brick and mortar and supposed to cost more, is higher on average.  So let’s assume that they hit 4% in profit margin in the long run because of their investments and they finally start to turn a profit…on $96Billion in sales, that’s profit of $3.8Billion. So at a market cap of $265Billion, that’s a price to earnings ratio of 70 still! Which is still 5 times more than historical averages especially for such a mature company because REMEMBER, Amazon is  a MATURE company. It isn’t a start-up! It’s been around for 20 years!\n\nSure it is! They surprised everyone by growing 20% from last year’s same quarter.  Ok. So let’s assume they continue to grow 20% per year and let’s assume Wal-Mart only grows at 3% per year…how long will it take for Amazon to catch up?  Remember, assuming 20% growth per year is HIGHLY unlikely…is it impossible? No.  But even Amazon’s growth since 2007 has slowed significantly.  From 2007 to 2008, before the big recession, Amazon’s revenue grew 30%.  So there is going to be a slow down.  Have they had better years since then?  Sure, but here is their year over year growth since 2007: 30%, 27.9%, 39.5%, 40.5%, 27%, 21.9%, 19.5%, and this last quarter they SURPRISED everyone with 20% growth.\n\nSo back to my point: Let’s assume 20% growth for Amazon every year and only 3% for Wal-Mart every year…In 10 years, Amazon’s revenue will be $595Billion and Wal-Mart’s revenue will be $651Billion! They still haven’t caught up to Wal-Mart! And even at $595Billion in revenue and 4% profit margin, which I remind you they have never achieved, they will have profit of $24Billion which is still only 10 times earnings of TODAY’S MARKET VALUE!…which is about where stocks should sell for during a bad bear market.  So let’s even assume that it should sell for the same multiple as Wal-Mart, which is around 15 or so historically. That’s a valuation of $360Billion which is 35% higher than today.\n\nSoooooo…follow me here…Today’s market value of Amazon is 35% lower than what it should be if it were to grow at 20% per year for 10 more years AND have profit margins it has never seen before.  Does it sound optimistic?  Absolutely.  Yes, Amazon is winning the popularity contest right now, but no companies does that for decades.  Microsoft didn’t. Google didn’t.  Dell didn’t. IBM didn’t.  No one does.  And sometime in there, it will massively correct.  And when it does, it will be ugly.  Until then, my bank account looks ugly.\n\nGood day.","name":"t3_3edx54","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-24 02:01:08","week":30}

{"id":"3ef8ph","author":"[deleted]","body":"I've been thinking of starting this whole buying low selling high on ebay thing to make some extra money as I'm in college and need the extra cash, however, there are no good thrift shops where I live, there's one Value Village and it sucks. There's another one in a fairly wealthy neighborhood in the town next to mine except it's next to impossible to find without driving for an hour-which I don't plan to do. So, the next best thing I could think of was my local dollar store, which sells random stuff like spiderman stickers or toys, and shampoo that have been discontinued as well as some camping gear so I was thinking...would it be a good idea to try to sell that on ebay? They'll be brand new as well so maybe I could take it to Amazon as well but I wanted to ask you guys on here first before I go blow 20 bucks at the dollar store only to find out nobody wants it for the prices I want to sell them at. \nOh also, the items are around 3 dollars (Canadian dollar stores) each and I was thinking of pricing them around 10-15 dollars-for example, they sell twine and I wanted to price that around the 15 dollar mark. I really hope I'm not getting ahead of myself here...\n\nThanks in advance, I've seen people give some really great advice on here, and heard awesome stories about earning 800 a month or something, so hopefully this works out for me too ","name":"t3_3ef8ph","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-24 10:03:46","week":30}

{"id":"3ehq8p","author":"yukinara","body":"A little bit story about me. I'm operating a small business with my friend. Basically we buy stuffs in the United States and export them to Vietnam. For example, let's say if a customer wants to buy a laptop on Amazon, but they don't ship to Vietnam, they will come to us. We will buy the laptop and ship it to Vietnam for them.\n\nSo, that alone is fine. However, due to the nature of my business, I usually have to receive large amount of wire transfer to my business bank account. Usually each transfer is about $20.000. Recently our business has been increasing, and we have a lot of customers. Sometimes my friend send over $20,000 and that is gone in like a week or so. \n\nPersonally, I have been running some businesses in the past few years, and faithfully filed and paid all the taxes. I haven't got into any trouble with the IRS or any government agency. \n\nMy question is, with that amount of wire transfer, is there anything I can do to make sure that my business's finance is transparent or safe in the eyes of the IRS?  My business is simply about exporting, and I don't want to raise any red flag. Is there anything else I need to do to protect myself beside reporting tax and keeping check of the spending activities?","name":"t3_3ehq8p","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-24 23:21:41","week":30}

{"id":"3ehryy","author":"RTiger","body":"Gather round, it's story time. It may not be what you think. After the AMZN earnings were out, I legged into selling strangles (both puts and calls). It was a roller-coaster ride that ended with me covering the put leg for about a 750% loss basis the premium collected. (Obviously the margin requirement is rather large for selling options on AMZN, so percentage on capital isn't so dramatic).\n\nAbout 10 minutes after the open with AMZN around 567, I sold JulW4 540 puts. About 15 minutes later with AMZN at 559 I hedged that by selling JulW4 590 calls.\n\nAround noon Eastern time it is looking good with AMZN holding in the middle range. Then came the down draft. When it breaks the 540 strike to the downside, I hit eject with AMZN at 539. Had I held until the close the loss would have been more like 2200%. \n\nSome might say I was over confident, too big for my britches. \n\nYes, it was a bad day, but I'll live to trade again.

So from what  I've read on the sidebar about CCs it seems that aside from getting a secured CC, it doesn't seem to matter much which CC I get as my first one because the rewards and cash back offers for the ones I'm probably eligible for wouldn't really be that great anyways.

{"id":"3ekqs4","author":"ValueInvestor1981","body":"My recent post about Amazon being overpriced was met with heavy criticism.  Everyone kept telling me how Amazon was not overpriced because of how great their business model is and how fast they are growing. \n\nThis is exactly what is wrong with investing.  Everyone thinks that just because a company is popular or their products are popular, the stock price is irrelevant.  Exactly wrong.  Should you pay more for a company that is growing faster? I would agree.  But in the world of Amazon, no one cares what the price is because the stock keeps going up.  Who cares that it's selling for more than Wal-Mart even though Wal-Mart is five times larger in terms of sales and makes $16Billion per year vs losing money?  Well, I care. \n\nSo what I have decided to do is go through a list of S&amp;P 500 companies that I think are GREAT companies but are selling for more than they should and show that they aren't selling for bubble-like levels. These are very popular and market dominating companies.  They are still priced a bit more than I would like, but they have strong balance sheets and good cash flow.  This is NOT a buy or sell recommendation for any of these.  I am not allowed to give advice like that. I am merely stating that these companies are solid financially.\n\nThey are big brands and have more cash on hand than total liabilities, so they can pay off ALL their debts with the stroke of a check, they have had 3 year net income growth in excess of 25% per year, and their Price to Earnings ratio is in excess of 40.\n\nFacebook (FB): Has anyone heard of this company.  They have over 1.2 Billion active users and generate revenues $13 Billion per year.  They are generating a lot of cash and putting it in their coffers and their stock has gone from a low of $18 per share to $97 per share as of Friday.  They are selling for over 94 times earnings! So a company that already has 1 in 6 people in the world on it, and they are selling for 94 times earnings.  Ok.  Is there upside? I am sure there is.  Only two years ago they had $5 Billion in revenue, but this is a solid company that will likely sell at a better valuation in the future.  I will hold tight for a better opportunity.  \n\nUnder Armour (UA): Hot new sports apparel business that has Jordan Spieth and Kevin Durant as endorsement contracts.  They have generated 29% growth in earnings over the past 3 years and they have plenty of money in the bank to pay off their low debts, relative to cash.  But of course, what new hot item wouldn't be without an overpriced valuation. They have bad Free Cash Flow but it's not awful.  \n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG): Who doesn't love Chipotle?  Losers don't like Chipotle. Fits all the metrics we want and, of course, because of its popularity, it is selling for bad valuations.  \n\nSo, like I tell everyone, good companies and good ideas can have, and usually do have, bad valuations especially during the good times that we have now.  \n\nJust be patient.  There are bull and bear markets...we are in the midst of a very solid bull market, but it will end...and when it does, the most overpriced stocks get hit the hardest. \n\nTheCapitalistManifesto.com","name":"t3_3ekqs4","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-25 19:20:06","week":30}

{"id":"3emut8","author":"[deleted]","body":"I like low-maintenance solutions that require the least work possible. Even while I was bringing in enough money to save a bit, pay off student loans a bit, I felt like I was always dealing with the following problems:\n\n1. **Not knowing if I was paying off more credit card debt than I was accumulating**. I could see on Yodlee/Mint that yes, I was accumulating some net worth. But was that because my credit cards were going down, or were my investments just going up faster than my credit cards?\n2. **Overdraft fees**.\n3. **Micromanagement of my funds**. Constant questions like *Is now the right time to move money into my Roth IRA?* *Do I have enough money in my checking account to make this payment?* *Have I scheduled other payments that are going to draw money from the account before this payment is made?* \n\nIt's not everyone's style/stage, but what I wanted to have to intervene in my finances with maybe one action a month. I wanted to be responsible for maintaining a rough sense of how much I was spending each month, but otherwise let my money run itself.\n\n1. **Checking line of credit (LOC)**. This is the backbone of my plan. I wanted a maintenance-free primary spending account that allowed me to overspend some months. Like if you've got $400/mo to pay on your credit card and spend $600 in May, it creates no problem as long as you recognize that and spend less in June and July. On the other hand, I also wanted a primary spending account that facilitated underspending each month. A regular checking account is great for underspending: deposit $400 a month into it and if you only spend $300 a month then you just accumulate a balance.\n\n    But checking accounts are terrible for overspending some months, and credit cards are terrible for underspending some months: I suppose you could pay $400/mo on your credit card regardless of balance and accumulate a negative balance, but then it's more micromanagement to get it out.\n\n    The checking line of credit allows both underspending and overspending. It's a regular checking account with an attached personal loan; once you spend down to $0 on the checking account, any further debits to that account are added to the personal loan; transfer money into the checking account while you have a balance on the loan and it's automatically credited as a payment. *It's a checking account that can go into the negatives*.\n\n    I'll write a bit more at the end about how I use the checking account as a *barometer for my spending*, and how each month I *deposit a fixed amount into this account from my investments*.  The important point is that if I overspend some months, it's no problem and I don't have to take any extra action to correct it, beyond knowing to spend a bit less in subsequent months. And if I underspend some months, it's no problem and I don't have to take any extra corrective actions.\n\n2. **Direct deposit into my investment accounts**. My short/intermediate term savings is a low volatility investment account with direct deposit. Specifically, I invest with Vanguard and deposit my entire paycheck into a total bond market index fund. Some people recommend more or fewer tiers of savings with more or less liquidity and more or less volatility; as in, \"Keep three months of income in a money market savings account.\" That's your choice. And if you wanted to, you could direct deposit into a money market account at Vanguard. The important point is that I *deposit my paycheck into investment, not a spending account.*\n\n    I don't know why, but this makes me feel like basically a saver, not basically a spender. And it helps me mindlessly accomplish the next step:\n\n3. **Automated deposits into my checking account**. I deposit in one fixed amount for rent, utilities, food, personal spending, etc. I aim to put in the **average** of my spending across all months. I might even put in a bit more than my average spending, because for me personally I do better with extra slack than extra stress.\n\n    Whereas the checking LOC insulates me from thinking about my spending, the automated deposits into my checking account **insulate me from thinking about my income**: income is a transaction between my employer and Vanguard. If income should stop for a while, my automatic deposits into my checking account would continue. If income should go up, my automatic deposits into my checking account would be unaffected unless I made the decision to raise them.\n\n4. **Automatic investment into my retirement savings accounts**. Part of that direct deposit check goes directly into my Roth IRA, also at Vanguard. It puts in enough each paycheck to fill the Roth IRA by the end of the year. The math is a little complicated because Vanguard requires you to allocate your direct deposit by percentage, so I had to calculate the percentage of each direct deposit that I would have to use in order to fill my Roth IRA over one year. That's the percent I direct into my Roth IRA, and the rest goes into my short/intermediate term investment account.\n\n    I'm planning on opening an education savings account (529) soon as well. And I'll be shaving off another percentage to go into that each month.\n\n5. **Automatic credit card/debt payments**. I don't know if it's the lingering fear of NSF fees or the legitimate consumer benefits of credit cards, but I haven't given up my credit cards for my debit card yet. But I do have each of my credit cards set up to automatically deduct payments from my checking account each month. The goal is payment in full each month, but specifically I have them set up for max $500 payments. I don't typically spend more than $500/mo on my credit card, but if for some reason I had to--say, car failure--I wouldn't have to worry about whether that an automatic payment for the whole amount would completely drain the LOC.\n\n    Of course, my student loans also come out of my checking account automatically!\n\nHere's how I **manage the whole setup**:\n\n1. **I have a rough idea how much I've spent each month**. Supermarket about once a week at ~$30. CostCo at ~$100 per month. Couple of Amazon purchases at ~$60 per month. Order in a pizza once or twice a month. Evening entertainment a couple of times a month. Subway lunch about once a week. Etc. *That's my benchmark for typical spending*; if I'm over, I know. But I don't have any fear that I'm going to bounce a check every time I issue a utility payment from my bill-pay.\n\n2. **My LOC is a barometer for my spending**. All of my expenses eventually hit my checking account; if it's chronically in the negatives that means I'm spending more on average then what I'm depositing into the account. That's not an emergency, and it doesn't mean overdraft fees, but it is a call to either reduce my spending behavior to match my expectations, or adjust my expectations (how much money I deposit each month) to match my behavior.\n\n    If you wanted to do the same, here are the **steps to get started**:\n\n1. **Apply for a checking line of credit**! It's a lot like applying for a credit card. I asked my bank for a $3000 LOC online, it was approved instantly, they sent me some paperwork to sign and return. Easy.\n\n2. **Create a short/intermediate term savings/investment account**. I'm going to recommend Vanguard because they are what I know; if you know something else, go with that. If you want very low volatility, you could go with the Prime Money Market account. I feel comfortable with the Total Bond Market Index, which is a \"2\" on their risk scale. Either of these carry a minimum investment of $3000, so don't start this step until you feel like you aren't going to need that $3000 for a while.\n\n3. **Set up direct deposit to that account**. There's instructions on the Vanguard site for how to set this up. You'll go through a screen where you establish that xx% of your deposit should go into account X, yy% of your deposit should go into account Y, etc. If you establish a retirement account, this is the screen you would use to say that a certain percentage should go into that account.\n\n4. **Establish a recurring sale from that account**. Estimate your average spending and set up a recurring sale from your short/intermediate term savings into your checking account.\n\n5. **Set up automatic payments from your credit cards**. Each credit card has a different interface for setting this up.\n\n*Wrap up*\n\nI tried not to touch on whether or not I have a budget, or what I spend my money on, or how I invest my retirement, because I feel like those are personal decisions. But after years of feeling like I was paying too much damn attention to my finances, trying to automate something and fucking it up and getting a few overdraft fees, etc., I feel like I've got something that almost runs itself.

{"id":"3eohd1","author":"LuciferIAm","body":"Greetings,\n\nThis will be a long post, apologies for the incoming text wall.\n\nI find myself in a strange situation. I'm running a website design business/ (freelance) specifically targeting small businesses. I discovered recently there is a web design company of 2 (ppl) in my tiny city. Curious about what they've done I explored their website and clients. \n\nHere's where the possible opportunity has my gears shifting on how I could approach it, if at all. This company claims great skill in various things like wordpress, photoshop, graphics, SEO, etc. However by relatively little internet sleuthing I have determined that possibly every single one of their clients ever have been scammed to some extent. It was difficult with Muse-built sites but I even managed to find templates off template selling sites for muse that are EXACTLY the same (maybe a few colors or gfx difference, very little). Especially for every single wordpress site I found of theirs not only were they pathetically optimized (nothing but jetpack on everyone) but every single theme was a premium template on theme-forest (by far most known WP theme market). \n\nYou might be playing devil's advocate right now like others have to me, well sir/ma'am I'm not stupid. Examining the liscence of theme-forest makes it clear that unless buying the extended (no way thats happening) it is illegal to resell a theme. This means if the client was aware that this company got the template from theme-forest and edited it, that's perfectly legal as its the client buying it for its proper price. HOWEVER it's absolutely illegal if they withhold any of this information. Not only this but each and every one of these sites have the company listing in the footer 'Site Designed by XXX' which is obviously copyright infringement, but it also can be reasonably assumed they may never had told these clients they didn't build the theme from scratch. \n\nMaybe too little to reasonably infer wrongdoing? I was able to receive a quote from the owner, 700$ for a 4-5 page site. Considering my research into all of their clients yielded them buying templates this figure is beyond ridiculous for the amount of work they ACTUALLY do. Which leads me to believe they are withholding the information that they bought these themes for the client. \n\nLet me be clear as well, I have yet to find a WordPress site of theirs not a premium theme from theme-forest. I kid you not even their own website is a 18$ landing page parallax in which requires no work on their part outside of content edit. \n\nHonestly that's still all too little to really prove it, which is why I've anonymously reached out to a number of clients politely asking how much their site cost and if it was built from scratch because I love its look. \n\nLet me also reiterate that this company claims SEO yet all it does is insert google analytics and the plugins available on all its wordpress sites are &lt;5 often including theme specific or jetpack. No optimization plugins, which any wordpress admin worth their salt knows is a must. \n\nThis leads me into additional exploitation by them. They host nearly ALL of their clients on Bluehost. If you know anything about hosting/webamstering you shoulda threw it a tiny bit in your mouth because that's how awful Bluehost and any hosting company under the evil corporate umbrella of Endurance International Group. \n\nlong story short if you dont; EIG has bought up countless well known hosting companies, severely crippling every hosts performance + quality. On web hosting forums with semi-savvy webmasters constantly debating shared/reseller hosting you can watch comments flood of abandoning a company once it gets purchased by EIG. Anyways back to it.\n\nAll these companies are hosted on an awful likely shared hosting plan, which is super evident by many of them loading like crap. I'm trying to ascertain how much this company is charging monthly atm as well. \n\nNow to me, maybe I sound too good hearted or whatever to be in this position but the truth is i lack morality completely. However I care nothing for money, little for materialism and despise those who exploit/scam. Maybe that sounds funny in Entrepreneur but I'm an odd duck, I just want to be able to enjoy my work and sustain myself without exploitation. \n\nIn my own work I also utilize wordpress if that wasn't obvious. I've done extensive testing on the greatest plugins especially for optimization. Not only that I've built my own LEMP debian droplets (digitaloceanftw) that are ultra secure and ultra fast. I lack in the gfx department but can easily edit, thus I am forthright with any client, either showing them a number of themes or letting them look to their hearts content. \n\nWhile being solely small businesses I also utilize Amazon CDN for further goodiness. \n\nAt last to my long-winded seek for advice. I want to attempt to obtain these clients while striking some righteous justice on this company. Sure, in the scheme of things what good am I really doing? Nothing much but so what, f' scammers. Problem is revealing this information to the clients (heck just hitting the crappy host hard) could easily open me for legal action, as it is the stupidity of our laws, protecting scammers with great free reign. I've also been repeatedly told never to badmouth a different company when approaching a client.\n\nWhich leads me to a great problem anyways, of course I could just legitimately approach clients offering my services with no mention of the illdoing etc. However what others who have replied to me so easily ignore is these businesses/clients are being exploited BECAUSE they are ignorant/lack knowledge. It's easy to exploit them. You can't really explain why your service is better when they know so little in the first place. It's like explaining what NFL team is better then another to someone who has never watched a game. \n\nSry not really much of a tl;dr possible, idk if anyone will even reply. It's weighing on my mind as a chance to obtain clients that I'll treat great while destroying some junk people. \n\nEven if it turns out they haven't been lying to their clients (I do have some additional proof like a Facebook post talking about drawing up a concept for a local company when I literally found the exact same muse template on a site) I could still make a great case their hosting is a super joke. \n\nOn the no morality side of things I've pondered a number of things. Scorched earthing all their websites by reporting them to theme-forest anonymously. Contacting a journalist who wrote an article about them and revealing their misdeeds (anon o course). Anonymously sending proof of the misdeeds to each client while approaching them after a brief period only focusing on my server capabilities and no mention of the company.\n\nEtc.. lol.","name":"t3_3eohd1","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-26 20:01:45","week":30}

{"id":"3eorce","author":"SE0isHard","body":"[**Link to Part 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/3bghpo/buying_an_affiliate_site_and_making_it_more/)                                        \n\n[**Link to EntrepreneurRideAlong Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/3eoith/buying_an_affiliate_site_and_making_it_more/)\n\nHello again! Huge delay in getting this up but I have been working hard on my sites and I’ve taken on a few SEO clients as well. Not to worry though, I’ll cover everything up until now and will be releasing the second month income report in around a week. \nThe first month I had control over the site wasn’t a complete month and I’ve done a LOT of work on it since then so the profits are up considerably already. I’m going to start by identifying how to choose a website and why I chose this site and then we’ll get into the numbers.\n\n**How buying a website works**\n\nThere are a few different broker sites that you can purchase on including Empire Flippers, and Flippa which are the main two that I’m aware of. These sites have slightly different purchase styles, Flippa is more like eBay where with auctions and BINs. Whereas Empire Flippers requires a deposit and produces a more traditional broker-esque experience.\n\nSo you’ll identify a website you want to purchase, put in a bid or deposit, and wait to hear back. Giving a wide value range, you can find websites for sale for anywhere from 15-25x monthly profit. So if a website makes $50 a month you could expect to pay anywhere from $750 to $1250 for it. Empire Flippers tends to be a bit stricter on the 20-25x a month range as they deal with higher earning websites and are involved in all of the listings. Flippa is user controlled so you can sometimes find a bit better deal on there (like I did with this site). \n\n**Identifying a good site to buy**\n\nThis does require some analysis. Postings on Empire Flippers will always have detailed information on analytics and profits, but Flippa users can submit traffic and income reports in a variety of formats so ALWAYS CONFIRM EVERYTHING. What are some measures you would want to look into when purchasing a website?\n\n* How old is the website? Use this to double check the timeline of profits and traffic history. \n* How much traffic does the site get per month and does it line up with the profits?\n* What keywords is it ranking for?\n* How is the existing backlink profile?\n* Are there any associated social accounts?\n\nWith these first five questions we’re looking to see if any red flags pop up. If they had reported a high amount of AdSense income without a ton of traffic then you know something is up. If there’s affiliate income without front page keyword rankings and no social media presence then it’s too good to be true.\n\nWhen analyzing the backlink profile (for example with Moz, ahrefs, or Majestic) you’re looking to see if there was a PBN (private blog network) used to build links, if the links are spammy (the analysis sites have spam metrics) and checking the general quality of links to the site. This also gives you insight into potential growth – if it has a relatively weak backlink profile then you might see an opportunity to buy the site and improve the profits quickly (ex. Keyword ranked #5 and the next few spots could be attainable with maybe 5 more quality links).\n\n**Key takeaways here:**\n\n* Validate all claims of traffic, keyword rankings, and profits as best as you can. If there is any uncertainty BE UNCERTAIN\n* Look for opportunities where you could increase the value (profits) of a site quickly if you notice they are weak on any fronts (low backlink count, poorly written content, poor branding, low social media engagement) \n\n**The site I bought**\n\nHere’s an overview of the site I purchased without being too specific:\n\n* Auction showed roughly 3,000 unique visitors per month (mostly organic) – ANALYTICS VERIFIED\n* Monthly income had a ton of variance, averaging out to around $50 USD per month\n* Lots of keywords on the front page for purchase incentive keywords like “XYZproduct review”\n* Auction was a decent amount below 15x monthly income with reserve not met\n\nSo look at this site – which by the way had VERY poorly written content, poorly optimized SEO titles and descriptions, and generally poorly converting pages I saw a great opportunity to buy this site and have it way more profitable in a short amount of time.\n\nThe site also had a very poor backlink profile which was curious as it had a lot of high ranking keywords with decently monthly volume. Also I was confused as to why the site wasn’t making more money with some of the keywords and it all came back to the poor content, bad conversions, and poor optimization. I decided to buy the site and outlined a strategy to crank up the profits:\n\n* Rewrite any content as necessary\n* Ensure all pages are optimized for the appropriate keywords\n* Produce fresh content\n* Add backlinks as possible (the site is not that friendly to white hat outreach due to it’s nature)\n\nI also started to notice a trend, the site was targeting products with extremely low competition that allowed it to rank on the front page WITHOUT building any backlinks which is a really nice feature for simply producing new content and increasing profits. This caught my attention as well because I didn’t want to have to build natural links to this clearly pure affiliate site with low information to offer to readers.\n\n**Kickoff**\n\nSo I had purchased the domain for roughly 10x monthly profit where I also saw a huge potential to increase the monthly profits in a short amount of time – this was as steal to me. It was almost too good to be true but everything lined up, and unless I was getting scammed in the transaction process (which could happen with the sale of any site I guess) then it was going to go through. \nI had a bit of trouble migrating and rehosting the WordPress site as it was my first time but I figured it out eventually. The site was rehosted, analytics and webmaster tools set up, and now I had to add affiliate links to around 300 pages of reviews – NO BIGGIE. \n\nAlso going through every single review page highlighted the poorly written content even more so I spent almost an entire week and still some time here and there updating and optimizing content.\n\n**Let’s do another quick recap:**\n\n* Purchsed site for roughly 10x monthly income\n* Site has ~300 pages of unique product reviews\n* Site ranks well for keywords and gets traffic but does not convert\n* A lot of the content is….crap!\n\n**My cleanup strategy:**\n\n* Add affiliate links – use GeoRiot to localize links to the appropriate Amazon for site viewers\n* Review and edit content as necessary – some posts needed to be completely redone or lengthened\n* Add more in-text links and image links that the posts were lacking\n* Optimize SEO and meta descriptions to further improve existing rankings and click-through\n\n**First month report: June 14th-30th 2015 (16 days only)**\n\n* Pageviews: 2613\n* Avg session duration: 38s\n* Profit: $43.20  \n\nWith only half of the month to report it was looking pretty promising. I’m guessing that the previous owner had really poor on-page conversion and once that was straightened out the pages were already getting enough hits so it was a simple solution from there. I also added a few decent quality links (DA25+) to the domain which boosted the keywords a few ranks each (some more than others). Summary of what I had done so far:\n\n* Pages all SEO optimized, well written, appropriately linked to Amazon, READY TO CONVERT\n* Built 3 DA 25+ backlinks\n* Added 4 new product pages following the low competition and volume criteria that would make their way to the front page with minimal backlinking efforts.\n\n**Second month teaser: July 1st – 26th 2015 (26 days)**\n\n* Pageviews: 4228\n* Avg session duration: 39s – big 1s upgrade….!\n* Profit: $98.86\n\nNot even with a complete month we’re already doing considerably better with page conversions. I need to dig a bit more in analytics and my Amazon stats to produce some better numbers on the improved conversions (not the easiest to do without the previous Amazon stats). The increase in profits can easily be attributed to amping up the content quality, adding a few links to improve rankings, and making the pages get viewers to Amazon more easily which is our #1 goal! I’ll have the completed report on July finished within a week and this will give me some more numbers to compare between the first two months (however useful that will be considering variance we shall see).\n\nAnyways, pretty long read here but I hope you made it to the end. I’m pretty new to reporting like this so I’m open to any and all feedback including any stats or processes that you want more information on. Here’s my favorite analysis:\n\n* Site purchased for $500 USD (10x monthly income of $50)\n* Site (depending on variance) could show to be doing over $100 USD per month with proper valuating could be worth $1500 to $2500 dollars!","name":"t3_3eorce","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-26 21:24:18","week":30}

I usually grocery shop at Kroger, but over time I've been comparing prices to Amazon S&amp;S and finding several things online to buy bulk that are cheaper than Kroger. Plus, when you S&amp;S 5 items in a month, you can get an additional 15% off your order.\n\nTo answer OP's question- I end up spending 500-600 per person per month, that includes non food items (like toilet paper, toothpaste, etc), eating out and alcohol.

{"id":"ct995x5","author":"jl2121","body":"For the most part, margins will be smaller on FBA than on eBay, but will sell much faster. I'll come back to why I still like that better in most cases, but the beauty of FBA is that you can now sell things that don't make it worth your while to sell them one by one. For example, two days ago I went to Walmart and found an item for $2 that sells for much more on Amazon, and is ranked very highly, so I know they sell fast. After fees, it's just over $5 profit per item, whereas on eBay I may be able to make $7 profit. I bought all of the items in stock, a total of 48, so I expect to make about $250 through FBA. Now, if I had sold them on eBay, I could make $350, but I would have to package 48 items and make 48 trips to the post office to make that $350, whereas I only have to make one package and one trip to the UPS store to sell them on FBA. Not worthwhile for $7 each on eBay, but totally worthwhile for $250 on FBA.\n\nNow even in circumstances where I'm selling one or two of a particular item at a higher margin, it comes down to wanting to make a quick nickel or a slow dime. A lot of flippers out there want a big inventory for a slow dime, but by getting a quick nickel, I can reinvest in sooner to turn that nickel into two nickels. Then turn those two into two more. So I could make four nickels in the time it takes you to make one dime. That's where our business model is now going.","name":"t1_ct995x5","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-20 04:11:09","week":30}

{"id":"ct9c5bv","author":"hallsgator","body":"The Best Seller Rank is the quick and dirty way to check how will an item is selling.  The Amazon listing page as well as the Amazon Seller app and other scanning apps will give you the rank of the item. \n\nSo what is Best Seller Rank? It is a snapshot of how well an item has recently sold compared to other items in its category and subcategory. The lower the number the better, ex: rank #1,000 is better thank rank #99,000. \n\n\nSince the BSR is done by categories, a rank of 80,000 in Office Supply does not mean the same thing as a rank of 80,000 in Toys. Office has more items in the category, so the 80k ranked toy will sell faster and more often than the 80k ranked Toys item, on average.\n\n\nSo also you need to know what percentage the rank is in each category. Example: A product is ranked 80,000 in Home, so that is in the top 1% of items in that category. This is how you can find out what ranks are the best in each category. There are several charts floating around Google that will show the ranks broken down by percentages in each category. \n\nOne more thing to remember about BSR. It is a snapshot of how will an item is selling RIGHT NOW. So many things can skew this and either make the item look like its selling better than it is or make a good selling item look like a bad product.  You need to get famille with sites like camelcamelcamel.com that show you Price and Sales Rank history.  The Price chart will show you what the item has been listed at in the past, not necessarily sold for as Amazon does not release that data.  The Sales Rank chart will show a graph of the item's historical Sales Rank. Each spike in that graph indicates a sale. If then line is constantly at the top of the graph, it is a consistent seller. If there is only a spike very few months, it is a slow seller. Also, if you notice the item has stopped selling well, you can look on the Price chart to see if there price had any effect on the Sales Rank. If the price went up, the Sales Rank may have went up as well as people stopped buying that item at that price.  Sales Rank charts can also help you find seasonal items. If something has a great rank in January but a bad rank in July, you may still want to buy the item.  \n\nA few more quick notes:\n\n1. Amazon does not always give ranks, especially in Electonics.  This does not mean the item hasn't sold. What you can do here is check the Customer Reviews. If there are current and frequent reviews, the item is probably still selling wel. If the last reveiw is from a couple of years ago, probably not the best seller. \n\n2. Sometimes when you scan things, you will see sub-category ranks, not overall category ranks.  This can be very misleading. And item could be ranked #10 in its sub category, but not even in the top 20% of the main category. It is important that you find the parent category sales rank. \n\n\nThere's a few more details that go into Sales Rank but that is a good over view for beginners.  \n\n\n\n\n**Edited for clarity on examples so not confuse.**","name":"t1_ct9c5bv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-20 05:42:14","week":30}

{"id":"ct9jnmz","author":"donvito","body":"&gt;Am I stupid for thinking people want to buy worm dirt?\n\nI'm into gardening myself and all those organic/natural obsessed hippies buy that shit en masse. I thought about producing it myself but never executed on the idea.\n\nThe market is there. You just need great marketing (and packaging because it's a feelgood product and great packaging is one of the most important things here) to get it sold. Just market it to the organic crowd. Your average hobby gardener who uses Miracle Gro probably isn't your main customer. But people who read http://www.motherearthnews.com probably are.\n\n&gt;How do I cultivate, and educate people around the benefits?\n\nEducating consumers is a losing game. It's hard and you need to have deep pockets. Better market directly to the people who already want a product like yours. \n\n&gt;How do I generate interest beyond Adwords?\n\nIt goes like: First you need a profile of your ideal customer (the narrower the better, the more real world data from existing customers you have the better). Then find out where those customers hang out and what media they consume. (Forums, blogs, magazines, podcasts, etc). Then advertise there. Depending on the niche and community sponsoring a forum or a blog for example is great return. \n\nOh, idea: Put your stuff on Amazon. [This product here](http://www.amazon.com/Unco-Industries-Earthworm-Castings-Fertilizer/dp/B00062KQ42/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437386648&amp;sr=8-1) has around 500 reviews. That's huge if you take into account how few people actually get their asses up to write a review. Assuming your worm castings are of equal quality you just need a better packaging and marketing. I'd go for a brown paper bag with a label like [this one here](http://www.yelmworms.com/organic-fertilizer/). Then add a great product description and bam. (Just don't compete on price!) \n\n&gt;How do I design the website better.\n\nOnce you have your ideal customer profile design the website so it caters to them. Your current website looks great but unless your marketing your worm castings to big time farmers the images don't \"speak\" to your customers. Your customers should identify themselves with what they see in your marketing materials.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is just my possibly meaningless input. I thought max 20 minutes about the topic. There's a big chance that I'm talking bullshit because I'm just some anonymous guy on the internet. Don't turn off your brain and mindlessly follow/believe what I wrote.

They make so much money because they can charge more for hardware than anybody else.  If they ever lose that fashionable status, they could begin a long and painful descent.  \n\nTesla... I'm not at all convinced Tesla is going anywhere.  Even if electric cars become the norm, there's no reason Tesla has to be the one benefitting.  Some other large car company like Toyota may end up the one on top simply due to their sheer size and the metric shit tons of cash they can throw at it.  \n\nGoogle isn't Google any more.  They're now a huge company with fingers in a lot of pies, and maybe  that'll work out great for them.  Or maybe not, we'll see.  \n\nAmazon has never made significant profits, and their value has been based on their growth.

I am just saying that when a company gets too big in size, they should share more information with the investors so that the Investors can build different investment thesis. I think it will help Google as well. Morgan Stanley analyst believes that if Google is a bit more transparent about how it makes its revenues, it could add more than $100 to its stock price. Check out the [story here!](http://www.businessinsider.in/Morgan-Stanley-wants-Google-to-stop-hiding-how-it-gets-its-revenue-and-theres-a-good-reason-the-CFO-will-listen/articleshow/47776724.cms)\n\nLook at Facebook.

Even though they are one-fifth of the size of the Google in terms of revenues, their market cap is just half of that of Google.

I've a strict rule about not buying unless I know what the outcome is likely to be through FBA.  Even when I can get a signal I'll often wait maybe 30 seconds to get a response from the Amazon app.  This plus my general dislike of \"furtive scanning behaviour\" has pushed me right away from retail sourcing towards online sourcing.\n\nCar boots I haven't tried yet having been told that they are mostly frequented by traders these days.  Must check them out though.  I'd definitely need a higher ROI for this because of the time needed to list up second hand items.  Conterfeiting is another concern with this sector.\n\nMy FBA shipments go to one centre about 50% of the time otherwise to two or three.  Amazon UPS rates are good as is the UPS service.\n\nOverall I sense that flipping is not as lucrative here in the UK.  For example my local tip doesn't allow trading and the charity shops have the good stuff creamed off for sale online themselves. The bigger retailers' \"clearance\" sales are usually just \"online rather than retail price\" sales.

A lot of the cards with high cash back require a decently high credit score. http://www.nerdwallet.com/credit-cards/ Here is a great place to compare credit card offers and it is what I use to find the best rewards. I currently have a PNC Card with 1.0-1.5% Cash back and the Amazon cash back rewards card. I would recommend paying off the current balance or the statement balance every month that way you don't carry interest. Keep your credit utilization below 20% of your limit and it shouldn't adversely affect your credit score.

{"id":"cta77k2","author":"phi0x","body":"Like many people have suggested, they likely are not making money on the deal OR they are buying the book at a very cheap rate and able to ship it very cheaply as well due to the service use purchasing power they have with the shipping carriers. \n\nI'd tend to think that they're likely 'losing' on many items they sell. They're in the game of buying lots of products and then reselling them, they don't care if they're making a profit per say on everything. They just want to be the marketplace where people come to to shop. If you buy a book, you may also buy something else. It's a marketing strategy where you take a loss on one item but upsell various others or just hope that people see other items that interest them and do a large purchase order of various items.\n\ncorporations lower their taxes by having business costs such as shipping. It's how many companies can offer 'free' or discounted shipping in the first place, because at the end of the year their business profits don't look the best due to the service fee's they're paying on things like shipping and thus they get discounts on corporate income tax and get to spend more money to expand their business. Essentially what a country wants a company to do is expand and keep expanding.\n\nCompanies that can make profit and have no costs get taxed heavily. If they aren't really expanding, and aren't really spending but can offer a service or product with minimal effort/cost to them but rake in huge profits, they're going to get taxed heavy because they aren't a company that is beneficial to the society they're operating in. Society doesn't like users/abusers and a company that just makes insane profits gets taxed insanely to deter companies from being setup like that.\n\nCountries want companies to spend money and make money but not make an insane amount of profit (or else they'll tax them insanely). You'll see many companies that have made a lot of profit during the year, spend a lot of money at the end of the year. They'll go to town with their spending, buying up a ton of stuff that they normally wouldn't really buy if they could avoid it, but they do this so that they show they're 'expanding' and bring down the income tax rates on the corporation. You'd rather buy stuff for your company and expand rather than pay high income tax right? This includes buying property, a company may not even need the property but to bring down their net gains they will state they've bought a property for expanding the 'office' - this office may just be a new home for the CEO, he can state he 'works from home' aka his new 'office'. He wont have to buy the house under his name, but rather buys it under the company's - thus its a write-off and an asset which helps bring down net gains. The CEO now gets a new home and doesn't have to pay the insane corporate tax rate that he would have had to pay if he didn't spend the 1 million dollars on his new home.\n\nThere's a lot more as to how these companies work and how they benefit from utilizing the system to its fullest. I'm not an expert on Amazons business model but maybe some points I brought up may be similar to what Amazon is doing.","name":"t1_cta77k2","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-21 00:05:07","week":30}

If you had owned it in 2000, at its peak, after accounting for stock splits, it would have been worth ~$46.32. **You would have an annualized return of approximately -0.86%**, not including dividends and inflation. You would have waited 15 years for it to recover, and it still would not have nominally recovered its stock price. People overpaid for stocks that would \"crush it\"... EVEN IF they were profitable companies. The problem is that assumptions were that they would keep growing at an exponential rate (\"crushing it\") when in fact they were mostly mature, stable, and profitable companies.\n\nCisco is even more exciting! Cisco is trading at $28.03 right now. At its peak in March 2000, accounting for stock splits, it was at $79.38. **Your annualized return, not accounting for dividends or inflation, would have been -3.38%!** Again, Cisco is a profitable company that is a leader in its sector, and investors who expected it to be \"crushing it\" would have been better off burning half their money and putting the other half under their mattress!\n\nThe point is, people will sometimes question certain assumptions. Sometimes, those questions will be something like \"how much growth is already built into Tesla's stock price, and how much room is there really left for a new investor to profit? How long should a new investor expect them to burn cash before they start becoming profitable?\" Other questions might be \"Why is Amazon's profit margin fluctuating between -0.5% and 0.5% when it's been dominant in the online retail space for a decade?\" And other questions might be \"Why is Google priced for a rapidly growing company when it already has incredibly dominant marketshare in its primary business, digital advertising, its prices per click are dropping, and advertising is highly cyclical?\"\n\nJust, you know, questions. I think all of these companies will still be around in 10 years, and probably still be dominant in their respective industries.

{"id":"ctahi57","author":"jm1982","body":"True, good point. The returns in vintage type items seem like they can be pretty massive. There isn't really anything that is going to 'manipulate' the market overnight. With buy new items at retail, a new 'improved' version could come out or everyone could decide to drop the price drastically. I could see how one could actually lose quite a bit in that situation. From everything I hear about selling on Amazon FBA though it sounds like everyone is selling their products quickly at good prices. \nI don't hear much about items sitting for a long time like you hear with eBAY sellers..I guess it's just a trade off. \nIt seems Amazon FBA might be better possibly for those that want to invest a lot off front and get more consistent monthly cash flow.\nOn eBAY I've been seeing a lot of sellers with hundreds of listings and they are only selling a few items a day. Not even high value stuff either sometimes. That's a little discouraging for sure. It seems like if someone had 500 items at Amazon they'd probably sell quite a few more items...and there is also the time saved by not taking photos , listing, dealing with customers ,etc. \nOf course its just too different ways of doing business and people seem to succeed at both...but it seems nowadays you hear more about the people making good money - like full time salary money or more are doing it on Amazon rather than eBAY .  \n","name":"t1_ctahi57","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-21 05:04:24","week":30}

In the rare scenario that they did, they would go straight to Amazon and order it for $5 with free shipping. Novelty items like this are not sustainable. If you want to spend that $100 wisely, put it in the bank. When school starts again in the fall, you can buy a ton of really cheap novelty items and sell to your classmates.

{"id":"ctaijvo","author":"limes_huh","body":"It is great that you want to start a site for experience... I highly recommend that. However, I recommend that you start a site with content rather than ecommerce. Write a blog about something you are interested in. Gather a following. People are more interested in stories and knowledge than cheap novelties made in China. If you make a site that is content only, you will only have to pay about $20, as there is no merchandise to purchase. With the remaining $80 you can either hire a professional writer (freelancer.com, freelance.com) or pay for advertising. You will learn so much about web development and marketing that even if you don't make any money, it will be worth it. If you end up gaining a following, it would be very easy to start displaying advertisements and brining in money, or becoming an affiliate salesman through Amazon to sell a product specific to your blog. If you really want to sell the dummy iPhone, go ahead. You will still gain the experience of starting a website and buying wholesale, but there is also a high possibility of gaining the experience of failure. $100 can hurt to see go down the drain. As for convincing youtubers, it takes money for that as well.\n\nIf I have come off as rude at all, I would like to apologize. I am trying to warn you and advise you to spend your money in a way you won't regret. When I was your age, I spent $950 on t-shirts that light up to music.

{"id":"ctami56","author":"AnalystNeo","body":"sure. I agree with the statements in the first paragraph. But, if the company is just in the business of making money, they should remain private. When they go public, they are seeking the investors money. They have to share the information with investors to help them make better decisions, especially when the company grows so big. If they do not more share information, expectations are set with lesser information and the stock goes up or down depending upon whether expectations are met or not.\n\nI strongly disagree with the statements in the second paragraph. The data is the most interesting part. What you said about revenues from US is not true for global companies headquartered in US such as Google, Facebook, or Microsoft. They generate less than half of revenues from US. Regarding product family, since they aggregate everything up, we cannot see the subsegment level information. So, it seems one product determines 80% of the revenue. \n\nI think user metrics details shared by Facebook are very interesting. We can know which geographic region is driving users growth and revenues growth. We can know the usage and revenues by device. There are only 4 Internet businesses with $100 billion+ market cap: Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Alibaba. FB disclosures are better than Google. Alibaba disclosures are better than Amazon.

I also use them to print packing slips and any promotions I have going on for advertisement. \n\nIf you buy a printer I recommend a Zebra, more expensive up front but I have some that are 5+ years old that still work. Plus with free labels there's not really any cost with them. Just make sure you can feed labels from the back of the machine, the rolls ups gives are normally to big for a regular printer so you will have to keep it outside of the printer and feed into it. Or get the stack of labels and set it behind it. \n\nAnd you can change the printer settings from most places, on Amazon you can change it to thermal, along with paypal. If you use multi shipping you can select a thermal in the settings or if you do an individual label there's a drop down box in the top right of the screen before you print.

What you do is add each product and then when you are picking shipping you create a new shipping plan for (i think it's called like single or individual items).  Then just move on to your next item and click the drop down box to add it to the shipping plan you made.  Make sure when you're listing these items you click the circle that says \"I want Amazon to fulfill this order\" or whatever it says.  Then once you got them all listed you can print individual labels and add them to each item.  If you have very small items or ones that require special packing instructions i think it'll tell you and let you know what to do, I haven't had any of those yet.  Then when you have your labels printed it'll split your order up and tell you to send x items to one warehouse and x to another, and it'll make 2 shipping plans for you.

{"id":"ctc2e7r","author":"Alex-Gopson","body":"I would recommend against a lightbox.  Go to the dollar store.  Buy a white tri-fold poster board, and a larger white piece of glossy paper.  The paper is the base, the poster board stands up as your background.\n\nFor lighting you can get a setup for ~$50, check around Amazon.  Two \"umbrella lights\" will honestly give you an effect that is as good as a lightbox.\n\nThe reasons I prefer this to a lightbox:\n\n* Easier.  No need to start a craft project, you set your piece of paper down and stand your tri-fold poster up, and you're done.\n\n* Space effective.

Only difference is most of them can only be used at that specific store which makes them fairly useless unless you shop there *a lot* and they give a big discount. \n\nJust FYI;\n* Your Chase Amazon Card isn't really a \"store card\" as its a Visa, and you can use it anywhere. They're partnered with the Amazon \"store/website\", but you're not restricted to only using it at Amazon. \n* You're BoA Visa likely has a name, but it's not \"Visa Signature\", that's just the type of Visa card that it is. Visa's have different tiers, just like MasterCards have different tiers. You probably have a BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card. \n\nIf you don't use your Disney Card at all, I would recommend asking Chase if it can be downgraded to a Card with no Annual Fee (preferably the Freedom if possible). No point in paying $50/year on it unless your saving more than that by using it. \n\nYou don't have to have to sign up for a joint target credit card to save 5% at target. That's a hard pull for the credit card version. You could either get yourself a Target Prepaid REDCard, add money to it from your bank account and sign her up as a sub account. She would get her own card that's linked to yours (like and authorized user). You can buy them from people here for a small fee if they're not available in your local targets. Check the sidebar for more info. You could also just use your discover it card and buy target gift cards from Amazon until the end of September.

{"id":"ctcjd8x","author":"legotri","body":"Hey it appears you want to get your score up doing the right thing to buy a house, however at your stage in life financially you have much bigger problems than buying a house, and I don't think you can afford it, if you want to post more details about your financials maybe we can come to other conclusions, but this post is no longer anonymous so you may not want to.\n\nFirstly, based on these loans age, I would not pay them and let them fall off. You won't be ready to buy a house for a few years, let's get financially stable first, it's gonna take awhile to recoup all that you spent. I admire you for spending it, but it's going to suck rebuilding your finances.\n\nNext, focus on getting your credit cards paid down/off. You need to utilize less than 30% of your available credit to help your credit score, this means spend and fully pay off every month.\n\nSo let's get rid of the Amazon debt as soon as possible, and let's try to not slip into debt again, luckily this is 0 interest for a few more months it appears, so don't pay it off, but set aside the money in your checking account for paying it off when it comes due. Next, pay off your normal credit card and stop using it. Yes credit cards are easier, but let's follow Dave Ramsey (I don't like him, but I agree with him on this point), by using cash only you will spend less money, more to save. Only use the credit card when you have to.\n\nYour goal now should be to get your expenses down, I'm assuming you're no longer in Austin? If so, good, Austin is expensive. Take a look at the eventually house you want to live in. Run it through a mortgage calculator, then find what your monthly payment would be. Remember that equity takes 30 yrs to really build into a house, that's a long freaking time, and too long for most people, don't buy a home. But now you know what you're willing to spend. A home is an asset, but it's not liquid and if the market crashes you're screwed and possibly owing a lot of money, so not buying a home can mean you instead set aside more in a liquid investment account. I recommend vanguard or betterment.\n\nOkay so you're willing to spend x on housing, well next let's go find a place to rent that costs 2/3 of that, what about 1/2 of that?, maybe that's an apartment. There is nothing wrong with that because now you're saving money in liquid form. So as that money grows in investment accounts you can spend that on a home in the future and get a lower loan amount.\n\nThat just lowered your expenses by a lot of money I would imagine, next thing, start putting aside 15% of your income by \"paying yourself first\" this goes into vanguard or betterment as a Roth IRA, this is for your retirement.\n\nSo now after all this you should be successfully back on track of saving money, living below your means by spending cash only, and living in a smaller place than you'd like, but it's just temporary, until you get back on good financial footing.\n\n","name":"t1_ctcjd8x","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-22 22:26:54","week":30}

{"id":"ctckv9m","author":"Beers_For_Fears","body":"I'll refer you to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/3asyfa/large_compilation_of_amazon_review_sites/) for a full complete breakdown of the sites you can sign up for.  Keep in mind, if you don't have Amazon Prime this is probably not worth it for you because you will then have to pay shipping.  I am fairly new to this so I haven't necessarily gotten products from every site yet, but here is what I'm signed up for, in order of my favorite ones:\n\n\n* [AMZ Review Trader](http://amzreviewtrader.com/) - You can request up to 20 products at one time (number increases the more you do) but you have to be approved by the seller.  In the last week I have been approved for 4 products.  Supposedly, you have a better chance if you leave video/picture reviews. They have a lot AWESOME products that you can get for cheap if you take the time to look around.\n\n* [I Love to Review](https://www.ilovetoreview.com/) - This site is great because they will email you once a day with the product that's available for you that day, and you can choose if you want it.  They are almost always free, and I have gotten all 3 over the past 3 days.  Some stuff isn't great (pH strips), but they will have some cool things.\n\n* [SnagShout](https://snagshout.com/) - This site has pretty cool stuff also.  Most of it is not free, but there is a lot of good stuff in the $1 - $2 range.  With this site, you are guaranteed to get any product of your choosing, but you cannot get a second one until you leave the review on the first.\n\n* [Amazing Deals Group](http://amazingdealsgroup.com/) - This one has a very small selection of available products at a time, however they update daily.  Most of the products are free/cheap, and they occasionally have some pretty cool things.  The amount of products you can get depends on the amount of \"DealCoins\" you have, which I'm not sure how to increase.  Right now, I can have two products at a time.\n\n* [Giveaway Service](https://www.giveawayservice.com) - This one is a little bit unique.  There a lot of really great products for free,  but you have to request the product, and then usually the actual seller will be in contact with you to determine if you will get it.  Some products will require more than an Amazon review (such as twitter/instagram post, etc), but they will list that in the description.  I have not gotten anything from them yet, but am in discussion with a seller about getting a product.\n\n* [Etekcitizen](http://etekcitizen.com/) - This site requires approval to be accepted to the site.  I was accepted on my first try, but have heard it can be difficult.  With this website, you are allowed to choose 1 free product per month off of their website.\n\nThe good thing is the more free things you get to review, the more reviews you leave, and the easier it will become to get approved for products on AMZ Review Trader.  My end game would be to get requested to join Amazon Vine, but who knows what that selection process is like.\n\nHope this was useful!","name":"t1_ctckv9m","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-22 23:02:25","week":30}

{"id":"ctd7tyv","author":"fly_eagles_fly","body":"I got a free trial membership for beta testing back in May 2015. This was early on for them and the site was definitely in need of some help. Here's my thoughts:\n\nPricing -- this is the most important thing for everyone. I order a lot of items on Amazon. Last year, I spent over $10,000 on Amazon between ordering for family and friends and business purchases. I love Amazon and have been a big fan of there's. I use subscribe and save (20% off 5 items or more which is now 15%) and Prime Pantry. I compared prices as much as I could and found Jet was highly competitive with pricing and often times cheaper. It's also important to consider that unless you live in a few select states (NJ, KS and NV) you will likely not pay sales tax when ordering from Jet.com. This can be a significant savings depending on how much you order. You have the option to save by using a debit card (1.5% discount) or Visa/MasterCard (0.25%) on your order. You can also save by waiving your return on an item which varies based on the item. \n\nSmart Cart -- This is a feature I loved with Jet. As you add items to your cart, you get additional discounts because the item is labeled as a Smart Cart item. This is based on where it ships from and how far it is from your zip code. The more items you get, the more savings you get. It really does add up and lowers the cost of your items even more than the advertised price.\n\nWebsite -- Their website was lacking big time compared to Amazon, which I expected. The descriptions were poor and the searching was cumbersome at times. I found titles of items to be off which caused them not to show up when I searched for something. When searching, use shortened names so that you can get more results just to be sure the item isn't carried and just improperly labeled. I'm sure this will get better overtime. Share your feedback with them at: feedback@jet.com\n\nSize of Items -- One thing I really loved about Jet is that I could fill my basket with a random group of items. A bottle of ketchup, mustard, a jar of pickles, a few Pellegrinos, 8 rolls of paper towels, etc. This was great as I didn't always want to buy 6 jars of pickles and 48 rolls of paper towels like I did with Amazon. This is essentially like Prime Pantry only the pricing was much better than Pantry. \n\nShipping -- Shipping time is definitely slower than Amazon with Prime. Amazon is a shipping machine. They ship millions of items daily and they have the process down to a science. I don't expect Jet to ever come close to the consistency of Amazon's shipping. I don't order on Jet for shipping speed, I order because of pricing. I plan on keeping my Prime membership because I utilize a lot of the features that's included with that other than the 2 day shipping. If I need something quickly, I'll order it on Amazon. If I am in no rush, I'll check out Jet. You do need at least $35 in your cart for free shipping, but otherwise the speed has been decent. Most items arrived in 2-3 business days. Many of the items shipped via FedEx Home Delivery so delivery was Tuesday - Saturday (no deliveries on Sunday and Monday). Some items did come USPS as well.\n\nCustomer Service -- This will be the area that is going to make or break Jet, in my opinion. I communicated with their customer service numerous times and they were great. They were also in a trial period so didn't have nearly as many orders as they do now that they're live. It will remain to be seen how they handle the different issues customers have with non delivery and broken items. My experience with them has been great. They're fast to respond to e-mails (help@jet.com) and their available 24/7 by phone and e-mail! Phone hold times were very short, but again they're live now so I'm sure it's a bit busier than normal.\n\nOverall -- Jet.com offers  a lot of value for those who do a lot of online shopping. My time is valuable to me and if I can skip a trip to the store a few times a week it's helpful. It's a hassle to drive 15-20 minutes to the store, deal with everything in there, bring everything home, unload it. I have found items like 25 lbs of cat litter that was cheaper than what I pay in store. To have that shipped to my door is very valuable to me, especially at a cheaper price than what I was paying to get it myself. \n\nGive Jet.com a try.

I would love to see Amazon do something like this. I took advantage of the 15 % subscribe and save discount for 5 items in a month but ended up canceling them afterwards.

{"id":"ctdi0ms","author":"polishdan","body":"Sort of.\n\nYour credit score is figured by magical algorithms from the three big unions and each has their own way but here are the oversimplified essentials of how your credit score is figured (in order of importance) on your score:\n\n* on-time payment\n* credit to debt ratio (your credit limits combined minus how much of it you're using)\n* average length of credit line (i.e. how long your credit accounts have been open)\n\nSo let's say you take out a loan for $40,000 for school. Assuming no other credit accounts, in the beginning you are using all of your credit line so a 1:1 ratio which does not help your credit. But eventually, paying on-time each month, you're down to $10,000 left in debt. Your ration is now 4:1—much better. And because it took you some time to pay this much, your average length of credit lines is higher as is also helping boost your score. Once you finish paying off all that debt, the account (since this was a loan) closes which freezes your average length and also eliminates that great credit to debt ratio. But assuming you paid on-time every month, you have that going for you which is the top determining factor for your credit score. \n\nThis is where the logic behind your question comes from. In theory, your credit score is at its peak during the last quarter of this loan scenario because all three factors are working for you then. Is that worth paying all that interest in the mean time? Hell no, when you can build your credit without paying any interest by getting a credit card and paying off the full amount each month. \n\nI suggest: \n\n* Amazon or Gas Station cards\n\nThey don't require high scores and you can earn some points/gas in the process.\n\n* Starter Cards\n\nSmall limit (usually $500) targeted at high-school and college kids. The interest rate is ridiculous but as long as you pay it off every month, you're fine. Might have to have someone co-sign for you on some of them but avoid those. It shows up on your credit report that way so you're not building as much credit.\n\n* Bank-secured Cards\n\nOriginally created for people with wrecked credit, they're issued by your bank/credit union and are linked to your bank account so if you don't pay, they can take it from you directly. After a year or so, you can ask to upgrade to a non-secured card at which point you have a full-fledged credit card and a year history. Don't cancel it (remember average length of credit line) but you can start shopping around for a better card somewhere else.\n\nEDIT: Type-os","name":"t1_ctdi0ms","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-23 18:31:22","week":30}

I'm wondering if returns are rare for me because I don't offer returns. (Which would be a good thing...right? or...no?)\n\nDoes it seem like if you open a window for no-questions-asked type of returns that you get more returns than if you didn't offer returns? I'm sure you'd get at least some, but I guess I'm asking do you think you get a significant higher number of returns by offering them vs. not?\n\nAlso, in your opinion, is a track record of 3 out of 200 items returned (just money given back to buyer, item not returned to me  - still a \"return\" in eBay's book) good or not good? What's average for a seller who offers returns and a seller who does not offer returns?\n\nI would say I have not as much issue with chalking it up to attrition and the lost money (even though it stings a little bit - I get over it fast when I remember I only spent .25, .50, $1, whatever) as much as the hassle of it all. [\"Well, then don't sell on ebay if you don't want hassle!\" -- is what I imagine some of you are thinking. And you wouldn't be wrong.]\n\nIf I have to do a return, then of course I will do it and do it properly and professionally and move on because -- you are totally right -- it's not the end of the world. That's just how the ebay system works and the cost of doing business. But if I don't have to give a return...then...and I'm asking this because I'm genuinely curious as to how other flippers go about this....then why would I offer returns that are due to buyer error (changed mind, made a mistaken purchase, etc.?) Especially if the buyer can get a return through the system somehow anyway? How could offering returns cause me to expend less energy? It seems like I would expend more energy by offering returns, yes?...or no? \n\nI've been flipping for this long without returns, but I feel returns is an area in which I've kind of gotten \"frozen\" with. So I wanted to visit the issue and re-evaluate my stance. This isn't my main income and I can afford to lose out on sales because of not offering returns and wait for the long-tail sale. But I seem to be skating along ok....but that's just for now because as you said - I may not make it in this business for long due to my practices. It's a risk I'm definitely calculating. It's always good to have people tell you what may be a harsh truth to consider, and I really appreciate your feedback. \n\nI want to make an educated decision on how I go about returns in the future, and this sub seems like a great resource of experienced, knowledgeable folks to analyze this with.\n\nBut now you've got me thinking! I could just test the return thing for a couple of months and see what happens. Maybe returns aren't that bad to deal with. And I guess if my sales...let's say rose from 15 items a month to 20 items a month, then maybe...just maybe, depending on how any returns I get end up going...I would offer returns permanently. I know items get a higher best match search result if returns are offered.\n\nAs you can see, I am in no way, shape, or form ready for Amazon - the king of making returns an option (or so I've heard.)","name":"t1_ctdmnq3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-23 20:21:39","week":30}

Free snacks/meals/laundry service/gym memberships/whatever may exist on the main campus for any of these companies, but they do not exist at every site nor are they available to remote workers.  Yet those workers not on the main campus still report outstanding company culture.\n\n2.  Company culture isn't about employee perks.  It's about empowering employees to be creative and make a difference.  It's about respecting them as human beings and not as discrete revenue generation units.  If you really think that all of those campus freebies are the same thing as company culture then we're not even having the same conversation.","name":"t1_ctdnrdt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-23 20:47:22","week":30}

Company car is an easier thing to work with (but all those company culture benefits are the same).  A company car is given to employees because it's cheaper than giving a raise that would cover the cost of the employee buying a car themselves.\n\nAt Google, all those fringe benefits make it far easier to expect a lot more out of their employees.  It's hard to work that many hours without food at the office, etc.  Without the ability to get more hours out of their employees, they would need to hire more employees instead.  Which is more expensive than just buying food and drinks for the entire office and/or having a gym on site.\n\nAlso at some point paying paying your engineers more gets expensive very fast because whats another 5 grand when you make $200,000 already.

They don't need everything to work out, but they're taking fliers on a million-and-one opportunities. \n\nBased on your username, Amazon's not for you, but five years from now I think you'll feel silly.","name":"t1_cte6x0y","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-24 05:36:14","week":30}

It is a little known company called Fastenal. Fastenal is an industrial distributor, they literally sell nuts and bolts but have returned 32000% since 1989 (behind only UnitedHealthcare). \n\nAmazon will be the Fastenal (or more likely WW Granger) of our generation. That's where the real value is for the company over the long term. It's not this B2C stuff they have now - also where this sub is focused this conversation. It's B2B from everything from office supplies to industrial chemicals, to residential construction tools. \n\nThey have a much more disciplined supply chain and are very operationally efficient. They just need customers that can buy in bulk. If Amazon ever gets a sales force and goes after the distribution market it would likely be a huge player overnight.\n\nMRO distribution in NA alone is highly fragmented and is a ~250B market annually. Margins are very good too, FAST margins are ~40%. Would be a huge growth driver for the company. Current market is very afraid of Amazon as an entrant. \n\nAlready dipping its toe in with Amazon supply.\n\nAnother big growth driver will be IoT. Imagine networked devices in your home or offices. When detergent gets low in your washing machine Amazon ships you another package and bills you for it. No thoughts or choice for consumer. Creates incredible stickiness. Already doing this now with Amazon button. Imagine a petrochemical facility or a construction site running low on critical inputs (caustic soda or nails, etc.). Supplies sit on a scale, when the scale gets light, Amazon ships more supplies to the worksite. Just in time inventory keeps costs low for operators and ensures plant keeps open. It's the just in time aspect where Amazon dominates and as a tech company (not a true distributor) it is better positioned than all current market participants to take advantage of managed inventory / vending.\n\nWhen B2B happens in a material way, this company becomes a leader in a very large segment of the global economy. Global is key too. Most distributors are private, regional mom and pops. They have one large customer. They can't offer the selection and pricing that Amazon can from its global supply chain.\n\n...

Amazon is cheaper, and is easier to set up things like automatic scaling.  \n\nOpenstack itself is not the thing, I have 3 servers in my house running running a xen pool right now, but the raw cloud/virtualization infrastructure doesn't give me anything resembling either amazon or rackspace.\n\nAs for all of the others, google isn't really offering servers unless something has changed, they want the consumer end of that, which is nothing more than hard drives in another room.  The fact that its virtualized is irrelevant.  Microsoft is running hyper V, and last I checked only supports the windows OS, which is fucking useless in the server world (although potentially useful in a thin client application).  Oracle is making money off of selling support contracts for open stack (kind of the way Redhat does), not offering infrastructure directly.\n\nI don't know much about what qualcomm is doing, but last I heard they are mostly just selling processors.  IBM is going to be specific solutions, typically custom infrastructure for giant companies.  Cisco doesn't really do much in the virtualization world other than some contributions in virtual networking, although they are still the the 300lb gorilla in the room for networking.\n\nOn and on it goes, but amazon and rack space are really the only two you mentioned that are even close to comparable.\n\nAs for the valuation, its hard for me to say, but they are murdering competition in a lot of areas right now.

Thanks.\n\n&gt;&gt;Sorry, I'm traveling for my GF's mom's funeral so I haven't been online a lot lately. Yeah, there's a few. \n\n&gt;&gt;1. Either get a new email to use for sweepstakes, or be OK with getting a crapton of spam in yours. Gmail is really good about filtering it all out, but you still get a lot of email. A lot of sweepstakes require you to sign up for a newsletter type thing to enter, so you'll start getting a lot of email.\n\n&gt;&gt;2. I run a search on all my email every day, including the spam for the words \"winner\" and \"congratulations\", and search through the results quick, that way I don't miss any wins I got. I actually won the trip to the Super Bowl (my biggest win yet) because the person that won it first never responded to the email.\n\n&gt;&gt;3. There's a crap ton of ways to find contests to enter. There's sweeps sites, FB groups, etc. IF you look on /r/sweepstakes, you'll notice that most all of the links are referral links. The best odds that you'll have to enter and win a contest are by entering the daily entry contests every day, and by getting referral entries for the contests that have them. Not to say that you can't win the prizes from the single entry contests, I've won quite a few from them as well. It's just that most people don't have the time or remember to enter the dailies every day, so you up your chances then. I have a daily list that I run that's a google docs spreadsheet, if you'd like to see it, let me know. Full disclosure, there are referral links in some of the links on there - my friends all look at and use it as well.\n\n&gt;&gt;4.

Amazon grew sales 26% (+2.8bn) and grew operating income 113% (+374m to 703m). Wal-Mart US grew sales 3.5% (+2.3bn) but operating income declined 6.8% (-400m to 4600m).\n\nI'm not long or short Amazon, but the bull case is growth will continue at a rapid pace for 5-10 years (and it's impressive they can still grow this fast after so long), and that margins will normalise to a 5-6% level due to achieving greater scale efficiency.\n\n(or maybe it's the cool robotic warehouses)\n\nHaven't looked into this result in detail, but imagine the stock is also jumping due to the acceleration in the sales growth rate.

{"id":"ctek041","author":"johnnysreddit","body":"In short, AWS has always been a black box, which allowed for very divergent bull/bear narratives.\n\nAmazon's bull story has always been that Amazon, Inc. is really 1,000 totally unrelated (well, mostly unrelated) businesses, each wildly different profitability levels and growth rates. And that, because these are all combined in the reports, all you see is a massive blob of non-descript revenue generating little aggregate profit.\n\nThe bear story is that this is a convenient cover story and there is no real evidence of profitability, only evidence of revenue growth at no (or negative) margin.\n\nAmazon's decision to break out AWS has been a very big part (probably) of the performance this year. It turns out, to the surprise of a lot of people (not just financial types, but tech types) that AWS is actually a very impressive standalone business. And since it is now broken out, there is now a discussion about how much AWS would be valued at if it were separated from the retail business.\n\nSo now, not only does Amazon now have a broken out AWS that just begs to be valued as a standalone, but now the notion that Amazon is being unscrupulously or foolishly managed has been sort of dealt a pretty serious blow, and we are now left to wonder how many other profitable businesses are being hidden in the consolidation, buried under Prime shipping costs or something.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is more speculative, but I can speak from personal experience: There are certain aspects of Amazon's consumer-oriented business that are so pathetic and lame that I think I inappropriately considered the entire company to be afflicted by some generic incompetence that made it a Bad Investment.\n\nSpecifically, Amazon's product recommendation algorithms are just ridiculously bad, and the entire Fire phone project was an embarrassing trail of bad decisions, all the way up to the launch (the launch is the point where everybody should have recognized the product was terrible, and they should have released it quietly, instead of doing a 3 hour Jobsian launch).\n\nSince the Fire phone thing happened last year, I think that there was probably a lot of qualitative dismissiveness about Jeff's leadership and Amazon's strategy.

That said, there are also plenty of car share services in the area I could have easily used. \n\nUber and Lyft are definitely helpful for nighttime social gatherings, but I probably spend less than $50 a month on those. \n\nBefore selling my car, I wish I had sold it sooner. It basically sat parked for a year because I never used it anyway. \n\nIt doesn't rain much here, but when it does, I usually take the bus. Again, this is highly dependent on where you live.\n\nMy commute is about 2 miles. I always carry my bike lock. I used to carry a small pump, but I never used it. If you're only travelling 3 miles at a time, you likely wont run into any emergency maintenance situations, and if you do, you won't be too far from your destination anyway.

When Google went public its PE was 300x.\n\nEdit: I'm going to outline why a company like AMZN could be a good investment\n\n1. In 4 years (when growth is expected to be slower), AMZN could eventually achieve Walmart-like EBIT margin of 6% (slightly higher than WMT's EBIT margin of 5.5%, but in-line with historicals of other retailers such as Tesco Plc. This is a  completely reasonable assumption given that AMZN has less infra cost + larger proportion of its revenue comes from things like AWS and streaming)\n\n2. Revenue growth - AMZN's top line has been growing at 23% CAGR since 2011. Assuming it can grow at 18% CAGR in the next 4 years, AMZN's top line will be $175bn in 2018. From 1, AMZN's EBIT is reasonably projected to be $10.5bn in FY2018\n\n3. Using 10% discount rate (i'm being pretty generous - risk free rate for 5-year treasury is 1.1%, Equity Risk Premium is 6% and AMZN's beta is only 0.84 - the discount rate of 8% would be more appropriate), AMZN's market cap in 2018 is expected to be $315bn, implying 2018E EV/EBIT of 30x\n\n4. 30x EV/EBIT for a company growing top line at 15%+ YoY is still rich, it could be argued that investors will pay for this multiple given the upside opportunities AMZN has.\n\nHaving said that, AMZN could fuck up the execution and lose market share the moment it tries to recover its margin.","name":"t1_ctertwo","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-07-24 19:15:31","week":30}

For a long time the sub was more anything goes but there were objections to the low quality posts crowding out more informative posts and suspicion of gaming votes. \n\nYou can see the source of issue by sorting out top posts for just this sub over the past 24 hours. Basically not enough people vote. The top posts include some with all of net 3 votes. Despite the low number of votes those posts will be seen by over 15000 people and clicked by some significant proportion of them.

The rule about self posts and the karma limit to post help include people actually interested in participating while discouraging people who want to drop links and leave. The Karma limit further helps people get involved before they post. Including limits on 'technically a self post but really just a link' posts reduces people who want to just game the system.

Ford could essentially only grow revenue as more people became able to afford their vehicles, or by reducing costs/prices so that more people could afford them (which they did). What reason did Ford have to invest in increasing production if they simply couldn't sell more vehicles? That would be wasteful. So, Ford grew at a rate that the market could sustain, and as it happened that left plenty of profit left over early on. Amazon is not even close to tapping the entire retail market. The limiting factor in Amazon's growth is just how fast they are able to continue building the infrastructure to handle the increasing volume and maintain their quality of service. Amazon *has* to spend every available dollar to achieve this. If they were to slow investment now and start showing real profits, *that* would be wasteful. Amazon has zero reason to show a profit until the day comes that continued infrastructure spending is no longer justified. \n\nIn addition, things are just different today as compared to prior eras. Word travels faster, advertising reaches more people, money moves faster. If you can't grow fast enough to keep up with potential sales, you're leaving money on the table.

[Using TTM data here, only up to quarter ending 3/31/15] With a market cap of $225B, OCF of $7.8B, and Equity of $10.8B, you have a P/OCF of 28.7x. High, but not offensive. And then an OCF/Equity of 72%, which is incredible. But that's the simplest way of justifying their current valuation. \n\nNow, were you use a simple FCF measure of OCF ($7.8B) - CapEx ($4.6B)  = $3.2B, then we get P/FCF  = 70x (clearly very, uh, expensive) and FCF/Equity = 29.6%, which is much more realistic given the industry, and still fine.\n\nBut let's think about this for a moment: OCF backs out changes in working capital, which is a direct function of growth. To best measure WC management is the cash conversion cycle, which while it's been increasing over the past several years, has always been negative, meaning its suppliers are basically funding its working capital needs. That's a huge positive. So we can safely conclude that we don't need to account for working capital changes, since it's being managed very effectively. \n\nLooking at the cashflow statement, AMZN routinely makes acquisitions as well. Over the past 10 years, 4 of those years they have been under $100M, while the remaining ones have ranged from $350M  (2010) to $1345 (TTM). So acquisitions, along with capex, are a real cost of doing business for AMZN.\n\nLet's also accept the fact that stock-based compensation is an actual cost as well, and shouldn't be added back into the OCF calculation. So as far as measuring FCF for AMZN, we can define it as Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization - Special non- Cash charges - (CapEx + Acquisitions). Basically Buffett's Owner Earnings.\n\nAnd for that number, it's -$1,273 for TMM. In fact, it hasn't been positive since 2010. Without suppliers funding the company (indicated by the negative working capital, DELL had a similar set up back in the day, and iirc so does APPL currently), there's no cashflow, it has nothing to do with \"investments.\" \n\n\n&gt; but he doesn't right now so why slow growth if the revenue is more than he can invest in good R&amp;D?\n\nAMZN isn't a newly public company, it was founded in 1994! It's over 2 decades old. This isn't a start up, no matter how much Bezos wants you to believe it.

But what is the validity of that number? The company reported FCF of $4.6b, a four fold increase from this point last year. Their internal formula is very simple - CFO minus purchases of PP&amp;E. This is also the figure they use to calculate ROIC.\n\nSounds great, but what about all of the operating leases?\n\nFCF minus lease principal repayments = $2.4b.\n\nFCF minus lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases = -492m!\n\nSo which is the correct metric to use? I'm going with the last one. Why? Because when you calculate CFO, you add back depreciation  - including capital lease depreciation.(CFA L1 stuff). So if CFO is juiced by capital lease depreciation, it would be impaired by capital lease expenditures. \n\nEveryone points to the AWS margins but I actually have no idea how profitable this business is due to how capital intensive it is, but all of the capital is being left off the balance sheet. If we capitalize 2016 lease obligations of $2b at 3x thats $6b of capital. Operating leases of $775m can be capitalized at 8x since that is probably the longer lived fulfillment centers. So that's another $5b in capital. Current assets and liabilities basically equal each other so there's no net cash. $12b in equity and $8.5b in debt and I'm assuming something like $32b invested capital. \n\nUsing the same calculation method through June 2013 we get $15b invested capital - so today's capital base is basically double what it was two years ago. Equity is 35% higher over the same period and none of it is from retained earnings but instead paid-in capital.\n\nSo to my point, beyond issuing debt and equity, I'm not sure what AMZN does.

Suppliers find it extremely difficult to back out simply due to the sheer volume of demand Amazon has access to. \n\nI didn't deny that. In fact, given I stated how well their managing working capital, it should be implied that I'd agree with this.\n\n&gt; 2.Employee stock compensation doesn't impact cash flow. \n\nLOL. [They are a real cost of doing business. Why else would GAAP require them to be expensed? Thus they do impact profitability.](http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052748704509304578515082253371720) \n\n&gt; Even if Amazon isn't \"truly profitable\"\n\nThen what is the fucking point of all this? They're barely even sitting on net cash per share: $15B cash in equivalents, $8.2B LT debt, $225B market cap. This isn't one of Graham's net-nets. \n\n&gt; 3.Its doesn't make sense to value a company spending all its earnings on its current earnings. \n\nIf it's a start up? Sure. If the company is over 2 decades old? Then you probably should.\n\n&gt; Just to quote the Dear Leader “When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.”\n\nCongrats, dear leader took an intro to finance 1000 class.\n\n&gt; But I find it hard to argue that Amazon couldn't in principle be profitable.\n\nThis isn't a philosophical, subjective argument. You're doing mental gymnastics to justify the unprofitability of a 21 year old company that continues to spend on \"growth\" rather than return some cash to shareholders.\n\n&gt; I also find it hard to argue that Amazon is headed for a liquidity crash anytime soon.\n\nThis is how I know you're clueless, because I never once made any criticism whatsoever about financial concerns. The fact that I complimented their working capital management should obviously infer that I don't view there to be any liquidity issues, but I don't think you understand what working capital even is.","name":"t1_ctf0knn","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-24 22:50:25","week":30}

{"id":"ctf6qha","author":"RTiger","body":"Thanks for the replies. I'll address them all in one batch. For those that feel compelled to give me advice, I sell naked all the time, and leg in all the time. Most of the time it works, but sometimes high probability trades blow up.\n\nYes, risky. I think I was emboldened after my selling of GPRO strangles before earnings worked so well. Sometimes the market has to teach people a lesson. It was my turn today. I'm sure many other premium sellers got blown out of the water on AMZN, either before or after the news, but haven't reported it publicly. \n\nWhen markets move fast, it makes it that much harder to get in or out of positions, and spread orders can be twice as hard. If a person is unwilling to take the max loss on a spread and is forced out on a spread, taking market fills on both ends of a fast moving market can make my bad trade look like a spring picnic.\n\nAs for details, I sold the 540 puts for 50 cents when AMZN was at 567 and the 590 calls for 32 cents @559. The calls expired for a win, but the losing leg was covered at $3.65 @539. So no, it was not close to break even, with 82 cents of credit against $3.65 to cover. I wasn't too concerned about buying power, because it was a one day trade. It was going to work, and I'd get my buying power back, or I was going to get out. AMZN closed at $529.42, so had I held on until the last minute of trading, covering might have cost $10+, perhaps a full $11 with a market order to avoid assignment.\n\nSpreads have their own problems. I believe that in this case, most of the common spreads would have made the out come worse not better. It would have added another level of bid/ask spreads and commissions and not offered any real protection against what happened. The loss on my trade was less than $3 per unit. A three dollar wide spread on AMZN in a fast moving market is unlikely to be worth doing for retail traders. Someone did one $2.50 wide before earnings, but that was during a calm market time. Ten dollar wide, sometimes more, is common on a $500+ underlying, so max loss $10, plus another level of commissions and bid/ask friction.\n\nUnless a person is willing to take a max loss on the spread getting out in a fast market on expiration day is like walking through a mine field. Using spreads vs. selling naked, can help in case of a big gap, but the news was out and today was expiration day. I rightly thought the gaps were over. Unfortunately it was a trending move down during the last couple of hours. Trending moves are the enemy of most premium sellers.","name":"t1_ctf6qha","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-07-25 01:46:59","week":30}

{"id":"ctfg1kc","author":"joatmon-snoo","body":"While I'd like to agree with you, the facts of OP's circumstance are far from suggesting what you're saying (which could very well be true for all I know). Essentially, what's happening here isn't Apple being litigation-happy, but rather, Apple doing CYA litigation.\n\nFor the record, I'm not defending Amazon, Apple, or the underlying laws, but simply painting a fuller picture so people who see this understand what's going on (and also why you're *really, really* wrong to use \"patent\" here, because patents and trademarks are two incredibly different things):\n\nUnder current US law, trademarks have a rather wide, expansive [definition](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Trademark), *see* [15 U.S.C. § 1127](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1127):\n\n&gt; A trademark is any word, name, symbol, or design, or any combination thereof, used in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from those of another and to indicate the source of the goods.\n\nAnd historically, courts have been rather permissive in establishing what constitutes trademarks. There's one particularly well-known case involving Louboutin heels, iirc, in which Loubotin sued another heel-maker *for using the same shade of red* on the soles of a competing line of heels, and won. The reason is that trademarks are designed to protect an owner's rights to the *distinctive* features of a product: for instance, the circular button on Apple phones, the color scheme of DeWalt/Ryobi/Black&amp;Decker tools, and in this case, the physical shape of Beats headphones.\n\nDoes it seem a little unreasonable? Yes, certainly, and you wouldn't be the first to disagree: there are *mountains* of legal academic work debating whether the current IP regime is better than the alternatives. The fact, though, stands as is: trademarks are designed to protect the owner's rights to distinguishing features, perhaps to an excessively overzealous extent.\n\nA second factor now comes into play: the notion of trademark *dilution*. Essentially, this is the legal concept that if you *don't* go after someone who infringes on your trademark, then because someone else has a feature which resembles that which you've trademarked, your trademarked feature is no longer as distinctive as it previously was. The result is that your trademark is considered *diluted*, and the only way to *prevent* this is to file against anyone and everyone who releases a product with a feature similar to one you've trademarked.\n\nThis is a *very* onerous burden: it means that a trademark holder has to be constantly on the lookout for something you can argue dilutes the trademark, or when the time comes for him to sue someone who's actually *seriously* infringing his trademark, his case falls apart because he didn't go after every little guy who had something close to resembling his trademark.\n\nIn the case of Beats - to many an audiophile's disgust - the product's success is premised on two things: the marketing, and physical design of the product itself. It's ridiculously obvious that the [product in question here](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTN-mrHzJ3CZy2sqqx7cYKDHdFG2FPnh77scWoX1Dv9UiooRJ-VuAJ3GUjKMekuXArxlGA-4zY&amp;usqp=CAE) is modeled *extraordinarily* closely after the design of [Beats headphones](http://www.howtocreate-music.com/howtocreate/images/beats%20by%20dre%20wireless.jpg), from the design transition of the headband to the over-ears, the placement of the expansion straps, the circular inlays, and even the coloring scheme of the headphones themselves.\n\nIt isn't a question of whether or not your headphones can be *mistaken* for Beats headphones. It's a question of whether their existence in the marketplace makes Beats headphones less distinctive, and for better or for worse, they quite obviously *do*.\n\nAnd if makes you feel any better, I *guarantee* that everyone else you see selling these has received a similar, if not identical demand from Apple's lawyers. Most of them, however, probably have lawyers on speed dial who know how to play hardball and actually challenge the demand they've gotten. It's very easy for lawyers to write a letter [exaggerating the circumstances](http://www.newyorkpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/2014/04/shooting-the-messenger-ive-been-sued-again.html) and argue for incredibly ridiculous relief, but the first route that people take when they get stuff like this in the mail isn't \"am I actually in the wrong?\" but rather \"HOLY FUCK APPLE LAWYERS ON MY ASS PANIC MODE PANIC MODE PANIC MODE.\" I'd honestly be rather surprised if Apple's action against you is actually actionable, but pulling the item rather than dealing with the fiasco will probably be easier.\n\nAnd, to conclude, IANAL: I'm simply a guy who happens to have read a lot of stuff about this and wanted to clear up some very obvious misconceptions here.","name":"t1_ctfg1kc","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-25 07:21:25","week":30}

Do you believe that accounting for the depreciation of assets accurately aligns revenue with expenses? It's not a penalty, it's an *educated guess*. But, as it turns out, it's hard to estimate the contribution to revenue certain types of assets will generate. If it were easy, there would be no risk and everyone would do it.

And Walmart today? 0%. What you see is what you get with WMT, and your valuation metrics work. Amazon is doing amazing things at their size.

The point of my posting the story is so that others might learn something, and perhaps I might learn something too.\n\nThe other part of the math is that it is a one day trade. If the trade was available every trading day, which it isn't because every day isn't expiration day, back of the envelope has it compounding to something like 250% per year on max regular margin and maybe 600% on max portfolio margin. \n\nThose potential returns are on a 90% to 95% probability trade. 90% on IV, more like 95% on historically realized vol. So even after the loss, I kind of like the math, even if it blew up in my face this time. To get those big annual returns, the trades would all have to be winners at max margin (which no one would do, but it gives an idea of the potential).\n\nThose wanting to buy those cheapo long shot options probably aren't understanding what they are saying or understanding how low the probabilities are for the options I sold. \n\nIt took an almost perfect storm to sink my ship. Even so, it was basically a $3 loss on a $500+ underlying.

Just using the card without trying every month, it is always an easy at least $15 for things i would of spent money on anyways.\n\nDon't think you will have too much trouble getting either card. Amex does have good customer support and people prefer them for electronic purchases and extended warranty things.\n\nI think a big thing to consider is at $150 a month, the Sallie Mae Mastercard will get better returns. \n\n[Here is a link from a similar topic in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2e7efa/i_made_a_graph_comparing_blue_cash_everyday_blue/)\n\n\nAlso consider that for Sallie Mae many Walmart and Target stores count in the 5%, whereas they definitely do not for Amex. Also although you don't spend on Gas, any purchases from a gas station or 7-eleven counts toward the 5%, so there is a possibility for some money to be returned there. And If you don't have another card offering 5% cash back on Amazon then that is definitely a consideration to always have the option of 5% on Amazon, vs. waiting on Categories.\n\nIts been the easiest card I have had to redeem and use for rewards, it is a card that i will definitely always be using.

You have no way of predicting that.\n\nRunning a short is basically saying you think it will go down soon. If it goes sideway you get slowly burned by your borrowing costs. If it goes up you have to clench your teeth and hope it doesn't force you out of your position.

I figured it was going to jump and I even told my wife, if this thing actually turns a profit the market will go nuts.  Sure enough it did, only to have the MM's and large option holders walk that baby down all day Friday.  \n\nOddly enough, I owned AMZN back in the 2000's at like $14 per share.  Yeah, $14 per share.

You don't need to have anything to do with Sallie Mae to get the card - it's issued by Barclays and just has the Saliie Mae logo.  Points can be redeemed for a simple statement credit (lowers your bill).\n\nIf you have average credit (600's), I recommend you apply for Student cards.  The Capital One [Journey](http://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/journey-student/) and [Discover IT](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/student/discoverit.html?ICMPGN=STL_CC_STUD_CHROME_SEE_STUD_IT) are pretty good.\n\nIf you have even worse credit, I recommend that if you have a bank account, you should go to your local bank (or credit union) branch and ask them if they've got anything for you.\n\nIf you're denied for those, a final option is Secured cards.

{"id":"ctgl1kz","author":"nath_leigh","body":"Self Driving Electric Cars will work 24/7, every day of the year with no breaks, holidays, sick days, lateness, distractions, tiredness, hangovers, complaints, strikes, wage rises, overtime pay, training or retraining, compensation, insurance, severance pay, contract negotiations, bonuses, maternity leave, law suits, require pensions and only demand a ‘salary' equal to the cost of energy. Machines will always follow procedure eliminating human error and bias, be reliable, consistent, won't procrastinate, talk back or unionise, they behave rationally without emotion, they won't commit occupational fraud or harassment to customers.\n\nVehicles transporting goods wouldn't need heat or air conditioning, saving on energy, vehicles in general will have more free space for extra stock or passengers as driver space is not required. The car is becoming a computer technology, it can be easily improved with new software updates, the on-board computers and sensors will continually become cheaper, more powerful, energy efficient and smarter allowing a much safer transportation experience and increasing the rate of adoption over time.\n\nThe general public may be slow to adopt but businesses and startups will utilise autonomous vehicles instantly as they will see the potential to out-compete rivals and increase profits by being able to deliver items and people safely at much lower costs. The robot capital may be expensive at first but should eventually pay off if the cost of employing a human is higher than a machine or software bot, over time. Uber is already experimenting transporting goods to people with Cornerstore, a delivery service to compete with Amazon and Google Express. With Uber's almost $50bn valuation stock holders will be expecting Uber to grow so it will have to enter every sector of the transport industry, it will aim to revolutionise the transportation of everything, not just people, and with it's $10bn funding Uber has the resources to create the fleets of self driving cars needed to do so.\n\nThis modernisation process is inevitable because company shareholders will look at ways to maximise profits and out compete rival businesses, any opportunity to get an advantage will be capitalised upon. It is in the interest of every company to employ a minimum number of workers, pay them a minimum salary and have the highest productivity. Companies which don’t adapt and stay relevant and persevere with the old way will be left behind. Just like Kodak or Blockbuster, no company wants to make those same mistakes and remain stagnant and let other businesses pounce on the new models and technology and let other customers choose their better cheaper and more convenient services. The pressure and competition from 1 car company utilising self driving cars will push other companies to make these cost cutting decisions, especially with minimum wage increases. They adapt or face obsolescence.\n\nUber recently poached 40 of the best scientific minds working at Carnegie Mellon's National Robotics Engineering Center, the vision of it'e CEO who publicly expressed his desire to do so. If Tesla can build a fully-autonomous car by 2020, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick says his company would buy it. In fact, he'd buy every one Tesla builds. Google predicts that by 2020, self-driving cars will be ubiquitous. As of CES 2015, predictions for an on-sale self-driving car are on the order of two to five years away, or 2017 to 2020. \n\nPeople see this and think about taxi drivers or truck drivers being disrupted but one major occupation is often neglected, which is retail staff, especially if they are combined with other new advancing technology such as automated warehouses, drones and 3D printing. This will allow products to be delivered to wherever you want, whenever you want and much quicker and cheaper than currently possible, creating a new level of convenience that some brick and mortar stores may struggle to compete with. The 4 possible scenario's in the article will show how self driving cars and a few other new technological innovations can disrupt physical retail sales.","name":"t1_ctgl1kz","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-07-26 13:29:18","week":30}
{"id":"ctgl6xu","author":"nath_leigh","body":"Currently it's difficult for delivery firms to find drivers to work inconvenient, unsociable hours hours or days and it may be also difficult for the warehouse to get workers to pick the items and stock them into trucks. Both of these tasks, delivering and picking objects, will soon become fully automated, the machines will happily work day and night, allowing packages to be delivered on demand when it's convenient for the customer.\n\ne.g. An item is ordered to be delivered at 8pm on Sunday, a Kiva robot delivers the shelf to a robot picker which grabs the item and puts it on an automated conveyor belt where its gets packaged by a Baxter robot and then placed into a self driving \"vending machine\" van. The custom delivery van autonomously drives to outside your front door. You receive a notification that it's arrived and go out to the car, you enter a pin code on the van or some other form of self service authentication and your parcel appears for you to collect. All with minimal, if no, human involvement.\n\nAn automated warehouse doesn't need prime location retail estate so has less rent, doesn't need to be lit up, heated or cooled, dosent need toilet or staffroom facilities which take up space so cheaper bills and more room for stock. In a structured warehouse, stock doesn't need to be displayed for customers so can be stored efficiently, it doesn't need to constantly move from backroom to front of store and staff are not needed to face up items. Soon robots will be capable of stacking shelves with the items that are delivered from manufacturers on to shelves automatically.\n\nOnline items tend to already be cheaper and the trend may increase as the cost savings mentioned above will allow the online store to undercut the brick and mortar store in sale prices of items. Higher convenience for customers, better tech to try and look at goods before you buy and cheaper items will increase online sales.\n\nThe \"ice cream van\" can now become automated and other products could start to be sold in a similar model as running cost's become cheaper. Picture self driving mobile vending machines as described earlier, driving around stocked full of the most common bought goods, nipping to the shop for some bread, milk, beer etc. could become a thing of the past as corner shops become mobile.\n\nIf the mobile convenience store doesn't have the item then it could get to you from the warehouse. Self driving cars and automated warehouses will deliver items to you within the hour (e.g. Amazon Prime Now) much cheaper than today because a driver and warehouse staff wages won't be needed. But maybe 1 hour is not fast enough for you, luckily you will soon be able to get ordered items incredibly quickly by flying to your location. Amazon are aiming to use drones to get items to you in less than 30 mins and they may be available within the year.\n\nThe high street will be at your front door, no travelling to shops, having to find the item, avoid people, queue, carry it back home and other inconveniences. Most goods are cheaper online, the only thing holding online shopping back today is the long wait for goods and inconvenient delivery times which looks to be eliminated soon. Brick and mortar will have stiff competition with this level of convenience as the virtual shop becomes far superior to the physical shopping experience.","name":"t1_ctgl6xu","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-07-26 13:39:46","week":30}

I adore the 2 day shipping on everything.\n\nJet just seems kind of pointless and stupid and irritating at the moment and, as nofishies said it's cheaper than Amazon on stuff you never buy.\n\nI just went through the last 5 things I bought at amazon:\n\n1) Foam master pogo stick. Is $40 at amazon and $65 at jet. Jet's link brings to Amazon, but to a shitty listing on amazon for the same product; the proper link at amazon with prime is $40. *Point amazon*\n\n2) Nerf darts, 12 pk. $4.37 at amazon as add-on item.

I never would have bought Vizio - I figured Sharp or Samsung or Sony would be far better.

My work's videoconferencing expert also buys Vizios, which was a surprise to me. Failure rate is ~ 10% which he says is economical vs other brands slightly lower failure rate.\n\nDesktops - I really thought stepping up for a good business class machine would make sense. Then I had many people get bottom of the barrel Dells, eMachines, white box whatever, and have them last 4-6 years. They spent $300 vs $600 for a business machine, and a business desktop is unlikely to last 8-12 years to even break even. Failure rates are somewhat higher, but again, it averages to roughly $400 covering failure vs $650 or so on the business machines (based on my memory and guesstimates, I'm not sure if I can really work out the self insurance cost).\n\nWhere brand matters IMO is the functionality out of the box.

{"id":"ctgzod7","author":"Imaginos64","body":"Hey there...I came on this sub to post a rant of my own but then I saw your post.\n\nAbout a week ago I was prompted to verify my information on Amazon Payments. I did so but I got an email stating that they couldn't verify me so my account was restricted. I'm unable to use Mturk or transfer my money out of there as well.\n\nNow would be a good time to add that I had an issue with verifying my info on Mturk itself about a year ago and my account was locked. I emailed Amazon and they told me to fax them a pic of my social security card and photo ID. I did so and my account was promptly unlocked, no big deal. I expected this would be the same thing but apparently no, this is the battle from freakin' hell. I don't know what the problem is; I'm 23, in the USA, have obviously filed taxes before, and have lived at the same address for four years.\n\nI emailed Amazon, politely asking what I needed to send them to verify my information. I got what sounded like a form letter back the next day stating that my account was suspended and there was nothing they could do. I sent them a couple more emails telling them I would send them my info, do whatever they needed me to do, etc but those were ignored. On Friday I called Amazon customer service. I got a really nice lady who said this is a common problem. She sent a message to Amazon Payments asking them to look into my account and email me with a solution. She also mentioned that in the mean time I could request a check from Mturk to get my money.\n\nNow today is Sunday and I haven't heard jack shit from Amazon. I just sent them another email reiterating the same information but adding that I would be in continued contact until the problem was resolved. I also attached a picture of the tax information page of my Mturk account that states my name, the last 4 digits of my social, and the word VERIFIED. I wrote that it was absurd that they could verify me on Mturk and not Amazon Payments.\n\nSo I wish I had some magical solution to give you but I'm in the same boat. I'm serious about pursuing this and I refuse to let them put me off. I guess I'll keep bugging them via phone/email and as others have suggested, start flooding their fax line with my proof of ID. It's sad that they can't just tell me what they need me to do.\n\nI've never had a bad experience with Amazon before so I'm honestly shocked at how badly they're treating us.

{"id":"cth07b6","author":"flipofthewrists","body":"I mean I know there are perks for having an Ebay store. Usually the shipping isn't cheaper but they use less fees which ends up being cheaper if you sell a fair amount consistently. \n\nMost of the time USPS will be the cheapest unless you have to ship priority from the east coast to the west coast in which case I think FedEx usually edges out. Also large items tend to be cheaper through UPS or FedEx. The discounts Ebay provides will be the best you fine. \n\nIf you have new items you might want to check out Amazon FBA. They can provide steep discounts if you ship a lot of items in a couple of packages to their warehouse.

{"id":"cth0mm1","author":"unclefire","body":"Charts 1 and 3 seem to contradict each other.  Am I missing something?  \n\nChart 1 says buying straddles for earnings generally is a losing proposition.  Intuitively, that makes sense to me b/c many stocks don't move all that much in earnings unless they have blowout earnings/guidance and/or are high flyer/volatile deals like NFLX, AMZN etc. have been lately.  Even AAPL use to move a bunch before the split, doesn't seem to move around as much since (yeah, I know had a 10ish percent drop last week, but recovered about 1/2 of that since).   To be a winner on the straddles you have to move beyond what are already probably high IV options.   How often is that going to happen on many of the value and even some growth stocks in SP500?\n\nSo buying straddles generally loses, how is it chart 3 shows selling straddles is also a loser (more often too)?   That would suggest that the stocks are moving way more than the straddle would imply and contradicts chart 1.  \n\nchart2-- are you selling or buying mid?\n\nLastly you assuming a close day after earnings.   That could make a different too on performance (in some cases you have to b/c it's a friday)","name":"t1_cth0mm1","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-07-26 22:50:31","week":30}

Amazon gets a special ups rate for FBA sellers, so you'll want to get some larger boxes and use UPS for shipping to FBA.

{"id":"cth1z7j","author":"Jakarda","body":"Long options can be extremely profitable because you aren't capping your gains. Think of it this way though: If you are long a call right at the money that expires in say a month you need the price of the underlying stock to appreciate to make any profit. If it stays flat, you lose on the time value. If it moves down, you lose on the intrinsic and the time value. So you're setting yourself up with a 33% chance right of the bat. \n\nNow thats not saying they never work. I've had a lot of success buying calls prior to earnings for companies that typically have earnings gap ups more than 1 standard deviation. Examples: GOOGL, NFLX, AMZN, CMG. Obviously the premiums are extremely high even out of the money on some of these but thats the risk you take. Other option if you wanted to go long in earnings anticipation is just go long a straddle or a strangle on a volatile, highly traded company. Your break-even will be further from the underlying price but you'd be just looking for a big move up or down.
