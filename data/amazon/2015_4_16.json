inexperienced seller and got my Amazon account suspended because of my ODR. I have been doing great on Ebay but would like to expand again to Amazon.\n\nI am creating a new Amazon account with my same name and using an EIN instead of my social security number.

My partner and I recently broke up and I now owe him $500\/month to buy him out of the house, so I suddenly need an actual budget instead of just buying whatever I want. If you've ever made a non-monthly budget, how did you do it? \n\nExamples that cover most of my important expenses:\n*Income: I'm paid bi-weekly, so even though I make ~$1900\/month, most months I get $1600. (I'm a grad student)\n*Car insurance: ~$550 July and January\n*Bus pass, parking: $50 and $120, paid in Sept. and January. The parking is a luxury, but saves money on parking tickets\n*Repairing stuff. Buying my computer a new hard drive, fixing my bike, attempting to get my car fixed (it's still on the fritz) \n*Traveling and visiting my family. \n*The university and universe randomly charging me fees. DMCA violation, late fees for stuff I thought would come out of my paycheck, etc. \n*House (bills, taxes): Other than the debt to my ex, my house is financially self-sufficient due to friends living with me. $0\n*Fixing up my house. It really needs it, and if something breaks I have to be able to repair it asap. But I'm letting things slide for now.\n*Food. I'm not sure how to balance groceries, eating out, and money I put in my account to buy food on campus. Clearly they depend on each other, but I still want them separate.\n*Household goods\/Amazon. \n*Roller derby. Dues, equipment, people generally expecting my to buy things on the assumption that I have a middle-class salary. \n\nOn average I've spent 1000\/month for the past 6 months, but the amount each month varies wildly. I want to budget appropriately for visiting my family, getting a dog, re-building my emergency fund (which I spent to buy out my ex from the house), and other fun stuff like getting a kayak. Eventually I will need to budget for another car, though I don't plan to replace mine immediately when it breaks down. \n\nWhat's the best way for me to manage all this?\n","16":"I already have a Prime membership, and I spend about $3000 a year at Amazon.\n\nI looked up the bank, Synchrony, and it has terrible reviews, but so do Bank of America and Chase...

I've seen a few others ask questions, so I figured I would post this to hash it out.\n\nRewards are as follows: 5% cashback on up to $250 gas, $250 in groceries, and $750 at bookstores. That is $250 EACH for gas and groceries, so you can earn up to $25 cashback for both categories combined per month at the 5% rate. After that, it's 1%, which is still better than nothing.\n\nItems fulfilled by Amazon counts as a bookstore. I've done this personally. As long as the transaction shows up as Amazon, you'll get 5% back on it. This includes gift cards (for just about every major retailer) purchased from Amazon too. So if you're looking to boost your rewards by purchasing at Amazon, you can do it on that part of the rewards for a total of $37.50 cashback per month from that category.","29":"Happy Monday Y'all,\n\nSome exciting news that happened over the weekend incase anyone missed out on it. Here's a recap:\n\n**China\u2019s Internet Attacks** The country gets hit with some more (probably deserved) bad publicity as the world learns more about China\u2019s attempts to censor the internet. According to a report from Citizen Lab the recent attacks on Github and internet freedom group Great Fire were orchestrated by China\u2019s new weapon, Great Cannon. Great Cannon is a tool built to intercept data and redirect it to specific sites. To get an idea of how the attacks work: \u201cGreat Fire claimed \u201cmillions\u201d of users were compromised for the attack it suffered, which hijacked Baidu and pushed the organization\u2019s Amazon hosting bill to $30,000 per day.\u201d In other news, China has also been accused of a decade of cyber attacks on governments and corporates in Asia.\n\n**Twitch Plays Ads** Twitch, a game-streaming platform known for the incredibly successful \u201cTwitch Plays Pokemon\u201d, is ramping up for another live-streaming engagement, this time with a plot twist. They will be using their platform for a Procter &amp; Gamble ad where people on the Internet will get the chance to control a real guy in the woods for three days. The world probably won't let him sleep, so this is what we expect he\u2019ll look like after.\n\n**Game Of Thrones Leak** Ah, you torrents you. Nearly half of 'Game of Thrones' season 5 has leaked online. A similar event happened last year which enabled HBO to set a world record for illegal downloads. HBO CEO wasn\u2019t upset, because more piracy = more buzz = more profits.\n\n**GoDaddy Acquires Elto | Amount Undisclosed** Elto connects business owners and non tech folk to web developers through their intuitive online marketplace. Looks to be another eventual service add on for the GoDaddys.\n\nYou can find the rest here:\n\n[Weekend's Trending News In Tech &amp; Startups](http:\/\/bit.ly\/1aWK8IC)","30":"[H] $5.00 Amazon gift card [W] $5.00 itunes or subway gift card.","31":"[H] Amazon UK \u00a370 [W] PayPal 90%","32":"Amazon, Google and More Are Drawn to Home Services Market","33":"So you will see stuff called sony stamina batteries.

Three CC (Citi Forward, SM MasterCard, Banana Republic).\n\nWants: Either solid travel or cash back (CB) card. I use my SM for gas\/groceries\/Amazon. Everything else on my Citi Forward (years old) for ThankYou points.\n\nShould I go for another CB card like Citi DoubleCash, Chase AARP Visa ([Link](http:\/\/aarpcreditcard.com\/Default)) or Chase Freedom or Discover It? Also is there another better flat restaurant CB or point card than the AARP?\n\nBut I also travel about 1-2 times a year (flight and hotel).

I\u2019m going to test building an authority site, a comparison\/review site and a pure Amazon affiliate site over the next year.  You\u2019ll get to come along for the ride.\n\nAside from knowing how to work on a WordPress site a little bit, I don\u2019t really know much about any of this stuff.  I don\u2019t even really know how much work is required but I do know that others have done it so I can do it too.  Don\u2019t expect me to \u201cpreach knowledge &amp; authority\u201d since I intentionally started this with ZERO knowledge - I thought it would make for a more realistic case study.\n\nAs promised last month, I put together a very basic blog to go into more detail about the process and tools I\u2019m using.  Some of the links are affiliate links but I figure if I\u2019m providing value you might be inclined to click and buy.  A few years ago I wanted to write a book about failure. So I bought the domain name [99Fails.com](http:\/\/99fails.com\/). I'll just use that domain for my basic blog to document this case study. Feel free to give it a visit to see a list of the plugins, themes and other thoughts that I have (yes, there is more information there about these case study sites).\n\nNote: don\u2019t ask me to tell you the names of my sites nor my exact niches, I don\u2019t want to skew the results.  I will reveal them in a few months after they get going.\n\n****\n**Goal:**\nThe overall goal for doing this was just to see if I could do it.  My monetary goal is to see if I can get 3 sites that could each generate $1000 in affiliate income per month by January 31st, 2016.  Hope and goals are different\u2026 I hope I make 3X that amount within a year, but my goal is low since I\u2019m a bit skeptical.  \n\n**Budget:**\nMy budget for this whole year is $500 out of pocket.  After each site starts generating its own flow of money, I can use up to $1000\/site to fund growth but until that time my budget is only $500 total.  I don\u2019t count my time in my expenses.\n\n****\n\n**Starting STATS:**\n\nCategory     | FitnessSite | SportSite  | OutdoorSite\n---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------\nAge| purchased in 2009 | purchased in 2009 | purchased in 2010\nSubdomains | 7 | 0 | 1\nPages | 140 | 3 | 6\nPosts | 3000+ | 2 | 10\nCategories | 40 | 10 | 50\nTraffic | avg 5000 pv\/month in 2014 | 0 pv | avg 100 pv\/month in 2014\nLast Update | 4 posts in 2014 | 0 | last update 2011\nMoney | $30\/mo Google Ads | 0 | $5\/mo Google Ads\n\n\n****\n**RESULTS**\n****\n\nMarch Results (screenshots at the very bottom):  Just like Month 1, this month\u2019s results aren\u2019t pretty and could even be a little discouraging.  I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of really good time on any of the projects this month.  I had work, family and hobby obligations that took up more time this month than normal.  I manage a few people at work and 2 of them quit so I spent a lot of my \u201cnormally free time\u201d doing interviews.  I had a child\u2019s birthday and a wedding anniversary in March.  I manage 5 other sites for a couple businesses\/friends and they were a little more needy this month with updates, formats and a few changes.  All of this ate into my time this month so I realize that I have to be happy with the work I was able to do.\n\nWith my complaining out of the way\u2026 on to the results. \n\n**FitnessSite Update:**\n\nI earned about $21 from Adsense on this site for this month on about 1101 visitors.\n\nFor this month I signed up for a few affiliate programs that were specific to this niche as well as a couple of the bigger affiliate networks.  I backed into the affiliate networks by finding the sites\/products I wanted to promote then found out if they had an affiliate program.  In some cases that meant emailing the company or using their contact page to ask them about a program.  You\u2019d be surprised how many companies have affiliate programs but don\u2019t really advertise them.  From this I was able to sign up for, and get accepted into, the Commission Junction, Avantlink and Shareasale networks.  I have been approved for several merchants and have started to pepper in some links into the content.  I have an advantage here since my existing site is so established.  Newer folks to AM might have a harder time getting approved for some established\/larger networks. \n\nLast month I broke the site by changing the whole structure.  My traffic has suffered, not to mention I haven\u2019t really put up any new content.  Because of the changes I started making to the site a few of my old freelance writers contacted me to see if I was starting it back up (really?!? did they like writing for me that much?).  I let them know that I will be breathing life back into the site and work will be coming their way soon.  This made them really happy since one of them was making around $300\/month writing for me in the past.  However I did let them know that I will have much more \u201ceditor control\u201d on their submissions since I want to curate the content that does hit my site.\n\nI did some more pruning on the site this month.  I deleted a few hundred posts and several pages.  I\u2019ll keep pruning to get some of the outdated (and duplicate) content removed.\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten any conversions on my affiliate links yet but am averaging 4 click throughs each day.  Eventually someone will buy something.\n\n**SportSite Update:**\n\nWoohoo!  I made $5.86 in Amazon income with this site this month.  [Imgur image](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Ddzeb3f.png)  \n\nThis is the site I am most excited about.  I really want to make it awesome.  Because of that I found that I get hung up on the content writing part.  I want it to be perfect from day one so I find it\u2019s creating a stumbling block for me.\n\nI don\u2019t remember which Redditor wrote this but I came across a comment from someone who said that you should just put up a MVP (minimum viable product) version of your content.  Basically just start writing your content.  Let it flow, just write what you want it to say.  Ignore links, ignore images, ignore affiliate links, ignore flow, ignore all of that.  Just get the content up there.  There\u2019s time to change it and perfect it later.  Right now you need to flesh out the site and that means words on pages.  As long as a user can get the basic idea then you can move on to the next one.  Once they\u2019re all up there then you are free to start working on ways to get traffic.\n\nIn between the execution of your \u201cmarketing strategy\u201d you can revisit your content and really start to make it shine.  That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing with this site for next month.  My hope is that I get it to the point where I can actually start implementing my social media &amp; marketing strategies to really see what this site can do.  \n\nIn the table below you\u2019ll see that I have 65 pages of content but only about 10 of those actually have any content on them at all.  That would make for a really poor user experience if I were to start marketing my site now - they\u2019d land on a page and see that just about every internal link takes them to a blank page.  Sure that page is beautiful but the rest of the site sucks.  So I\u2019ll be filling them in next month as quickly as possible.  Just a word vomit on the page\u2026 with a little bit of organization.\n\n**OutdoorSite Update:**\n\nI earned about $6 from Adsense on this site for this month on about 168 visitors.\n\nMost of this site is built and it won\u2019t change much other than content and design later in the year.  Because of that most of my pages are complete - there just isn\u2019t new content.  Even though it\u2019s stale, this month I received a message from my contact page requesting a guest post.  I will allow just about any relevant author to write a guest post on my site at this point.  I just don\u2019t have time for content generation.  After a little back and forth with the author I got his article and posted it to the site.  Not bad for a little bump in traffic but nothing converted.  Since this site will be my Amazon Affiliate site that\u2019s not good since their cookies only last 24 hours.  I\u2019m still not planning on doing much with this one for a few months.\n\n**Site Breakdown for Month**\n\n\nCategory             | FitnessSite | SportSite  | OutdoorSite\n---------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------\nTotal Time Spent| 3.5 | 10 | .5\nSubdomains| 0 | 0 | 0\nPages| 70 | 65 | 24\nPosts| 2107 | 15 | 12\nAffiliate Links\/Ads| 42 | 13 | 17\nTraffic| 1,101 pv (94.2% new) | 275 pv (58.5% new) | 168 pv (97% new)\nMoney| $21 Google | $0  | $6 Google\n\n\n****\n\n**Commentary &amp; Details:** \n\nDuring the month of March I spent a lot of time working on \u201creal life\u201d projects so I didn\u2019t have as much time to dedicate to this case study.  But, as predicted, I felt compelled to do a little work on each site and on the [update blog](http:\/\/99fails.com\/) because I felt accountable since I put it out there publicly on Reddit last month.  So that part of the case study worked just like I had hoped.  Sometimes we have to know ourselves in order to get external motivation.\n\nTime Spend:\n\n* Sunk Time (Prior Months): 75 hours \n* Competitive Research - 4 hours\n* Writing Content - 10 hours\n* Total Time Spend (this month) - 14 hours\n\nMoney Spend:\n\n* Sunk Costs: $388\n* Hosting - $13 this month\n* Income - $32.68\n* Total $ Spend (this month) - $7.32\n\n**Net Income: -$331.64 - it\u2019s going the right direction, just very slowly!**\n\n**** \n**FINAL THOUGHTS FOR THE MONTH**\n****\n\nThis is a long term play.  I have to keep thinking about that.  Honestly I\u2019m pretty disappointed with the progress and I really thought I would have something to brag about this month - but I don\u2019t.  Hopefully next month is better.\n\nI got a TON of PMs from Redditors last month asking me to reveal my sites.  I\u2019m not going to do it.  \n\nHowever there were a few messages from folks who wanted to write for me or do a guest blog.  I was really excited about working with a few of them but it turns out they went through the whole process, it seems, to just get me to reveal my site or niche to them and then I never heard from them again.  \n\nI\u2019m open to working with anyone that is in a related niche but I think I\u2019ll be a bit more selective in the future about who I work with and to whom I share my stuff.  Kind of a \u2018lesson learned\u2019 for this month.\n\n**New Skills Acquired, Websites Used &amp; Tools Found:**\n\n* Time Management - With limited time you need to focus on where you can make the biggest impact.  I decided this month that I already knew everything I needed to know about my niches, my keywords, and my competition (after 4 hours of research).  This was just a little mind trick since I know I don\u2019t know everything but it helped me to focus on just writing content which is currently the only thing that\u2019s keeping me from really executing my marketing plan.\n* Google AdSense - I found out through some post or blog that I was reading that Adsense isn\u2019t just a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type of network.  I had put my codes in place 3+ years ago on most of my sites and a lot has changed at Google since then.  This would explain, in part, why my revenue from this channel has declined in the last few months.  Sure enough, when I logged into my account I saw that none of my ads were \u201crevenue optimized\u201d on any of my sites. So I went in  and updated all my ad codes and then re-deployed them on each of my sites.  So far I\u2019ve seen a 207% increase (according to Google) in my clicks with the same amount of traffic.  Good thing to look at every few months.  And this was an important update since it was \u215e of my total revenue for the month.\n* Reddit - I\u2019m pretty sure Reddit is a very bittersweet place.  It\u2019s great for getting answers and finding solutions to problems but it\u2019s also really easy to become distracted.\n\n**Useful Tips:**\n\n* Make a list of everything that needs to be done on the project.  Put time estimates next to each task.  If you ARE short on time, when you have it, start working on one item that\u2019s easy to knock out.  My old boss always would say \u201cgo after the low-hanging fruit\u201d.  I need to do that more.\n* All Traffic is not the same - I\u2019m building for CONVERTING traffic (email subscriptions, return visits and lots of clicks) and not just hit &amp; run traffic.  Because of that I don\u2019t want to focus on revenue generation up front.  I\u2019m building the framework for an affiliate site but the first thing I need to bring to the table is a genuine desire to help people.  Sometimes that means that I\u2019ll give A LOT of stuff away for free.  Eventually I\u2019ll get enough momentum to generate decent commissions.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* Other Redditors don\u2019t lie when they say that this stuff isn\u2019t easy work and you have to be committed to the long term.  I\u2019m not too pleased with a $5 return in affiliate income for the month but I know that I\u2019m building something that people will like and find useful.  To that end I will continue.\n* Even 15 minutes spent on generating content is time well spent.  15 minutes on Reddit does not have the same value.  I need focus my 15 minute chunks on those tasks that have the most return.\n\n**Images:**\nHere are some traffic screenshots from this past month.\n\n\n* [FitnessSite](http:\/\/imgur.com\/EonLbb8.png)\n* [OutdoorSite](http:\/\/imgur.com\/Zx3aO9v.png)\n* [SportSite](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lhfyQ8r.png)\n\n\nHope you enjoyed the summary.  Next month I hope it\u2019s shorter and full of more good news and results.

I don't have a car or belong to any gym or anything like that. My only consistent recurring expenses are Spotify ($5\/month), Microsoft Office ($10\/month), and Amazon Prime ($60\/year).\n\nMy parents aren't able to contribute anything to my education\/life really, so I worked two jobs over the summer, and work two jobs on campus. I never really thought twice about it. After doing my taxes, I was shocked to discover that I made about $10K last year, which is a quarter of my single mom's income, and also more money than I've ever imagined I'd have in college. Except I don't have it anymore.\n\nI spent my first two years of college with an average of $100 in the bank and living very conservatively, so I guess I've been trying to play catch up. My lifestyle has unfortunately shifted accordingly. I began this semester with about $4K or something in the bank, and have spent..pretty much all of it. I spent like $800 alone in December (I wanted to spoil my family, give them the Christmas they never had). But on average, I spend $200 a month now.\n\nCurrently...I only have about $600 left to my name, no emergency fund of course. Now, a good chunk of it went to rent, bills, and living expenses over the summer (in NYC), and I'm pretty generous with my family (I've flown my mom out to visit me and to bury her best friend) but to be fair, a lot of my money also just went...and went and went.\n\nI don't live extravagantly, but I love the luxury of being able to go eat out with friends whenever I want, and to be able to afford to replace an old pair of shoes or something. That being said, I definitely have been spending WAY more than I'm making (although that might also be a remnant of the summer, when I had steady, consistent, big paychecks coming in).\n\nI have tried to budget but it is SO difficult for me to say \"NO\" when I KNOW I have the money in the bank, and I don't really have any bills or whatever to pay. I use Mint, but there's no consequence for me to spend more than I budgeted, besides feeling like a dipshit right now.\n\nI'm going to graduate with like only $2K in student loans (emergency money I needed my first two years), I pay my two credit cards in full and on time (no matter how much it hurts), and I don't have any other pressing financial needs. But I don't want to spend like this when I have a full-time job. I'm going to be a senior next school year, and would like to have enough saved to be able to move to wherever my heart (or grad school or the job I get) wants after graduation.\n\n\nAny advice, how to reach that \"A-Ha!\" moment, and change my attitude towards my money?\n\n**tl:dr; How should I budget\/be conservative with spending when I have zero expenses?**","112":"I am looking to trade $5 Amazon GC.\n\nI am looking to receive $4 Google Wallet.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2zlv8p\/urowebil_gcx_rep_profile\/","113":"I'm new to credit cards and was interested in applying for an Amazon store card (https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/iss\/credit\/storecardmember\/ref=storecard_van) what caught my eye is the \"No interest if paid in full within 6 months on any purchase totaling $149 or more.\" I was just curious if stretching out the balance between the 6 months, however paying it before the 6 months ends, would be negative towards my credit score.\nFor example, if I bought an iPad priced $400 and I made equivalent payments of $67 each month for 6 months (that would pay it off by the end of 6 months) so even if there is no interest charged, would credit bureaus see that as bad that I paid it off in 6 months instead of 1 month?","114":"Who I Am and What I Do\n\nI am a 23-year-old internet entrepreneur in every sense of the phrase.\n\nI sell physical products [http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00HPR7J4G] (currently out of stock)\n\nAs well as digital products [https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/jonbowsir\/give-a-complete-amazon-manual]\n\nI am based in Virginia and I have done a lot, but I still feel I am at the beginning of my journey. This story will reflect while I\u2019ll always choose products over services when it comes to business. \n\n\nWhy I\u2019ll Choose Products over Services\n\nI read several entrepreneurship blogs that tell you how to get rich.  They all pretty much say the same thing.  The first is to decide to get rich and the second is to pick something and stick with it.  The latter part was the most difficult for me. \n\nI went back and forth between products and services and after 3 years of fails and self-reflection.  I realize I\u2019ll forever only be product oriented.\n\n\nWhy Services Lose Out\n\nI\u2019m going to keep it real the reason I struggle with services is because I\u2019m lazy.\n\nCustomers will literally take it out of you.  They demand the world, and your time, which is warranted they are getting your money, but still.  I became an entrepreneur to control my own time.  And I know what you\u2019re thinking why not just outsource everything.\n  \nI'm young with a family that is not supportive of my entrepreneurial efforts (Stop being lazy and get a real job mentality). I didn\u2019t have the capital for hires.  So everything from lead generation, sales, and delivery I took care of myself needless to say I burnt out pretty quickly.  I spent days upon days in COLD CALL HELL to get myself off the ground only to feel stress to the gills.\n\n\nWhy Products Win Out\n\nNow on to my bread and butter products.\n\nProducts both digitally and physically allow you to set and forget essentially.\nThe most intensive part of the whole process is product research and development.  Once that\u2019s over it\u2019s pretty much a cake walk depending on the platforms you choose to advertise on.  Not to mention Amazon\u2019s FBA program is a Godsend Waking up every morning to money in your bank account due to a little groundwork you put in months ago is AWESOME. \n\nThe best part no big outstanding arguments with customers.  Don\u2019t like my product I have no qualms giving a refund. Honestly, my favorite part of the business I don\u2019t have to groom and coax customers into a buy and customer acquisition is as easy as ever see my product, see my reviews, a small customer acquisition price (ususally PPC) in regards to time. \n\nMy day is my own to do with as I please.\n\nNo one puts this freedom to use as much as Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS, aka \u201cSHOE JESUS,\u201d the flexibility allowed in the product-based business not only allowed him to fully train a company president in just two months, but allows him to go on a lot of speaking engagements, as well as go on his company sponsored shoe drops to the communities TOMS supports.  Not to mention, he has just launched a set of coffee products with just 30 employees in the department.  The fact a large company only needs 30 people for a whole new product category is insane, and helps you really see the flexibility of the products business.  \n\nProducts give you the feeling of freedom you sought when you began your entrepreneurial journey.\n\nConclusion\/A Question to the Service Guys\n\n\nCan people who do services tell me benefits I\u2019m missing besides less capital to start?\n\n","115":"#Buying Gift Cards via BTC\nHey, I'm once again looking for a lot of various gift cards.

FeaturePoints and Slidejoy, both of which will deposit into your paypal account or give you a gift card.\n\n**FeaturePoints** is pretty straightforward. You download an app from their offer list, and mess around with it for a minute. Usually just completing the tutorial and connecting the app to FB is long enough.\n\nSometimes there are special instructions, I once got 950 points from Game of War but I had to get my stronghold to level 5 before being able to receive points. It took about 10 minutes, but since 3,000 points is worth $5 it was about worth it.\n\nYou also get points if your friends join. This is my referral code - RQ2HBF and the link is [here](http:\/\/featu.re\/RQ2HBF). You get 50 points when you join using my link. I use it for Android, but I think it is available on all systems.\n\nYou can cash out at any time, it's usually a $5 minimum in the form of a gift card (Starbucks, Amazon, Wal-Mart, ect) or a $5 deposit into your Paypal account (no fees). Your monthly average depends on how many friends you refer and how many apps you download. I made $5 last week with no referrals. \n\n**Slidejoy**\nThis one is so easy. You just install the app, and it installs a lockscreen that shows an ad on your phone. Swipe right to ignore, left to view the article or deal. Most people report earning $5-$15 per month. I have earned $3 so far this month. \n\nThe only problem is you have to wait three months from the time you install in order to get your first deposit. After that you can cash out monthly. You can have them deposit to Square, Google Play, Paypal, or to one of the charities they support. You get 20 cents for joining.\n\nMy referral link is getslidejoy.com\/r\/blueeyecyber.94531 Formatting isn't working on this link, sorry.\n\nThe ads are usually to Buzzfeed videos, the Ibotta app, or an article.

My credit is shot due to student loans, so i'm trying to pay everything off that i've owed in the past and carry only a small balance on my two cards which each have limits of $500 and $750 respectively.\n\nMy amazon balance is currently at $890 (interest and fees) with an account limit of $800.  even though the account is \"closed\" I am being charged about 25% APR on that balance.\n\nI can take a loan from my 401k, spread out over 2 years for $1200 and an interest rate of only 4.25% interest.  I'd pay a total of $53.76 in interest over the lifetime of the loan from my 401k which would go towards my savings anyway (though i'd have to pay taxes on that $54 as \"income\" (double taxation?) apparently.)\n\n\nShould I take out the $1200 loan from my 401k and pay off the $980 balance on the amazon card \/ put the rest of the money to pay down my $500 card (which is at around 400) to below 50% utilization?  it will cost me $52.24\/mo which they will automatically deduct from my first paycheck each month.  Currently i'm paying close to $130\/mo towards the amazon card and based on basic math, it looks like it'll take about 4 years to pay it off at this interest rate (most of the $130 goes towards interest and fees).\n\nIs this wise taking from my 401k to pay off this debt to help me reduce my monthly payment, get it marked 'paid' on my credit report, and also help me start building up a \"buffer\" in my checking using the money i'm not putting towards that bill?  Or would it be hurting me by taking from my 401k where my current balance of $4,600 is earning approx 18% return per year?\n\nI'm tempted to pull the trigger on this as it seems like i'd be saving a TON of money, I just don't know if there's anything I should be aware of.\n\nAlso, i can borrow up to 1600 apparently... should I borrow the whole 1600 an put that left-over money ($710) towards one of the higher interest private student loans (which i'm paying 12% on?) (lowest balance \/ highest % is approx $14k balance currently) or would it be better just holding onto that $710 as \"just in case\" money so I don't need to rely on the 2 credit cards for emergency purchasing?","133":"[H] $5 Amazon[W] $4.50 Paypal","134":"[H] $5 Amazon GC [W] $4.50 Paypal","135":"[H] Paypal [W] $135 Amazon (85% Paypal for amazon)","136":"[H] Amazon account w\/221$ [W] offer paypal","137":"I have 6 $5 Amazon gift cards, want $27.00 paypal.\n\n[My GCX Profile](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2v439q\/uretroblade_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n\nPM here first","138":"NOTE: This is a re-post. My previous post was mistakenly removed. The Mods gave me permission to post again.\n\nI signed up 2days ago after seeing u\/Garwald's post.\n\nI redeemed $5 Paypal yesterday morning.

I had no problem with this.\n\nPayment proof 1: http:\/\/imgur.com\/JzsotVp\n\nPayment proof 2: http:\/\/imgur.com\/yAdUEH6\n\nThis is my take on the site.\n\n1. You have to register with your Paypal email as I did not get an option to enter my email when I cashed out for Paypal. Luckily I signed up with the same email.\n\nTips: u\/Reynard_Austin gave a helpful tip in the comments: \"You can add more emails to your Paypal from the My Account settings menu in Paypal\" In this case you can add the email you signed up with to your Paypal account. Thanks u\/Reynard_Austin\n\nSigning up is easy. You confirm your registration immediately via email.\n\n2. As soon as you open the site, there is an option to earn. You can click on Videos, Game or Polls (Surveys)\n\n3. The videos are passive. It plays in the background. So I just leave it open while I browse other websites or work in other tabs. It advances to the next video automatically except it freezes. The freezing tends to happen once every hour or once every 2 hours. I noticed it freezes less  late at night and in the early mornings. \n\n4. I did not try multiple tabs and I have not tried it on mobile devices. \n\n5. I use the Chrome browser. If you keep getting Shockwave\/Flash crashes. Check your browser settings to make sure you do not have 2 Shock-wave players running at the same time. This causes it to crash as they interfere with each other. I had this problem in the past and after disabling one of the players, it was much better.\n\n\n6. You can also get points from the 2048 game. You don't need to play the game. It plays Ads by the right side which gives you points. I found out that I got more freezes when it was in game mode. YMMV.\n\n7. From my own experience I got more points watching the videos than when I left it to play games. I also got less freezes. Ads play intermittently throughout the video. You get 3 nectar after each Ad. 9 nectars give you 1HD. 100HD is equal to $1.\n\n8. The videos stop after playing the last one. You can start the videos all over again and still earn points. \n\n9. You can mute the Ads volume so it does not disturb but I have found out that after every 15 minutes or so, an Ad plays out loud but subsequently goes back to silent mode.\n\nTip: You can mute individual tabs in chrome. To enable this ability, go to chrome:\/\/flags\/#enable-tab-audio-muting and click enable. Then, when you see a tab making sound, click on the speaker icon to mute the tab. Thanks to u\/zacker150 for this tip.\n\n9. Under surveys, make sure you complete badges and the Profile survey. I got 5 points for each completed badge and 10 points for the 2 minute profile survey. After completing the above, I had a lot of surveys about 4 hours later. Another good thing is that my inbox was not spammed with survey emails. I only received 2 emails in the last 48 hours.\n\n10. There are high paying surveys. I completed a 500HD survey 2 nights ago for 25 minutes. I got credited immediately.\n\n11. There's a weekly draw for $25 Amazon. The information on the website says \"We are giving away weekly Amazon $25 gift cards. Each valid feedback sent through our Contact Us page will receive one entry. Only valid during the Beta test.\"\nThat's all my experience so far.\nLet me know how your experience has being so far for those who have already signed up. Helpful tips will also be appreciated.\n\nOne more thing, some people have attempted to use Auto-reloaders to combat the freezing issues. I have not tried this as it is clearly against their TOS.

Scanning, scanning, and more scanning. I've been in several Home Depot's, Gabe's, Ollie's, WalMart's, etc scanning clearance items and normal items. The best deal I found was a $1 item that sold for $10 on Amazon, after fees it was a profit of like $2-3. Today I found a filter that cost $30 and sells for $50, only 2 of them and will profit maybe $8-10 after fees. Take into account all the gas and time I've spent finding these items I have no idea how people can make xx,000 per month with RA. Seems like a whole hell of a lot of work with small returns, maybe they are just super good at finding high profit items. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Thrifting** - probably my favorite so far. I consistently find items for $1-3 in Goodwill that sell for $20-50 on Amazon. The downfall here is you only find 1 at a time usually unlike RA. So you have to constantly be sourcing. I'm planning on focusing on this and private label more and more.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Private Label** - This is how you really make the money. I know a local guy selling 1 bathroom item and making $20k per month with about 50% profit, he started 3-4 months ago. I also know a guy selling markers and making $15k a month with the same margins. It takes some work to find a product, source it, get it listed but once you do there isn't much more work involved, keep inventory up and get paid! RA is exciting because you *think* you're going to find a gold mine, but even if you find a good deal you buy them out and then you have to keep looking. Private labeling seems like the best option there is. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm interested to hear what others think about these methods.\n","155":"#Buying Gift Cards via BTC\nHey, I'm once again looking for a lot of various gift cards.

My income went from ~32-ish a year to what is around 65-ish.  These are rough estimates, mind you, about 95% of my income is tips.  \n\nNow, I live with my parents now, but I figure I can afford to move out.  But I have awful credit due to two things:\n\n1) I have never had a credit card, and my only credit history is a few payments on a car that I got back in November.  \n\n2) I have about 12k in student loans due, but I am cashing out a mutual fund to pay those off, which means that will go away, right?\n\nMy priority right now is moving to my own place, and I feel comfortable renting for a year or two, while I save a bit more, and then looking at getting a townhome or something.  My parents are telling me to just pull the trigger and buy a house or townhome now.  Currently, I'm putting about 75% of my tips into my savings every week, with everything else going towards insurance, bills, etc.  \n\ntl;dr, I've never had money before, please stop me before I get drunk and spend it on Amazon.","171":"So this is more a BOLO or a story than it is a \"tip\" because it really only works in certain situation. Its a good stratagy if you're like me and not ready to jump into wholesale.\n\nSo I was in a big box store, call it Store, and found an item, call it Item, for $4.21. Scanned it, it had a single merchant fufilled seller listing it for 5.99+5.23 shipping. After fees I'd get about $3.50, but I know that as an FBA seller I could get even more. AS for the sales rank, it was 40k, but only had one sale two days ago on record on CCC. Worth the risk, so I picked up all 12 they had in the store. Sent them into FBA, and sure enough it sold literally the same hour my first box arrived. \n\nSeeing it sold so fast, I raised the price to 14.99. Still had the buy box, still had sales. Raised to 15.99, to 16.99. I finnally no longer had the box at 17.99 so I stuck to 16.99. What gives? I was almost 50% higher than the merchant fufilled and STILL had the box. I looked at the merchant fufilled seller and realized it was Store that was selling it. Interestingly enough, that store had 89% feedback and time to ship was 10-14 days. That is pretty damn shitty, expecially considering it was a big box retail store. I invite everyone to watch this video.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vp00UFsJWZw\n\nBasically, the fact I was FBA with 100% feedback and the speed of FBA shipping, I could jack up the price enarly 6 dollars higher than his and still get the buy box. Thats when it hit me: his listing was 5.99 PLUS shipping. So I went to his offer and typed in 20 quantity, and the shipping dissappeared. Basically, I could do online retail arbitrage by buying from a seller with shitty customer service and reselling it with good customer service at an insane markup. Basically, taking advantage of the buy box system to make a good profit.\n\nAfter I purchased around 100 of Store's Item, they closed their listing, but I had already made easy bank. Just keep in mind if you use prime to do this you ARE BREAKING AMAZON TOS. I don't have prime so its not a big deal for me.\n\ntl;dr: If you see an item with a single merchant fufilled seller with bad metrics, test the market to see if you can use the buy box system to resell his own product at a big markup.","172":"Hey guys!\n\nLooking for 1 coupon:1 dollar, can give deals if you buy more.

I make a bunch of purchases, usually on Amazon, but occasionally from other places like Target, for family members in foreign countries. They typically are unable to use their cards on US Amazon, or the item is available only in the US, and find it easier just to have me order it all, then pay me back in cash whenever I see them every few months (I may give them the items then or have sent it already with a family member). These purchases are typically made by me on my card, and on occasion a friend's card (in order to help them meet minimum spending requirements). A few months later they give me USD in check or cash. Currently, I'm keeping a Google Sheet with all the orders, items, amounts, and dates, along with the card used and who it is for. I've been able to create pivot tables with this but it is starting to get very confusing as I have 50+ orders and sometimes the pivot tables double count the item amount as well as the ultimate total for each person. I'm looking for an easy system where I can easily input everything and it will output the total amount, plus add\/subtract payments.

To make a long story short, when the economy tanked, I lost my full-time career job and had to come up with something fast. Since I was already doing so well with storage auctions as a hobby, I took out a loan against my retirement and started my own storage auction business.\u00a0\n\nWithin a short time, I was making over six grand per month consistently. Then I made a huge mistake and closed my original warehouse in exchange for a retail location with more overhead, less space, and zoning restrictions that led me to change business models and lose my loyal customers. \n\nThis eventually led to filing bankruptcy\u2026 ouch!\n\nI learned a lot along the way - what I did right, and what I did wrong, and I put it all together into a book.

I currently have a BOA Cash rewards credit card, but am looking for a better option. My situation:\n\n- 24y\/o\n- Pay off my balance in full every month\n- On average I will spend $500-1000\/month on the card. Most of it will be in grocery, gas, food, and other random expenses.\n- I don't travel a lot for work, maybe once or twice a year.\n- I travel on my own dime via airplane about two or three times a year.\n- I also sometimes take weekend trips where I stay in AirBNBs most of the time.\n\nWhat sort of card should I get? Ideally, it would be nice to have a credit card that can give me a free flight \/ hotel when doing my personal travel. However, it seems like my spending may be more catered to a cash rewards card that I can just put to travel expenses. The one cash rewards card that seems appealing is the Sallie Mae Master Card as some of my expenses come from Amazon. On the other hand, I'm wondering if a hotel card makes more sense as it'd be nice to get some free nights \/ perks when I travel.\n","218":"If you have an Amex credit card or Serve card, check your personal Amex Offers section on your account.

I currently live in a relatively expensive state\/county and may soon have the possibility to move to a smaller town with a lower cost of living. According to the CNN Money \"cost of living calculator\" (no idea how useful this is), and using a comparable town for destination as the actual one isn't on the list, the new place shows up as roughly 18% \"cheaper\". \n\nSo my question for the gurus here is basically this... I don't believe it's reasonable to assume that, if I took an 18% cut in my salary, I'd have the same standard of living. I might have the same kind of house, for instance, and some things might be cheaper, but I also know that, e.g., Amazon doesn't sell me stuff at 18% cheaper just because I live somewhere else. While I want to be clear that I'm entirely aware there are a million other tangible and intangible reasons to move, or not, even just within the specific benefits of the jobs involved and not even factoring in the location.. assuming I based it purely on salary, are there any recommendations for how much of a cut it would really take to \"feel it\" day to day? How accurate are the cost-of-living comparisons, CNN Money or otherwise? Right now we are doing well enough, certainly comfortable but no real extra money, and I'm concerned about things like a lower salary resulting in a lower contribution to IRAs and things like that as well as the more short-term ramifications.\n\nThe move is far from \"certain\", but I'd rather be prepared if the offer comes through so I can build an idea of where my \"walk away\" cutoff line would be.\n\nThanks!","230":"Hey all - I was just curious about what other cards to get for rewards\/points?

I have the url DeskFitnessHQ.com and was planning on branding that for the site, and I'm currently building the site on a shopify template. What are some things to take into consideration here? Can a brand be effectively created these days for a drop shop model? I can sell for the same prices as the current suppliers show and what's on Amazon, but they will have a better site and buying experience and the product brand name advantage. I could have a map closer to wholesale selling offline, but not sure of the channels to do that. Would like to hear any and all views on this.","262":"[H] $2 Amazon Code [W] $1.50 CSGO skin","263":"I'm gonna go out of a wild limb here and suggest that maybe Amazon thinks this solution will be cheaper.","264":"&gt; on to take a bigger cut of the sales in order to free up my time.

Usually what I do is option #1.  Amazon charges 50 cents for the removal.  When you get the item back, inspect the item.  Some times, the item is actually still in brand new condition, and can be resold.  Send it back into Amazon to resell.  If it's not in new condition, you'll need to try to sell it somewhere other than Amazon (eBay maybe?).  If it looks like it should have never been returned because the customer severed damaged the item (I've had holes drilled in items, grass stains on Halloween costumes, torn apart wheels, parts of items not being sent back, etc), open a ticket with Amazon.  If the item really shouldn't have been returned under Amazon's policy due to blatant customer abuse, Amazon will reimburse you a portion or all of  it - if you fuss enough.  Sometimes it takes more than one ticket.  They do NOT like reimbursing for \"customer damaged\" items.","329":"In my experience ICs are not the best strategies for earnings, especially when you get the weekly ones.

If you do lots of shopping there, it can be a deal breaker. \n\n2) My budget is $6000 annually as well, but I shop at Aldi for roughly half of it. I lose that cash back but the savings on the items themselves is huge. \n\n3) Do you have a 5% cash back Amazon card? Or 5% gas? If not, SM would be the winner for me. \n\nPersonally I'd recommend the SM just for the flexibility. Maybe a grocery store moves, maybe your office building moves and a different store is convenient and it doesn't take AMEX, things like that. Plus number 3.

Here's two:\n\n1) Consumers continue to adopt an increasing number of mobile personal computing devices.  For at least several years, there will be no breakthroughs in battery technology.  To deal with that, server side processing continues to augment mobile devices and, as a result, the cloud computing market grows.  There is a high barrier to entry in cloud computing, so the incumbent players (Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, Google) will enjoy growth\/profit in that area.  \n\n2) Electric cars will continue to increase in popularity.  Tesla may or may not come to justify it's valuation, but the existing manufacturers who are better poised to take advantage of the trend will do better than those that are not.  Secondarily, between this trend and the mobile devices trend above, Lithium production will be in high demand.

We aren't talking $5 off a $60 game. We are talking 70% off, 80% off etc. Hell, just today I got 3 games for less than a dollar. Brothers, a Tale of \nTwo Sons, and Ctulu Saves the World + Breath of Death VII. I got Brothers almost for free by selling items that I got just for playing games I bought. Yes that is right. You get **MONEY** for **PLAYING GAMES** which you can spend on **MORE GAMES.** I have 173 games in my library. I have spent &gt;$400 total on them. My old $300 PC I built 4 years ago ran all of them wonderfully (with the exception of DayZ and Arma because Bohemia games run like shit no matter what). Game Bundles exist as well. Typically a single dollar can get you multiple great indie games, with Beat the Average tiers and $10 tiers having more popular games. Their are so many bundles these days and all have such a great variety of terrific games I can't pick a favorite, but [Humble Bundle](https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/) is by far the most popular. I picked up this last bundle and got Shadow Warrior + 9 other games + 1 gift copy for $8. Of those 11 games, Torchlight 2, Shadow Warrior, and Outlast are all highly praised games that fully justify a $20 price tag each. Cheapness aside, lets talk about the most popular games in the PC world. The top 3 are indisputably League of Legends (most played game in the world currently, this includes consoles), Dota 2 (I have 2500 hours played, by far my favorite game of all time), and Hearthstone (CCG, Idk I don't like it very much). These games are all so massive that there are extremely popular championships for each of them. These games are complete lifechangers, and guess what? **THEY ARE ALL FREE**. Yup. The most popular games on PC won't cost you a damn thing. Not even a subscription fee (though League is hard to enjoy unless you spend some cash, \/r\/dotamassterrace, be mad League of Losers). There also exist other completely free games such as Path of Exile, an MMORPG, Team Fortress 2, an FPS, Unreal Tournament 4 (nowhere near complete, but will be free and probably will be very popular unless Epic fucks it up) and Warframe, which I believe is on PS4 and XBONE but requires a subscription fee because consoles.

People claiming \"PC is dead\" or \"PC gaming is only viable if you have a $4000 computer\" and my favorite \"PC has no games.\"\n\nAll this said. I fully understand if you want to stick with PS4. It took a lot for me to ascend too. If that is the case, always buy used games. Amazon new games tend to be cheap so I would check there first. For the console itself, I wouldn't advise used unless you see a good deal at gamestop. I remember buying a Gamecube which only just broke this year from Gamestop that had 4 controllers, 2 $30 games and a Buy Two Get One free coupon for only $130 back in the day. They get shit (deservedly, they really do treat their employees like shit), but the deals they offer are hard to beat. Especially if you have that powerup card and trade in frequently. I still urge you and anyone else to consider PC for frugality.

I use this for QuickBooks, GitHub, etc. I also use this with Amazon Web Services buying Reserved Instances (this trick would apply only to a small number of people.)\n- See if there are any large purchases you intend to make anyway coming up. When I applied for my most recent Chase Ink Plus, I delayed the purchase of a new laptop until after I received the card.\n- When I was chasing the bonus, I would pick up a $100 Amazon gift card every time I went to staples (5x bonus with Chase Ink) which was fine since I order from Amazon all the time.\n\nObviously the key to all of these tips is assuming you are not spending money you wouldn't spent anyway and that you are capable of paying off the balance in full.","384":"On the whole price war thing.  \n\nThat's one of those things that has been around since the early days of basic pricing models.  I've definitely read some modern game theoretic stuff awhile back where, for example, the first mover in a price war wins.  Anecdotally, one could reasonably argue both Walmart in its time and Amazon in this time have engaged in multi-year price wars and won.\n\nIt probably is true that most price wars are started inadvertently and are waged in ignorance. \n\nHere for example are two acknowledged reasons to start a price war:\n\n1. Significant latent demand exists at a lower price level. (PCs, HDTVs, Mobile Phones etc) i.e. a discontinuity in the demand curve.\n\n2. Where competitors are structurally unable or are unwilling to react. e.g You have a significant cost advantage via hard to reproduce technology, or supply exclusivity etc.\n\nBottom line as long as unit volumes go up more than the loss from the price reduction you're good.\n\nOne pricing paper I read had this interesting rule of thumb to estimate the optimal price in a sparse demand curve data situation.  I won't go through the reasoning as to why it has credence but here it is:\n\n1) Determine your overall variable cost for the product (assume low fixed cost).  Call this Low.\n\n2) Take the highest price a reasonable person would pay for it. Call this High\n\n3) Estimated Optimal Selling Price = (High - Low) \/ 2\n\nTaking your example and say your variable cost is $100.  Assume the other guys are just selling for as much as they can, $1200.\n\nThen Estimated Optimal Sell Price  = (1200 - 100 ) \/ 2 = 550\n\nGrow some [1] and estimate the volume of all the top sellers of the product.    Make a buy where you can get and sustain your $100 cost.  Get plenty of inventory.  Private label with some fancy memorable name.  Go in with a $600 price.  Dominate the market share.  Own it, the buy box, the product, the brand.  Get a crap load of great reviews cause you are moving some volume.  You are selling at a great price.   Embed your private label brand in the market's collective consious. Don't run out of inventory no matter what.    By the time they react, if they react, if they even bother to react (other than to just dump their remaining inventory and move on), you da' man.  You're selling volume at a nice profit 5.5X cost.  Someone is going to have to think hard before they try and bump you off as the newly crown king-of-hill.\n\n[1] Shown here in the brass version. You, Jack Lemmon, me Alex.

But if he wants a price war, he should make sure he is the low cost producer, and being new to the market, that is not very likely.  Also, the investment to be a Walmart\/Amazon in any market can be huge, and this guy is just getting started.\n\nIdeally, if someone is willing to pay $1200, you want to sell it for $1200 to those folks, then sell some for $1000 to folks willing to pay only that, then $800 to folks willing to pay no more than that, etc., etc.  There is no reason to sell it for $550 to someone willing to pay $1200.  Of course, in practice, once implemented, it may take a different form - discounts, promotions, coupons, whatever.  ","387":"Thanks for the replies everyone.  Yes quality content is the main thing I am worried about for now, I'm in no hurry as this is purely a side project.    \n\nOne thing I am wondering, from reading around Amazon can be tricky to deal with and shut down your affilliate account for any reason it seems (wether this is because people do dumb stuff I'm not sure).  What I'm wondering is would they be tougher on a affiliate site that has products which also has a price comparison to other affilliate sites?   The products I am looking at have 4 (at least) other affiliate programmes I can use, so I intend on having a live price comparison between them all on the sale page. ","388":"Assuming you can do price discrimination, you are correct, you absolutely should, but on Amazon you, I and everyone else gets the same price.

Maybe it's not a gift and I just bought it in the airport gift shop to use for my trip home?\n\nI dunno - just a thought. Buying electronics here on Amazon and selling it there in person can enrichen the travel purse quite a bit. ","411":"There are number of avenues for sourcing. Many, like myself, simply cruise garage\/yard sales, rummage sales, thrift stores and Estate sales and find items that we can flip for a profit. It is the way many \"bootstrap\" their business. Spend $50 and turn that into $200-$400 and then roll that money back into sourcing more products. \n\nMany just stay at that particular level and run it as more or less a hobby that makes good money. Others strive to up their game and move into areas like \"online arbitrage\", \"Retail Arbitrage\", working with liquidators and buying pallet lots or eventually moving into working the Private Label game and sourcing products directly from China.\n\nMost flippers that are serious about this is some sort of software on their smartphone in an attempt to establish some pricing guidelines. Amazon itself as one that runs on iPhone and Android called The Amazon Seller app. It is free.  Others choose to pay for software that has a few more bells and whistles and provides more information. I do this myself. A program like Profit Bandit which runs about $10 a month on a subscription.\n\nWhen people find out what I do, they always ask \"What do you sell?\" My answer is usually \"whatever I can make a profit on\". I don't really care what it is as long as I can roll it over for a 100% or more profit. That hard to do what you figure out the game. Overall, my ROI is in the high 80% range on average. Not everything is a winner or a home run, there are always losers that won't sell. Those I just donate back to a thrift shop and move on. Since my initial investment was small, it's not a big hit to the bottom line.\n\nThere are a crap ton of Facebook groups that cover all levels of this game from total newbie to expert. I would highly suggest you look into those as well.","412":"Really? I thought you couldn't buy non-Walmart gift cards with a gift card.

Get a job as a one-on-one tutor for some local high school students or underclassmen in an area you excel in.  Can make anywhere between $25-50\/hr, depending on the course level and your effectiveness.  \n2.  Become a sports referee.  I was a soccer official and was being paid $50-75\/game for adult league (games started every 2 hours), and $25-50\/game for youth (games started every 1.5 hours).  \nHow to stretch what you've already got?  Coupons.com is a good place to start, especially for necessities.  You can also peruse Amazon.com for the essentials - toiletries, paper towels, etc.  Sign up for Amazon Prime 30-day trial, buy a bunch of stuff (discounted) you'll need for the semester, and then cancel before the 30-day trial is up.  There were also campus coupon books that gave discounts at local restaurants.  You can also go to any\/every organization that gives out free food for attending a meeting.  \nIn terms of alcohol, buy yourself some Keystone Ice.  $15 for a 30-rack.

The fees drop from the standard 10% to 4% which can cover the cost of the store for the month and then some depending on the item. Video games still just drop to 9%, so if you sell over $2000 in video games a month that 1% would pay for your ebay store. ","419":"Seconded. I have it - it's nice.

This number assumes no more sales or transactions, if you have any more sales Amazon removes shipping charges from the disbursement; there's also corrections if you use UPS as they may bill a different amount than quoted. Basically you will only ever get money that is completely cleared as Amazon wants to protect themselves from any potential loss.\n\nIf you want to avoid this, setup shipping directly through the carrier website and don't print the labels through Amazon.com but make sure to add tracking still. You'll also lose any, if you have some, shipping discounts.","425":"Sure, just setup a website with Magento and install the M2EPro plugin. Then everything is automatic, you just add a product to your new .com website and presto it's up on eBay and Amazon. Someone buys off eBay, it deletes Amazon. Buys on Amazon, it deletes eBay, Buys on your .com, it deletes eBay and Amazon.\n\nThe only thing you really have to know, if you want best performance you NEED a dedicated server. Using GoDaddy shared hosting or whatever will cause problems with the syncing as your web server has to sit there checking your listings all the time. More listings = more checks and typically a shared host just won't provide the resources required to do this which makes the sync fail. It'll try again automatically if this happens but it'll be a lot less headache to spend a few bucks more and go dedicated.\n\nEdit: Probably should point out, if you're really hell bent on not paying for hosting you can use your home computer as a server. Magento typically runs out of RAM so if you got a decent amount you'll be fine vs shared hosting. It does need to be on 24\/7\/365 so your energy bill goes up if you currently turn the system off but you could set that up.","426":"How much Amazon?","427":"Is drop shipping dead?\n\nI think it could be?\n\nProduct branding is the only way we can compete with the likes of Amazon who can destroy on price.\n\nPlease prove me wrong as I love the idea of drop shipping, it just doesn't seem saleable at this moment in time.","428":"Recommendations for a specific body form\/mannequin for clothing photos?

For now, I lay clothes flat on a dining room table and take a photo from above standing on a chair.  It's all men's clothes (and not sportcoats) so I feel I've been able to get away with it, but in looking in other auctions it looks as if those with professional photos can get a higher asking price on similar items. Thanks!","429":"Only you can decide. There are many pros and cons for both and depending on who you talk to you will get two different answers.\n\nIMO Ebay for all its faults offers more seller protection than Amazon and it also has lower fees, the downside is there is more work involved in listing and sometimes less profit per item.\n\nGood luck and do a lot of research.","430":"&gt;Congratulations, you finished your profile!

Here are some alternatives:\n\n- Open a new joint account with someone you can actually trust.  You're young, so be paranoid.

Put \"for deposit only\" on the endorsement line.  Then close all joint accounts and hide it well until you are 18.

As someone else suggested, PayPal would let you pull it back out!\n\nWith most of the above options, leave a couple hundred in the account for you, and not to raise immediate suspicion.

The tasks generally take about 30 seconds.\n\nI also started using TrafficMicro, which gives you tasks throughout the day and generates $0.10 per task completed. During my 8 hours shift at work, I have gotten 4-7 tasks per day, translating to $0.40 to $0.70 per day. Their website says you can do up to 10 tasks per day. As with MXWRX, the tasks take about 30-45 seconds.\n\nBoth of these programs pay out daily to my PayPal account.\n\nI also do 30 searches on one Bing Rewards account.

Pick a product with no clear brand winner ex. if you source diapers don't expect to compete with Huggies\n2.  Pick a product where multiple brands have success, and at least one is in the top 200-500\n3.  See how many reviews the top product preferably in the top 500 has the lower the better your chance of knocking them out of the running \n4. Using a launch service (possibly multiple times to secure your position)\n5.  There is no magic product that will get you to a million sales with no effort, the best thing to do is diversify.  Work on one product, get it to a good spot, then move on to the next.

Neither are the best when it comes to coffee but they both were much better than Folgers or Maxwell House. I brew a pot and then toss it in the fridge when it cools off and just drink it cold with out sugar or milk\/cream. Gives me my caffeine fix and gives me some flavor unlike tap water.\n\nI have also been unemployed for a while and living off of savings while I tried my hand at freelance web design. I haven't had much success lately and starting writing ebooks this year. I am starting to earn enough to buy food and start paying my share of the bills again. Living of my savings and scraping by on the skin of my teeth has definitely taught me how to stretch my money and I look forward to paying my brother back for helping me out.\n\nI have also lost a lot of weight the past year and a half. About 120 pounds by mostly cooking my own food and not eating massive portions. Now that I will have some steady money though I am going to look into taking this weight loss and building some muscle. I don't like the way I look now any more than I did when I was 290 pounds. I am that weird looking skinnier guy with some extra skin and hardly any definition. So I will have to find out a cheap way to increase protein intake and I am dreading that because I think tuna fish will be the cheapest and I have a hard time eating fish. I just haven't liked the taste, ever. Maybe eggs will be comparable, you can do a lot with eggs.","530":"I think one thing we might find in the future is independent studios making high quality TV shows. Right now, TV shows are made by network TV or, increasingly frequently, distribution companies (Netflix, Amazon). Look at Comedy Central. IMO they have The Daily Show and South Park as their quality original programming. Why do they need a 24 hour channel. Why not have a private company run The Daily Show and license it to Netflix? \n\nMaybe I'm wrong. Maybe there is too much overhead for a company to just have 2-3 shows, but it might be a direction we see more.","531":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

(unless you're self employed.)\n\nIf you make $140K\/year and save very hard, as the person in the article did, it's possible to invest and amass enough money.  People remember the Great Recession, but they forget that the market has more than doubled since then.  Those are the years when the profiled person was investing the most...  Excellent timing.  \n\nThe biggest reason why focused and determined people don't just quit at 30 is because they already have a system that is working.  Why retire with 1M to live cheap if you can work 5 more years and retire with 2M and live much better... And when they reach that point, they wonder if they should work 5 more years to get to 3M so they can live more luxuriously.  And then... the recession hits, they loose some money, and they spend 5 more years chasing loses....  it's a never ending cycle that people have a hard time getting out of.  \n\n---\n\n**People think they need to fly to Thailand or Philippines to live cheap, but that's a myth.**  You can live CHEAPER in Middle America, if you are willing to make similar sacrifices.  \n\nIf you get yourself a scooter and a $30,000 rural house and cook your food, you will live cheaper than in Thailand.  And on top of that, you don't have any travel or visa expenses.  \n\nThe big reason why people think they have great lives on 12K\/year in Thailand is because they are surrounded by deep poverty, and they are continuously exposed to new sights, smells, etc.  There is a sense of discovery early on, and that sense of discovery overshadows their own meager lifestyle.  It feels ok... for a while.  \n\nBut rest assured, Thailand is full of $200K houses with $40,000 cars out front and people basically live the exact same lifestyle as in the USA.  In fact, it's MORE expensive for MOST things.  Virtually everything is heavily taxes upon import, which means that all the cheap crap from China is more expensive in Thailand than at Walmart\/Amazon.  This applies from everything from cars, to clothes, to cheese and wine.  For example, in the US, I can pursue my hobby of riding sportbikes at the track.  The bike costs $10,000 and entry fees cost $150\/day.  In Thailand?  The same bike costs $40,000 and entry fees are about $400\/day.  That's the reality of Thailand; you can live cheap in a poor area and eat cheap streetfood.  But if you seek a Thai (or American) middle-class lifestyle, have some personal aspirations\/pursuits\/hobbies, costs skyrocket very quickly.  Land is actually more expensive in Thailand than in the USA - which is a moot point because Thailand, like many developing countries in Asia, don't let foreigners own land to begin with.  *At best, for some things the costs are the same.*\n\nBut early on, when tourists still have their mouths open taking in the novelty, $1 street food and a $400 condo seem like a bargain life.  It doesn't last.  The happy expats spend plenty of money.  And the bitter expats are a miserable bunch who end up jumping out of windows.  ","535":"I would price your products higher on Amazon.

I'm not too concerned with my low ranking items, but I do have some higher ranking items that I'm afraid will never move if other sellers constantly beat my price.","537":"If they are all around the same price and all FBA, then you share the buy box. It rotates hourly between different sellers. No need to start a race to the bottom. Just as long as you are within range, you will get your fair share of the sales.\n\nYou probably could've even just matched their higher price and still had a piece of the pie. People need to understand that selling on Amazon shouldn't be a race to the bottom. If it's an item that sells, everyone can have their turn at the buy box and everyone walks away happy. \n\nUnfortunately that rarely happens because people just want the quick sale and dump the prices just so that they can make their 25 cents off the item...","538":"m.s.r.p vs actual price (i.e amazon).

It looks like part of a series of design mock-ups before you lock it down and start adding the features. Did they have a watchlist? I don't remember one. (Edit: apparently they added one in Q4 2013, oddly late. Edit 2: I don't recall it on the app this year?). Why is the \"bookshelf\" horizontal and slow\/awkward scrolling, what a crazy format choice.\n\nAnd Amazon Instant Video, my goodness, it's even worse. Exactly like any other part of their store, but with fewer ways to find things. How can they possibly think that sorting by rating or release date isn't useful enough to add? How about an easy way to discover what you might like... or might be available at all.\n\nTo my surprise and private annoyance, the UK's NOWTV app was by far my favourite, and my compliments to the Android developers who did an especially good job of making it feel like any other phone app. But still, silly oversights like missing a \"next episode\" feature for series-watching. You'd search for a show and the results would be a season per result... *unsorted*. When you have to find the next episode manually, that's dreadful.\n\nOne of the apps forced portrait layout, which is absurd when you're immediately going to flip to landscape any second, often back and forth between the two repeatedly like some kind of awful game, quite the workout on a 10-inch tablet. But I don't remember which one.\n\nThis isn't a multi-media bonanza, all of these are subsets of a single feature and relatively basic ones at that. They have *one* job to do.

We closed on a house late last year so there's really no reason for me not to get into this now. I figure we can get a few cheap\/free trips before kids.

Better is send into Amazon as a case lot and then you don't have to label each item. Just slap on a new shipping label. ","578":"You can FBA their products, I've done it several times.  However there are Amazon stores solely dedicated to TJs and there is almost always a race to the bottom. ","579":"On that note; [this company](http:\/\/www.teikametrics.com\/amazon-repricing.html) does repricing on Amazon. API collection, no artificial intelligence, but lots of business intelligence baked in.

So even if I'm right, it could ultimately be moot.\n\n&gt;  Problem 2. This site isn't about locally made. It's about a small business with a brick and mortar selling their Products. I've mentioned this already.\n\nI'm not sure you understood my point.  I understand that goods aren't locally made.  However when most products come in from China, they mostly end up in a handful of states.  Very tiny amounts do trickle into each state for resale, however those brick and mortar stores have god awful pricing.  The people who have anywhere near rates that *could be competitive* are selling wholesale or large volumes in retail.  These vendors mostly exist in New York &amp; California &amp; many people use third party logistics throughout the center of the country.  I'm saying that because we don't manufacture, goods are not organically\/evenly distributed.  Instead the location of goods are *heavily* polarized.\n\n&gt;  Problem 3. If I want to buy something local I'm not going to call every business in town or my state to see who has what I want.\n\neBay has a search feature by distance where a person can filter a product by *x* miles from their zip code.  \n\n\n&gt;  \u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t know what they want until you show it to them.\u201d - Steve Jobs\n\n\nFair enough.

Having just finished my taxes and books for the FY 2014 I can't even imagine how nightmarish your books will be to maintain. That aside is this sort of like Amazon's subscribe and save?","582":"Well, good luck with your giant warehouse and your tiny margins, and competing with Amazon Subscribe and Save.","583":"No warehouses needed, and there are tons of products not on Amazon which we can create a subscription for.","584":"It's all about scale. The margin on most Amazon products are very small, but given they focused so much on automation (software, hardware, and people logistics), they're able to significantly increase their margins and then reinvest it in R&amp;D.\n\nI think it's safe to assume they've found a good way to source tea, which I'd estimate the cost of goods to be sub $2 per box. It also looks like OP is using Cratejoy, which helps them with the bulk of that automation for nominal fee. Then with services like Shyp or even requesting a free pick-up from any shipping carrier, the only real hurdle they'd have to clear is customer acquisition.\n\nAlso, the beauty in their product is that they're basically shipping dehydrated foliage, so concerns about spoilage are almost nil. With the right Terms of Service and company incorporation, their liability is also almost nil. And the fact that this is being run from a college dorm room reduces costs even further.\n\nI'm not saying their business is perfect, but in terms of actual cost, alot of variables are mitigated thanks to the current technological climate.","585":"&gt; My personal reasons cable sucks:\n\n&gt; Old-ass DVR's with only 2 tuners\n\n&gt; Small hard-drives\n\n\nI have one with 6 tuners, just upgraded from one with 4.

Seems like poor engineering somewhere in the system. \n\n&gt; In order to get the channel or two you actually want, you have to upgrade your package 4 times and pay for a couple-hundred channels you'll never watch.\n\nNot the cable companies fault, it's how they are sold channels. You may only want ESPN, but the cable company can't just pay for ESPN when they buy it from Disney.  Disney forces you to buy 20 other channels because they know that no one can go without ESPN and be a viable cable company.  Content providers are responsible for this, not the cable\/dish companies. \n\n&gt; They take my money and lobby to prevent municipal fiber internet, as well as pole-access for competition.\n\nI want you to start a business where you invest billions of dollars building something that you then are forced to give out for free and not make money back on.  Funny how quick you would change your tune if your livelihood depended on it. \n\n&gt; Programming guides are often wrong, leading to missed recordings.\n\nSomething that is always being worked on.\n\n&gt; Constantly shows commercials for the cable service you already have.\n\nWho cares? \n\n&gt; Don't support privately owned DVRs.\n\nDepends on the company.  Problem with privately owned equipment is if you upgrade your network and all of a sudden the customers equipment isn't supported they cry foul.  This happens with older cable modems all the time. \n\n&gt; They charge equipment rental fees as well as \"service fees\" for the equipment you have to rent, just to use the service you already pay for.\n&gt; \"Introductory\" rates vs real rates.\n\nEveryone does their fees differently.  It's typical to give customers a discount to sign up for service, would you rather just not get that at all?  Customer acquisition is pretty important. \n\n&gt; Upcharge for \"HD\" versions of channels, despite having gone to digital long ago.\n&gt; If you don't pay for HD versions, they superimpose black bars on the sides to simulate what SD looked like.\n\nHD is more expensive to provide from multiple perspectives, are you one of those people who expect everything for free?  \n\n&gt; Different price quotes depending on who you talk to on the phone.\n\nBad customer service, but this happens in every part of the service industry.  Stop acting like it's a cable only thing.  I've gotten wildly different responses from two different Amazon reps to the same issue. \n\n&gt; How all this could be solved:\n&gt; A la carte style channel bundling.\n\nNot up to the cable companies, talk to the content providers.  You don't think cable companies would love to do this, it would solve the biggest complaint they get from their customers. \n\n&gt; Cutting edge equipment and\/or support personally owned DVRs.\n\nAnd you want all that free right?  \n\n&gt; Charge &amp; advertise what it actually costs.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are ways to legally resolve those types of issues if you have them, I don't think complaining on Reddit works for that though. \n\n&gt; I refuse to believe a cable model featuring what I just described would not be financially viable.\n\nGo start or buy out a cable company then and do it better, it\/s a free market. \n","586":"On Demand? Yes. \n\nA la carte? No way. Amazon and Itunes offer that and it's not super popular. ","587":"I put it on my Amazon wishlist.  If I still want it later, I consider it.

For example, if I have headphones, I don't buy a new pair until the old ones break.","588":"I find it easier to not impulse buy if I do not even go to stores. No window shopping. No looking for deals on Amazon or Craigslist just because.\n\nI said I was going to go to garage sales tomorrow morning until I realized that there is absolutely nothing I need right now so why even go?","589":"I have NetOnTheRun. It's Tmobile service. It's 45 a month for unlimited call, text, data, and hotspot. When I signed up they offered a $100 Amazon gift card. They recently asked me if I wanted 3 free months of service instead...I obviously accepted. It's damn good service. BYOD.","590":"I put it on an Amazon wish list and make myself wait until the next pay period to buy it (usually about 2 and a half weeks). Usually I forget all about whatever it was or change my mind, without all the willpower drain that comes from talking myself out of it entirely on Day 1. ","591":"You buy a SIM card either through Walmart or search for it on Amazon.","592":"Yes, I've done both Shopify and Square Marketplace.\n\nIf you need a custom design, have a budget, and can do the design work or pay someone to do it, I agree: Shopify is great.\n\nIf you need to sell online, and don't want to point your domain to your eBay or Amazon Marketplace account page... Square is great.\n\nProbably no clear-cut \"winner\", depends on the business.","593":"The way I see it, it covers everything from wine to to to vegetables or sweets.\n\nYou subscribe to get X amount of Y per month. Even Amazon offers subscription for certain things. Desirable because you can build repeat sales.","594":"I lived for several years in a tiny studio apartment that generated huge electric bills.  What was worst of all was that, despite how much I was paying, I was still hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The main culprit was that it was an old building with lots of cracks in the walls, and gaps in the apartment around places like floorboards and electric outlets, and also through the ceiling (I was on the top floor).\n\nI subsequently moved a short distance away to a larger apartment that had recently been structurally refurbished, and my highest bills in the new place are about what my lowest ones in the old place were.\n\nWhat I wish I had done in the old place was to get one of those laser temperature detectors.  They look like a handgun, cost about $15 or 20 at Home Depot or on Amazon, and read temperatures.  You can point the laser to get a reading.  Mostly people use them for cooking and other kitchen chores, but they're great for detecting energy loss points.  Using one of those would help identify the 'problem spots', and then address them accordingly.\n\nI would not go with the monthly rate from the electric company, because you get a false sense of your consumption.  I like knowing exactly how many kwh hours I'm paying for each month, and you can now go on the website of your utility company and see what your consumption is on a daily, or even hourly basis, thus helping you to better determine where the energy is going.\n","595":"What's an example of a product that you can serve better than Amazon?\nHow will you guarantee on-time delivery of my product if you don't have it in inventory in a warehouse?","596":"That sounds like a lot of work. I'll just let Netflix, Amazon, HBO and Disney replace the cable companies. It's working well so far.","597":"But wouldn't you have to order from multiple retailers to satisfy the variety you are suggesting? Wouldn't then the shipping costs to the client be prohibitive?\n\nIs this not similar to the subscription service now available on Amazon, which I believe offers a discount for signing up?\n\nEdit: This thing --&gt; ?","598":"Okay for example, let's say you wanted to send your s\/o a dozen red roses every month (or send any other product not on Amazon S&amp;S to yourself or anyone else on a recurring basis).

Everything we do is listed as an expense on the balance sheet. What do companies like to do? Cut expenses or increase profits. In distribution we are only left with one option. Unless a company is doing extremely well, which most retailers are not, they cannot justify the massive upfront expense associated with automating these menial jobs. They are comfortable with the status quo. \n\nCompanies like Amazon and other technology focused retailers will pay these costs because it is part of their business model. They are planning decades ahead knowing that all this upfront cost will eventually pay off. It is inevitable that these retailers will one day rule the retail environment. But that day is at least 15-20 years down the road in my opinion. \n\nAs far as an impact on my job, I will still be gainfully employed.

To make a long story short, when the economy tanked in 2012, I lost my full-time career job and had to come up with something fast. Since I was already doing so well with storage auctions as a hobby, I took out a loan against my retirement and started my own storage auction business. \n\nI leased a 5,000 sq ft warehouse, got a 7x14 enclosed trailer, and got to work. Within two months I was already turning a profit. A few months after that I was making over $6,000 per month. After the first year lease was up, I made a huge mistake and closed my original warehouse in exchange for a retail location with more overhead, less space, and zoning restrictions that led me to change business models and lose my loyal customers.\n\nThe original plan was to have my partner run the retail location with all of our \"nicer\" stuff, and I would run the warehouse. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how much work that would be and I was too shortsighted to hire employees at the time so I closed the warehouse hoping that the retail store would do better.\n\nUnfortunately, because the zoning restrictions (attempts at gentrification) didn't allow for us to sell thrift items, we pretty much lost our customers and had to work hard for new ones who were into antiques &amp; collectibles. We managed to do ok and break even every month with $3k in overhead, but we weren't making any profit and after a year of that I had fallen behind on my bills. This eventually led to filing bankruptcy\u2026 ouch!\n\nThe problem wasn't our store, so much as location. The spot we leased was close to our warehouse, in a really run down (ghetto) neighborhood and our target customers didn't want to travel to our spot.\n\nI learned a lot along the way - what I did right, and what I did wrong, and I put it all together into the book. I know there's already a ton of storage auction books on Amazon, but from what I've read, a lot of them aren't that great and don\u2019t provide real sound advice about starting a legitimate business. It\u2019s my goal to address as many of these issues as possible to take someone from hobbyist to professional, while balancing the needs of newbies and seasoned pros.","630":"Given it has to be from a reliable online source, most of the stuff you'd be able to get already *have* a subscription service.\n\nCould you perhaps name some stuff I can't simply use Amazon's subscription service for?","631":"No clue.

Or, that'd take people a month to get their items sometimes, maybe, so I guess that wouldn't be okay?","669":"Obviously not a necessity but I think it's worth the money, especially Amazon Prime.

Loads of shit is cheaper on Amazon than in the grocery store and I share the account with my entire family so we definitely get our money's worth out of it.","670":"Thanks for this thread, it's very eye opening. People that are usually saving lots of money traditionally own their car for more years than those who regularly trade up. For example, in California at least, the average car on the road is over 10 years old (50% of them or so). There isn't much salt corrosion and other weather factors that significantly detract from reliability, thus a longer lifetime. Looking for an old Porsche? It's the one-owner California cars that command the highest prices.\n\nThe idea of paying cash for a newish car (let's say 4 years old or newer based on the original post) is certainly smarter than financing it. However, with complete service records and a friend who has an eye for reciprocating piston engines, you can find yourself AMAZING deals on cars 10 years old or more that are better well equipped, luxurious, and in many cases quicker too. Yes, there are cars to avoid (Audi Allroads, E65 750iL's, any AMG Merc with 100k or more, etc) but there are tons of others that will go for way longer. Ultimately, these will be even cheaper than a 4 year old car. Use an 03' 530i sport as an example. Extremely reliable M54 engine, leather everything, sporty suspension, often included a high output DSP sound system, electric everything, etc. That's way better than most new cars and even with 100k miles, it will EASILY go another 100-150k for about $6k. It's a now brainer. However, if you want to be a little adventurous and do some wrenching yourself on it, lots of other doors begin to open too.

Theres too many legalities to worry about and its more profitable to just pump something. You cant short a product ya know, and how many companies will have only one competitor? You cant bash every other candle manufacturer and expect that to pay off for example. Far more capital efficient to just pump your own product.","681":"I'd cut cable in favor of Netflix or Amazon Prime (probably prime, since you can get it half price as a student).\n\nThe best way to make it seems to be to increase your income, though.

Even just cultivating a few casual survey and task sites (see \/r\/beermoney for suggestions) can help. Back when my kids were little, those random $3 Pinecone Research checks paid for gas a lot of the time.","682":"Relevant portions of life story as hopefully helpful response~ (this is gonna get REALLY long, sorry)\n\nI studied different kinds of engineering in college, kept changing my major because I was bored, got forced to take a comp sci course and surprisingly found I LOVED it, changed major to computer science with 3 semesters left, barely finished on time. Learned NOTHING in college that would actually be useful for real jobs. CS degree looks nice on resume but is not important whatsoever.\n\nOn my own I learned voraciously from internet tutorials, from StackOverflow questions  (by now, 3 years later, I've asked over 300 questions on SO myself), the occasional book, and trial and error. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a beginner's level, enough to do basic things. I had gone around asking professors if they had projects they would pay me to help with and one told me she would pay me (a lot to my pleasant surprise) to help build a mobile app in JavaScript. So I did. And I did it really badly! I had no idea what I was doing! I literally started off by googling something like \"how to make a mobile app in JavaScript\". \n\nBy the time I graduated, I knew a little jQuery (enough to know what it was) and jQuery Mobile (thought I would never end up using it again, not very popular) on top of what I already mentioned, was not really competent in any other technologies yet although I knew basic C++ and Python, and after applying to maybe a dozen places got a junior JavaScript job at small company near Boston paying $67,000. The interview involved me writing a function to generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, and then showing them what I would do to match a color of a real world item to a color on the screen  (literally held the item up to the screen and matched the color....really stupid question.) But you have to know little puzzles like these to get through interviews. The more of them you fail at, the easier it gets. I messed up my first one ever (with Amazon) because I didn't know mergesort yet-- learn your basic sorting algorithms.\n\nSo my first job sucked but I got some more practice-- left after 6 months and took a new job in Boston for $77k-- switching jobs you can always add $10k to your salary at min, just argue that you learned a lot and are a much more valuable asset now, etc. There WILL be someone willing to pay you what you ask. If someone balks at it, say \"Ok thanks for your interest, sorry to hear that, goodbye.\"\n\nThe second job was at a bigger, more prominent company with $1b+ revenue, and it was much much harder and I learned WAY more. The interview was MUCH harder-- implement call() using apply() (look up \"call and apply in JavaScript\" though it's likely too early to get into that), and also an algorithmic problem about finding and removing duplicates from an array efficiently). I was once again a JavaScript developer and I was still junior-- three of the other people on the team were INSANELY skilled and I learned a LOT from them, watching them debug and having them criticize my code. This was where I really learned to use Chrome Dev Tools well. LEARN THAT. It's one of the most crucial things-- learn to use the inspector and the debugger, learn to modify the CSS on the fly, learn what breakpoints do and about the \"debugger;\" statement, use the Chrome console as a JavaScript playground. Learn to hate Internet Explorer and learn how nothing works in Internet Explorer and learn that Microsoft hates web developers and learn that IE is the worst thing in this universe. Until like IE10 at least.\n\nThis job got me thinking about how inefficient jQuery can be, and how I can avoid using it here and there. Everything you do with jQuery, [make sure you know how to do it without jQuery](http:\/\/blog.garstasio.com\/you-dont-need-jquery\/). It also got me to understand how I can use the Network panel of the Chrome Dev Tools to observe HTTP requests and responses to find out why things might not be working. I also learned my first JavaScript framework at this job-- Backbone.js. Took a while to really get it even though it's simple. Also learned underscore.js. READ THE UNDERSCORE.JS source code!! It's relatively short and it's annotated and you can learn a lot. Make sure you know [JavaScript's quirks](http:\/\/bonsaiden.github.io\/JavaScript-Garden\/) and understand them well. Understand how `this` works and understand the prototypal inheritance model and understand EXACTLY what `new` does to a function invocation, understand what an IIFE is, understand why you should always use `var` and always use `===` instead of `==`. Understand why many people hate JavaScript and why many people love it.\n\nAfter I left (bored) after 8 months, I took a new job in Chicago for $90k doing the same thing. Had to learn AngularJS (another framework, the hottest one out there right now) before the job started; was easy by this point. Interview was easy too. It's kind of easy to find AngularJS jobs, but if you want to be really good at JavaScript and good at what you do I don't recommend becoming dependent on Angular or even learning it until you know JS and the DOM very well. Angular does too much for you.\n\nBtw, don't really like my new job. Interviewed for another one that would have paid $105k but they were rather rude during the interview. Don't take shit from people. You don't want to work for people who don't respect you from the get-go. They left me waiting in the room on my own for 20 minutes then couldn't even bother to ask how I was before launching directly into a technical problem involving implementing Conway's Game of Life (kind of hard but not if you've done it before). I told them I wasn't interested in the company anymore.\n\nAnyway, in my free time along the way (after college) I had been casting around for a project to work on to add to my resume and after a lot of moaning and wishing there was something I cared to work on that I was actually able to do, I discovered [this didn't exist](http:\/\/www.handsfreechrome.com) . So I wrote it. Had to google a TON OF SHIT and learn SO MUCH to do it. Took me 9 months even though it's only 1000 lines of code. I work slow...\n\nI also started a free python class in my spare time in Boston and taught that, stuck that on my resume. Just find things you're interested in building and try to learn enough to build them! People WILL ask you about your personal projects in interviews, so be ready to explain your design choices and defend the decisions you made. They almost always ask \"what was one of the hardest aspects of building X?\"\n\nIf I needed a project and didn't have one of my own, I would ask around (friends, family, acquaintances, small business owners...) if they needed a web application built (like a way for a restaurant to take online orders, for example) and try to help them build it. It would be hard as shit if it were your first one but you'd learn a LOT. By the way, learn how the server-client relationship works and what front-end vs back-end programming is. Learn how servers interact with databases. Learn Ruby on Rails or Node.js\/Express to build a backend for a web application. \n\nLearn git. Git has a steep learning curve but is very important. Learn what npm and bower are. Try different editors to see which one suits you. I like Sublime Text 3 personally, irreplaceable to me. Learn basic command line stuff -- `cd`, `ls`, `less`, piping with `|` and `&gt;`, `vim` (just type `vimtutor` on a mac or linux computer command line and hit enter, follow instructions), `cat`, `grep` (LEARN REGULAR EXPRESSIONS OMG SO FUN use google), `ssh`, `brew` or `apt-get` or whatever it is on your system, what `sudo` does in linux, [sed](http:\/\/www.grymoire.com\/Unix\/Sed.html#uh-0), `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `which`, `curl`. Take notes, make a cheat sheet. Learn through experience why we use the command line for so many things (it's just faster! you'll see.) Learn to make your own bash aliases. Learn that *everything* is different on a Windows command line and nobody uses that. Install git on your Windows pc and use git bash instead, which doesn't have all the linux commands but most of the important ones.\n\nI know this is long, hope it was a bit helpful.","683":"I would have to say swag bucks if you don't know already, a lot of videos and stuff. \nAs for the game thing, you can redeem Amazon gift cards and get games when they are on sale\n\nHere is the site [Link](http:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/)\n","684":"I bought Amazon gift cards at Smart &amp; Final that triggered the offer.  $150 in amazon credit for $75?

Last fall, they were offering $100 for charging at least $1,000 over 3 months or for charging at least $500 a month for 3 months in a row.  BTW credit card cashback and sign-up offers are tax-free because the IRS considers them discounts rather than income, unlike the case sign-up offers for bank checking accounts.\n\n\nI don't know if it's true, but somebody said you're more likely to be approved for a card if you apply online or by phone, at least if you received an application offer by mail or e-mail.

There's no shame is using cheaper machines, especially just starting out. \n\nGumballs can be purchased at Sam's Club, Staples and online at Quill.com or Amazon. \n\nNext is the hard part. Sales. Visit businesses in your area. Let them know you're a hardworking entrepreneur and are starting your own business. \n\nIf they need a push, let them know you're willing to turn 2 square feet of previously unused space of their business into a revenue channel, and offer to pay a 25-30% commission. Obviously, no commission would be better for you, so don't lead with this. \n\nVending machines do well in grocery stores, pizza and Chinese restaurants, laundromats, auto body shops, etc. \n\nThe national average earnings for a bulk vending machine is around $14-18\/head\/month. That's a great return on your $40-80 invested. \n\nHead over to vendiscuss.net for veteran insights and years worth of questions and answers in forum format. Good luck!

I would at least consider a grocery category card, since even though you may not buy many groceries, you can still buy gift cards from the grocery store and it counts for the 5% back since it just rings up as a grocery purchase. You could buy gift cards to places you plan to shop at like fast food, restaurants, Amazon, Apple\/iTunes, etc.  you can also buy visa gift cards to use anywhere, but you would need to find one that doesn't cost more than 5% of the card value to activate - so look for $200+ visa gift cards.

The idea that a company must be making money to be worth anything is ludicrous.  Snapchat has something that these deep-pocketed companies desperately need: attention.  They have users and those users actually, you know, *use*.  Having assets like attention which can be leveraged into income anytime is almost as good as having the income.  If you're just looking at the dollar signs, then you're just playing for this fiscal quarter, not looking at the long game.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth nothing that Amazon hasn't technically been profitable in years, a majority of the company's history.  This isn't because they're just scraping by.  It's because they're always reinvesting in themselves.  That way, they can afford to have flops like the Fire Phone, as well an enormous successes like the Kindle.  That flexibility to explore, test, and expand is also worth a ton of money, just like attention.  Amazon could be \"profitable\" whenever they want.  They just have to stop investing in new endeavors, but they don't, because that's playing for the fiscal quarter, not the long game.\n\nValue is a far, *far* broader concept than you're making it out to be.  Dollars are simply our medium of exchange, because Snapchat couldn't give Amazon ten million arbitrary units of user attention in exchange for ten million arbitrary units of flexibility.\n\nThink big, man.  They are.","715":"I would instead get Amazon Prime. You get so much more for less than Netflix alone.

The [Amazon Basics version](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00DIFIM36\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) is more expensive, and doesn't work as well as the other, [cheaper version](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mediasonic-Homeworx-HW110AN-Indoor-Antenna\/dp\/B008KVUAGU\/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) I bought. The reception stinks and often goes in and out on the AB one. We have three of the mediasonic antennas and they work beautifully.\n\nJust my two cents on the only Amazon Basics product I've ever purchased. :)","773":"Especially international (in my case, Canada). Shipping is often more than the cost of the cables\/small items from Monoprice themselves.\n\nThank you Amazon Prime.","774":"They actually price match Amazon too. It just has to be sold by Amazon and not some random user.","775":"Amazonbasics lightning cable. 6 ft long @ $20, and better than the Apple version. ","776":"The only time I consider buying anything at Best Buy is if there's a huge sale going on or I need something immediately. I consider the additional cost a convenience fee. Especially if what I want is Prime-eligible, I'd rather buy from Amazon anyways.","777":"I think it is actually 0.5% of your total purchase. You can choose which charity gets the money. Any 501(c)(3) is eligible as long as they sign up to receive Amazon Smile donations. When you pick your charity, make sure they have signed up to receive donations. It should specify this on the list. Otherwise they won't get the money unless they sign up.","778":"Also from the people that don't want to wait. I have a friend with more money then sense. He'll refuse to wait the two days from Amazon. So he'll run to BB and pay full inflated retail price. ","779":"This needs to be higher. I love Amazon but nowadays they're not the best deal a fair amount of the time IME for the items I shop for. \n\nHowever, because of the 2 day shipping. They figure most people will say \"eh screw it, it's only $4 more.\" and order from them anyway. ","780":"Not only do you not get the error, but the Amazon basics brand lightning cables are the most durable and long lived cables I've owned.","781":"I have a shit load of Amazon basics rechargables. The high capacity one. I use them in my dslr and they are great.  I also replaced the eneloop in my Logitech g700s mouse with one to compare and it lasts just as long. I can't tell a difference really and eneloops are the best. ","782":"I work at an Amazon Fulfillment Center and had no clue about these products until I started working there. Now I purchase amazon brand products all the time. The 10% discount is a plus as
