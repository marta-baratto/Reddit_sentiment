{"id":"48dp4g","author":"lunarbridge","body":"Hi, I'm 18 and a senior in highschool. My economics teacher told us that it would be wise to build a credit score early so it would be easier and to show I'm responsible when I buy a house or a car in the future. So I was thinking it'd be easier to open an amazon credit card, but stuff, and make payments on them. (They have a thing where if you pay the amount in full by x amount of months there is no interest) for example, I want to buy something worth 160. It said if I get Amazon credit, if I pay it completely by 6 months, there would be no interest and I'd be fine, I even went to length to call Amazon and verify that and the woman said it was true. If I open a card, what would I do with it after I complete the purchase?","name":"t3_48dp4g","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-01 02:12:29","week":9}

You can also get a few points for playing the apps for a few minutes and occasionally a survey about the app that you downloaded will pop up for a few extra points. If you refer anyone you each get 300 points and you will earn 30% of what they earn as well. The app had giftcards for Amazon($1), paypal($3), itunes($5), google play($10), starbucks($5), xboxlive($5), PS store($10), and steam($20), minimum payouts for each in the parenthesis. The conversion rate is approximately 1750 point to the dollar with apps paying up to 500 points, though for the most part they hover in the 50-100 range. http://appkarma.io/ that's their main website(for IOS it's only a webapp), https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appkarma.app&amp;hl=en (thats the link to appkarma of the google play store) If you guys could use my referal link to sign up - http://xkr.ma/m/odgyCfgfWo \nor simply download the app(appkarma) and enter your referer as pyroknarks that would be awesome.

{"id":"48h8l4","author":"AwesomeFaic","body":"Hi r/entrepreneur!\n\nSome of you may have seen my occasional posts here about my Amazon Affiliate site, [Venturio.us](https://venturio.us). This was my first commercial website, built around my personal interests and an attempt to fill the gap between novice shoppers and expert/enthusiast information. It's been around since November 2015, and since day 1 I've spent $33 dollars on the website and marketing.\n\n---\n\n**Setup**\nBorn from my interest in watches and the fact that many people starting out don't know what to buy (and that things like watches can get extremely complicated). I had some free time after work (I work full-time as a software engineer) so I threw together a really quick BootStrap website. I thought it had potential from initial feedback from friends and family, so I picked up a cheap .us domain (after choosing the name) and set up a DigitalOcean server. I used CloudFlare to handle caching so in case of high traffic I wouldn't have to upgrade my server right off the bat. The first month was mostly setting up the website. I also set up a Facebook page.\n\n**November Costs**\nDomain - $2\nDigitalOcean Hosting - $5\nCloudFlare - $0\n\n---\n\n**Moving Forward**\nNow that the core of the website was established, the bulk of my work was research, writing, and adding products. This is when I decided to monetize the website from Amazon, as opposed to Google Adsense as I initially planned. Because of the holiday season, I decided to run a basic Facebook ad, which got about 1450 views, translating to 21 website clicks and 1 Amazon sale (my first sale!). During this month I also received a huge number of Facebook page likes, however I still am unclear as to how and why that happened.\n\n**December/January Costs**\nDigitalOcean Hosting - $10\nFacebook Ad - $6\n\n---\n\n**Improvements**\nNow there was a website, domain, sales under my belt, and a limited social media presence. Most of late December and early January was spent researching everything from .htaccess files to SEO. A lot of work was spent in early January to improve SEO and keyword usage, as well as integrating Google Adsense in the site to improve the monthly earnings. I also started a blog portion of the site, [Venturious Posts](http://posts.venturio.us), and added [Venturious Pens](https://venturio.us/pens) as the second product category. I also ran some free user testing and improved the layout and design of the site, and started an Instagram page to connect with fans, brands and similar pages. Work has been a lot more demanding lately and I haven't been able to spend as much time on the website as I'd like, which is why nothing signficant has changed since early February.\n\n**January/February Costs**\nDigitalOcean Hosting - $10\n\n---\n\n**Overview**\n\nSince November 2015, I've spend $33 on the page. Since then, I've seen 5 Amazon sales, resulting in $4.64, and $7.94 in two months of Google AdSense, which has been very surprising. From what I've seen, many of my AdSense ads are images for high-end watch dealers, which could be explain the high AdSense revenue by a lot of my users just clicking out of curiosity.\n\n**Overall Numbers**\n~5400 page views, ~1150 sessions, 24.8% bounce rate\n\n[Google Analytics](http://i.imgur.com/3wwR6sg.png)\n\n\n~250 Amazon clicks, 5 Amazon sales, $4.64 earned\n~1000 AdSense impressions, 23 clicks, $7.97 earned\n\nSince November, I'm down $20.39, however if you combine everything I've learned and experienced since then, I wouldn't complain in the least. $20 for four months of hands on work, experience, and new marketing knowledge is a pretty fair deal to me!\n\n---\n\nThanks for making it this far! If you have any questions or anything I'll be happy to chat.

{"id":"48jlxj","author":"alveress","body":"We are a new educational preschool and day care in south east Michigan. We are barely making ends meet (especially when you consider all our payroll, bills, supplies, rent, taxes, etc.).  We have been open since September 2015, and we are projected to make money for the first time in March 2026.  We really need to find ways to cut costs while not sacrificing the quality care we currently provide.  \n\nSome quick stats, we currently have 22 kids on average each day (30 kids in the center each day is our max). We are making roughly $3,000/week in revenue. We will make more once several more kids start in September.  We are using Facebook to advertise and we should be maxed by September. This will bring in about $4,100/week. \n\nCurrent Revenue = $12,000\nCurrent Costs = $11,700 - includes everything!\n\nObviously we need to be bringing in more profit, so we must cut costs to survive.  We have a lot of business and personal debt to pay off from this business venture and this is my wife's dream!  This is where we need your help!\n\n1. One area we are looking to save on is supplies.  Everything from gloves, Toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, eat.   We spend roughly $1,000 on supplies /month.  For changing diapers we have to use surgical gloves (non latex to be precise due to allergies), these are VERY expensive.  We current buy most of these supplies from Amazon.com.  Do you know of a better whole sale supplies company that we can save money on supplies? \n\n2. Another area is food costs, we are currently spending about $1.35 / child for breakfast, and around $2.40 /child for lunch.  We are considering charging for our lunch program like our schools do.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Our current food costs are roughly $800 / month and we think this will save us a lot of money in the long run.  \n\n3. Lastly, our largest expense is payroll.  We spend roughly $6,000 / month currently.  We pay higher than all other centers in our area.  We believe in a paying a little more so that we keep our talent. So far this has worked really well. Most centers are consistently recycling people (we have had the same staff from opening and we keep adding as our demand picks up).  We love our employees, but maybe we can do a better job scheduling?  If another has any resources, books, or advice about scheduling for a daycare to meet ratio requirements please let us know.  \n\nWell there you have it, we appreciate any and all advice you may have!","name":"t3_48jlxj","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-03-02 01:48:09","week":9}

The adults both work full time. The 7 yo is in 2nd grade, 5 yo and 3 yo are in daycare full time. 27 yo is also going to school and will be graduating in June with a BA. 25 yo works full time but also has a chronic pain disorder that could change workable hours.\n\nIncome is $42k salary and $21.72/hour 40 hours/week ($45,177.60) for a combined yearly income of $87,177.60.\n\nTaxes right now are $316.70 (combined bi-weekly) and this will be enough to cover any tax liability for 2016 (due April 2017) with child tax credit, school credit, daycare expenses, etc.\n\n$98.08/paycheck (25 yo) for FSA for medical expenses. $286.58/paycheck (25 yo) for medical and dental insurance. $53.31 (25 yo) for supplemental term life insurance for the whole family, short term disability for 25 yo and hospital insurance for 25 yo.\n\nWe also have a cafeteria plan for childcare ($5000/year) that is taken from the paycheck but then reimbursed to our checking account. This reduces our taxes in the immediate. I will include the total daycare expense below but have not taken it from the income so there is no double dipping with expenses.\n\nWill all the deductions that are not reimbursed the monthly net is $5,629.69.\n\nExpenses:\n\n* $1350.00 Mortgage (This includes p&amp;i, pmi, property taxes)\n\n* $43.00 Gas (same payment every month with any differences adjusted annually)\n\n* $91.00 Electricity (same payment system as Gas)\n\n* $25.00 Water, Sewer (average monthly, but changes slightly)\n\n* $14.75 Garbage, Recycling\n\n* $89.10 Cell Phone (2 lines, $27.08/month for 27 yo's phone, last payment will be December 2015 then bill will be $62.02 - Tmobile)\n\n* $73.45 Internet (Comcast)\n\n* $150 Car Gas (this fluctuates and sometimes more but lately less)\n\n* $62.68 Car Insurance (Geico, 2 cars, 2 drivers $1000 deductible, comp &amp; collision included)\n\n* $318.50 Honda\n\n* $106.17 Suzuki\n\n* $36.84 Parking (both work downtown)\n\n* $23.75 Registration (for both cars, paid annually but save monthly in a savings account)\n\n* $455.00 Food ($105 weekly, average monthly)\n\n* $42.48 Dog Food (we order on Amazon and get 15% with S&amp;S)\n\n* $30 School Lunch\n\n* $920.00 Daycare\n\n* $28.36 Diapers (Also order on Amazon S&amp;S for 20% off)\n\n* $104.17 Medical (We take the difference of our family max out of pocket, $3800, and the FSA, $2550, and divide that monthly then we put it in our savings account. Yes, we will definitely meet the family max out of pocket - and if not we just saved $1250)\n\n* $257.85 Student Loan (25 yo)\n\n* $329.83 Loan 1 (consolidation loan)\n\n* $772.00 Credit Cards (various, detail list below)\n\n* $50 Clothing (put in savings account until this is needed for the whole family - if it's not used it will then be savings)\n\n* $20 Family Entertainment (mostly dollar movie outing each month)\n\n* $16.67 Gifts (20 gifts each year at $10 each - not removing)\n\n* $42.00 Dance (5 yo - using as a behavioral tool - can't remove)\n\n* $8.54 Netflix\n\n* $6.99 Amazon FreeTime\n\n* $30.00 Savings ($10/each for the kids)\n\n* $130 WooHoo ($15/week each for 27 yo and 25 yo - this is our play money)\n\nTotal expenses $5628.13\n\nMonthly Net: $1.56\n\nDebt:\n\n* $3773.00 Amazon Store Card, 0% int until January 14, 2017 (Then 26.24%), Pay $343, Min $38\n\n* $9857.28 Chase, 22.24% int, Pay $287, Min $287\n\n* $3881.00 Citi, 0% until August 15, 2017 (Then 19.24%), Pay $59, Min $59\n\n* $2618.57 Discover, 4.99% until January 20, 2017 (Then 22.24%), Pay $53, Min $53\n\n* $1433.99 Local Bank CC, 18.49% int, Pay $30, Min $30\n\n* $7560.39 Loan 1, 11.49%, Pay $329.83, Min $329.83\n\n* $3776.10 2008 Suzuki Reno, 3.09% int, Pay $106.17, Min $98 (take half of min monthly and pay every two weeks direct deposited from 27 yo paycheck)\n\n* $11,354.96 2007 Honda Odyssey, 3.09% int, Pay $318.50, Min $294 (same as Suzuki, but from 25 yo paycheck)\n\n* $33,408.68 Student Loan 25 yo, 6.55% highest int, Pay $257.85, Min $257.85\n\n* $47,983.72 Student Loan 27 yo, 6.80% highest int, Deferment until December 2016\n\n* $186,343.25 1st Mortgage, 3.75% int\n\n* $6286.56 2nd Mortgage, 5.75% int - FHA down payment assistance program\n\nWow, that was a lot of information. Now for lifestyle and life changes. The 7 yo will be in 3rd grade next year. The 5 yo will be in 1st grade next year. The 3 yo will still be in full time daycare.\n\nLast $920 daycare payment will be May and will decrease to $525. During the summer we are paying a family member $100/week to watch the 7 yo and 5 yo. When school starts back in Mid August 2016 the school lunch will be $60/month.\n\nWe are going to be potty training shortly so within the next 6 months diaper expense will go away (3 yo has some minor medical issues that could delay us).\n\nPhone bill will be reduced to $62.02 starting January 2017.\n\nWe do crockpot freezer meals and this is how we are able to keep the food cost so low. We spend about $180/every two weeks for crockpot dinners and the rest of the money is used for breakfast, lunch (weekends), and snacks. We've been doing this for about 3 months now and have been able to stick to it so far.\n\nDance, Netflix, and Amazon FreeTime are minimal costs to keep our sanity as parents. As is our $15/week play money.\n\nAmazon store card $343 last payment will be January 2017 and then will need to start increasing debt payments to other cards.\n\nSo, with as much information as I can think of to give, can I get some suggestions on how to increase income or decrease expenses? What are some other frugal ways to save money without being cheap?\n\nEdit: Typos","name":"t3_48u953","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-03 23:01:34","week":9}

You have to pick a product line, hope they carry it and a couple days later they will send you a price list for that line.

{"id":"48za4o","author":"Ichiwalley","body":"This is a repost.  My first post must have been deleted somehow.\n\nHello all.  I'm stumped.  First, just a brief background.  Late 20s, married, kids, $2.3k/mo expenses.  I work retail and make $13/hour and work 30 hours a week (voluntarily, I could work 40 if I chose), netting $1050 after taxes, insurance, ect.  BA in finance, no debt.  Wife is a SAHM.  Last year's FBA sales: $200k.  Net $36k pretax. Worked it 15 hours a week max.  I pay myself $1,300 a month from Amazon.  Got suspended for 2 months in 2015 over bullshit (long story, don't want to discuss).  $25k in the bank.\n\nHere's my dilemma.  Flipping is great.  I like it.  I want to expand into thrifting, eBay, craigslist, Facebook, ect.. But, the problem is: is it worth it to expand if I don't plan on ever going full time?  It's just a ton of work.  I was all gung-ho about jumping in into full time online sales before my suspension, but now I'm leery.  Even with multiple income streams I'd be leery.  I'm not at all interested in private label and building a \"brand\".\n\nI don't really want a desk job.  I can't find a job anyways; I've been looking, albeit not passionately, for nearly 2 years now and a move isn't in the immediate future.    I want to be self employed, but with one income, I honestly don't think I'm brave enough to do it.  Which makes me think I should just go balls out on my job search and really apply myself to it and land a good job.  I don't think that would make me happy, but it would be a more secure future.\n\nI'm just working so hard on my flipping venture and I don't know if there's a future there.  I'm so back and forth.  One day I'm brave, the next day I'm timid.  I've looked into everything: health care, self employment taxes, worst case scenario budget - and all the numbers check out, but I'm so worried about the future.  Where will flipping be in 5 or 10 years?  No one knows.  But I know with my degree I could be making good money in 10 years, just doing something I don't want to.\n\nWhen my wife goes back to work, I'll have less reservations about selling full time, but that won't be for another 5 years.  I don't think I can stay at my retail job for another 5 years.  I need to pick a direction.\n\nMy YTD sales for 2016 are only $20k because I've been bumming around.  I haven't worked much this year.  I'm like depressed about this - about the uncertainty and indecision.\n\nCan anyone out there relate?  I'm just so lost","name":"t3_48za4o","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-04 21:59:10","week":9}

{"id":"497vgx","author":"DGPR","body":"So I've looked around on this sub and haven't seen anything mentioned about the site \"One Opinion\".  I use sites like Prize Rebel and Cash Crate, but honestly the most consistent site for me is One Opinion.  Each survey pays a minimum of $1.  The minimum payout is $25 and the maximum is $100 but it pays out in the form of a Visa gift card.  I made about $75 in about a week and a half of doing surveys, cashed in my rewards and got my Visa gift card within a few days in the mail.  There is a limit per day, but most days you can make $8-10 easily.  Some of their surveys will boot you, but not nearly as many as the ones on Prize Rebel do.  There are no referrals, but it has paid the most amount to me out of any site that I use.  I even got invited to do a research panel that pays me $100 in the form of an Amazon gift card through One Opinion.\n\nwww.oneopinion.com\n\nEdit:  Proof is in the pudding: http://i.imgur.com/pKSgBG7.jpg\n\n1 point = $1.  You can see I cashed in 75 points for a $75 Visa gift card on the 24th of February which I already used.\n\nEdit 2 Electric Boogaloo:  As you can see by the time stamps, you can bang out surveys pretty quickly for some good money.  I usually browse other places online while doing surveys to break up the monotony of it so some surveys take me longer than others.  On average the one opinion surveys take 10 minutes to 30 minutes to complete.  I've taken surveys on there that pay $4-5 before.

{"id":"d0ity9b","author":"dat972","body":"As a mechanical engineer I have been toying around with the idea in my mind lately that patents are basically useless. This may or may not be true, but they sure can replicate things quickly and cheaply in China. I would say a provisional patent is probably plenty, especially if you are going B2B. That type of transaction isn't being carried out on Amazon its happening between managers face to face in an office. Its about the personal relationship so I would be less worried about some guy copying your idea and undercutting your prices by half.\n\nAs far as who to pitch to that is interesting. I worked for a vertically integrated manufacturing company that had plenty of shop workers (200 or so), but the guy who made the decisions on what to buy was the purchasing manager who sat in the corporate office. All 200 of the shop workers could have loved it, but none of them or their supervisors had the authority to buy anything. That being said if your product really does provide real value to shop workers pitching them would probably still be helpful as the managers/supervisors would know who to go to.\n\nAlso lunch and learns are really common. You could put together a talk on something and buy lunch for some workers.

{"id":"d0ixnuh","author":"discountphilly","body":"I haven't traded level 2 in ages. Most of my current trades are catalyst/medium term \"sniper\" plays. \n\nIf you want to trade level 2, you really need it to be your full time job. First you'd have to spend a few weeks just watching a few stock's level 2 to find set-ups that you can feel good about trading. I think if you're in college and have nothing better to do all day, this is the perfect time to learn. Put it on a laptop screen and keep it by you. Just watch. Don't trade. Just watch. See what you see. \n\nAs far as what stocks to trade... Think of it like ante in a poker game. I started with stocks that were in the 30s and 40s that have a range of a dollar a two a day. That way if I had 200-500 shares at a time, I wouldn't take too big of a loss when I was wrong. Eventually I worked up to stocks that were trading for 80-150, which had a range of $3-5 in a day because I was comfortable holding up to 500-700 shares and having them move 50 cents to a few dollars if I'm wrong. \n\nRight now, If I was trading, I'd want volatility and liquidity in ~$100 priced stocks. Really any momentum stock that moves a couple dollars a day. TSLA, FB, LNKD look good.\n\nOnce you really have your shit figured out you can trade stocks like GOOGL &amp; AMZN, which can move $10 in a day no problem. You need a lot of capital to get 500-1000 shares of these guys though and you really need to trust your method.

{"id":"d0j11ra","author":"metalmayhem9","body":"I got my first card (Freedom) after a Chase banker persuaded (pursued?) me for a few days. He called my phone for days, upselling the benefits of the card. Only cashback tho, no 5% or signup bonus. This was in 2007, long before the financial crisis and tightening of consumer credit.\n\nIt took me three years to fully understand the workings of credit card and benefits of maintaining good credit. Paying my bills in full on time and not going crazy with expenses was part of my habit, so that was a non issue.\n\nI started adding more cards once after reading a ton on credit and personal finance. Since 2011 I only got new cards when there is very high signup bonus available. Examples: Discover IT $200 back on $500 spend, Chase Amazon $100 in Amazon GC in $300 spend, Amex PRG 50k points on $1000 spend, etc. This way I was able to discount my day-to-day or large spending by 20-50% depending on the offer. I have been mostly working in retail fast food, been a student and very very poor the entire time in NYC, so this was one my ways of saving money.\n\nThere are other benefits too. I wouldn't go into comparing which card is the best in terms of other benefits, like purchase protection or extended warranty or whatever. I care about being a desirable customer to any credit provider. From my experience once a provider see that I have 2/3 good cards, they want me to have more cards from them. This way I can pick and choose which cards I want without having my application rejected ever. This is also helpful with existing banks. I negotiated things like getting bonus cashback points at the end of a year, waive late fee if I accidentally missed a payment (happened once when I was stranded abroad) etc. Having over $300K in available credit (~3x annual income) combining all my cards doesn't hurt either.\n\nTake a look at /r/churning and see why other people have that many cards. I guess this is a game for some people (including me).","name":"t1_d0j11ra","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-01 06:02:13","week":9}

I've marketed affiliate offers for 16 years now so I have a pretty good idea of how to do it, but there's no \"silver bullet\". \n\n&gt;Just built a small affiliate site to get into e commerce and not sure how to best market it / test the idea at a low cost.\n\nI'm guessing Amazon since you mentioned Ecommerce. Keep in mind this relies on a sale, which is infinitely harder to get than information which is why I prefer \"lead based\" CPA offers. Niches like insurance, loan, mortgage, .etc. You get paid a fee when someone fills out a \"quote\", no purchase necessary. \n\n&gt;Hypothesis include: writing more blog post targeting long tail key words, posting products on Pinterest and Instagram, spamming my friends and family hoping for organic growth through word of mouth.\n\nIf you ask me blogging is dying. Google has devalued content so much it seems that the only companies that benefit from writing content are already wildly popular. Right now, in 2016, podcasting and YouTube are some of the quickest ways to build an audience. \n\n&gt;What other strategies am I overlooking? Any good resources on getting started and common mistakes to avoid? What should my expectations be with respect to how much effort I should budget for marketing this stuff?\n\nI've included a resource below, but I'll answer some of this. You can expect to lose money at first with affiliate, that's just the nature of the game. It's the split-testing and understanding your ideal customer (and what they want!) that's going to put you over the edge. \n\nAs for a budget. I can't give you specifics. It's different for everyone. Ultimately though you want an unlimited budget for as much as ROI allows. If it's profitable, scale to infinity! \n\nMy general rule when advertising for a new offer is to give it 3x payout before I cut it, or try a new strategy. If street payout is $20, I'm only going to spend $60 pushing it before cutting it loose or re-evaluating the advertising platform for that offer. True, $59 is still a $39 loss, but at least it's showing some promise that could possibly be split-tested into a profit with tweaking.\n\nI compiled a pretty big marketing resource list a few months ago and this should give you just about every tactic there currently is. Just a warning, it's a bit of a rabbit hole so if you don't resurface for like 3 days - I warned you!\n\n[Internet Marketing Resource List](http://willhustle.com/ultimate-internet-marketing-resource-list/)","name":"t1_d0j2gu0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-01 06:52:40","week":9}

{"id":"d0j75y5","author":"Stuppsaqt","body":"My DD could be completely retarded but I hope I don't get stung by sharing it.\n\nI'm just investing in what I see and what I know. My original \"big maker\" (keep in mind I'm 20 and come from a low income family) was investing in fb at around 45 and exiting around 88 (I believe around an August crash) because I could see Facebook around me. And investors at the time were really downplaying Facebook as \"just social media\" or whatever. So I figured it was undervalued and I bought and made my first thousand dollars there.\n\nSo to relate this to SQ, I just see SQ everywhere I really go (I live in Southern California idk about other places) but the local businesses and even some bigger ones like the Apple Store use SQ technology. It's really downplayed and people don't see a lot of potential in it.\n\nI see potential because bigger payment processing companies charge too much for the small business to survive. I suppose they're kinda harsh. Small businesses sometimes have to charge you 75 cents for purchases under $10 just to help cover the fees. SQ caters to the needs of these small businesses. Cause honestly fuck paying 75 cents to use my own money. With SQ small businesses can have affordable payment processing.\n\nAnd yeah I know SQ doesn't make a profit. Neither did fb really (relative to its size) or Amazon.. Or tesla. But I believe they'll be valuable through having tons of users. And I guess it's a more long term stock for me. I believe SQ will be treating small businesses right, and you know lots of big businesses started small years ago. So maybe 5+ years from now some small businesses using SQ technology will become big.\n\nAnother reason I side with SQ is that Facebook IPO at around 40 and they fell to around 20 and everyone laughed their asses off then it went nothing but up since then. \n\nWell SQ IPO at 12 ish and fell to around 8 and people laughed. My entry point was 8.98 or something like that. It's been good to me so far. I am still a firm believer in FB, but I believe FB got too big and there's not much room to continue growing. I believe SQ is a baby and here's another chance for me to double my money again. But instead of $1000, I'll double $7000. \n\nHere's to hoping.\n\nYOLO!!!","name":"t1_d0j75y5","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-03-01 11:03:59","week":9}

{"id":"d0j9pvo","author":"teamboomerang","body":"I was there a couple months ago.  I was so burned out I was just going to quit eBay all together, so I cleaned out my \"warehouse\" (ebay room) and donated 3 bags of crap and put everything else on sale.  \n\nFor probably 3 months, I didn't list anything really, except for a couple personal items I wanted to get rid of.  I focused on ramping up Amazon, and I got a lot better at that.  I was mainly doing RA, but I tried OA again.  Before this eBay break, I couldn't really find much online, but for some reason, something clicked or something, and I started finding a ton of stuff, and way more than I could buy.  \n\nI also started missing the thrift stores, so I decided to only go on sale days.  My first day back at one of the Goodwills, I was shocked at how much more stuff they had.  I joked with some of the employees that I felt personally responsible for them having so much more crap, but as I was looking through the cramped racks, it was fun again.  I found a bunch of stuff, took it home, processed it, and waited until the next sale day to do it again.  I wasn't buying as much stuff, though I was still buying a few of those bread and butter items, and I was finding much cooler stuff.  \n\nI still don't list on ebay every single day, but I do like that the process is different because about a year ago, I felt the same way about Amazon.  That started to feel like some crappy warehouse job or something because that's just scan, list, label, ship, wait to get paid.  I took a break from Amazon last year, too, but now I like the mix, so when I'm sick of one, I just do the other.\n\nI agree about those $10 items, though.  A grind for sure, but it can be hard to resist sometimes when you know they'll sell in a couple of days.  I decided to still keep buying a few because I found if I had a day on eBay where I only had one or two things to ship, I didn't really feel like doing it, but if I had 10 things to ship out a day, I was more motivated.  \n\nI'm over it now, and it feels good again to crank stuff out because I know I can take all those eBay proceeds and buy all this Amazon stuff I'm finding.  I'm making more money now, so I think changing things up for a few months really helped.","name":"t1_d0j9pvo","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-01 13:42:38","week":9}

In the condition notes, I say something along the lines of \"box shows minor shelf wear, all product inserts and instruction manual is included, disk has no scratches or scuffs, jewel case has minor surface scratches, activation code works.\"  I send my games in shrink wrapped with the barcode sticker on the outside in case the buyer is collecting the games and wants the box as it is as well as to protect it from the dusty warehouse.

Of course the buyer is pissed and returns it because that isn't used good condition!  \n\nI know this isn't the same one I sent in because the barcode label is stuck to the box itself, so to prove that to Amazon, I take pictures of what was sent to me, including the barcode sticker, and I show a picture of something currently in my inventory that shows my barcode sticker to show that they do not match.

{"id":"d0jveyv","author":"im14andwutisthis","body":"I'm a fellow rootbeermoney earner, and I have a pretty big list of sites that I can recommend. Nearly all of them are survey sites, because they're one of the best ways I've found to earn money as a minor.\n\nMy favorite personal favorite site is [SurveySavvy](https://www.surveysavvy.com/?m=6766539&amp;c=120) | [Non-ref](https://www.surveysavvy.com/). Unfortunately, their surveys are infrequent, but they're usually pretty high-paying, they rarely disqualify you, and when they do, it's only after you've answered a couple of questions. They also have a really great referral system (Thanks!). You can get a payout at any time, but it's by check, which some might find mildly inconvenient.\n\n[YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/refer/69Xlsxdowpb8Bp7beZcPOw/) | [Non-ref](https://today.yougov.com/) is probably your best bet if you want frequent survey opportunities. I get an average of 3 or 4 a week. However, I chose to download their extension (which also awards you a few bonus bucks), and you may not get surveys as frequently if you don't download it. Another con is that the payout minimum is pretty high. They payout with Amazon, Walmart, AMC, and many other giftcards, but you need to collect at a minimum 30,000 points (~45 surveys which take 4 to 15 minutes each) to get a payout. Not only that, but 30,000 points will only get you something like a $25 AMC gift card. For a better prize, you need to rack up 60,000ish points for something like a $50 Walmart gift card, or, better yet, 100,000 points for a $100 Amazon gift card. All that aside, 4 to 12 minutes for frequent surveys is a pretty good rate.\n\n[SurveyU](http://www.surveyu.com/) is one of the most efficient money earners I found. They don't send surveys frequently, but the ones they do send are very high paying for a small time commitment. They payout through paypal and amazon gift cards, with a $5 payout minimum. This survey site is only available to us students, though, and signing up will take several minutes.\n\n[Xtrender](http://xtrender.com/?rc=NTc%3D) | [Non-ref](http://xtrender.com/) is also only available to students. Survey invites are very infrequent, but they literally only take a couple of minutes and payout nicely. They only payout with $5 dollar amazon gift cards. I've probably used the site for, like 40 minutes, and in that time I've already secured $10 of Amazon gift cards.\n\n[Innopoll](https://www.innopoll.com/), again, is one of those very infrequent but very solidly paying survey sites. It also only works with Paypal. It's unique in that all you have to do to sign up is give your email and maybe some brief profile information if you'd like. Once that's done, they will never contact you unless they have a survey to offer you, and you won't even have a profile to keep track of on their website. Once you complete a survey, they'll automatically send money right to your email, so be sure to link up your email that's connected to your Paypal. They'll occasionally disqualify you from a survey, but they'll never wait 'till half-way through a survey, and you'll still get some small monetary compensation.\n\nLastly, I can recommend one other efficient way to make money, but the morality of this method is questionable. [BestReviewApp](http://www.bestreviewapp.com/cusregist.php) will pay you for reviewing other apps. They pay $0.50 for you to review a free app. All you do is check up on the BestReviewApp website once in a while for app reviewing opportunities, take any app reviewing opportunities you'd like, download the app from the app store, and write up a review. Feel free to unisntall the app once you've written up your review. You can usually find 1-10 app reviewing opportunities a day, and you can take as many as you'd like. You can get a payout at any time through Paypal, Alipay, or Itunes gift cards. The English on BestReviewApp is surprisingly bad, and the website design isn't beautiful either, but the site works fine overall. I confess to using this method a lot because it's incredibly easy and efficient, but, again, the whole practice of giving fake reviews is a little fishy.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.

Look at scheduling to see if you can put off hiring a new staff person, and make use of the staff you have.  If you also pay benefits, run the numbers.

Don't get me wrong, online courses are great, but only if you have the raw talent to do the job. Personally, I can type fast, but I can't make the ear/finger connection, so transcription isn't for me.

If you are merchant fulfilling, you will be competing with other mf sellers, BUT you will also be competing with the fba sellers.  Many Amazon customers just blindly add to their cart, so whomever has the buy box gets the sale.  However, there are also many customers who will check out the \"third party\" sellers.  That's in quotes because the majority of customers don't realize that much of what they think they are buying from Amazon is coming from third party sellers because it is FBA.\n\nSo.....to answer your question, no.  I wouldn't take it off of Amazon just because others have more feedback.  If you are competitive in price, yours will still sell, though it just may take longer if you are merchant fulfilling.

The way I see it I will probably never be able to get another Chase card.\n\nI just called in to apply for the IHG on 2/29 and they are still processing the application. I did that for the annual free night since I won't be getting another Chase card like ever. I was wondering if I should go for another card too for the hell of it? Are there rules about application frequency? Choices would be United Business Card, Marriott Business Card, and Chase BA Card. I have never been denied for any card I've applied for, the last Chase card I applied for I just had to move some credit around in recon.\n\n1. 790\n2. Tons (this is just Chase): Slate, Amazon (ugh), Freedom x2, Hyatt, CSP, Marriott, Mileage+, Ink+.\n3. Not really sure. Was thinking of going for the British Airways card and going for the companion pass and the 100k points for 30k spend. I don't MS so this would be my main card for the next year or so. If I got the Marriott Card I would end up with 160k Marriott points which I could use for 4 nights in Cancun. United Card would just be nice cause I live close to EWR which is a hub.\n4. 100k AA, 75k MR, 40k UR\n5. EWR or any other NYC airport\n6. My wife and I really want a tropical/resort trip (Cancun probably) but I've also been eyeing Tokyo for 2017.\n\nI guess my mian question is: Should I even bother applying for another Chase Card?

They make you take pieces of other routes to make up for fellow carriers having the day off or sick.

{"id":"d0l872m","author":"_somebody_else_","body":"Lots of experience with Opencart &amp; Prestashop.\n\nI'd say it depends on the size of your store and how many products you aim to list. Also, how deeply you want to modify the visual look and whether you will need any advanced features/ functionality that isn't provided OOB.\n\nPersonally I'd avoid Opencart - I've used it since v1.5 but there has been a LOT of bad feeling within the community and the development seems to have lost its way somewhat. Daniel the CEO has a bad attitude IMO and this wasn't helped with him nearly selling out his open sourced community work to Amazon and Ebay...\n\nPrestashop is good for a medium sized store but they are blatantly trying to support partner modules and often if you want a feature that is not already supported OOB or by a cheap/free module the alternatives may set you back quite a lot of expense. This platform is quite resource hungry if you want a snappy experience so you will want a VPS at least (basic hosting will not be enough).\n\nIf you just want to start out with a handful of products and are after a smooth polished UI experience without needing lots of advanced features I'd recommend Shopify or Woocommerce.\n\nThe final decision ought to include the % cuts that various platforms take (I believe Shopify is the most ££ by default?) because you NEED to factor in cuts from their business model. Obviously Prestashop or Opencart are free by themselves, but your payment provider (Paypal, Stripe etc) will take a cut. Shopify and other hosted platforms take a cut on top of the payment cut I believe.\n\nYou can demo all of the above CMS platforms on your own local installation using XAMPP or equivalent. I would start here and try out the front &amp; back-ends to see whether they include all the features you need OOB.\n\nEDIT: Finally you will need to factor in the cost of any further development, either in terms of cost from a hired developer, or your own time. I have spent many hours working on PS and OC and if I were charging for my time a third party dev would probably have been more economical.","name":"t1_d0l872m","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-03-02 22:35:19","week":9}

{"id":"d0l9rkj","author":"TrappStick","body":"Rule #1, whatever you do make sure you enjoy doing it. Even if that means you enjoy it because it makes money. You simply have to be able to get up and do it everyday and not go \"Fuck, what time is it?\" - cause, dude, it's \"make money time\". \n\nThat being said, let's scroll through this list. \n\n1.) Med bakery. No. Food businesses have a fail rate of 60%+. Typically they have higher overhead than necessary, prep-time is a full-time job and then, well, you have to get customers .\n\n2.) Flipping. Cars? No. You typically have 2 options with cars. You buy them off CL or some classifieds for dealer trade-in prices and hope to get some suckers, or you go out and hit up the auctions and compete with everyone else trying to flip. \n\nAlso, you need a license (at least in the US) and in Canada I don't know how it works, but either way, you wouldn't be the first or the last trying to break into that business. Overhead is high, revenue is determined by your ability to sell. \n\nAs for flipping other things. You may as well get into Amazon FBA if you want to do retail. This way at least you've got the cash flow to keep operations running smoothly for a year and can really do some damage (in a good way) with the right product/market fit. Want more insight into FBA, here you go - [Ryan Moran has done it](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/building-a-million-dollar-business-in-12-months-ryan-moran/). \n\n3.) Convenience Store: Damn, bro. You like your low margins and overhead don't you? You're smart enough to be on /r/entrepreneur and ask for advice so let's try to bring your business ideas online where you can reach any market in the world, without the risk of getting held up (DDoS is another story) and jacked for some Twizzlers and all your Loonies. \n\n4.) Hookah Lounge: Cool story. No. \n\n5.) Vape Store: This is possible, but I'd rather compete with the vape guys online than locally. You could create a real brand for $50k with a good product. Why blow it on overhead in some seedy ass area of town pushing product to a base where 50% of them would rather steal it than pay for it?

{"id":"d0lbxx4","author":"010a","body":"Considering they're posting record YoY profits every single quarter, I'm not too concerned about them \"stopping progressing\".\n\nThe iWatch still has massive potential. They will get the price down, improve battery life, improve functionality; all this will drive adoption in a market which isn't very saturated. \n\nDesktop/Notebook sales are a cash cow. There are entire industries which buy mostly Apple and will continue to do so (software dev, audio prod, video prod). They've got the best hardware design teams here, magnitudes ahead of any Windows machine except maybe the Surface, and their customers appreciate it. \n\nMobile/Tablet sales do need work. I'm not sure what they can do to improve it. It seems like the entire tablet industry is in a slump; maybe it was just a fad like everyone has been saying.\n\nI don't think they give a shit about VR. All of the products Apple focuses on have an innate \"human\" aspect to them. They're built to supplement, not to replace; you can see this clearly even in their advertising. \n\nVR just isn't their wheelhouse. Its highly challenging software-wise, which is something Apple isn't the best at. Its first purpose will inevitably be video games, which Apple has shown interest in but ultimately never really pursued with any aggression. Its second purpose will be porn, which Apple hates. \n\nI think their next avenue will be home automation. I think we'll see Nest and Amazon Echo type devices from them within the next two years. Its a hardware and design challenge, which is exactly what they're good at. They've started down that road with HomeKit. It just makes sense. \n\nThey're also very clearly working on driverless cars. If we didn't have so much evidence that they were, I'd argue that it doesn't make sense for them to do that either, but its pretty obvious they are.

{"id":"d0lj7kc","author":"dotchianni","body":"Here are my takes on each of these. I almost didn't make it past #1 because the suggestion to use Amazon Prime (which I have avoided for years)\n\n**Shipping fees** are not always the horrible thing people make them out to be. Amazon Prime (at $99 a year) is out of my budget. If you use Amazon for a lot of your items then it is great! Otherwise, I am not paying $99 a year, or $8.25 a month, so I can save $5.00 on shipping and buy the item for two to five times the amount it would cost me elsewhere. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/48k9xk/fees_frugal_people_never_pay/d0kbwcd) says it better than I can.\n\n**Late Payment Fees**. While it would be nice to be frugal AND pay my bills on time, I don't always have that luxury. Sometimes I have to plan in the late fee that I know I will have to pay for not having a living wage. It comes with being poor.\n\n**Overdraft Fees**. I don't know anyone who hasn't mad this mistake! I have. But I work hard to make sure I don't make it. I found using cash is a better option for me during the month. I use my paypal card for things like gas or if I am planning to pay by credit card (because I get cash back). But for anything not planned, it's cash.\n\n**Convenience Fees**. Since I don't have a credit card, this doesn't apply to me. So... I never have this! YAY!\n\n**ATM Surcharges**. I am with you on this one! I found a bank that works with my bank so I don't get charged $5 to $10 to access my money. My bank isn't in the state I am in and I am horrible with checks (which also cost money I can't afford).\n\n**Partial Payment Fees**. I don't have the luxury of paying for insurance in one lump sum. Although I did find one that helped a ton. My van (soon to be my house) is older than 10 years. My state lets me permanently register it so I never have to pay a registration fee again. Soon, my \"rent\" will be set aside to maintain my van instead (and gas it up, buy propane, etc)\n\n**Foreign Transaction Fees**. I've never had to use this either. I don't travel outside the US though. I did a few times but it wasn't an issue with my bank.\n\n**Checked Baggage Fees**. When my kids fly to see their dad (lucky for me, their dad pays their transportation), they always fly Southwest. The one time we used an econo flight closer to home, they nickle and dimed us to death, had horrible service, and overall were not worth the \"savings\". We stick with Southwest now. You can find online deals at their website.\n\n**Overweight Bag Fees**. We have a bag scale at home to avoid this. We read up on what the bags are and what they should weigh and stick to it. We try to send one bag there so they can bring stuff back if they want. Or if they are taking stuff back to dad, they take two bags there, empty the bag there and fill it with stuff to bring back (like games, books, clothes they left, etc). This only works because their dad and I are still friends.\n\n**Collision Damage Waivers**. I highly recommend this! It's that I think *I* drive bad... it's that there are other horrible drivers out there. Actually, I am not allowed to drive right now and probably never will be allowed to drive again... but I still highly suggest it!","name":"t1_d0lj7kc","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-03 03:18:28","week":9}
{"id":"d0ll0pg","author":"hugeuvula","body":"Glad to hear you're feeling better!  I was diagnosed Celiac a few years ago and I've been through the switch.  I think my food budget is about 25% higher than it used to be.  \n\nAs someone else said, try to switch to rice or potatoes instead of pasta as much as you can.  I've discovered there's good rice like Jasmine &amp; Bismati instead of crappy minute rice.  A rice cooker helps.  For pasta-specific recipes we use Barilla GF pasta.  It tastes good and isn't as expensive as other brands. You might try buying on Amazon to save money, too.  \n\nBread is a tough one.  Store bought GF bread is $6 for a mini-loaf so I started baking my own using Pamela's Bread Mix.  It's a little cheaper per loaf and the loaf is bigger so it comes close to store-bought regular bread per pound.  Again, the mix is cheaper on Amazon - especially if you buy the 25 lb bag.  \n\nBTW, there's a blood test for Celiac if you want to try to nail down the diagnosis.

{"id":"d0lmonv","author":"Jancy52","body":"I'm in my mid 60's, and was forced into becoming very frugal thru no fault of my own, just really bad luck, some injuries at work  that cause me to loose my career of 40 years and created  a major reduction in income down to poverty levels, I depleted my savings over a two year period and  have no credit cards and own my vehicle (14 years now.) and live in HUD housing, on food stamps and disability,on both Medicare and O'Bummer care, and get energy assistance for my electric from our local county.  I also have VA available to me, I was active duty at one point!     I use free transportation thru our local Area Agency on Aging for rides to medical appointments.    I also have two adult disabled sons living with me  - so it's tough to make my income stretch and am very pragmatic about expenditures.   We grow a garden every year(we salvage seeds thru the year...  and restart our own lettuce, celery, onions and potatoes from cuttings and use a traditional four sisters garden set up - corn, pole beans, sunflowers  and squash!) I have a guy who pays me in eggs, milk  and manure for mucking his stalls.  I had to learn how to can and dehydrate food for long term food  storage, and I buy in bulk to fill my pantry using large air sealing containers and staple items for cooking by scratch.  I put Belkin on/off switches on every appliance that's  an energy vampire and a control switch on my computer and TV so it all gets turned completely off to (why use short warm up periods in favor of taking more time to turn on but using less energy).  I switched to buying the longest life LED bulbs I could find.    5-10 LEDs are equal in energy costs to one standard incandescent light bulb.  We gave up TP use in the bathroom in favor of a bidet. and we use a bucket method for showering - water gets turned off after getting wet, one the soaps up and the turns water on again to rinse off... doing the same with dishes.  I no longer wash my truck but use a dusting mop instead.  I brew and drink Kombucha instead of soda now.   This house I'm in has no carpeting - I sweep and dust daily.  \nI have fabric tapestries going into each room in my home to slow down loss of heat or coolness thru the house and have windows covered in heavy solar blocking fabric. This house I'm in is a rental and has central air and heating, but we use small space heaters as necessary - choosing to bundle up or strip down  to lighter clothing as needed.  I compost kitchen scraps and watch every dime being spent like a hawk.  \nI pay no bank fees ever by maintaining a tiny savings account with the bank where my SS disability check is deposited,and use my debit card for purchases without resorting to cash.   I keep an Amazon prime membership to avoid shipping costs and get free books and video's on Amazon.    I cut the  cable and use just the internet and use a RAKU for internet streaming.  I home make my dogs food per a recipe from the vet - I give up a tiny portion of my food stamp money to do so - plus when I cook they get some but not all leftovers (they can't have onions, etc.)  \n    Home cooking by scratch is very important to us as I control the amount of salt and sugar we eat this way, I've lost over 50 pounds since I was put on disability by home cooking.   I make bread at home and am learning more about baking as I go along.   We use baking soda and vinegar for cleaning, and baking soda for brushing teeth. I purchae no TP and use a bidet for cleaning after using the toilet.  \n     Being frugal when you have no choice is a hard, hard  lesson to learn, but one that can be achieved.  One time I ran into a financial problem, needing a lot of money,  and it took me three months of juggling bills to overcome it but I got us thru it painlessly somehow.    It may not be fun but i'm also not livin on the street! And I still have my sons with me, thankfully; and there's my drive, having my family together!    I scout goodwill stores and thrift stores as i need clothing, I use enamal, ceramic and cast iron for cooking and avoid teflon pots and pans due to the chemicals that leach into your body.   I am fearless about bargaining at yard sales, and to make extra income I refurbish and paint old furniture I find and sell at good prices or will barter for things I need, including bartering garden produce with neighbors.    See example of my art  projects I've made: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CupYwDo.jpg) \n [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/hv8lBjD.jpg)\n\nI maintain a food budget and daily menu - a complete chicken I cook tonight will also supply chiken for tomorrow's taco's and the bones will make stock for other cooking purposes.  I also make my own homemade yogurt - which in turn makes cream cheese for just pennies.     When baking bread I buy yeast by the pound in order to save money and keep the yeast in jar in the fridge so it stays alive indefinately.  Every evening I make dough and leave it out overnight to make biscuits in the morning.  My sons are so  spoiled, they get fresh biscuits, gravy, and  homemade jams and jelly and salt free butter for breakfast.   Or oats.  Or a sticky breakfast rice with sugar/cinnamon and cream.   We certainly eat better now than we did before I was injured.   I also use and cook foods in a pressure cooker so cheaper cuts of meat become more tasty and cook faster - saving my energy costs overall.     I can make a butt end roast in an hour on the stove top that would take 2-3 hours in a crock pot!

It only takes one customer to complain or one employee to inspect for Amazon to realize it. Nothing may never happen, or you might get permabanned tomorrow, or something in-between. Nobody here can tell you, it's like asking what will happen if you keep shoplifting - maybe nothing, maybe you'll go to jail, but either way you should probably stop.\n\nFor these reasons I avoid used toys/games almost entirely. The only time I'll bother is if it's absolutely brand new, very old or rare and genuinely collectible, or valuable enough that it's worth the trouble to list it on eBay.","name":"t1_d0mbj66","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-03 19:44:38","week":9}

I’d prefer to just pay a slight premium and buy from a store I know I can trust like Amazon.

Most of my selling revolves around ebay due to me doing a lot of used clothing. \n\nYet Amazon is a monster which can not be ignored. My first month was last month on Amazon and I did just a tad bit over $1k there with 17 sales. It would have easily been more if I could source more of what I'm selling. (I'm only selling items that list for a average of $50 and I don't do FBA as of yet just MF.\n\nMeanwhile with ebay, it's just so freaking easy to source used clothes, that the time it takes to do listings becomes my limiting factor. Yet on ebay I can charge actual shipping cost meaning I can afford to sell stuff at cheaper prices than on Amazon (my average ebay sale is $20+shipping) Right now I have 100 pair of jeans for example that I've yet to take pictures of or list. I have another 80-100 dress shits as well that have been sitting for 3 months since I stopped buying them due to time involved to list them.\n\nMy thoughts would be ebay is easier to build up cheap inventory but its time consuming. Amazon requires more money but is less time consuming meaning you can grow bigger for equal amounts of work.

After 10 no interest payments, there would be one interest-bearing payment of $343 next February. This would generate about $7 in interest. For simplicity, I assumed that card was fully paid by February. In reality, there would be a sub-$10 balance for the next month.\nI then went to the Chase card by itself and applied just the mimimum payment every month. I used the dropdown at the bottom of unbury.us to see what the balance would be after 11 months (next February ), and totaled up the interest paid to that point.\nI then started a new calculation from the February 2017 ending balance to determine the interest paid on the remaining balance once you could apply the extra $305 towards it every month.\n\nI totaled all these amounts to arrive at just over $2900 paid in interest.\n\n\nI then compared it to what seemed to be the mathematically optimal way. \nI started with the Chase card by itself and applied $592 in payments towards it every month.

Your excess payments now switched over to the amazon card until it was gone. This gives me the total interest paid starting from next January until the debts were gone.\nSumming the interest from the Chase card over the next 10 payments with the interest total from the final calculation gave a total interest paid of approximately $2,436.\n\nI did this because it seemed intuitive to me that paying the Chase down now was better for a true avalanche method, but I wanted to provide close to accurate numbers for you. The numbers may vary a bit based on your actual amazon card rate (likely not 25.00%) and where you are in your payment cycle, but it will still be hundreds of dollars saved. I hope this helps.\n\nNow if you want to snowball, it's probably better to stick with your current plan.\n\nNote: The reason this method is better is due to a combination of factors. These include the relative sizes of the card balances, how long until you start paying interest on the amazon card, the relatively small difference in interest rates, etc etc. If there were a bigger interest rate discrepancy, or a smaller balance discrepancy, then your current method would likely be the correct avalanche approach.","name":"t1_d0o2v1o","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-05 02:36:09","week":9}

{"id":"d0o73u4","author":"say_wot_again","body":"Productivity growth measures our ability to produce more stuff using the same amount of labor and capital. It has nothing to do with profit margins. Productivity growth is important for two closely related reasons:\n\n1. In the long run, growth in GDP per capita depends solely on how quickly productivity growth. \n\n1. Wages are a monotonic function of the marginal productivity of labor (MPL). Thus, things that increase the MPL of workers will also increase their wages. Increases in overall productivity are one of the most effective ways of increasing MPL (the other being increasing the ratio of capital to labor). \n\n&gt;  If business practices have shifted from increasing profit to increasing market share with technology, we'd see \"productivity growth\" decline without any slowdown in technological progress.\n\nThis is pretty close to the argument Silicon Valley VCs and technologists, like Marc Andreesen, make. They claim that the benefits of technology mostly just reduce the price of things and thus don't get fully reflected in GDP or productivity metrics. However, the article shows that this tech-centric view is not supported by the data. \n\nAs far as businesses shifting from maximizing profits to maximizing market share, what reasons would businesses have to do so? One might be that the market is still young and has sufficient economies of scale that running a loss to build market share helps the company maximize profits in the long run. Another more cynical reason might be that the company's investors are more satisfied by rapid, unprofitable growth than by actual profit. Some combination of these factors can be seen in the tech industry and in the behavior of startups and even some public companies like Amazon or Netflix. But there's little reason to think this holds true outside the tech industry and thus little reason to believe non-tech companies are shifting from profit maximization to maximizing market share.

{"id":"d0oj0nm","author":"wheres_my_2_dollars","body":"A few things: \n- I have found working with the average joe never made us money. They are always the ones that nickel and dime, expect stuff for free, and go out and buy their own IT stuff on Amazon or Best Buy. Average joe is low margin. Where we price ourselves, Joe doesn't want to work with us. \n- my best recommendation is talk to everyone about your business. Join a local business owners group (BNI, LeTip, Chamber, etc.). I am pretty sure every town has these. \n- a example of the above is this: my mom has shopped at a local jewelry store. I went in one day about 6 years ago for a mothers day gift. I was talking to the lady at the register and mentioned what we do and gave her a card. She called me about 2 weeks later because they were looking to upgrade their point of sale and wanted to talk. Fast forward, they are still a customer, they have 4 more stores, 30 employees. We provide them a multitude of services and they pay us ~$3000/month in recurring revenue. We started simple by selling them Quickbooks. Then we built the relationship and helped them as they grew. What I am saying is I have found that the most important thing to develop is relationships with other people. If they like YOU as a person and trusted business associate, your services will sell themselves. You don't have to be the smartest guy, have the most IT certs, or even have the lowest prices...but you have to be friendly and trustworthy and a positive person. \n\nWe definitely did our first jobs, when we first started, with the average Joe. And our prices were low. This was done to pay the bills only. As we grew we raised our prices and no longer worked with the average Joe. \n\nThis may have helped a little but I wish you the best of luck. Where are you located? Just a region is cool.

This brings down the P/E ratio to 76.15 from 361.25. \n\nAssuming Netflix is able to increase its user base, its costs per user decrease. The benefit of Netflix internet-based business model is that it enjoys significant economies of scale. The costs per user decline, revenues per user remain stable. As Netflix matures it would not be unreasonable to see significant improvements in EPS. \n\nNot that I would buy Netflix shares. But I can see how its price can to some extent be justified. Quite contrary to, for instance, Facebook, which is already a $300b giant and is valued as if its going to experience exponential growth over the past years. For Netflix to increase its EPS with 374% it implies cutting less than 10% of costs. For Facebook to 'merely' double its EPS (bringing down PE to ~42) , it has to cut 25.9% of its costs. \n\nAnd this all without assuming any change in revenues. Would argue that Netflix has much more room for expansion here than Facebook does. \n\nOnce again, not stating Netflix is a good buy, but I think it does not rank as high on the 'absurd valuation' ranking as some of its 'peers' like Facebook and Uber do.

{"id":"d0ozhqo","author":"cn1ght","body":"SPX is the S&amp;P 500 index.  http://portfolios.morningstar.com/fund/index-holdings?t=SPX This means that 1 share of SPX = \n\n3.26% Apple  \n2.36% Microsoft  \n1.94% Exxon Mobile  \n1.67% Johnson and Johnson  \n1.63% General Electric  \n1.47% Berkshire Hathaway  \n1.40% Facebook  \n1.32% AT&amp;T  \n1.32% Wells Fargo  \n1.29% Proctor and Gamble  \n1.25% Amazon  \n1.25% JPMorgan  \netc etc etc\n\nSo on day 1 you take take all 500 companies market caps and multiply each one by whatever % of SPX they make up and add them together [(AAPL * AAPL%) + (MSFT * MSFT%) + etc = ($103.01 * 0.0326) + ($52.03 * 0.0236) + etc] and that is the value of SPX on day 1.  Do the same thing on expiration day and you now have the value on expiration day, you compare those 2 things and now we know if SPX went up or down.\n\nThe intrinsic value of SPX is 100% the value of every single company.  The intrinsic value of SPX is whatever someone is willing to pay for SPY.  **You** as an investor cannot walk into a building with 100 shares of SPY and walk out with 3.26 shares of AAPL, 2.36 shares of MSFT, etc.  Some people can do that, and if the price of SPY varies too much from SPX then those people will actually break a share of SPY into individual shares of companies, or the other way.  But to be blunt about how this works SPX is priced by the price of the underlying companies and SPY is defined by whatever someone is willing to pay for SPY.\n\nSo, you as an individual investor can own 100 shares of SPY **or** you can own 3.26 shares of AAPL, 2.36 shares of MSFT, etc.  However those are NOT the same thing, the ETF SPY has tracking error and may be trading at more or less than the actual underlying shares.  On the other hand you can own/sell options against SPX without being able to trade SPX for stocks the same way you cannot trade shares of SPY for shares as an individual investor.  However, because SPY is an ETF you have tracking error and because SPX is defined by the underlying stocks there is no tracking error and it is the more accurate of the underlying assets.\n\nIn terms of it being a gentleman's agreement: no.  An option on SPX is determined by the underlying companies so a put or call is determined 100% by whatever happens to the price of the underlying companies and it is a contract to pay based on the price of those companies.  There is a very real and determined price for SPX and it is not just based on whatever someone is willing to pay for SPX, which interestingly means that you have sort of switched SPX and SPY in terms of which is more \"real\" in terms of having value.\n\nI should also point out that even owning stock in AAPL is fuzzy when you break it down: what the fuck does it mean to own 1 share of AAPL?  You own part of a company which have a bunch of assets and revenue etc, but if you are going to argue me on whether or not SPX has \"real\" value then I want you to explain to me how owning a share in a company has \"real\" value in the first place.  Both are identical: legal documents which are going to be respected based on something in reality.","name":"t1_d0ozhqo","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-03-06 00:05:12","week":9}

I don't know why you would expect to be tax-free, that's generally reserved for things like non-profit charities and even then their employees still have to pay their own individual income taxes.\n\nI believe the limit before you have to file a Schedule C tax report for business profits/loss is $400 in profit. Amazon doesn't take the taxes out for you, you have to do that yourself just like any business. On a schedule C you report proceeds (sales income) - expenses (money you spent running the business, like fees, shipping, inventory purchases, etc). That number is your taxable income, and you add that to your regular 1040 form. So if you had $5000 in sales, and spent $3000 on business expenses, you would be taxed on the $2000 of profit.\n\nI realize you're just doing this as side income, but unless you plan on earning less than $400/year you need to be reporting it or you risk dealing with an angry IRS. There's a million different programs to help you keep track, and you might even save some money since you can deduct things as business expenses. For 2015 the mileage rate was $0.575, meaning for every mile you drove on business errands (like going to the UPS store, or sourcing inventory) you can deduct 57.5 cents off of your taxable income.","name":"t1_d0p0srq","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-06 00:45:34","week":9}

It's *essentially* just a way of displaying the contents of your computer or smartphone on a bigger screen~~~.  I like the price, though.\nEDIT: This is the wrong way to think of the ChromeCast.  See the other comments.\n\nFire TV is okay if you are deeply embedded in the Amazon ecosystem.  It's a slick interface for Amazon products and services and if you have Prime, quite a bit is included.  You *can* do non-Amazon stuff on it but it's notably more of a pain to do so.\n\nApple TV (especially the new one) is surprisingly not as Apple-centric as the Fire TV is Amazon-centric.  Go figure.  It has a wonderful interface and is adding channels relatively frequently.  It does have integration with the Apple ecosystem, too, so if you're invested in there, then the Apple TV makes it all seamless.  It would probably by my recommendation if the Roku didn't exist.\n\nBut the Roku does exist and it does everything that all of the competitors do (save the deep integration) and then more.  Much more.  It's interface isn't as slick as the Apple TV or Fire TV but it's definitely far more friendly than the Chromecast.  It has more channels that you'd ever use.  It's pretty close to ideal.\n\nThe one big knock I have against the Roku is that there is no easy to \"cast\" contents from your phone or computer to it, ala the Chromecast.  Yes, sometimes that feature comes in handy.  I don't want to do that all the time but I do sometimes.  In that case, it might be worth getting a Roku PLUS a Chromecast, since the latter is so inexpensive.","name":"t1_d0pr351","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-06 18:28:53","week":9}

{"id":"d0q076c","author":"yetimind","body":"If you mean personal device, Kindle Fire HD (or one of the Fire tablets). You can download Prime content and watch offline. This is a great feature of Prime/Kindle you cannot get sans Kindle.\n\nIf you mean a device connected to your tv, Roku. I like the \"search\" function. On other devices, i have to go to each media vendor's app (eg, Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, etc) and search. On the Roku, I just go to the main page, scroll to search, and it will search across all the different media apps I have, but from a single interface.\n\nHaving said that, I'll say the Roku 3 remote has a known bug. A short, I think. My Roku 3's remote will decimate a new battery in 2 days. If you roll with Roku 3 you might want to buy a $5 replacement remote and use that. My Roku 2 does not have this issue, but it is not as fast.\n\nThere is a lot of buzz about Kodi right now. I think that is all misdirected. Kodi is a great app, but if you want to get a Kodi device to stream pirated content, you can do that. Be warned that you should not log into pay services with such a device, it is just too insecure. You can install Kodi yourself from source, or from a linux repository, and it will be a legit Kodi. These pirate boxes though seem sketchy to me. I don't watch pirated streaming media. I do have Kodi installed on my Mac and my Linux computer, but don't use any of the unofficial pirate media plug ins. You can use a Roku the same way, installing apps which surf pirated media. I steer far from that, don't trust it. I wait for movies to come out on Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, Flixster, etc. \n\nAs for sports, each sport has its own app, each is usually a pay app. MLB, NHL, NFL, etc. Pay for the app, or pay a monthly fee. I can only rate the MLB app which was excellent and pretty cheap. I haven't used it for a year or so and I think their rates have gone up.","name":"t1_d0q076c","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-06 22:44:52","week":9}

{"id":"48adyl","author":"jshogren10","body":"##Note:##\n\nI have formatted this post the best I possibly could for Reddit, but it is still has a ton of images and reads a lot smoother on my site. I am not selling anything and have nothing to gain by having you read this on my site or here on Reddit. So if you want to read this article on my site you can do so [here](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/website-investment-6-month-update)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Intro##\n\nI’m back with the 6 month update on how the $6,000 website investment has gone so far. You will see that things are going very well and it has provided an awesome ROI for both me and my parents. Before I give you all the fresh update, make sure to catch up on the previous two updates below:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - [I Just Bought a Website for $6k; Here’s Why](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/i-just-bought-a-website-for-6k-heres-why)\n&amp;nbsp;\n - [The 3 Month Update](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/3-month-update-on-my-6000-website-investment/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI would suggest reading those two updates if you haven’t already so that you can fully understand everything that I will be talking about in this update. However, for those of you who don't have time to read through the first 2 updates I will quickly recap everything for you below.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Quick Recap##\n\nI have been building/buying/growing/selling websites for the past ~2 years and my parents have seen the ROI that websites can provide and were willing to test buying a website as an investment strategy. I found a website making $500/month and I purchased it for $6,000. The site itself makes money from Google Adsense ads, affiliate links and advertisers that buy ad space. The past 6 months I have been growing the site's traffic and earnings and I have been documenting the process I have been making. That's the gist of it, if you want more details behind it you will need to check out the first 2 updates.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##What I’ve Done Since the Last Update##\n\nIt has been 3 months since the last update and to be honest, I have not done a whole lot to the site since then. I have probably put in about 4-5 hours total per month and most of that time has been emailing advertisers and optimizing adsense. The site itself doesn’t take any work as it will continue to earn at a constant rate due to the content being evergreen, meaning that it will always be relevant and will not age. I did do a couple things in the past 3 months and you can read more about them below:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Stopped Producing New Content**\n\nThe service that I was previously using to produce content ended up going out of business which left me with a decision to make.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - I could either find a new content producer via Upwork and keep the fresh content coming 3 times a week like I have been doing since I took over ownership of the site.\n - I could find a new content producer but, slow down the amount of content from 3 new pieces of content per week to 1 new article per week.\n - Stop paying for new content\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI opted to stop paying for new content so that I could take some time to determine if adding new content had a positive ROI for me. I have let this content sit on the site for 3 months and it is now time to determine if I should keep adding new content or if it is best to stop. I will be diving deeper into the results from this and my decision in a second but, I just wanted to let you know that I stopped adding new content these past 3 months.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Continued to Optimize Adsense**\n\nThe bulk of this sites earnings comes from Adsense so it is smart for me to keep testing and optimizing to find the ads that perform the best. Up until recently, I have been manually testing different ad placements and it has been a real pain in the butt to make changes and to determine what changes led to the most earnings. I was using 3 different plugins to get the ads where I wanted them to be on the site and I was unable to fully optimize the ads for mobile users. This was leaving a lot of money on the table because a good chunk of the sites visitors come via mobile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLuckily, I came across a sweet plugin that allows me to test different ad layouts and keeps the stats for each layout so that I am able to determine which one makes the most money. This plugin is called AmpedSense. The owner of the plugin actually helped me setup the plugin on my site and has been super helpful, great guy as well! Take a look at the screenshot below that shows the stats for a couple different ad layouts that I have been testing on the site:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStats from Different Adsense Layouts - [http://imgur.com/TFba3mK](http://imgur.com/TFba3mK)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt gives you all of the stats that are important and in an easy to read fashion. I have only been using this plugin for around 3 weeks and I am excited to see how much I am able to increase the earnings over a longer period of time. One area that this plugin has helped tremendously is for showing ads for mobile users. Take a look at the stats for the ads that are shown to mobile users. The “Baseline” layout was what my site was originally showing before using the plugin:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdsense Improvement for Mobile Visitors - [http://imgur.com/qn5wrSX](http://imgur.com/qn5wrSX)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIgnore the total earnings because the majority of it is from February but, I want you to see the improvements across the board with the new ad layouts. The CTR nearly tripled and the RPM more than doubled. This is HUGE. I’m excited to see how big of an impact this has on the earnings over a month long period. If you are monetizing your site with Adsense and you AREN’T using AmpedSense, you are leaving money on the table. I would highly suggest at least giving it a shot, it’s free!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Traffic and Earnings Report##\n\nLet’s see how the site has performed in the last 3 months in terms of traffic and earnings. First, let’s look at the November:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**November’s Traffic Stats**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverview of November's Traffic - [http://imgur.com/QQhY945](http://imgur.com/QQhY945)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA very solid month in terms of the amount of unique users and it was one of the best months since I have owned the site.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Different Traffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/t79hze4](http://imgur.com/t79hze4)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe majority of the traffic is still from social media, mainly Pinterest, with direct and organic following it up. Overall, solid month on the traffic side of things and let’s see how this translated into earnings!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**November’s Earnings**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdsense Earnings - [http://imgur.com/xFrD3P1](http://imgur.com/xFrD3P1)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have to hide all of the data from my Adsense account except I am allowed to show you the amount of earnings it made as well as the date. So in November the site was able to pull in $549.19 from Adsense! Through November, this was my second best month from Adsense.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEtsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/5q26yyX](http://imgur.com/5q26yyX)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNot a ton of money but, Etsy’s affiliate program made me $64.80 in November!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdvertisers - Another revenue source is selling banner advertising on the site. I currently have 3 advertisers which add an extra $136 per month to the bottom line.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Earnings in November:\n\n - Google Adsense: $545.19\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Etsy Affiliate Program: $64.80\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Advertising: $136.67\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal November Earnings: $746.66\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA very good month in terms of earnings and through November, this was my highest earning month yet! Also, since I have stopped paying for content there was no expenses during the month which allowed every cent of the $746.67 earned this month to be all profit. November was my best overall month since I have owned the site. The traffic has increased month over month and it was also my highest earning month. This is awesome to see! However, you will find out that in the next two months the site begins to see even more success.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**December’s Traffic Stats**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverview of the Traffic in December - [http://imgur.com/UDISOIY](http://imgur.com/UDISOIY)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was close to 40k unique visitors in the month of December, which is slightly down from the previous month. With that being said, still a solid month traffic wise.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTraffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/JIvtWyy](http://imgur.com/JIvtWyy)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe traffic channels stayed relatively the same since last month but, the organic traffic actually saw some nice growth. Around a 600+ more organic visitors and a 3% increase in the percentage of the total traffic from 16.8% to 19.5% from Organic traffic. This good to see because it means a bigger portion of the website’s traffic is coming from organic searches and is becoming less reliant on social media.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**December’s Earnings**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdsense Earnings - [http://imgur.com/FvyjnmZ](http://imgur.com/FvyjnmZ)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDecember saw a decrease in Adsense earnings, although $487.41 is not a bad month by any means!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEtsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/Yln1s0W](http://imgur.com/Yln1s0W)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$55.95 from Etsy! I am super pumped even though it is only 50 bucks because these affiliate links are only on a select few posts where the products make sense to promote.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon Affiliate - [http://imgur.com/8ouChJs](http://imgur.com/8ouChJs)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNot much, but an extra $8.65 was earned through the Amazon affiliate program. It all adds up over time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBanner Advertisers - Same as last month, an extra $136.67 from the 3 advertisers that pay to have a banner ad on the site. Nothing much else to talk about here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPaid Post - I had one person contact me to do a paid post on my site for $50 and I accepted. The content they wrote was good and I made $50, pretty good deal!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Earnings in December:\n\n - Google Adsense: $487.41\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Etsy Affiliate Program: $55.95\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Amazon Affiliate: $8.65\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Advertisers: $136.67\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Paid Post: $50.00\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Earnings in December: $738.68\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother very good month! Back to back months with over $700 in profits and you will see that the next month was able to continue the trend, more on that below.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**January’s Traffic Stats**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverview of the Traffic in January - [http://imgur.com/3jYn88U](http://imgur.com/3jYn88U)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJanuary saw a HUGE increase in traffic compared to all of the previous months. With over 54,000 unique visitors in January it made it by far the highest amount of traffic in a month. Let’s look at the traffic channels to see where all of this traffic came from\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTraffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/u58xco2](http://imgur.com/u58xco2)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou might have been able to guess it. Social media, Pinterest, was what provided the site with a nice increase in traffic this month. It would have been nice to see this increase in traffic from organic search because that would mean the content that I was producing 3 months ago is starting to see some rankings and bring in traffic. Nonetheless, still a nice surge in traffic so let’s check out if this was able to lead to an increase in earnings as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**January’s Earnings**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGoogle Adsense - [http://imgur.com/g9D9K2F](http://imgur.com/g9D9K2F)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat’s what I like to see! $641.85 was made this month via Adsense, which is $100+ higher than any other month.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEtsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/Tp7d8CI](http://imgur.com/Tp7d8CI)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA solid $54.50 made from Etsy in January as well, not bad!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdvertisers - Same thing as the previous months here, $136.67 was made from 3 different advertisers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Earnings in January:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Google Adsense: $641.85\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Etsy Affiliate Program: $54.50\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Advertisers: $136.67\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Earnings in January: $833.58\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy best month yet! Thanks to the increase in traffic, there was a nice boost in the Adsense earnings which led to the really good month overall. If I am able to keep up this amount of traffic and combine that with my newly optimized Adsense layout thanks to AmpedSense, I should see some higher earning months coming up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##The First 3 Months vs. The Last 3 Months##\n\nNow that I have owned the site for 6 months I can now split that time in half and see what kind of growth the site has seen when comparing the first 3 months to the last 3 months. 3 months is a long enough period to get a good idea of whats working and what isn’t. I will also be able to see the areas of most growth and where I could improve. This whole next section of this article will be comparing various stats from the first 3 months to the last 3 months, should be fun :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Overall Traffic**\n\nThis is one of the most important metrics to any website and seeing growth month to month is vital to constantly improving the site. Let’s see how the first 3 months of traffic compared to the last 3:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst 3 Months Traffic vs. Last 3 Months Traffic - [http://imgur.com/jq6rqHz](http://imgur.com/jq6rqHz)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe image above shows the traffic stats from the first 3 months compared to the last 3 months. You can see that there has been some nice growth. There was a 23.85% increase in unique visitors in the last 3 months, which is a substantial increase! The # of sessions and pageviews also saw a nice boost.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pinterest Traffic**\n\nThis is the sites main traffic driver and it accounts for over 50% of the sites traffic since I have gained ownership. I would like to see the site be less dependent on Pinterest for traffic but, nonetheless, it is still driving a ton of traffic each day. Let’s check out the growth it has seen from the first 3 months to the last.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst 3 months vs last 3 months - [http://imgur.com/kxw076e](http://imgur.com/kxw076e)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first 3 months Pinterest drove 67,000 visitors and in the last 3 months it drove over 80,000, which comes out to a 19% increase! One of the major reasons for the increase is due to a handful of the new articles I published that went viral within Pinterest and they continually drive 100+ visitors a day back to the site. Pinterest is different from the rest of the social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook because the content on Pinterest does not get lost in the past. Old posts will continue to drive traffic on Pinterest because people use it as a search engine and popular posts will rank well. This makes Pinterest a very solid traffic source because it isn’t just one-off traffic, it is consistent and will continue to grow if you keep posting on Pinterest.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Organic Search Traffic**\n\nIncreasing the organic search traffic was a major focus during the first 3 months that I owned the site. I added a total of 42 new articles to the site during that time period and it will be interesting to see how well the organic traffic increased since then.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst 3 Months vs. Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/hvriZcK](http://imgur.com/hvriZcK)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was a solid 33% growth in organic search traffic from the first 3 months to the last 3 months, which is pretty darn good! Organic traffic increased from 18,000 to 24,000, which is about an extra 2,000 visitors per month in the last 3 months. I think the site will continue to see growth over the next 6+ months as well because all of the articles will have enough time to settle into Google and start to rank for longtail keywords. So I would expect the organic traffic to keep rising over the next few months.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Keyword Growth**\n\nOne of my favorite tools, Semrush, does an awesome job of showing the growth that your site has seen in keyword rankings and how well that translates to traffic. Let’s check out how my site looks in Semrush:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTraffic Growth via Semrush - [http://imgur.com/SH2EOWP](http://imgur.com/SH2EOWP)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you can see, a good surge in traffic growth according to Semrush. Semrush tracks keywords your site ranks for within the top 100 of Google and translates that to search traffic by looking at the monthly search amount. According to Semrush, my traffic grew by 100% but, as we saw earlier it actually grew by only 33%. So Semrush isn’t 100% accurate but I still feel like it does a good job of showing growth.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Keyword Rankings**\n\nLike I said, Semrush tracks the amount of keywords that your site ranks for within the top 100 and you can see how many keywords you ranked for 6 months ago vs. now. That is what we will look at now:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKeyword Rankings 6 Months Ago According to Semrush - [http://imgur.com/hbyWz5P](http://imgur.com/hbyWz5P)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6 months ago I had just over 4,000 keywords ranking within the top 100 of Google. I feel like the keywords ranking within the top 10 of Google are the most important, so we will mainly look at that number. There were 18 keywords in the top 3 and 192 ranking in the 4-10 positions, which comes out to a total of 210 keywords ranking in the top 10 of Google. Now let’s compare that to my most recent month, which was 6 months later:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKeyword Rankings in January According to Semrush (6 months later) - [http://imgur.com/W87AfRC](http://imgur.com/W87AfRC)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6 months later I am ranking for close to 6,000 keywords within Google, which is close to 2,000 MORE than it was 6 months ago. Now let’s look at the top 10 rankings. There are 29 keywords in the top 3 of Google and 212 ranking in the 4-10 position range, which is a total of 241 keywords ranking within the top 10. The site is ranking for 31 more keywords in the top 10 compared to 6 months ago, which is a solid improvement. As you can probably tell, the majority of the keywords are ranking in the ranges of 21-50 position and 51-100 position. These keywords in these ranges don’t bring in a lot of traffic but, they do have the potential to increase in ranking over time. I think the 42 new articles I published on the site have accounted for a lot of the keywords ranking in this range, so I am hoping that after a couple more months they will be able to move up higher.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Adsense Earnings**\n\nThe Adsense earnings account for the bulk of my site’s earnings and I have also put a huge emphasis on trying to optimize these ads. Let’s take a look at how they have been performing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdsense Earnings from the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/ZKNlF3O](http://imgur.com/ZKNlF3O)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the first 3 months the site earned $1,333.65 from Adsense, which comes out to $444.55 per month. This isn’t terrible by any means and is still a solid chunk of money each month.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdsense Earnings from the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/3U9J12g](http://imgur.com/3U9J12g)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the last 3 months the site has earned a total of $1,678.45 from Adsense, this averages out to $559.48 per month! This is a $100+ increase per month which I am really happy about. This growth I think is mainly due to the increase in traffic the site has seen because with Adsense, more traffic = more earnings. However, I am super pumped to see how the earnings grow now that I have been using AmpedSense which has allowed me to fully test different ad layouts. I am thinking that I will be seeing some nice growth over the next few months in terms of Adsense earnings.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Total Site Earnings**\n\nOne of the most important metrics to track are the earnings and to compare the first 3 months to the last 3 months. This is looking at the earnings from all of the different sources as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEarnings from the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/UGpvEza](http://imgur.com/UGpvEza)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFeel free to ignore the traffic stats section as it is in the same spreadsheet that I keep my earnings in so it was caught in the screesnhot. However, in the orange box you can see the earnings by each month. There was a total of $1543.61 earned during this period which averages out to $514.54 per month in earnings. Not bad!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEarnings from the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/xCvaHS6](http://imgur.com/xCvaHS6)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce again, feel free to ignore the traffic stats and the large black blob. The total earnings for the last 3 months was $2318.92 and that comes out to $772.97 per month! This a large upgrade over the previous 3 months. In the last 3 months, the site was able to generate $775.31 more money and $258.44 more per month! This is some awesome growth and it was from a combination of things, one major reason was that I was able to land some advertisers that added a quick increase in earnings. That combined with the Adsense improvements helped increase the monthly earnings.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Total Site Profits**\n\nProfit, by far the most important metric for any business and it’s funny because a lot of people seem to ignore this stat in their business and only look at the revenue. You can have all of the revenue that you want but, if that doesn’t translate to making ACTUAL money what does it matter? So the last thing that we are going to compare is the profit that the site made:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nProfits in the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/U7gMrzH](http://imgur.com/U7gMrzH)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was a good chunk of expenses within the first 3 months since I was paying for content to be written at a pretty rapid pace, which caused there to be a large expense per month for new content. You may or may not noticed but, the profits are a bit higher than I reported in the last update due to my content writer giving me a partial refund for the content that they didn’t write for me. So if you noticed the discrepancy between these numbers and the the 3 month update that is why. The first 3 months accounted for $983.61 in profit, which is $327.87 in profit per month. This would value the site at right around $6,500 based on the 20x multiple if I were to sell it at this point. Let’s see how that value changed over the next 3 months.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nProfits in the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/acCsv2v](http://imgur.com/acCsv2v)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can see right away that these months were WAY better, mainly due to their being no expenses combined with a solid increase in earnings. A total of $2318.92 was earned in profit during this time and that comes out to be $772.97 per month. With the new 3 month average being $772.97 per month in profit, the site is now valued at around $15,500 if I were to sell it now! Remember, I bought the site for $6,000. I will touch on the subject of selling the site and the current value in a minute.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Current Return on Investment##\n\nRemember that this website is acting as an investment vehicle and it needs to be giving a solid ROI for the investors, which are my parents. So let’s see the type of ROI they have seen so far from this website. Just as a refresher, my parents and I split the monthly profits 50/50.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Profit - [http://imgur.com/XPnK3aG](http://imgur.com/XPnK3aG)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe site has made a total of $3302.53 in profit since I took over ownership. This means that my parents have made a total of $1,651.26 on their $6,000 investment over a 6 month period.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What kind of ROI is this?**\n\nMy parents have seen a 27.5% ROI on their initial investment! Over a year long period, this would come out be a 55% yearly ROI, which is 5x better than the average stock market investment, especially during the current market conditions. Not only are my parents getting an awesome ROI on their investment each month but, I am also building up a sellable asset along the way that I can cash out whenever I want. It is hard to find an investment that provides this type of upside. I now want to walk through the idea of possibly selling the site and what kind of ROI we would see if we decided to go this route.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Should we Sell?##\n\nNow that I have owned the site for 6 months and have a solid track record of earnings and of the traffic, we could now sell the site if we wanted to. Also, by not paying for new content and increasing the monthly earnings the last couple of months I have been able to maximize the site’s value. So right now would be a good time to sell the site if we wanted to. I’m not sure I have mentioned this before but, my parents buy houses and repair them and then flip them or rent them out. They basically do what I do with websites but with real estate. It runs in the family I guess :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, my point of bringing this up is that they are looking to purchase another house and they would like cash from this website out so they can use the money with the new house they buy. So that means my parents are looking to sell the site pretty soon.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##ROI If We Sold the Site Now##\n\nIf we decided to sell the site right now, based on the earnings through January, the site would be valued at around $15,500. I would probably sell the site through Empire Flippers which they they would take 15% of the sale price as a selling fee so we need to take that into account. This would mean that we would get around $13,200 for the site after the 15% fee is taken out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe agreement that I had with my parents for when we sold the site is that they would get their initial investment back of $6,000 and then we would split the rest 50/50. So after they got their $6k back there would be $7,200 to split between us from the $13,200 we made from the sale of the site. This would come out $3,600 for my parents and $3,600 for myself. Now, we add this $3,600 made from the sale of the site with the $1,651.26 of monthly profits from the past 6 months and that comes out to a total of $5,251.16 in PROFIT for my parents and the same amount of profit for myself. In this 6 month period, my parents made $5,251.26 in profit on a $6,000 investment, that comes out a 87.5% ROI through 6 months. That is an insane ROI in a very short period of time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’m going to quickly break these numbers down so it is easier to digest:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Breakdown of My Parents ROI:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Total Monthly Profits: $1,651.26\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Profit from Site Sale: $3,600\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Total Profits: $5,251.26\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Initial Investment: $6,000\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n - Return on Investment (through 6 months): 87.5%\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy parents will be very happy with this kind of return and I am truly excited to be able to help my parents out as well. They were nice enough and believed in me enough to invest $6,000 into my idea and it looks like it is going to work out well. I’m extremely grateful, thanks mom and dad :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Is Money Being Left on the Table?##\n\nIf we sell the site within the next month do I think there is some money being left on the table? Yes, I do. I think that the content that I published on the site 3 months ago is just starting to gain some traction within Google and I think continuing to add content will help grow the site. I also think that the Pinterest traffic will continue to grow if I keep adding new content as well. Combine this traffic growth with the fact that I am now truly able to optimize adsense ads with AmpedSense and  I think the site could get to $1,000 per month in profit within 3-6 months from now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAre we losing out on a TON of money? No, not really. I just feel like the site hasn’t reached it’s potential yet. However, I am 100% fine with selling the site. Please don’t think that I am complaining about my parents wanting to sell the site, because that is not what I am doing at all. I am just being completely honest with you all and saying that I think the site still has more potential.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Wrapping Things Up##\n\nMy parents and I have made the decision to let it earn for one more month and then see what kind of valuation it will get from Empire Flippers. Depending on how they value the site we will either list our site for sale or keep it longer. We will be making this decision at the end of February and I will make sure to keep you all up to date on what we do. Thank you all for reading and I hope you enjoyed the 6 month update on the website investment. I hope that I have opened your eyes on the crazy ROI websites can provide you with.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFeel free to leave any questions or comments below, I will be around answering all questions!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Link](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/website-investment-6-month-update/) to original post on my site","name":"t3_48adyl","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-29 15:17:28","week":9}

{"id":"48bhgl","author":"teliotsauce","body":"Howdy everybody,\n\nI've got a few questions about creating my own product/brand. If anybody has some knowledge they're willing to dish out I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nI've been interested in selling on Amazon by importing goods. I've read a lot of really shitty blogs and a couple great ones. The conclusion I've come to is that I shouldn't put all my eggs in Amazon. So I'm going to have my own website and sell via other options as well.\n\nA lot of people are also saying that you should sell stuff that you know and love, which I think is understandable. I found a niche I'm really into and know about. I have found a few different possible suppliers. I know how to use these products and which ones are good and why they're good, but I don't know how to make them. Without getting specific they're particular cleaning chemicals.\n\nThe potential suppliers seem willing to talk about fragrances, color, and everything else. They're obviously willing to send samples. I can pick out the options until I get a product I'm satisfied with. This is all cool, but I don't know how to make it. That seems like a bad idea. \n\nOnce I get a good product could I have them send me the exact ingredients just in case the supplier fell through, or something bad like that happened? It also feels weird because I'm just giving direction and not making the actual product- is this a bad thing or does it matter?\n\nAlso most of the potential suppliers are in China, but a few are in the U.S. I'm a little concerned about chemicals not thrown together here (I'm sure the customer might be concerned as well).\n\nIf anybody wants to throw in what they think, or anything really, I would appreciate it.","name":"t3_48bhgl","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-29 19:03:06","week":9}

As far as I know, Google Wallet is like Venmo, except you have to pay by only debit card, whereas Venmo offers the ability to pay using a debit OR bank account. PayPal you can use bank, credit, or debit. That's why you see people offering 75-80% BTC for Amazon and people sell them at those rates for BTC to amazon, even though amazon sells fairly quickly at 85-90%. There are websites backed with millions in funding that convert money to BTC for a 1% fee, yet BTC is worth more trading in general since it's not as common.\n\nEdit: Don't know why this is being downvoted, I listed a reason why people value one type of payment method over the other. Not as many people have Google Wallet as opposed to PayPal buyers.

{"id":"d0i744q","author":"Dragonsven","body":"Pay off your credit card first.\n\nThe rest of your questions really depend on the amount of time you want to put into managing your investments and what your time horizon is.  You should have what you need to live for 6 months saved and liquid before you consider investing as well.\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed with individual stocks, most people here would recommend an index fund of some type.\n\nDo you have a 401k through your employer?\n\nedit: Some general finance tips\n\n1) Reevaluate your credit card and whether you should get a different one or have more than one.  It depends on what you spend most of your money on, but search out ones that give you the maximum amount of points back for what you consistently spend cash on.  I use a combination of Chase Freedom and Chase Amazon for maximum cash back on Amazon / Gas / Groceries.  /r/churning has a lot of information about these types of cards to make a well-informed decision.  \n\n2) Buy everything with credit cards.  This maximizes the free money you are getting from them.  Never buy things with your points.  Only apply them as a credit to pay off your credit card or put as cash into your checking account.  This doesn't apply if you chose a miles card because you like to travel a lot.\n\n3) Make sure you are maximizing your employee match on your 401k if you have one.  If they match up to 6%, put 6% or more.  At your age you should be using a nearly 100% stock allocation.  At most, I would put 10% of your 401k into bonds but at your age I was 100% stocks.\n\n4) If you've done all this and you have a 6 month safety fund in a savings account; now you can decide how you want to invest your remaining savings.  The main factors that determine what you should invest in and how much are what your plans for the future are.  Do you want to buy a house?  Do you want to get married?  These types of plans will determine how liquid you need your investments to be and in what amounts.  If you don't want to actively manage it and it's just for retirement, I would put as much money as you can afford into your 401k.  $18,000 per year is the current maximum.\n\n5) If you can afford to maximize your 401k and you still have money left over then I would consider opening an IRA.\n\n6) If you don't want to actively manage your investment and you want liquidity that a 401k or IRA can't offer, you should invest into an index fund.  There's a ton of information on these in /r/personalfinance.\n\n7) If you can't afford to have your money locked up for 2+ years I would recommend avoiding stocks altogether and put it into bonds, CDs, or pay off your debt.  This is very low return but is also low risk.  There will always be short term volatility in stocks so if you can't afford to hold for a good amount of time they are a very risky proposition.\n","name":"t1_d0i744q","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-29 17:50:12","week":9}

Or if you use amazon a lot, you can get an Amazon card that gives you 1% everywhere, 2% some places, and 3% on amazon purchases.\n4. Did I mention paying it off every month? Yeah, that.\n5. If you haven't done anything to build credit and don't currently have a source of income, you may get declined. Don't worry about it. In this case, I'd recommend getting a secured card from a credit union for a few months, then trying again.\n6. Don't continually apply for lines of credit (CC, mortgage, personal loans, etc etc).
