{"id":"44vnhx","author":"americanpegasus","body":"Everyone knows I am one of the greatest oracles of the modern day.  How I have not been scooped up by some forward-thinking banking think-tank is a cosmic mystery.  \n  \nConsider I have given /r/investing such stocks as Netflix, Michael Kors, and 3D Systems before any of their monster runs back in 2012.  \n  \nThen, since early last year I've been warning that we have reached peak market conditions:  \n  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2onv3v/and_then_the_tech_bubble_20_crashed/?  \n  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34axx6/today_a_coworker_struck_up_a_conversation_about/  \n  \nThis subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.  \n  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34hxdn/the_pegasus_vanguard_vs_bitcoin_challenge_put/?  \n  \nIf that's not enough, I also warned you about the continuing spread of negative interest rates, which are still getting worse by the day:  \n  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3o3dun/three_month_treasury_yields_are_at_zero_percent/?  \n  \n-------  \n  \nSo, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: \"Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?\"  \n  \nWell, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  \n  \n**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  \n  \nI'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  \n  \nOil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  \n  \nI expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     \n   \nIt's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  \n  \nThis R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  \n  \nSpeaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   \n  \nThe stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   \n  \nMoney itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  \n  \nAnyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  \n  \nYou'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  \n  \nIt's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  \n  \nThe big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  \n  \nAnyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to \"buy fear\" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  \n  \nAs always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.  \n  \nFeel free to disagree with me and be on the wrong side of history yet again.  \n  \n","name":"t3_44vnhx","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-09 09:02:28","week":6}

Its heading into earnings and I my gut tells me this is due for pop. Its overall direction will still be down like every thing else as it is over valued with respect to the macro environment but in the short term I'm making a bullish play on technicals, earnings and my gut. \n\nI picked up some May 20 $29 calls as I think stock will get 3%-5% bounce heading into and likely after earnings. I have no idea if they will beat but I think they will give positive forward guidance based on their acquisition of King Digital.. yes they over paid but right now I care more about positive guidance than i do earnings. I'm not expecting a huge bounce and I only picked up 5 calls just to dabble on this spec play and see what its like to take the other side of the trade as I usually only buy puts.\n\nGood luck to anyone that decides to follow. This isn't like my AMZN trade. I make no promises with this one.\n\nEdit: Also something I forgot to note was that it has a very high short interest at the moment and I believe a short squeeze could also send this higher in the near term.","name":"t3_44y23l","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-02-09 19:23:04","week":6}

{"id":"44y8ir","author":"TheHorseTrader","body":"[Here] (http://i.imgur.com/W1plJ5Y.jpg) is an update on the numbers from the auction last month I posted about. Note: The numbers are profit after paying Ebay/AZ fees, shipping, etc.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, a recap:\n\n[What I bought] (http://imgur.com/a/uXMfD)\n\n[Update #1 - Picked up items] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/41mown/update_1_photos_of_the_items_i_bought_at_the/)\n\n\nI sent the Valcom units into Amazon FBA. I should have sent them all in at once as I've been out-of-stock on several occasions. I have 10 more on the way which should net me another $200.\n\n\nI didn't even list the ABB units until late last week. No action yet but I might end up parting some of the larger ones out as they would have to been sent freight due to the weight. \n\n\nThe Allen Bradley Powerflex units are doing well. I've been slowly listing them so as to not flood the market. When I list them I'll usually get a few lowball offers but they tend to sell in about a week or so.\n\n\nThe appliance parts have done really well on Amazon merchant fulfilled. I wasn't sure about them so I didn't FBA them but I've been pleasantly surprised. Most of the lawn equipment won't start to sell until the spring so I have a lot listed but I'm not expecting them to sell anytime soon.\n\n\nThe electrical lots (plugs, gang boxes, outlets, etc) have sold slowly. Usually when someone orders they'll get a few. There were quite a few high priced ones (over $150 each) I sent into FBA. They are specialty so it might take a while to sell but I have the buy box and mine should go first.\n\n\nI took a lot of the lower priced and used stuff (as well as a cart) to a local auction house. It hasn't been sold yet but I'll update this when it does. I expect to get another $600-800 from that.\n\n\nThe EZPath boxes haven't sold yet. A lot of these items were surplus from a hospital being remodeled so, again, they are specialty parts. When someone needs them for a job they should buy a large quantity.\n\n\nI originally spent $1300 for all items. After fees and expenses I've made a $1614 profit in 3 weeks. I've got over $10,000 in inventory at FBA, ~$1000 for sale on Ebay, another $3,000-4,000 worth left to list.\n\n\nI knew it would take a while to sell everything and I'm fine with that. It will likely sell over the course of the next year providing a steady income. The goal is to do 3-4/month and get overlapping steady returns. \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not all auctions are goldmines and you have to do your research to know what you are buying. People can and do lose money on auctions. Research things in depth before starting.\n","name":"t3_44y8ir","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-09 19:54:46","week":6}

{"id":"44ykcd","author":"secondary_seven","body":"To start - I know there isn't a miracle solution to debt besides fixing your budget and paying off revolving accounts, that's not what I'm looking for (though if one is out there, I'm of course open).\n\nLong story short - I'm 27, and in my early 20s (college and right after I graduated) I let myself get into about a $12K hole of credit card debt - I had very good credit because I always paid my balance down to zero, and still have never missed a payment. When getting started in my career, I fell into the 0% APR trap, and before I knew it, had more debt than I could pay down with my income. I started working on paying it down somewhat about 2 years ago (and by that I mean I physically destroyed all my credit cards but one - the one I had paid off in full and use for day to day spend because it gets great rewards - I still pay this card off entirely every month). I've steadily reduced my budget, cutting out a decent number of small, recurring subscriptions (no need for Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime when I can split the Netflix account with my roommates and only really use Hulu about once a month, for example). I've also reduced how often I go out to eat, although there's still room for improvement there. Unfortunately, I spent most of this time making just over the minimum payments, although I was able to put together a 6 month emergency fund during that period, so it wasn't a total loss. I'm now at close to $16K in debt, and am sick of it.\n\nThis year, I've finally gotten serious about getting out from under the debt. I know it's only been about 6 weeks, but I was able to put $1K towards it in January out of my income and should be able to continue to put at least $500 (ideally more, but January was somewhat unique in that I didn't really have any unanticipated expenses) towards it every month. I'll also be able to put nearly my entire tax refund towards it (part of it will be going to a new mattress, which I desperately need), but the rest (around $1200) will go straight to debt. I'm paying them off in a semi-avalanche method: I'm paying off the ones with the largest minimum payment first, unless one is close enough to pay off entirely. The only reason I am doing it this way is that my two highest interest accounts are relatively low balances.\n\nI've looked into consolidation, unfortunately, my utilization and average age of accounts aren't great, so I haven't qualified for any despite having never missed a payment on anything, ever, and having a reasonable income. \n\nAgain, I know there isn't a magic solution, and it wouldn't shock me if no one has any real tips besides recommending their preferred debt payoff method between snowball and avalanche. I just don't want to leave any stone unturned now that I am being very aggressive in this.","name":"t3_44ykcd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-09 20:55:12","week":6}

{"id":"44za6h","author":"fosgo","body":"Last year I took my $2,000 Turbo Tax refund as an Amazon gift card, which was a mistake for 3 reasons. \n\n**Background:** I spend about $2,500 per year on Amazon.com. So when Turbo Tax offered to goose my $2,000 refund by 5% (+$100) if I took it as an Amazon gift card, I clicked yes. My savings account was only paying about 1% at the time, so it seemed like a 4% return was a no brainer. Well, a year has passed and I've learned that this is a mistake for 3 reasons:\n\n**1. The Amazon Rewards Visa Card ALREADY PAYS 3% cash back for Amazon purchases!**\nThat's right, if you have this card (which I do), you already get 3% cash back on Amazon.com purchases. So instead of \"earning\" 4% more than my savings account, I was only +1%. Dohhh!\n\n**2. Your Amazon.com spending will increase WAY more than 5%!**\nI am a disciplined spender, but having a \"gift card balance\" makes you feel like you are spending funny money rather than hard earned greenbacks. I'm now the proud owner of things I didn't need like a fancy alarm clock, bluetooth speakers, and a sound machine. \n\n**3. You can't buy gift cards with a gift card balance!**\nI'm a VERY lazy gifter, so most of the gifts I give are Amazon gift cards (I know, I get the irony, but I'm really lazy in this department).  I probably spend $500 a year on gift cards and I assumed I would be able to give away part of my gift card balance for birthdays and holidays. Not so much! I should have read the fine print. You are not allowed to buy gift cards with a gift card balance. Double dohhh!\n\nSo, don't be a sucker like me this year.

Most recently I just finished (or at least got it to a working version) building an analytics platform for Instagram that offers insights into how you can better optimize your social media to yield higher engagements. You can also set up scheduled tasks to automatically generate more followers and likes, allowing you to focus on other things while your account continues to grow its user base on its own. Feel free to check it out here: [www.chompsocial.com](https://www.chompsocial.com) (no need to enter in your email, just comment here and I’ll hook you up with an account if you’re interested)\n\nAnd although we’re in the Entrepreneur sub, I don’t think there’s much of a viable business model here as there’s already several established companies that offer essentially the same thing but better (just an assumption since I haven’t tried any of their services). Hence I’m not too interested in monetizing this, as it’s been more of a fun and huge learning experience while also being able to build something cool that I could potentially put on my portfolio. \n\nSo with that being said, if anyone is interested and wants to be my guinea pig (other than myself and the friends who’ve graciously allowed me to play with their business Instagram accounts so far), than let me know and I’ll provide you with an account to tinker with!\n\nThere’s no cost or any requirements.

But because not everyone plays in every stock, everyone needs to be aware of what's going on in the market right now that is going to make it difficult to be a winner even if your style of trading is outright directional YOLO.  When volatility is this high and there are so many macro questions without answers we end up with myriad results that make little sense.  If we happen to win or lose we can prented in hindsight to say \"oh that makes sense because ______\" but taken as a whole they really don't.  Recent examples:\n\n1. LNKD drops 50% on best quarter ever but weak guidance - not 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% - half of its value gone\n2. TSLA up 12% AH right now when most people were looking for further downside\n3. TWTR traded way down on earnings AH today and then almost completely recovered.  If TWTR stays anywhere near its pre-earnings price options players are going to mostly get brutalized.  No one assumes a no move on Twitter earnings\n4.  NFLX traded below $80. That's below the mini-flash crash we had a while back.\n5. AMZN has lost 35% of its value from peak.  \n\nTo be clear, it's not about a market downturn being surprising, its about trades around earnings plays being screwy, I can't even list them all here.  Institutions are shifting capital allocations, everyone is running blind as to macro factors, etc.\n\nSo yes, you can certainly make money here and you may guess right in spite of all of this but just exercise some judgment.

{"id":"456ivm","author":"moumouren","body":"So we know that Amazon just announced a $5 billion buyback. In what world does that sound like a good idea? \n\nAmazon’s P/E is currently 400, give or take a bit. To justify that valuation, either one or both of these has to be true: i) earnings are apparently but not intrinsically depressed, or ii) there is tremendous future growth. I’m thinking that both assumptions have to be in play for a P/E of 400 to exist. \n\nLet us assume for a second that earnings have been depressed by 4x, while the remainder “intrinsic P/E” of 100 is attributable to growth. Let’s tackle the first assumption first. Bull case says that it is cash flow that matters, not earnings. Well, we know two myths about the cash flow vs earnings argument. \n\nOne, Amazon is investing in CAPEX for growth, hence the depressed earnings. We know this is not the case, as CAPEX would be capitalized on the balance sheet without affecting earnings. Furthermore, the bulk of expenses are categorized under the line item *Fulfillment*. This implies that most of the expenses are attributable to operating costs, not R&amp;D. Even if we give the benefit of doubt, there is no reason why R&amp;D should take up 40% of revenues. Even half of that would be excessive. One might make the argument that Amazon is accelerating depreciation of warehouses, by far their biggest cash flow expenditure, in favour of conservative accounting. Starbucks did this in the late 90’s, according to Penman’s book. However, we can see that is not the case, as *depreciation/amortization* is its own line item – and it is insignificant, less than 3% revenues. So we’re really left scratching our heads about where fulfilment expenses are coming from. \n\nSecondly, we know that Amazon is basically an online Walmart. Which means they have negative working capital. What this means is that they accept goods from suppliers, sell them first, and only then do they pay them back 30-60 days later. This is immensely advantageous, as it acts as a gigantic float. Having said that, it also obscures true free cash flow at year end. We know that Amazon’s biggest sales are during the holiday seasons of Christmas and New Year’s. Thus, they can report huge upfront operating cash flows before they’re paid to suppliers as part of FCF – which actually doesn’t belong to them. So much for the cash flow argument. \n\n\nWhat about growth? Well, a reverse DCF shows that a 100x P/E implies a 20 year CAGR of 25%. This is Buffett level growth, post-insurance float. Keep in mind that most analysts are only projecting about 10 years into the future, which implies a 58% CAGR. That’s approximately what Starbucks achieved - from date of inception. Not from juggernaut status. Even if it became the global status quo by overtaking Alibaba and global economic growth maintained at historical levels of 2.5%, it would not justify its P/E.\n\nSo what is Bezos doing with a $5 billion buyback? Not to be sceptical, but it seems like a confidence-maintaining move. Enron did a buyback in 2001 when shares fell from $100 to $15. There doesn’t need to be fraud for overvaluation to exist. \n","name":"t3_456ivm","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2016-02-11 03:24:56","week":6}

{"id":"458jhl","author":"bemmu","body":"Not originally geared for subscription boxes, [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) is an ecommerce system for starting online stores. Bonus fact: Shopify [was originally created to run a single snowboarding shop](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/meet-our-ceo-of-the-year/article21734931/), but has since grown to handle multiple stores and $8 billion worth of sales. \n\nI was recently comparing all the different subscription ecommerce apps available for Shopify, so here are my results.  For [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) I use a homegrown system, because there wasn't really anything good available at the time.\n\nShopify itself costs $29/month and has gateway fees identical with Stripe, but with volume discounts for higher sales. By default Shopify does not support recurring payments, but it can be extended to do that by using apps.\n\n#### Chargify\n\nOne of the recurring payment apps is [Chargify](https://apps.shopify.com/chargify). By combining Shopify and Chargify, you have a system suitable for running a subscription box. Chargify pricing is $65 for up to 20 customers, $129 for up to 500 and $459 for up to 2,000. \n\n#### PayWhirl\n\nAnother option for adding a subscription layer to Shopify is PayWhirl, which is used for example by the soap subscription box [JFSoaperie](http://www.jfsoaperie.com/soapscription). PayWhirl is priced to have two tiers, either $0/month + 2% per transaction or $49/month + 1% per transaction.\n\nYou can find [PayWhirl in the Shopify app directory](https://apps.shopify.com/paywhirl-recurring-payments) or on [PayWhirl’s own site](http://www.paywhirl.com). Besides Shopify, PayWhirl can also be used in other contexts, [such as with SquareSpace](http://blog.paywhirl.com/blog/post/how-sockscapade-uses-paywhirl-to-power-their-online-monthly-sock-subscription-business).\n\nIf your subscription plan is $29/month, then at 20 subscribers PayWhirl would cost only $11.60/month compared to Chargify’s $65, so it is cheaper to start with. At this plan when having a bit under 500 subscribers it would become more expensive, but it would be quite a trivial difference. You should be choosing the system rather based on which you feel is easier to use and most of all the better user experience for your customers.\n\n#### ReCharge\n\nThere also exists an app called [ReCharge](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-recurring-payments), which is designed to be used both as a \"subscribe &amp; save\" -type feature similar to Amazon or as the engine for subscription boxes. The [introduction video on their app page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNm1s_vU8N0) is excellent, I recommend checking it out. ReCharge is $19.99/month + 1% per transaction for up to 500 subscribers, with a negotiable discount if you have a larger customer base.\n\nWith ReCharge all recurring subscriptions appear as new orders within Shopify, with special new interfaces for managing them both for you and your customer. You can change the subscriptions and update credit cards etc. through the interface which ReCharge adds to your Shopify. It also sends notification emails (welcome email, charge failed and charge succeeded) to your customers automatically. ReCharge supports monthly and other frequencies.\n\n\n#### ChargeBee\n\nThe options don't stop there. Another subscriptions app which works with Shopify is [ChargeBee](https://apps.shopify.com/chargebee-recurring-billing?ref=shopstorm), priced in tiers based on how many monthly invoices you have. Starting at $49/month for 50 invoices, going to $79 for 200 with finally $249 for 2000. For monthly charges ChargeBee creates its own invoices instead of making normal Shopify orders, but on the other hand it supports several payment processors.\n\n## Thanks\n\n[In my book](http://www.candyjapan.com/book) there are screenshots from the admin sides of all of these apps and a price comparison chart (subscriber number vs. cost). It also covers all the other options besides just Shopify.","name":"t3_458jhl","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-11 13:33:49","week":6}

{"id":"45gvpo","author":"Trees4mcd","body":"Hey Reddit, \n\nI wanted to ask for your thoughts/advice/criticism on my current business endeavors. I have been importing different products and selling them on eBay/Amazon over the past few months.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. Product #1 - I ended up losing money. Looking back I must have been blind when I invested around $300 a piece into these. They were selling on eBay for $500-$600 bucks when I made the order and the selling price dropped down to $350 before they arrived and quickly dropped below that. I ended up losing around $400-$500 bucks on a $3000 investment. Thankfully they are all sold. Ok, they were hoverboards.\n\n2. Product #2 - This is my bread and butter right now. I've sold 130 units on amazon in the past 30 days and 13 on eBay for $1475 in sales revenue. Amazon is amazing I cant believe it took me this long to discover how awesome it is. I pay $2.50/pc and sell them for $10.00/pc.\n\n--  I have my inventory at Amazon's warehouse and they take care of all my logistics for less money that it costs me to handle it myself from home, and my sales are better because they're included in amazon prime. I have so much more free time not having to ship products out myself.\n\n3. Product #3 - I have 100 units that I paid $2.50/pc for and they have been steadily selling for 6.99 a piece. A really low price just so people will buy it and get my listing ranked higher on the site. I will be giving away 15 units to bloggers for reviews on Amazon the same way I did for product #2. Positive reviews increased my sales by at least 5x. I only profit $.75/pc right now. Once my reviews are posted I'll raise the price to $11.99 and order 1000 units for $2/pc.\n\n\nMy profit on product #2 is 34% so I made about $500 bucks this month on 1 product. I have researched about 5 other products that I could launch that I believe would do the same if not better than product #2 so right now I am thinking about the easiest and lowest cost way to come up with $13,000 to launch them.\n\nI have to use my current revenue to stay on top of my current inventory and purchasing more of product #3 as the sales start increasing. I can't let myself run out of stock or all of the work boosting the listings will be a waste.\n\nSo, do I take out some 1yr interest free credit cards for 13k? Do I try to put together a proposal for a business loan? Do I sell equity to a friend? (I'm increasingly hesitant of this as I become more successful by myself) Do I take the slow road and build 1 product at a time?\n\nI would really appreciate your thoughts Reddit!\n\nEDIT: I have been approved for 20k in interest free 1 year credit cards and have 4 new products coming in from China as we speak! Woo!\n","name":"t3_45gvpo","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-12 22:13:27","week":6}

When Amazon refunded me, they only refunded $1052 which is about $100 short of what I previously paid for it. I don't have that much money at the moment, so $100 is quite a lot of money to me. I've tried contacting Amazon but they basically ended up by saying that they will not adjust the refund amount and they won't give me the $100 they took.\n\nIs this something I can dispute with my credit card company?

We don't do a tit-for-tat with regard to bill paying.\n\nI am an independent contractor.  This is my second year filing since graduating college, so I don't know anything about write-offs, other than what categories I can write off.   First year was pretty straightforward since I worked outside of the house and covered all of my expenses in my name.\n\nNow we both work from home, but he gave me the office room.  The problem comes in that he pays the rent and Amazon bill (sometimes), and I cover food, utilities, and other expenses like our cat generally speaking.  The problem is this:  Am I not able to write off the room I use solely for rent since he's not my husband?\n\nIf we can file jointly (which I don't know if we can since we're not married), will I be able to write off the purely business expenses that he may have covered (through paying some of the Amazon purchases and rent), or is it completely not allowed since it didn't technically come directly from my income, but our income?\n\nThanks for the help.","name":"t3_45ien1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-13 04:05:02","week":6}

{"id":"czrr4fq","author":"snuxoll","body":"This! Hit up the capital one pre approval site and see what they may have to offer you. I also had a score in the low 500's and got the QuickSilver One card (same as the QS, just with a $39 AF and MasterCard instead of Visa) - I also got an Amazon Prime Store Card and a WalMart store card within a month after that (Synchrony bank is very lenient on credit profile) - store cards are pretty easy to qualify for and usually have some decent limits that grow quickly, making them a good tool to build your credit profile.\n\nOf course, none of this matters if you aren't responsible with them. Make sure that you always pay in full every month, or if you use promotional financing (on an Amazon Store Card, for example) you don't get caught paying backdated interest.\n\nWorst case, CapitalOne offers a credit builder card with a low $200 limit for people with thin profile or poor credit - five months and it graduates to a standard platinum card that you can product change to a rewards card, downside is it doesn't even report until it graduates - also make sure you pay on time, one late payment and they cancel the card without recourse (but at least it won't report).\n\nBeyond that, secured cards. Wells Fargo has a nice one with a $300 minimum deposit - if you pay your cell phone bill with it you get free insurance for the first three lines listed on your statement which could save you up to $30/mo depending on your cell phone carrier (only a $25 deductible too, much better than the $175 T-Mobile has for my iPhone 6 Plus). This one also graduates to a standard platinum card with responsible use, unlike the Capital One secured card which will give a one time CLI but won't refund the deposit until you close the account (I have both of these).","name":"t1_czrr4fq","subreddit":"CRedit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qph1","created_utc":"2016-02-08 03:34:47","week":6}
{"id":"czrr6pq","author":"mohi666","body":"&gt;  risk is not the same. \n\nAgreed. Naked puts posses less risk than buying the stocks outright. For example I sold a naked $28 put for XOP when it was trading above $29 for $1.3. It went ITM, that's why I ended up rolling it out for another $0.91 of credit. So far I've collected $2.21 in XOP. The premium that I collected reduced my cost basis to $26.80. As of now XOP is trading at $26.28. So far I've only lost $52 on the trade. If I had bought 100 stocks outright at $29, I would have been down by $372 on the trade. So the naked put has reduced my loss by $221 so far. Hence it's a less risky trade.\n\nOnce again your point of losing on something that you didn't put on the table has nothing to do with naked puts. It is a problem with misusing the *leverage*. You can misuse the leverage using spreads as well. They actually provide higher leverage than naked options.\n\nI do trade spreads. Mostly for more expensive stocks such as AMZN, etc. But I prefer naked calls and naked puts any day. The problem with spreads is that you cannot really defend a losing position if it goes against you. They have lower probability of success and higher commissions as well.","name":"t1_czrr6pq","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-02-08 03:36:16","week":6}

{"id":"czrubu7","author":"cuteman","body":"Why wouldn't manufacturers give better/higher volume customers discounts for quantity, marketing, display, etc.? \n\nThat's where the majority of their own revenue comes from. They also go through distributors but large direct accounts usually account for more and often a lot more business than smaller accounts. \n\nSamsung / Best buy for example, a few years ago,(I'm not sure if that's still true now that Apple has gotten huge), used to be the biggest consumer electronics relationship in the world with nine figures in revenue per month. Through their largest distributor, Ingram micro, that number may be low 9 figures for all non direct accounts combined. But after best buy you've got Walmart, Target, Amazon, Costco, Sam's Club, etc. Which add up to a lot more than non direct wholesale accounts. That's just revenue alone. I'd wager 80% of their volume comes from their top 50 accounts with 20% coming from the 1000-2000 accounts below the top 50. \n\nAlso, don't forget, retailers are partners. They spend part of their own advertising money marketing different brands so sometimes to win the front page or end cap, manufacturers will often contribute to what's called MDF (marketing development funds). There's simply no replacement via smaller accounts for the exposure they get by Partnering with the biggest retailers and DMRs. At retail they also get dedicated floor space, displays, and salesmen focus. At somewhere like Amazon they may eblast a specific deal or rebate out to their hundreds of millions of customers. \n\nAnother issue for manufacturers are fly by night resellers who happily gobble up business by selling at or near costs. You may say all volume is good volume, but in addition to commoditizing items they may wish to keep selling priced high, it also negatively impacts the aforementioned retailers who have spent millions on marketing and have overhead that cannot survive cost + 1%. This is especially true of tier 1 brands like Apple, Samsung, etc. \n\nI used to work with lots of retailers and e-commerce dealers as a distributor sales rep. I sold to everyone from the $50k per year to $15b per year revenue accounts. Different deals fall into place depending on the specifics. I can tell you sometimes the big boys aren't getting as good a deal as you think (with items like MDF, accessories, warranties, service, etc. Contributing more margin but tier 1 brands drive foot traffic). \n\nSometimes the huge ones like Walmart will buy from distributors as well, like during the holidays when they don't want to stress their own logistics or inventory proximity allows for quicker transit time. They may negotiate top tier pricing, but on some stuff, every day dealers can get the same cost. \n\nMy suggestion would be to find your own niche. As profitable as you can find while driving enough revenue and inventory so that cobwebs and dust don't develop. \n\nThere are also third party programs, groups and services like buying groups that can help approximate incentives that the big retailers receive (MDF, rebates, aggregated volume for discounts on payment processing, Web Development and social media services, buying shows, contact resources with manufacturer reps, face to face seminars for all of the above). If you're a  appliances, electronics, furniture, etc. retailer for example the big ones are Nationwide Marketing Group, Brandsource/PRO and NATM (if you're a big dealer but not necessarily national). \n\nWhat's your category/industry?

Here's [Indeed in Kentucky](http://www.indeed.com/q-Software-Engineer-l-Kentucky-jobs.html), which has ~530 jobs in my search results. The [same exact search in Virginia](http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Software+Engineer&amp;l=Virginia)--which, to be fair, has about twice the population--gets me over 8,300 results. The majority of these jobs are going to be in the Northern Virginia suburbs of DC which are expensive. Doing the same thing in San Francisco yields almost as many results as Virginia as a whole. NYC gets about ~7K jobs. There are way more software jobs per capita.\n\nCompounding things, you cannot find any of the top tier software jobs in Kentucky. You cannot work for Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. in Kentucky as a software engineer unless you get lucky enough to land a remote work role. To be fair, DC doesn't really have many of these top tier jobs either, but companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. do have a presence even if it's not that large. These companies give out huge stacks of cash and can advance a career much faster than working at Farm Credit Mid-America, one of the first jobs I saw on the Indeed search results for Kentucky.\n\n&gt;If millennials want to optimize their condition they'll avoid the overpriced metropolises of old and move to cheaper, greener pastures. \n\nThey'll optimize their *rent*, but that will not be terribly helpful if they are unemployed since these areas tend to be cheaper for a reason.","name":"t1_czs863n","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-02-08 15:53:39","week":6}

So if you are truly worried about a big item not selling, simply only ship Amazon 1 at a time.  If it sells relatively quickly, then send more.\n\nLong term storage fees are totally not a big deal when it comes to smaller items.  We're talking stupidly low.  I had a retail arbitrage item that flopped.  I recently noticed that it has been at Amazon for over a while and I had to pay long term storage fees.

Instead it has about half the population of Virginia but only 6% of the tech jobs on Indeed.\n\nRight out the gate you can see that Washington state, with a smaller population than Virginia (~8 million vs ~7 million), has almost as many tech jobs (~8.3K vs ~8K), meaning it has more SW jobs per capita than Virginia. It's also got a lot of the top tier companies, including a few that have their HQ there (Amazon and Microsoft, for instance).\n\nNew York State as a whole has fewer SW jobs on Indeed than Virginia, but its per capita rate is still higher than Kentucky's.

People have been saying Netflix has been absurdly valued for a long while now. This kind of thing can go on longer than anyone can predict and sometimes much longer. In a risk-on environment like the last 4-5 years, you can own NFLX, TSLA, AMZN, etc and everything seems great...until the turn happens - and when the turn happens (and it can happen quickly), these kinds of names are not where you want to be. I have said in the past, you do not want to be anywhere near NFLX when the turn happens. I have nothing against Netflix as a business, don't think it's going anywhere, etc, but a 300 p/e for a video streaming service is the height of absurdity.I mean, even the NFLX CEO was baffled by the stock price. When the CEO of the company goes, “When the stock was half this price I described it as euphoric,” that's a problem. (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/even-netflix-ceo-is-baffled-by-high-stock-price-2015-07-16)\n\nThere's plenty of things that I like as products or services but have no interest in owning as investments. Additionally, I want things that I can let go on autopilot and not have to constantly monitor. Danaher (DHR), which is one of the best industrial conglomerates in the world, is something I don't have to monitor. Brookfield Asset (BAM) trading at something like a 10 p/e is something that you can buy and hold. Netflix (NFLX) trading at 300 p/e even after the recent sell-off....hell no.

{"id":"czsgojr","author":"CynicalHitler","body":"It is an economics question.\n\nIt depends on what the money is currently being used for. Two scenarios:\n\n1. All rich-people-money is currently sitting under a mattress. If the rich decided to spend it, it would increase the aggregate demand for goods and services, which would be represented by a right-shift of the AD-curve. AS is unaffected by this change in the short term, leading to a higher price level (i.e. inflation, i.e. decreased purchasing power per unit of currency), yes. (Demand pull inflation).\n1. All rich-people-money is invested in Amazon bonds. Amazon uses this money to build warehouses, hire people to pack and ship your stuff, research drone delivery methods, and so forth. If rich people withdrew their money, the level of investments would go down accordingly. Amazon would have to pay a higher interest rate to continue growing as fast, and thus chooses a lower level of investments, reducing (the growth of) real output. This is represented as a shock on aggregate supply, left-shift of the AS curve, and correspondingly higher price level (inflation) and lower real output. (And of course the same money would now act  as part of AD, making matters even \"worse\".) (Cost push inflation).\n\nThis is, of course, a very limited model, and the reality is much more nuanced and the truth lies somewhere between extremes. But it gives you a general idea of what's happening.","name":"t1_czsgojr","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2016-02-08 19:28:48","week":6}

Markets and investors do tend to be \"irrationally exuberant\" from time to time, but you're not giving investors enough credit.\n\nNO ONE in the world would buy a stock at a PE of 500 if they weren't anticipating strong revenue growth.\n\nIf AMZN got something close to the 5yr projected growth numbers and paid out all earnings as dividends then current investors would get all their money back in about 15 years(ish) AND still own stock in one of the most valuable companies on the planet.\n\nSo JUST looking at trailing PE is silly in a case like this.  AMZN is at 390 PE ttm, but 57 forward PE (next 12 months), a 5yr peg ratio or &lt;3, and a price to sales of just 2.2!\n\nSo IF the growth projections for amzn are remotely correct then the stock is not crazy high over valued.  The reason stock like this get hit hardest when there is uncertainty and fear around is because most of their value is based off expected growth, which become increasingly uncertain if we enter a global recession.\n\nThe greater fool theory may sort of apply, but its much more applicable in cases where the underlying asset is not really expected to produce cash flows that validate the current price.","name":"t1_czsqy18","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-08 23:28:29","week":6}

{"id":"czsrvt4","author":"SUpirate","body":"Yeah growth stocks are notoriously hard to value.\n\nWhen shit goes bad they always look crazy in retrospect because people say \"well hell it was trading at a crazy high PE!\"  But in reality a lot of times the growth expectations are totally realistic and the price is justified.\n\nAMZN is an especially fun one to look at, because they have such an outlandishly high amount of revenue/sales.  Hover their earnings are very low, because they've been spending most of their revenue on expanding infrastructure and continued growth.\n\nIf/when they ever reduce their growth related spending then they have the potential to start cranking out really really high earnings and dividends.\n\nBut there are cases that are pretty hard to validate.  TSLA was recently trading at prices that just didn't line up with any realistic expectation for the next 5 years for example.  Even if they hit their growth estimates and were super successful the price would still be considered high.  Although I think its dropped a fair bit recently and may be more within the realm of reason.\n\nQuality data for free, yahoo finance is pretty decent I think.

{"id":"czt6kmb","author":"Y3808","body":"The only reason that Facebook hasn't crashed/burned like Twitter is because they learned how to avoid the mistakes of their predecessors and effectively lie to Wall Street.\n\nThey have not doubled down on failed projects, just this past week they abandoned a cloud app/IOT subsidiary that they bought because that's a market either doomed to failure in the form of the latter or dominated by Google and Amazon in the case of the former.  So rather than pissing away billions, they just scrapped it and quit, that's smart.\n\nThey are also trying to diversify, even if some things fail, rather than sitting on their one thing and amassing cash ala apple.  Look at where that has gotten apple, they'll trade at a p/e below 10 until they can convince everyone of a new direction that will work.\n\nThey know how to lie to Wall Street in that they pump user numbers on one hand while censoring their users' content on the other hand.  Wall Street thinks the Internet is a medium like print or TV, but it isn't.  This is why local news, TV news, newspapers, etc persistently fail at the Internet.  You can't convince them that there are bad users, because their 100 year old business model is based on circulation and/or ratings.  They fail to grasp the fact that plebs must be eliminated early, often, and with an iron fucking fist.  If they are not eliminated your internet presence is doomed to failure and when it fails it stays that way, there is no recovering good users once they leave.  Facebook avoids this pitfall by constantly censoring with changes to their news feed algos and not telling people how or why they're doing so.\n\nIt's also a constant balancing act to push ads while not pushing ads.  It's no big secret why we don't see video ads despite the constantly dangling carrot, that carrot is just to appease Wall Street plebs.  Users don't want ads, but people who get up early to file TPS reports on salesforce struggle to figure that out for whatever reason.  So Facebook has to selectively allow ads to slightly intrude but not give their ad buying customers much of the real pie.  \n\nDespite all of these things, plebs only stay fooled for so long.  It's a constant juggling act to keep them while hiding them from the real day to day.  Can they do it indefinitely?

{"id":"cztqbg5","author":"Fishinabowl11","body":"Investing, in this context, is taking ownership of a financial asset. Some people like to micromanaging their investments, others leave them alone for years at a time. \n\nI like examples, here's another one. You take your 3500 pounds and want to invest it all in a company you believe will be profitable and grow in the near future. Let's pick Amazon. Right now, Amazon's (AMZN) stock price is $475.50 per share. You go to an online brokerage, open an account and transfer your money there. After they've received it, you setup a buy order for $3500 worth of AMZN, netting you 7.36 shares. Oh and you have to pay a commission for this purchase, maybe $10. \n\nYou can leave this alone now and come back in a day, a week, a month, a year, 10 years, what. You'll always have 7.36 shares. What you hope for is that the share price will increase as the company becomes more valuable. Maybe in 1 year, the share price is up to $517, and you've made (517-475.5) * 7.36 = $305.44, less your initial $10 commission, and the second $10 commission when you sold it. Your return for the year before taxes is ($305.44-10-10) / 3500 = 8.2%! A great year! \n\nNone of this involves leaving your day job, or even paying attention to it. Of course, you should never invest all your money in a single stock (diversify!) and you need to be prepared to lose everything you put in. \n\nIf you don't like stocks, there are other financial instruments you can buy like bonds, certificates of deposit, sovereign debt, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), or commodities. They all function is different ways, with different amounts of risk, depending on your tolerance.  \n\n","name":"t1_cztqbg5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-09 19:45:57","week":6}

{"id":"cztt4dj","author":"philwelch","body":"For three adults, we cut our grocery costs in half once my girlfriend moved in and we started doing a few simple things:\n\n1. Restrict where you shop. Places like Whole Foods and QFC are not just expensive, they also can be stressful and oversized. Trader Joe's is inexpensive and their store brands are better than most national brands. Also, the store itself is compact and easy to negotiate. It's also easier to make healthy choices because they just don't stock nearly as much junk food as a normal grocery store. Costco is also a great option. Our schedule right now is to go to Costco once a month to stock up on staples (frozen chicken tenderloins, tortillas, spinach, etc.) and also grab a week's worth of fresh fruit and basic groceries. The other three weekends of the month we go to Trader Joe's to buy produce and to stock up on sauces and other TJ-specific products. There are also some dry staple foods we order from Amazon, especially using Subscribe and Save; this can be a good way to get your paper products as well. \n2. Use cheap, versatile staples. Frozen chicken tenderloins are boring, but you can make them exciting by mixing up how you cook them. Cook them, chop them up, and throw them in a stir fry, or shred them and put them into enchiladas, or cook them whole saturated in a sauce and fix rice or potatoes on the side, or shred them and cook them in taco seasoning while making Spanish rice and reheating a can of beans and you can make burritos.\n3. Use a grocery list. Feel free to cut things from the list as you shop or to make substitutions if they would be cheaper. Also feel free to put something vague on the list, like \"fruit\", and actually choose what you want when you get there. But you have to have a list. \n4. Keep your receipts and analyze them later. You will learn that some things you buy are not as cost effective as possible substitutes. \n\nThings that we don't do:\n\n1. Sometimes you can save money by being more flexible and not being so religious with a list. One way is to go to places like Grocery Outlet. We have considered this but there are risks. One is that if you buy things just because they're cheap, you end up buying things you don't need, so you're better off figuring out what you need first. Another downside is that Grocery Outlet can be kind of depressing. \n2. We don't do coupons. Aside from the \"buying things because they're cheap and not because you need them\" risk, we don't really want to commit that much time to it. Plus, Costco automatically applies their coupons on checkout anyway, and TJ's doesn't have coupons (just their \"Fearless Flyer\" which just tells you what they have on sale anyway). We do consult the Costco mailer when we make our Costco list, but it usually doesn't influence our decisions. \n\nFinally, some things that will increase your grocery budget but save you money in the long run:\n\n1. Everyone says to eat at home instead of going out to save money, but you still might want to have special occasions, like a date night or something. A couple of rib-eye steaks and a bottle of wine are still cheaper than going out, though. \n2. If you buy healthy groceries, that's great but you still get a sweet tooth sometimes. Getting a pint of Ben and Jerry's at the corner store or something like that can add up fast, but making a small concession and buying ice cream at the grocery store can hit the spot for cheaper.","name":"t1_cztt4dj","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-09 20:47:53","week":6}
{"id":"cztu6gn","author":"Hussar_SoulJacker","body":"/u/azzazaz\n\n/u/hayasdan\n\n\nIt that case here is a bit of a breakdown...\n\nThe concept is very simple buy stuff for cheap and resell it for more. I've been a re-seller for few years and my wife for a few years more than me. I can tell you that it works. Of course two main things to consider, first; like with everything else, there is a learning curve. Depending on the time put into research and individual aptitude we're talking about somewhere between 30-90 days before you get pretty good at the task at hand.   Second; you only get out of it what you put into it. \n\nSo, harking back to the concept it self, I specialize in men's \"stuff\" clothing, shoes, accessories etc. and of course anything else that I come across that can be turned around for profit. So basically anything other than women's \"stuff\". Some re-sellers narrow their focus to something like, used knifes, tools, shoes, music, polo shirts etc. some buy wholesale ( I have yet to find a good, reputable &amp; consistent source ) \n\nThe best profits come from garage sale purchases but garage sales sometimes lack consistency in the amount of good inventory you can pick up. So thrift stores are the other source of inventory and while the profit for individual items are typically lower you more than make up for it in volume. Obviously, any other source if fine, flea markets can be great, the occasional estate sale, even normal retail stores when they have killer clearance sales, auctions, wholesale dealers etc.  \n\nTo make $1000 a month the time input should be relatively low and the space for inventory also pretty small. Get on the pc and start looking on ebay, perhaps start with things you may already know about, relating to your work or hobbies. Than, expand as necessary. Also google to see what's popular on ebay, what's selling, trends etc. \n\nLastly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention another market place calls Amazon as well as Facebook. Amazon has a different process but the concept is the same, but low sell for more. Facebook on the other hand is it's own little animal that can be used to generate additional sales income selling to people in your local area. If you look around you're likely to find multiple \"sale groups\" for your area. I live in a sub 100K city and there are dozens of groups on FB.\n\nThe reality is that IF you put the time and effort into it, there are MANY people that make 50K+ per year working by them selves. In your case that maybe more time than you have available or maybe not, that's up to you. \n\nHope that helps. Good luck.\n\n ","name":"t1_cztu6gn","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-09 21:11:31","week":6}

If it did, you could call Barclays and ask to product change to one of their no-fee cards.\n* As others have mentioned, in order to decrease the odds of Barclays closing your account for inactivity, you want to use it every 4-6 months. If you shop on Amazon regularly you could set up an automatic $5 Amazon gift card reload every 4 months and an automatic payment from your checking account a few days later. Or you could use this card to pay any regular subscription you have that accepts credit card, e.g. Netflix, Hulu. Just be sure to pay it off in full before the due date so you don't get charged interest.\n* $750 is a low credit limit. You want your credit limits to be higher, because they decrease your utilization and increase your credit score. According to [this Doctor Of Credit post](http://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-cards/which-credit-card-companies-do-a-hard-pull-for-a-credit-limit-increase/) Barclays does a hard pull when you request a credit limit increase. A hard pull increases your credit inquiries, which lowers your credit score (low impact). I'd recommend contacting your credit card issuers that don't perform a hard pull first.\n* Since you only use your credit cards for things you can afford and pay them off in full every month (right?), you don't care about APR.

Didn't find anything I could flip because I don't have the knowledge to flip clothing or glassware or kitchenware etc. \n\nThrift shops in Australia aren't allowed to sell electronics or electrical due to safety concerns. That's my niche.\n\nMy first auction purchase was laptop docks and bags - all NIB. 5 docks for $120 including fees was the price on the docks. $110 for 8 HP laptop bags. Still have a couple boxes of docks left and about 8 boxes of laptop bags.\n\nThe docks have been selling at $99 each and the bags somewhat more slowly at $35 each. \n\nSince then I've sold DVD players, Kitchen appliances, satellite phones, mobile phones, computers, printer consumables, tools, gardening equipment, sporting equipment etc etc. \n\nI now have $43K of stock on Ebay. Not much on FBA due to shipping fees from Australia and Amazon restrictions.\n\nI haven't got cash in hand profits yet due to re-investing everything into flipping. I don't expect cash in hand profits until late this year, when I hope to have doubled my current stock levels and selection.\n\nThe biggest lesson I've learned is to be patient. Some things are rapid sellers and others are longtail items which will sell, but you need to wait for the right buyer.\n\nThanks /u/TheHorseTrader !

{"id":"czudssj","author":"kevlarlover","body":"The $150 bonus for the Freedom doesn't hurt, but it's not one of the main reasons to get the CSP and Freedom together:\n\n1. If you are approved for both the CSP and the Freedom on the same day, then Chase will combine the credit inquiries and only do one hard pull, which is nice.\n2. The Freedom is also subject to Chase's 5/24 rule, so if you're ever going to get it, you should get it early in this hobby.\n3. The CSP and the Freedom compliment each other, making the other card more valuable. Specifically:\n4. The Freedom earns 5x the Ultimate Reward Points (URs, Chase's reward currency) in rotating categories every quarter - usually useful categories, like gas and ground transportation (this quarter), groceries, Amazon (usually around Christmas), etc. 5 points per dollar on that spending is very nice to have, and since there's no annual fee, you can easily keep the Freedom forever.\n5. The URs on a CSP are worth more than the URs on a Freedom - Freedom URs can be redeemed for travel at 1 cent per point, while CSP URs can be redeemed for travel at 1.25 cent per point - 25% more value. You can also transfer CSP URs to travel partners (United Airlines and a few hotels) to get United miles or hotel points, which, depending on the redemption, can be worth much more than 1.25 cents per mile. Finally, you can transfer URs from your Freedom to your CSP, and then redeem them from your CSP - which means you're really earning at least 6.25% back on the Freedom's quarterly categories if you also have the CSP, and perhaps more, depending on how you redeem the URs.\n6. The CSP comes with a slew of other travel benefits that the Freedom doesn't (primary rental car insurance, trip protection, etc.)\n\nSo, those are the reasons most people recommend getting the CSP and Freedom together as two of your first cards when just getting into churning. If you can spend $4k in 3 months, I'm sure you could stretch it to $4.5k - prepay some expenses, buy some grocery store gift cards to wherever you normally buy your groceries anyway etc.\n\nAnd you're right, I'm generally not a fan of the 1 cent/mile cards, but I'm a fan of the CSP/Freedom combo, because URs are valuable and can be earned relatively quickly, thanks to the Freedom's quarterly category bonus.\n\nAnd thanks for the offer to use my referral link - my CSP isn't eligible for a referral (so you should use someone else's referral link from the thread), but I'll PM you my referral link for the Freedom, in case you decide you want to do the CSP/Freedom combo!","name":"t1_czudssj","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-02-10 05:03:27","week":6}

I bought a small fake one to act as a mini Christmas tree for $3 at target. Those look bigger and nicer, though.  Amazon has fake cactus looking ones that are small and go for $5 a piece.  Ikea is in the $5 price zone.  Not sure if some of those are real or not, though...don't think they are.\n\n\nPicture 8 - not sure what they are, but it looks like designer/homemade soap maybe?

You are probably looking at the lower end if you are flea market selling, though...not sure how they sell online.  My sister-in-law sells them for around $3 each as her friend made some to sell at neighborhood garage sales and the like.\n\n\nPicture 12 on the left look like baby leg warmers and something else - another baby item that can sell quickly at $3 - $6.  I looked closer and the brand is Bella Tunno.  This is good for you - especially if the other baby stuff is that brand too.  They sell for more. Those paci clips (mentioned below in picture $17), if those are Bella Tunno go from $3-5 for random brand to $8, and those leg warmers go for closer to $15.

I would advise searching Amazon for [Bella Tunno](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bella+tunno&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Abella+tunno) and looking at all their categories...you may have a lot form them.\n\nPicture 17 - front left of the table looks like what my wife purchased...pacifier holder to clip the pacifier to the baby's clothes so it doesn't hit the ground and they don't lose it (and can find it in the night so they don't cry and wake you up) They go for $3-$6 each, depending on quality and what is all attached [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=pacifier+holder+clip](Life Savers at night!).\n\n\nPciture 23 - if you have more stuff like that with that theme - it will sell easily for a decent price. I have a family member who collect/decorate with essentially the same thing as that except a moose instead of a bear. No idea on price as [this one on Amazon that is similar](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bella+tunno&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Abella+tunno) is $45 dollars and I have no clue why. You could sell it for $5 or $50 as I browse and look around.\n\n\n\nOk I am done, I only know about those things as I have bought them or know someone who has bought/sold in the past.  Good Luck!  And if your journey to/from Texas brings you through PA I may buy a thing or two off you!

{"id":"czv5szw","author":"odieman44","body":"For tires, the important things that I look out for are:\n\n1. Speed rating and load index. See [this documentation] (http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=35) for a good explanation.  You shouldn't need to buy tires with a higher speed rating or load index than your current tires.  Tires with higher speed ratings will wear out faster.\n2. Pay attention to the treadwear warranty.  They are expressed in miles (40,000, etc.).  If the tires wear out beyond that point, you are entitled to a refund of a prorated amount of the original purchase price, based on how many miles they fell short of the warranty.\n3. Make sure you take regular rotation and balancing into consideration.  Discount Tire will give you free lifetime rotation and balancing when you purchase the tires from them.  Doing this every 5,000-6,000 miles will ensure maximum treadlife and will also keep your warranty valid.  Don't buy them from Bob's Tire for $5 less and have to pay $40 for each rotation and balance.

{"id":"czv7hy8","author":"aerored82","body":"Not a retail expert but as a (very) critical consumer, I just clicked your link and ...\n\n\nI found the website intriguing and interesting. Good!\n\n\nOn my tablet (mobile layout), I got the name banner, good, and a grid of pictures of random stuff. Ok... what's this?...\n\n\nI clicked a picture and was taken to... instagram. Wut?\n\n\nAs other comments said, you aren't known (to me) so I don't know what you are known for. There's no apparel on the page I landed at.  So I would ditch the pictures and put key menu items on the top of the landing page, along with a two line masthead of your mission statement.  \"Designer apparel at prices you'll love\" or somesuch marketing jabber...\n\n\nBut there is also no suggestion you want to sell me even the things I can see. There is no 'invitation to buy' so beloved of marketing professionals.  You tell people to buy, buy NOW before the stock is out, the sale ends!  Give them imperative to buy.\n\n\nOn the other hand, special offer is everywhere, did you have a fire?? Only kidding. A sale price must be rare to make that item seem special.  Everything 'reduced' seems either desperate or fraudulent!\n\n\nConsumers are programmed to expect a shop to look like one. Although I was looking at the mobile version (was I?) It looks too much like an inventory database when looking at the clothes.  Jazz up the background a bit.  Maybe use your store's design themes, colors etc.\n\n\nThe rule set by Amazon I guess is TIME. You have to convert to a sale within (from hazy memory) 9 seconds of the person seeing the item.  That is effectively one or at most two clicks away.  \n\n\nSo for instance don't let the customer choose the color until they click 'buy'.  If you let people think whether they want something they don't really need, the decision they take will be 'yes/no'. So make them click 'yes' (i.e. 'buy'), then size color etc at checkout.  If you give them size options (say) first, they will be wondering if they really need it all the while they are worrying if it will fit.  E.g. if it is 'temporarily not available' the item is not in the basket, so they will move on. Sale lost!\n\n\nOther comments have addressed the pictures. I don't have a problem with the model (you??). But all the pictures have a white background, including the modelled clothes.... again this is like a fire department insurance claim!! The model should be in a natural environment (not plain white) and preferably posing, not just standing.  If you are just doing this now, go all glam- go out into your city and showcase you stuff like magazines do it!  Take the modelled shots in front of old buildings, graffiti, modern architecture, old cars, bikes, whatever. Lifestyle brand!\n\n\nIf you did feel like hiring a model or at least using a person who can handle or craves exposure, combined with semi pro photography (art school?) you would then have a dynamic magazine style in keeping with the brands you sell and the customers (or at least their aspirations).\n\n\nAlso in my cramped little tablet, I would make ONE picture of each garment the 'clickable' one, so you can see many different garments on the same page and screenful. ( Then clicking on one would give you the other views of that object. )\n\n\n I think your instincts are right, it's exposure you need.  I would start with your walk-in customers.  Decide what your strategy is.  If you made money off the website would you shut the shop?  Or open more shops?\n\n\nStart by offering your customers a discount after they purchase in the shop, exclusive to the website?  Then maybe they will spread the word too.  Or give them 'customer only' offers via email... again that they have to order online.\n\n\nI guess you know the reason stores with glass windows still exist is people don't always like the bother of returns, a high likelihood with clothing.  So in addition to 'free delivery', you need to make returns SUPER quick and easy.\n\n\nIf the sensation of shopping for clothes wasn't so intimate (trying stuff on), bricksn mortar would already be dead.  It's virtually the only viable main street option in retail. I'm guessing the margins also help.  The point to me is, if you are making your store work, you can definitely make the web work for you. You know what you are doing.  The website just needs to have that coolness, intimacy and fun that your store does.  \n\n\nThe final point is online marketing is a money game.  You have to have a fat marketing budget to climb up the dung heap over the other poor slobs.  Then you have traction and can rely on repeat orders and social media.  But without that first push you are nowhere.\n\n\nThe final final point is, plan for success!  If you did go viral for whatever reason (say a band bought some clothes from you and they tweeted a million followers...), how would you ride the tidal wave?","name":"t1_czv7hy8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-10 22:02:31","week":6}

Deferred revenue (ie subscriptions not yet realized) ended the year with 7.5bln up from 4.4bln the year prior. This amounts to only 7% of total sales but at much higher margins (again compare this to COST). I would even aggressively say that virtually all of that flows directly to the bottom line as Amazon likely spared all expenses up front for those customers. That is an aggressive assumption but that typically is the case for SaaS companies. \n\nSaaS companies are typically unprofitable because they incur all expenses up-front but have to recognize any revenue over the life of the customer contract, which typically can be anywhere from one to three years. \n\nOnce the customer is on-board with the company, it becomes increasingly sticky as they build more and more information and data into that proprietary service. With each renewal, costs continue to fall to almost zero over time.\n\nI always look foolish when I say this, but I continue to believe that GAAP accounting is behind the curve when it comes to SaaS companies and is effectively useless. This is why looking at cash flows are oftentimes the best answer.\n\n**Edit** If you assumed 100% profit margin on deferred revenue (again aggressive assumption), that would put EPS at $17 or a PE of 29.\n\n","name":"t1_czvmhwp","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2016-02-11 04:34:52","week":6}

{"id":"czvt7h2","author":"moumouren","body":"SaaS works because infrastructure is an immense one-time upfront cost that comes with huge depreciation costs where revenues are tight in the early years. As the later years roll by, fixed costs become negligible while marginal revenues go way up. So it's just a battle of attrition in the early years.\n\nAmazon doesn't behave like that. Its fixed costs are largely represented by warehouses, of which a significant portion is represented by capital leases. This means that Amazon is merely staggering its capital outlay to later years; fixed costs are expected to go UP over time, not disappear. As things stand, it only posts large FCF because it abuses capital leases. No other respectable company of this stature uses capital leases to this degree; it's just not cost efficient.\n\nFurthermore, variable costs are not expected to reduce. Cost of sales of goods are basically not going to change over time; they're commodities. So marginal cost will at best remain the same. Things like Prime can help with the marginal profit, but as we've seen it incurs its own expenses, nullifying all the extra revenues. \n\nAmazon's business model does not resemble an SaaS business at all.

{"id":"czvyf2m","author":"bigbear0083","body":"good morning traders! here are your early movers on this thursday-\n\n&gt; **PepsiCo** — The snack and beverage giant matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.06 per share. Revenue beat forecasts despite the negative impact of a strong dollar, and Pepsi made upbeat comments about the current year despite a \"challenging\" environment. It also increased its annual dividend to $3.01 per share from $2.81.\n\n&gt; **Nielsen** — The ratings company came in 2 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 82 cents per share, with revenue scoring a beat as well. The company said it benefited from the rollout of new products as well as winning new clients.\n\n&gt; **Avon Products** — The cosmetics maker reported a breakeven quarter, missing estimates by 8 cents, with revenue also below forecasts as sales fell for a 16th straight quarter. Avon was hurt by continuing declines in its key Latin American market.\n\n&gt; **Twitter** — Twitter reported adjusted quarterly profit of 16 cents per share, 4 cents above estimates, with revenue matching forecasts. However, Twitter shares are under pressure as the key metric of monthly average users posted a decline, and the company gave current quarter revenue guidance that falls below Street forecasts.\n\n&gt; **Tesla** — Tesla lost 87 cents per share for its latest quarter, compared to forecasts of a 10 cent per share profit, with revenue slightly below forecasts. However, the automaker gave a forecast for deliveries of its Model X that topped analyst estimates, and also said it expected to be profitable this year.\n\n&gt; **Time Inc.** — The magazine publisher missed estimates by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 58 cents per share, though revenue exceeded forecasts. Time did make upbeat comments about 2016 revenue, predicting growth after a 2015 decline.\n\n&gt; **TripAdvisor** — The travel website operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of 45 cents per share, 12 cents above estimates, and revenue was also well above Street consensus. TripAdvisor benefited from higher ad sales and an increase in subscriptions.\n\n&gt; **SolarCity** — The solar equipment maker's Chief Financial Officer Brad Buss resigned, replaced by SolarCity President Tanguy Serra.\n\n&gt; **Amazon.com** — Amazon announced a $5 billion stock buyback program, replacing a $2 billion program that had been announced in 2010 and had $763 million remaining.\n\n&gt; **Whole Foods** — Whole Foods came in 6 cents above estimates with quarterly profit of 46 cents per share, while the grocery chain's revenue was slightly above forecasts. The company also forecast fiscal 2016 comparable sales would fall into a range of down 2 percent to flat.\n\n&gt; **Expedia** — Expedia missed forecasts by 23 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 77 cents per share, with revenue roughly in line. The travel website operator did give an upbeat 2016 profit forecast.\n\n&gt; **Zynga** — Zynga matched analyst forecasts by reporting a breakeven quarter, but its current quarter forecast comes in below projections. The creator of the \"Farmville\" online game expects to release just one new game in the current quarter, pressuring its results.\n\n&gt; **Yahoo** — Yahoo announced the first round of layoffs in its planned move to eventually trim 15 percent of its workforce. 107 employees will be laid off as of April 11. (Disclosure: CNBC has a content-sharing partnership with Yahoo's finance site.)\n\n&gt; **UPS** — UPS increased its quarterly dividend to 78 cents per share from 73 cents, and also named CEO David Abney as its chairman, replacing former CEO Scott Davis in that position.\n\n&gt; **Cisco Systems** — Cisco reported adjusted quarterly profit of 57 cents per share, 3 cents above estimates, while revenue came in slightly above Street consensus. The networking equipment maker also increased its quarterly dividend to 26 cents per share from 21 cents, and increased its stock buyback program by $15 billion.\n\n&gt; **iRobot** — iRobot beat estimates by 8 cents with quarterly earnings of 65 cents per share, while the vacuum cleaner's revenue also exceeded forecasts. But iRobot's current quarter guidance is below estimates, as is its full-year forecast.\n\n&gt; **Skechers** — Skechers saw earnings miss by a penny at 19 cents per share, but revenue for the footwear maker's latest quarter was well above forecasts. The company also said 2016 sales were off to a strong start and that comparable sales are growing in the mid-to-high single digit range.\n\n&gt; **Pilgrim's Pride** — Pilgrim's Pride earned an adjusted 26 cents per share for its latest quarter, falling 14 cents shy of estimates, with revenue slightly below forecasts. The poultry producer's results were impacted by a bird flu outbreak that led to export restrictions.\n\n&gt; **Mylan** — Mylan is buying Swedish drug maker Meda For $7.2 billion in cash in stock. Separately, Mylan also reported quarterly profit of $1.22 per share on an adjusted basis, falling 6 cents below estimates.\n\n&gt; **Rio Tinto** — The company scrapped its policy of never cutting its dividend payout from year to year, because of a challenging environment for the mining company.\n\n&gt; **Nokia** — Nokia reported a better than expected profit for its latest quarter, but the telecom equipment maker warned of a negative impact from a slowdown in the key China market.\n\n&gt; **Boeing** — Boeing will cut jobs at its commercial airplane unit, in an effort to cut costs and better compete with Europe's Airbus.\n\n&gt; **KeyCorp** — KeyCorp's deal to buy rival regional bank First Niagara would be rejected by federal regulators if New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has his way. He is urging that the deal be blocked, saying it would cost thousands of jobs and reduce retail banking competition.","name":"t1_czvyf2m","subreddit":"StockMarket","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjuv","created_utc":"2016-02-11 14:17:33","week":6}

You allocate all of your income at the start of each month into specific categories, and then log your spending as you go.  My boyfriend loves it, and finds that it helps him reign in his spending on random stuff he finds on Amazon.  \n\nWith YNAB, you decide in advance that you are going to give yourself a monthly budget of $X for spending on clothes, $Y for spending on groceries, $Z for spending on car maintenance, and then if you spend less than the allocated amount, it rolls over into your budget for next month.  \n\nYou could also budget more manually, perhaps by logging your transaction in a spreadsheet, or by using Mint, which separates all of your transactions into different categories.  \n\n\nIn general, you should save and invest 10-15% of your income for retirement.  If I were you, I'd open an IRA and contribute an additional few hundred dollars per month.  I'd also set monthly goals for saving for a house.  Before you buy a house, you'll need an emergency fund, a 20% down payment (ideally, not required), 3-5% of the house's value for closing costs, and then some additional savings for moving expenses and any necessary updates or renovations you want to complete right away.  \n\nFor a $200k house, you might want to save up a total of $55k plus your emergency fund.  If you save $1500 per month towards your goal, it will take you 3 years to save up the cash.  If you save $2000 per month, it will take you approximately 2 years and 4 months.

Even if you could get $15, after fees and shipping you'd likely make about $2. But you're not going to get $15.\n\nThe Dixon Art Studios plate is super easy to find on eBay's completed listings as well:\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/Dixon-Art-Studio-25th-Wedding-Anniversary-Plate-10-25-With-Silver-Rim-Accent-/111840020847?hash=item1a0a2f496f:g:fwIAAOSw0HVWEGZC\n\nIt sold for $10 plus shipping.

Everybody like buying stuff. The hard part is researching. You need to research before, during, and after. Sometimes retail sites (like the Michael C Fina site) can give you an 'okay' indicator of price... but you always want to look at the venues you're actually going to be selling the item at. If it's not on eBay or Amazon, find  comparables. Find how often they're selling, or how well it's ranked, in Amazon's case. Look at eBay completed listings. \n\nWhatever you spent there, I'd just write off as 'tuition'. You learned an important lesson.\n\nIn the future, members of this sub aren't going to be doing your research for you. Generally, people see a thread like this and shit all over it.

{"id":"czwe4bl","author":"AlwaysABride","body":"I'll try to help by answering some questions.  They may or may not be the questions you asked.\n\nGenerally, the way stock options work is that they give you the right, if you choose (i.e., it is your option) to purchase a company's stock at some future date at a pre-established price (the \"exercise price\").  In the case of employee stock options, they are typically set up so that the exercise price is equal to the company's stock price the day you got them.\n\nSo, for example, Amazon stock is trading at $494 right now.  So an employee of Amazon may get an option to buy up to 1,000 shares of Amazon stock for $494 at any time over the next 5 years. (I'll continue to use this example throughout).\n\nWhen you get these stock option, there is no taxable event so long as the exercise price is the current price of the stock.  So in the Amazon case, there would be no income to the employee.  However, if the option price was $394 instead of $494, then the options would have value on the day they were issued, and the employee would have $100,000 (1,000 shares times $100) of taxable income on the date the options were issued.\n\nIf/when you exercise the options, there is a taxable event on whatever gain you have.  So if 3 years from now, the employee exercises their options when Amazon is trading at $725, the $231,000 \"gain\" would be taxable as ordinary income.  That's the difference between the $494,000 exercise price of the options, and the $725,000 value on the date of exercise.\n\nAt that point, you own the stock and it is treated like any other stock you own.  However, your basis in the stock (the amount used to determine future gains and losses) is the $725, not the $494 you actually paid (because you've already paid taxes on that $231 difference).  So when you sell the stock, the gain or loss will be calculated based upon the $725 acquisition value, and the gain or loss will be treated as either a long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon the holding period.\n\nTypically, people wait until the stock value goes up and then exercise their options and sell the stock all simultaneously to lock in their gain.  The problem is that, like in the Amazon example, most people don't have $494,000 sitting around to pay to the company in order to get the stock so that they can sell it.\n\nSo typically, a stock broker helps with the transaction so that 3 things can happen simultaneously:  (1) buy the stock by exercising the option, (2) sell the stock in the open market, and (3) withhold taxes from the gain and remit them to the IRS (because taxes on the $231,000 gain are going to be substantial).\n\nNow, having said that, **since your company is not publicly traded, there is a good chance the stock options are worthless**.  It really depends upon how sophisticated your employer is and how much professional help they got setting up the stock option program.  If they just set it up themselves and issued you a contract-looking letter titled \"option agreement\", then it is quite likely they just did something to make it seem like they were giving you something of value when they didn't.\n\nIf it is sophisticated and legitimate, then there *should* be some mechanism for periodically determining the value of a share of stock as well as a way for you to turn that share of stock into cash.  Either that, or a general understanding of \"hey, we're giving you these options with the understanding that they don't really have any value unless and until the company goes public\".  In which case, the options shouldn't even be exercisable unless the company goes public.","name":"t1_czwe4bl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-11 20:59:32","week":6}

So, as a company, they recognize exactly what you're talking about, and are continually 'aging down' the company to keep the youngsters in the ecosystem. \n\nAdditionally, do you think many of the users aged 45+ are going anywhere? For my parents, the internet is composed of Google for finding stuff, Amazon for buying stuff, and Facebook for keeping up with their friends and family. My parents are the same people who wouldn't give up their AOL email addresses for the last ten years because 'everybody knows that one'. While those users will be continually aging out of being able to use the platform, if you take a few hundred million 50-year-olds in a continuous cycle of sharing interesting memes with each other, you can sell a LOT of advertising that way, for a LONG time.\n\nIt's interesting that you're behind Google but not Facebook. Since Facebook advertising is very often promoted content with real value, people are vastly more likely to interact with it well than the Google ad network, which are JUST ads.\n\nAs someone who runs a small business, believe me when I tell you, the conversion is there.\n\nFinally, if you think the internet is somehow going to move toward MORE privacy and LESS personal data...

{"id":"czwhu6w","author":"macroinvestor","body":"I think you are going in the right direction. Beginning in 2009, U.S. households have picked up their savings habits and with the decline in gasoline prices, the average U.S. household is saving an additional $1,000 a year.\n\nSo far, however, they have been saving most of this vs. spending this on other things. The trouble with TGT and other consumer plays is that AMZN's influence has really been deflationary for the whole consumer sector, with pockets of exceptions such as Apple's products, home improvement retail (HD and LOW), and discount stores (ROST, DLTR, etc.). I have been bullish on ROST but the stock feels overextended.\n\nWhat the Millennials want as you know are something new and differentiated, and they are spending most of their additional savings on Zara, Forever 21, etc. URBN still resonates to some extent so I am bullish on them this year, but fashion is a fickle space so it's only good for a 6- to 12-month hold. COH is turning around and they've refreshed their products and stores so I like them as well.","name":"t1_czwhu6w","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-11 22:23:10","week":6}

{"id":"czwmbd2","author":"mmmmmmBacon12345","body":"&gt;If/when you exercise the options, there is a taxable event on whatever gain you have. So if 3 years from now, the employee exercises their options when Amazon is trading at $725, the $231,000 \"gain\" would be taxable as ordinary income. That's the difference between the $494,000 exercise price of the options, and the $725,000 value on the date of exercise.\n\n&gt;At that point, you own the stock and it is treated like any other stock you own. However, your basis in the stock (the amount used to determine future gains and losses) is the $725, not the $494 you actually paid (because you've already paid taxes on that $231 difference). So when you sell the stock, the gain or loss will be calculated based upon the $725 acquisition value, and the gain or loss will be treated as either a long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon the holding period.\n\nOnly one of the above paragraphs can be true or it results in double taxation.  If he closes his option he will get $231,000 which will be treated as a short term capital gain and taxed as normal income.\n\nIf he exercises his option, he will have to put up $494,000 and will acquire 1000 shares in exchange for the cash and his option, this does not trigger a taxable event until he sells those shares.\n\nThe way you described it would result in being taxed when you exercise the option, and being taxed *again* when he finally sells those shares.","name":"t1_czwmbd2","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-12 00:05:26","week":6}

{"id":"czwztfl","author":"hallsgator","body":"Went to my first library book sale tonight that had a nice challenge. Tonight was “Preview” night where only members of the library could enter. You could pay $5 at the door to join, so that’s what I did. They also did not allow scanners at the Preview sale, they do for the rest of weekend.\n\nThought it would be a nice challenge sourcing books with no scanner. Prices were great, only $1 for hardbacks, .50 for paperbacks and kid’s books were 3/$1. They had a “special” priced section as well, I’ll get to that.\n\nThere were probably 20 or so people there for the hour I was looking around. I noticed a couple other people that gave off the seller vibe, so not too much competition. It was in a smallish room packed with books, the library advertised 10,00 books, but I would be surprised if there was half of that.  Also a little disappointing was most of the books were library discards, not the most desirable books.\n\nI spent my time looking through the non-fiction sections, grabbing just about anything that looked newish with a good topic or was an interesting topic. I grabbed all the new textbooks I saw, but this is where I made a big mistake. Most of them were advanced copies, not available for resale. I caught a few before putting them in my bag, but still ended up buying 6 or 7. Luckily they were only .50 a piece. I did well with religious books and a couple of cookbooks. Fairly slim pickings overall, not the strongest inventory available.\n\nI ended up sending $78 on books. This includes $39 spent on 3 books from “special pricing” section that looked like they had potential, but didn’t really pay off. My best find was an educational book for $.50 that will sell for $23.99. According to my IL numbers, I’ll be sending in 34 books with an average rank of 834k. Not the best, but there’s a good mix of high and low ranked books. Total buy cost for books going to Amazon: $54.16. Total Sales value: $403.46.

I regularly make between £20-£50 a week for a few hours a day.  It’s very similar to Amazon’s MTURK (which is unfortunately U.S. only) \nClickworker is a company based out of Germany, they pay you cash to do small online tasks, such as rate if a website has adult content, verify information on individuals &amp; organizations and a massive range of others tasks.  Although there are some jobs available on the Clickworker website.  The real money is made on their UHRS project\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n*Note:  Clickworker requires that you use Internet Explorer to complete tasks from them*\n\nFirst, you need to [Sign Up] (http://www.clickworker.com/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=629851&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email).   Once you have done this, it’s time to start filling out your profile.   A few key things to remember when filling our your profile:  When they ask you for a tax number select “No, I am freelance/commercial”.  You’ll need to add English as your native language for Both written and Verbal.  And don’t forget to fill out your paypal address under payment details\n\nOnce your profile is completed it’s time to do some assessments.  The first two assessments are:\n\n-\t**Placement Test – English**: This is a simple Grammar test with around 35 multiple choice questions.  Very simple to complete and should only take you about 10 minutes\n\n-\t**Qualify for Address**: This is a test to check your research skills.  You will be given a Company name, you need to google that company and find out their contact info.  You’ll need to list the Company name, address &amp; phone number.  With this test  **READ THE GUIDELINES!!**  As it’s very important you input the data exactly as they expect it.  This will take about 10-15 minutes.\n\nAfter you have completed these tests, another set of tests will be unlocked for you.  These are:\n\n\n-\t**Qualification for UHRS I**:   This is a combination of the first two tests,  you’ll get about 50 multiple choice grammar questions and about 5 find the address questions.\n\n-\t**Qualification for UHRS II**:  This is simple.  You have to create the Live I.D. you will be using to access UHRS.  Just follow the instructions and sign up for the unique Live I.D. they tell you (You Should save or write this down somewhere) – Well Done!  You’ve now got access to UHRS.\n\n**UHRS**\n\nUHRS or Unique Human Resources System is where the money’s at.  You can login by clicking “Compare Web Search Results” under jobs.  Or you can log in directly at \nhttps://prod.uhrs.playmsn.com/Judge/Views/Login\n\nEach Job (or HIT as Clickworker calls them) requires you to do a qualification test, this is normally the same as the actual HIT, but Clickworker knows the answers and checks to make sure you got it correct, as long as you read the guidelines and pay attention you should pass first time (normaly you get 3 chances, but this isn’t always the case, and if you fail qualification you can’t do that HIT) Once you have passed the qualification test, simply click “Start Judging” to begin working.  \n\n**Payment**\n\nPayment is made via paypal.  Your first payment is quite slow, and takes 21 days.  However after the first payment has been made you are paid weekly. \n\n[Clickworker/UHRS](http://www.clickworker.com/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=629851&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email) | [non-ref](http://www.clickworker.com)\n","name":"t1_czx8zue","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-12 14:21:22","week":6}

{"id":"czxc6b2","author":"beley","body":"It varies a *LOT* by industry, but for established companies (not startups in high growth phase) it's generally a multiple of **net profit** not revenues. For retail (I own an e-commerce company) I wouldn't pay more than 3-4x net profit for a company. I looked at buying a small e-commerce company that had leveled out and the owner wanted 20x net (or 3-4x gross revenues) and I had to laugh out loud. \n\nCompanies that are in growth mode, growing 30%, 50% or even 100% a year can be valued based on other factors though, because they usually keep their net profits at almost zero by reinvesting in growing the customer base (look at Amazon for an example of this, they STILL do this). Here the valuation is a lot more tricky and involved looking at the estimated market share the company can take, the size of the overall market, etc. \n\nIn the end though it's kind of like the stock market -- your business is only worth what someone will give you for it.

Unfortunately, there is not a 'shopping list' approach that will make you successful. You're going to have to start researching pretty much everything you see at thrift stores, craigslist, estate sales etc and get into your own groove. Acquire an eye for profitable stuff. Use the completed listings feature on eBay to see what things are selling for how much (especially good when you see something that you THINK is profitable, but you're not sure... install the app on your phone). Similarly, the Amazon app combined with Camelcamelcamel.com are useful for measuring your potential success on Amazon. \n\nOther than that just keep reading threads here. You'll learn a lot just by reading about other's stories of success and failure. Whatever you do, don't post a thread that just asks \"Hey guys, what do I buy?!?!?!\" :)\n\nGood luck!

{"id":"czxnho2","author":"LettinItAllHangOut","body":"I just went through mattress buying, did tons of research, and I am now the de facto \"mattress guru\" in my groups of friends. Here is your quick and easy buying guide:\n\n* Do as much research as you feel comfortable doing using [The Mattress Underground](http://www.themattressunderground.com/) and [Sleep Like the Dead](http://www.sleeplikethedead.com/). I did a lot of research because that's kind of how I am, but I understand everybody might not be so meticulous. My big piece of advice that can apply to anyone is don't think memory foam is the only option. They have by far had the most advertising, so everyone knows of them and thinks they're unarguably the best, but you should look around. I ended up going with a latex mattress and it was absolutely the best choice for me.\n\n* If you can, go to a store and lay on different types of mattresses. It's the best way to know what you'll like.\n\n* THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. You will not be able to find a better deal in a store than you can through an online mattress retailer. I've seena  lot of people in this thread saying, \"I bought mine on Amazon and it's great\" \"Have you heard of Tuft and Needle?\". Again, these are the most advertised ones, but there are so much more (and honestly, way better quality. The Tuft and Needle and Casper mattresses kind of suck IMO). So here is God's gift to the mattress buyer. [Sleepopolis](http://sleepopolis-mattress-reviews.com/). This guy does amazingly thorough reviews, has coupons and deal codes through his site, and reviews almost all of the online reatiler mattresses and compares them against each other. It was absolutely the saving grace of my mattress buying experience as the whole thing was starting to get really frustrating.

I'm assuming since you pay kids daycare cost that you don't have cell phones for the kids.\n\nNope, kids don't have cellphones. Our bill is so high because we took out iPhones on a pay by the month basis - so in September we'll be done paying them off. I believe we probably only have ~$300 left to pay on them, but I'm not sure. Either way, when September hits, I'll keep my phone - not upgrade. Without the stupid month by month pay plan our bill would probably be around $100 (at least that's what our unlimited shared plan costs).\n\n&gt; Your cable/internet bill is sky high. You don't need cable and only pay for internet. (we only pay 25 a month for internet here) Plus we pay for netflix. Kids can watch PBS, good quality STEM programming here.\n\nI wish I hadn't just signed back on with Verizon. I was looking at internet only but even then it's no less than $60-80/mo (even for a slow speed!!!) so add monthly equipment fees to that, and Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, etc it ends up costing just as much.\n\n&gt; As for car insurance I see no problem.

We're starting the 21 day fix here soon, so that should help cut down the bill. I bring food from home for breakfast and lunch, but by the time I'm home from work I'm too exhausted to make dinner, so if my husband is home (he works nights 2-3 nights a week) we usually go out to eat or grab fast food.

The reason is there is a maximum on the number of people born in each country to get a Green Card (I think it's 7% of the total number of Green Cards), so those countries are backlogged.\n\nOn average which you asked for, I got it in 3 years, a couple of my other friends got it around the same time. If you land a tech job in a good company who actually cares about their employees, it's usually a couple of years after your H1B.\n\nH1B and Green Card filings in US are public info (except employee info like name and address and identifiable information). There are several websites that allow you to search through the filings. For example: http://data.jobsintech.io/\n\nCheck this http://data.jobsintech.io/companies. Look at the companies at the top and check their number of Green Card filings against their H1B visas. You want companies that apply for Green Cards.\n\nFor example, Infosys and Tata are shit. They basically apply for no one except in special circumstances. The third one, Microsoft while it has 50k H1B visas it has a 40% Green Card application rate.

{"id":"czywpbv","author":"Pyro636","body":"For shipping, there are really two different options on eBay. Either\n\n1. You account for the cost of shipping in the sale price. Say you buy something for $5 and want to make $20, but shipping is another $5. So you list it for $25 free shipping OR\n2. You elect to do calculated or flat rate shipping when you list your item. So you list your item for $20 and then the buyer also pays your flat $5 if you do flat rate, or whatever the shipping calculator determines their shipping price to be.\n\nI personally mostly do calculated shipping, as I sell a lot of items on the heavier end (15+lbs) and so the shipping cost in shipping to say California is way more expensive than shipping to NYC. \n\n\nWith either method, the buyer pays the shipping costs, even if the listing is technically \"free shipping\".\n\n\nAs for FBA, this question is answered in many places already, so I suggest you do some searching on the sidebar or head on over to /r/FulfillmentByAmazon ","name":"t1_czywpbv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-13 23:40:17","week":6}

{"id":"czzvsnn","author":"aerored82","body":"So Facebook,  Amazon,  YouTube and Google are all each investing billions in 'the social graph', and targeted advertising, which is no better than what you are asking for...\n\n\nAnd there is a huge war between the advertising community and consumers who are fed up with the intrusion. Why? Because the algorithms they all use are CRAP!  Given their size and position in the market, they are all clueless.  \n\n\nThe magic bullet, finding the exact demographic for your product, at this time, is science fiction.\n\n\nAny niche company who could help you, will realize the power they have, and firstly won't want to upset their OWN customers.  Secondly if they did, it would cost too much to you.  Thirdly, what are the odds that such a company isn't in fact a competitor to you, who by definition is more successful and powerful, so why would they help you?\n\n\nThe time-honored method other comments alude to is,  do the work to build your OWN subscription list through blogging or competitions, or some other 'free content' surrounding your product or service, which predisposes the people on the list to view your offers favorably.  Currently, that is the only reliable method afaik.  Clearly it takes time, effort and money.  You have to put your brand in front of a lot of people who aren't interested at first, in order to start building a community of people who share an interest.  Even that is impossible for many products. \n\n\n...which is why personally I believe FB et al are barking at the moon.  I simply don't believe you can isolate brand or even product preference through lifestyle choice or social networks.  If my neighbor buys a Volvo, am I gonna buy one? Hell no! If I like dogs, will my drinking buddies also like dogs? No!  Consumers habits are private, random,  sometimes stupid, and change often.\n\n\nAnyway I've taken my meds so I'm calmer now...  your catnip product can be sold to cat owners, but cats are so ubiquitous that literally anyone could own one.  Your only option is to be highly specific.  E.g. market to a company that makes catfood,  they could offer you a deal to buy your units to be used in a promotion of THEIR product. (E.g. 'buy 3 tins of catfoodX and get a free bag of catnip'.)  Just a random idea.  Try to imagine the 'pipeline' of supply to cat owners. To reach them, forget email, try outlets like veterinarians?","name":"t1_czzvsnn","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-14 21:28:27","week":6}

I do not have an IT guy or programmer.  3 of us are intermediate in excel but do not use VBA and we do not have the knowledge to run scripts.  I am aware I most likely need to start getting all my data in 1 place.  I have not dug in deep but I assumed that data will need to end up in Access or SQL.  The issue I would have bringing in an outsider is they would have a hard time understanding some of the data we need and over time that data would change so if you set up a template for us, we would need to keep coming back to have things tweaked.  The type of reporting I would like would need to access Amazon sales reports, Ebay sales reports, our shipping software, and our WMS.\n\nI currently download data from these sites and kick it over to India to have it done manually for 4.00 an hour.  It works, but also makes it so we cannot instantly access our reports.  I think it would be easier if you picked a niche.  For example, I pay a firm to run our Ad Campaigns on Amazon.  He gives me multiple reports monthly but if I asked him to give me ebay reports or Google Ad reports, he would say no since he is focused on strictly Amazon Ads.

{"id":"czzx5wi","author":"jordanwilson23","body":"There are a million things you could do.  It is dangerous to put all your faith in Amazon as others have mentioned but if you try to diversify your products on ebay, it may not be much added sales and could be a pain in the ass.  You could take your existing products on Amazon and focus on increasing their sales on Amazon.  To do this, you need to solicit reviews (checkout amztracker).  If you use Amztracker and it works for you, you also need to remember there is a VERY good chance that site is going to get shut down or Amazon is going to completely change their search algorithm.  I solicit reviews via this software but I still believe it is not going to be around forever.\n\nYou need to play with Amazon Ads.  They are pretty confusing but you can start with an auto campaign to cover your 2-3 current SKUs.  Just make the bid really low on the campaign.  Once you have enough data, take the converting keywords and put them into a manual campaign and up your bids.  Some items can be extremely expensive. When running a campaign I also think you can get cheaper clicks by manually pausing it daily and restarting it in the afternoon.  This way you are not bidding against the other sellers that maxed their budget out in the morning.\n\nIf you have decent products, this process should take you a couple months to get something sustainable.  If your product category is popular you will need to keep running give aways biweekly or monthly to hold your rank.  If money is an issue I would recommend focusing on your ROI more than your gross profit.  This will extend your cashflow.  Bascailly when you sell a product you have the cost of the product, the cost of fees, and the cost of shipping.  You only need to pay for the product up front so you want something you can buy for 1.00, pay 7.00 in shipping and sell for 15.00 instead of something you buy for 7.00, pay 1.00 in shipping and sell for 15.00.  This is one metric I use to extend cash flow.  If I could start over again, I would have built up 1 product at a time.  I think this is the right way to go and will allow you to focus more on a single item.  You bring in 5 products and then you start getting a little sloppy.","name":"t1_czzx5wi","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-14 22:07:36","week":6}

{"id":"czzycqp","author":"Infosavvycanada","body":"I know personally few people who are paying close to $150 monthly just for TV services even they are on moderate budget. Now that’s just absurd. You don’t need all those premium channels and packages to entertain your family. Even you tune into some of these channels very rarely and you are paying $10 to $20 for each of these channels monthly.\n\nOkay, let’s move on. Ensure you are on unlimited internet data plan for your home. You are good to go now. Cut the cord on your cable TV and switch to Internet TV. Popular options are Netflix, Hulu Plus, Sling TV, HBO, Crackle TV, and Amazon Prime monthly subscription. They have a rich library of TV content including most popular TV series. Some of these even telecast live sports events. Pick your option whatever best for you. One of these subscription would cost you from nothing to somewhere around $15 monthly.\n\nI understand some of these options are only available on other side of the border. Don’t get disheartened here. There are quite a few options available if you look around. Another thing, you can buy a Chromecast stick or Smart TV box- Apple or Roku or any other android box if you don’t have smart TV at home. These are useful to watch free news feed, movies and You Tube videos or similar free Apps from your comfy couch. Anyway, if you can’t simply live without cable then downgrade to basic package and subscribe to one of these services for premium content. Another option, you can simply pick up a free to air TV antenna form Best Buy to watch your favorite local shows or news free of cost.It should not cost you more than 30 bucks to buy a decent antenna. By making these few changes you should able to reduce your TV bill up to 50%.","name":"t1_czzycqp","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-02-14 22:41:24","week":6}

{"id":"czzyema","author":"RockhopperZP","body":"Yeah, I really love those long expirations...The premium's obviously higher but you get the benefits of less significant IV fluctuations, and the time decay is much more insignificant compared to options a few months out. The spreads really fucking suck though.\nLet's say I think NFLX, AMZN, or any other inflated P/E company is going to go up in the short term for whatever reason. I'll set a strangle with a bunch of ~2 month calls and a couple of more expensive very long term puts. If I'm right and it goes up, I cash in the calls, ideally for more than I paid for the entire position. Because the time horizon is so far on the puts, even a decent move against them won't have a huge effect on prices, especially not as much as with short duration. There is a hit and again, the spread fucking sucks, so if I can and still be profitable I'll just hold onto them as long as I can for the bubble to eventually burst. Even if it doesn't in the next 2 years, no worries because I already was profitable overall off the calls. And then holding the puts lets me do the same thing in a few months if I think it'll go up again, but now I don't have to cross the spread to buy new puts. \nI do the opposite with strong fundamental companies: if I think it'll go down short-term I'll buy short duration puts and a couple of long calls. My best trade of the year so far was using this strategy on Alcoa: Early Jan I bought Feb puts and a few Jan18 calls, It crashed with the earnings as I predicted, so I cashed in the puts for a 20% increase on my total position. I still have the calls, and they've gone up since I closed the puts. Now if aluminum makes a recovery by Jan 18, I'll have a nice payday. If not, I already broke even so fuck it. \nIt could be a good strategy for stronger Oil companies, though I haven't touched any of those myself the last few months as there's too much crazy shit going on.\nIt's not as safe as a straight straddle obviously, as if Alcoa had gone the other way I would've had a bunch of near worthless puts and better calls, though I likely couldn't profitably cash out because of the spread(unless it was a very big move). \n\nThose options are fucking great for long term value investing, or long term 'fuck this inflated tech company' investing.","name":"t1_czzyema","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-02-14 22:42:57","week":6}
