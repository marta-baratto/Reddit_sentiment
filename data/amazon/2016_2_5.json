{"id":"43lnbh","author":"Guacamula","body":"Hey guys I've been getting a lot of good advice from this subreddit and notice a lot of you like to order/cook/store food in bulk. To be specific, I'm looking to buy brown rice, black beans, whole wheat pasta, and oatmeal in large quantities (like 50 lb bags.) The only website I even know to check is Amazon so where do you all find deals buying your food items in bulk? It would be great to have all of this on hand and basically only shop for veggies and meat.","name":"t3_43lnbh","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-02-01 00:45:08","week":5}

{"id":"43om6f","author":"alanorourke","body":"Hi guys,\nI am working on the next book in the Marketing Tactics Series and my focus this time is email list building.  I am compiling the ultimate list of practical tactics that anyone can start using as soon as they read them. My goal is 200 of the highest quality tactics that go beyond the basic \"Put a pop up on your site\".  I will also categorise each tactic by difficulty, type and industry. If you need to build an audience I want this to be the go to reference book!\n\nThis is where I need your help. \nWhat list building tactics have you tried that worked great. Have you seen any great examples from other people? Can you share it with me via this form please?\n\nEvery single contribution will get a thank you in the book and a digital copy when published.\nIf your tactic is used you will get full credit and attribution and I will send you a signed copy of the book.\n\nI am collecting submission here http://audiencestack.com/static/book-submission-listbuilding-tactics.html \n\nbut feel free to share in comments if you prefer.\n\n-------------------------\n\nIn the interest of giving back I wanted to share 5 ideas that you probably have not heard of before. \n \n \n1. Sold out event tickets\n\nTo build the list for his own marketing events, Jason Row would buy two tickets for a related event earlier in the year. When the first event sold out Jason would then offer the two tickets in a competition to attract those still looking. The killer part of this tactic was that Jason would often approach the first event about the competition who were more than happy to promote it to their own audience as it made them look great.\n\nTip: The competition works best about 3 days before the first event and of course only when it is sold out.\n \n \n \n2.  Run a course\n\nSeth Godin has a great example of a wine merchant who used free information provided to him from his suppliers  to create a wine appreciation course by email.\nInstead of putting an ad in the paper for the latest wine offers he placed an ad for the course.. Newsletter by newsletter he explained the virtues and characteristics of the wines in his shop and along with it, gained the trust and confidence of would be purchasers. He became known in his locality as an authority on wine; he converted readers to purchasers and ultimately grew his business.\n\nThe information he gave out was free, provided by the wine makers. Like the wine merchant, think of the expertise you have in your field and see how you can repackage it for your subscribers. Keep it simple and relevant to the needs of your clients.\n\nTip: Instead of advertising your business, advertise a resource or course.\n \n \n \n3. Offer a checklist with every blog post\n\nBrian Dean from Backlinko achieves a 5-8% subscription rate on his content by offering a download focused on the blog post a person just read. His most common type of download is a checklist. So for example if you just read a blog post on how to get people to link to your website Brian would offer a checklist of the top 10 things to remember to do when asking for links. Brian offers the download within the content itself and at the end.\nMatthew Barby, Global head of growth &amp; SEO at Hubspot has also spoken about the increase in subscribers they achieved by better matching their downloadable resources with each piece of content.\n \n \n \n4. Pay or download for free\n\nThe next time you are speaking at an event do not offer your ebook for free at the end to get subscribers. Instead tell them where they can buy it BUT also offer a discount code they can use to get 100% off. This results insignificantly more downloads and subscribers. Chris Penn is constantly on the road keynoting events and offered this tip on his weekly marketing podcast Marketing Over Coffee with John Wall.\n\nI tried this when speaking at an event in London. I offered the an Amazon link where people could buy the book at full price and then offered a discount code where they could get 100% off on my own website. I noticed the difference immediately with people coming up to me afterwards thanking me for my generosity and instant downloads of the book.\n\nTip: https://gumroad.com/ is a great tool for selling your book and setting up discount codes.\n \n \n \n5. Calculators for everything\n\nEngineering for marketing is one of my favourite tactics. A common implementation of this is online calculators. Banks or estate agents often offer mortgage calculators where you put in your salary and spending information and it will tell you how much of a Mortgage you will get. Insurance companies will ask you how much cover you want and calculate how much your monthly payments will be.\n\nEmail marketing company Toddle.com offers a handy marketing return on investment (ROI) calculator. You put in how much money and time you spent on a marketing campaign, how many leads you got back and how much money you earned. The app will then calculate your % ROI and the value of a lead. You can then give your email address to download this report or if you wish you can download an excel version of the calculator and do it yourself.\n\nTip: Create the calculator yourself in Excel and for less than $100 you find a developer on upwork.com or elance.com to turn it into a Javascript app to put on a webpage.\n \n \n \nBonus 6. Survey your industry\n\neConsultancy.com produces and sells many industry reports each year. This is a huge source of revenue for them and partners. However what you might not realise is that they are also a great way to build subscribers. People are invited directly or via adverts to take part in the industry survey and in return they will get a free copy of the report when done (Subscription value starts at €795.00)\n\nTip: Appeal to a person’s ego to get the best results for this. E.g. highlight you are \"only inviting the best HR Directors from the top companies of your country and their input will help direct the future of HR over the next year\".\n\n \n\nWhat about you? What is your favourite way to build your subscriber list?\nShare below or here: http://audiencestack.com/static/book-submission-listbuilding-tactics.html","name":"t3_43om6f","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-01 15:15:58","week":5}

Do you understand what exactly we're all about?  \n\nThanks so much!\n\n**EDIT 1:**  Sorry guys, I know it might have came off as spammy, here's how our site will work\n\nWe share commissions with the original deal poster, you don't need to refer anybody or market anything.\n\n*We do all the marketing.*\n\nThe only thing you have to do is find true and quality deals to post on our site, and we split any commissions that we make on that deal with you.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Thanks so much for the feedback guys!  We appreciate it very much.  One more quick question, what can we do to attract more users (buyers) those that want to buy deals.  Would you suggest implementing a refer-a-friend program for let's say a $10 Amazon/eBay gift card per friend referred?\n\n**EDIT 3:  Wow guys!  You blew me away!  Thank you so much!  All your feedback will be taken into account, I already forwarded this to my technical partner.  Our analytics are off the charts and we are learning a lot from your actions.**\n\n**Tip for deal posters:  Try posting deals for items that you personally are interested in purchasing.  If you post a deal on something that you personally would buy, chances are the next guy might buy it.  And bam, there's your first sale and commission!  The better quality of a deal you find the more chances of you earning commission.**\n\n","name":"t3_43qa5w","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-01 20:58:51","week":5}
{"id":"43qfad","author":"H-KCM","body":"I wanted to get /r/investing's thoughts on what your favorite value picks / holdings are and why? \n\nMine are below, and would love to hear feedback, advice or suggestions.\n\n**$SWHC** - Sin stock / controversial discount, I got in at the $15 range, its election year, ISIS terrorism threats are high, NCIs checks at record levels, quarterly projections up 20%, cash generating machine trading at industrial multiples, should trade closer to consumers, currently in XM17 contract worth potentially $250mm, likely driving $50+ mm more sales per year from contract and consumer buys. M&amp;P Product Line has had excellent growth and is leader in CCW market, the most profitable segment due to low polymer costs. Excellent track record of innovative products and bringing to market, with very low R&amp;D costs. M&amp;A has been in accessories market, which the average consumer spends the same amount as the original gun itself, and higher margin. Lots of roll-up in the industry. Risks: NWC and channel build up after sales settle like previous cycle.\n\n**$RDS.A** - Trading near all time historical lows due to low oil and short-term bears on expensive BG group acquisition, bought at $26 dividend yield over 9.5% management expected to keep as well as cut operating costs by $3/4Bn and turn around profitability, lowest P/B in sector @ .6, BG Group adds LNG (byproduct of E&amp;P activities and more profitable), 20% more reserves, 30% more production and making it the 2nd largest oil conglomerate, albeit expensive @ current Oil and LNG prices. No risk of bankruptcy due to massive scale and assets, as well as $30 BN of cash. Risks: Oil staying in the low's short term.\n\n**$PRAA** - Debt collection business has taken a hit due to low amounts of charge-offs driven by cheap credit and strong economy, cash generating machine with stellar growth and profitability. Suffering due to one time impairments @ very attractive multiples, especially as company benefits from recession, strong performance during the last cycle. Recent high leverage from international M&amp;A growing top line, profitability and the 40% market leader in an industry with high entries to barrier dominated by two companies. Auto / Home sales at record or strong levels means more potential charge-offs. Risks: Regulations, tax liabilities and low charge-off rates from strong economy despite current sell-off.\n\n**$OLN** - Trading low recently also at 09 trough levels and decline in profitability from commodity pricing pressure, consistent 5% dividend yield, business merging with DOW making it the largest Chlor-Alkalai manufacturing. Kicker for half the business being Winchester, a profitable and growing ammunition manufacturer, which ammunition should see the firearms sales spike growth delayed in a few months. Risks: Commodity pricing exposure\n\n**$WMT** - Horrible 2015 trading near 09 trough levels, big turnaround planned for 2016, healthy 3% dividend yield and focus on profitability and e-commerce. Very defensive and one of the few strong performers so far in 2016. A downturn would unlikely affect WMT with a beta of .2. Risks: AMZN, increasing wages, low / long e-commerce growth / success, poor execution and profitability near term. \n\n**Currently up ~20% driven by SWHC, RDS.A, OLN and WMT**\n\n**Others I Like:** \n\n**GILD, LCI, ARLP/AHGP, AAPL, MDLZ, AFSI, RICK, SAVE, FCX** ","name":"t3_43qfad","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-01 21:27:27","week":5}

{"id":"43s6lg","author":"mikenseer","body":"A while back I signed up for Amazon's Echo beta test, and I've had an Echo ever since, constantly listening! I left the default name Alexa, as that sounded more natural than saying \"Amazon\", and lets be honest its hard not to build some sort of relationship with a named computer. Cortana and Siri are much more fun at telling jokes than \"Hey Google\", even if the jokes are better.\n\nWhile perusing through my Amazon Echo app, I stumbled upon the \"Skills\" page. Reading through a few of the \"Skills\" I realized that they were no more than apps, just without GUI.  **Does the Amazon Echo have an App Store?** The Echo may be a bit in the \"early adopters only\" zone still, but where are the other voice command systems at? As far as I know Google, Siri, and Cortana do not have an app store for developers.\n\n**Amazon is passing the threshold into crowdsourcing the development of \"Alexa\"**. Now, I'm a full believer that AI will be taking over the back end of any voice command systems, but anytime soon? I doubt AI will take the place of human \"app\" development for voice command apps for a least a couple of years, if we're lucky. \n\nThere will still be room for apps to be made to hook Alexa up to other services such as calendars, project management software, search engines, social media, etc. I think Amazon has pulled ahead by opening up \"app\" development for their Echo (Alexa). Not that they will assuredly be the winners, but they've positioned themselves well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you think voice command apps will have any value, like the app store did for turning Apple's smart phone into a Mary Poppins bag of tools and distractions? Do you think Voice commands are a fad? (It's pretty clear that they're past that) Do you think things will develop too fast to make an app store useful? The real question is if there is an opportunity here.","name":"t3_43s6lg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-02 03:45:55","week":5}

{"id":"43sw1o","author":"imkatnotcat","body":"Let me just get this out of the way before I forget, [this is my referral link](http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=304443)/[this isn't](http://www.tremorgames.com)\n\nI know we've all seen sites like Tremor before. We've probably all even seen Tremor before, right? Similar to other \"offer wall\" style sites, but they seem to have a better selection than any other one I've ever used (there's currently 19 different offer walls available to pick from, some I've never seen on any other site), but that's not very interesting. Everybody here already knows they can earn something for watching videos, downloading apps and on rare, glorious occasions, for signing up for a free Netflix trial. \n\nWhat makes Tremor stand out (for me) is the reward options - not only do they have a selection of the typical payout options (btc, eBay/Amazon/Steam/Xbox/PSN...even reddit gold), they specialise in steam games that they source from sales/bundles etc.\n\nWhen it comes to gift cards, you can expect 900 tremor coins to be roughly equal to 1 USD, though it varies somewhat - a $20 steam code is 18000 coins, but a $50 amazon card is only 41000 coins. The games however, are a much better exchange rate:\n\nI had [1473 steam games](http://imgur.com/uDdKdmo) a couple of hours ago, which you'd think would limit my options for game purchases...and it did. I owned the vast majority of their selection of cheap games...but, I still managed to spend [several thousand coins](http://imgur.com/6KQqv4o)\n\nJust as proof of the site being legit real quick:\n[Here's me getting PM'd some keys on the site today](http://imgur.com/s3y0Vsh)\n[Here's my Steam account activating them](http://imgur.com/sTzNAZq) [cont](http://imgur.com/xcwZj69)\n\nSo, my Steam account actually got blocked from activating more keys, so the next screenshot is far less impressive than I wanted it to be, but [Here's roughly what the trading cards are worth](http://imgur.com/WYnOTHs).\n\nFor those 51 games that I did get to activate (at 99 coins per) I spent 5049 coins, and once I collect my trading cards (If you buy a heap of games like I did, I'd recommend downloading something like Idle Master and just leaving it running overnight - although you can do it the old fashioned way and download them all if your computer can handle it) I'll have approx 20 NZD in Steam wallet credit (actually, likely more because I'll pick up at least a couple of foils from 200+ cards) - which is a far better exchange rate than buying the codes directly.\n\nThen, last step (that I'm not personally going to do this time because there's something I actually want from Steam and my accounts currently trade-locked because SteamGuard is a pita) - you can also trade in Steam items (TF2, CSGO, Dota etc) to Tremor Games in exchange for Tremor Coins - so with my trading card money, I could buy half a dozen TF2 keys and trade them into Tremor for 1310 coins each - for a total of 7860 coins - so at that point, not only would I have the 51 games, I'd actually have considerably more coins than I initially spent to get them. If you happened to have a steam account which didn't already have over a thousand games, you'd have even more options for cheap games than I had and could rinse and repeat that strategy a few more times. \n\nEDIT: [All the available giftcards](http://imgur.com/eZMErI3) for people who don't want to sign up just to check.\n\nTLDR:\n\n1. Sign up to TremorGames [this is my referral link](http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=304443)/[this isn't](http://www.tremorgames.com), do offers like you do on any similar site.\n\n2. Buy shitty steam trading card games to turn your coins into more coins.\n\n3. Buy the Amazon code or whatever you initially wanted.","name":"t3_43sw1o","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-02 06:44:53","week":5}

{"id":"43uz7j","author":"Jeff-H_Art","body":"I'm extremely new to investing (less than a week) and I am trying to come up with a plan aside from blindly following. I'm starting a small $6k and treating it as if it were 20 times larger - $10 loss is a $200 loss. \n\nAnyways, basically I am buying stock in companies that seem to have been performing well over the last 5,10,15,20 years. I buy them when they're at a low. For that, I check out the day, week, month, year fluctuations. \n\nHere's some things. Can you guys give me some critique on these?\n\n1. If I'm holding long term, I just buy it when it's at a 2 day low. It's better to start now then never for funds like Vanguard (in my opinion) so I'll just put stuff in there now. \n\n2. If I'm holding short term &lt;1 year, I buy it when it's at a 3 month low. I also check up on the general thoughts and views on the company as a brand -- what people think of them and how they're perceived. Like Apple, they're not doing hot, but I have faith that they'll put that huge asset pool to use. Same with Boeing, they're doing pretty bad but they've got quite a few planes out there and they're the only aircraft company that I ever hear about. Their price dropped so it seems like a time to jump in even if I lose a bit at first.\n\n3. Disney - they're at a low for the year, but they have an overall large growth, so I'm hoping it will go back up since the dip only occurred recently and they seem to be pretty highly regarded in just about everything.\n\n4. QQQ - they do well over a long period but not so great recently. Which is why I'm buying. \n\n5. BAC - this is one where I'm taking a risk. They did pretty badly in a 20 year outlook but over the last 3 years they've been performing decently. They're at a all year low right now which is why I'm buying. I don't hear much good opinions on BAC but people still use them no matter what and I'm sure they'll go back up again. \n\n6. AMZN, GOOGL, NFLX - I bought these as long term stocks. They're pretty volatile and I bought them at high points. But I think they'll do well in the long run. \n\n7. WMT - I bought this for the dividend payout and plus it seems to be doing decently.\n\n8. FB - I'm planning on selling once it gets to 120 or so. I'm pretty risk adverse so I don't want to take the chance of it going higher. Even if it does go higher, I will learn to place a little more trust in these companies. But I really do think that FB is a bubble right now. \n\nThanks!","name":"t3_43uz7j","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-02 17:35:20","week":5}
{"id":"43uzia","author":"SlowMotionFaceBite","body":"Short story: I have CC debt and when I attempted to get a Slate card to help manage this debt, I learned you cannot transfer balances within Chase cards. \n\nSo I currently bank with Chase and have two credit cards through Chase, the Chase Freedom and an Amazon Visa. Due to work instability I fell behind on payments and racked up about $2,300 on one and $5,800 on the other. At this point, interest is really killing any headway so I thought about doing a balance transfer to a low- or no-introductory APR card and the Chase Slate seems exactly designed for that. You look on the website for it and it makes broad claims about free balance transfers and 0% APR for 15 months. It clearly sells itself as a way to manage debt. Only after applying and being approved and going to a Chase branch to do the balance transfer (since the website is very confusing) was I alerted to the fine print on page 56, subsection whatever of the contract which states \"By the way, you cannot transfer balances between Chase credit cards.\"\n\nSo now I am stuck with a 3rd credit card which I worry I cannot cancel for fear it will hurt my credit and I am still at a loss for ways to get out from under these other two cards. Any advice? Will cancelling this useless new card hurt my credit enough that I should just keep it but cut it up? Is this prohibition on balance transfers within Chase well known and I'm just a sucker?","name":"t3_43uzia","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-02 17:37:00","week":5}

{"id":"43vdeh","author":"Xperimentx91","body":"Hey all. So my credit score is 746-758 depending on which credit bureau I check with. I have 2 credit cards I use often (my major bank, ~1200 limit and my Amazon card, ~800 limit) as well as an auto loan (only 1800 debt remaining from original 8000) and I'm co-signed on a small loan for a mattress I purchased which is on my girlfriends credit. That has a pretty small balance, I think only 500-600 from an original 1100. I have no student debt.  \n  \nI also had one credit card get closed on me due to some annoying circumstances -- I had received an incorrect statement at one point. I paid off the balance I was given after having not used it for over a month and then went out of the country for a few months. When I came back, I was sent a letter saying there was some remaining balance (ridiculously small, maybe 30-40 dollars) and due to late payment the account was closed. I did contest this and had it removed from my credit report. \n  \nHowever, every time I have asked for a credit increase with my major bank I have been denied despite having what I feel is a fantastic score. I've also been denied recently (past 6-8 months) for 3 different cards. I'm starting to rack up hard inquiries (I count 7 in the past 2 years including credit checks for my apartment, increase requests, and credit apps) and I have no fucking clue why I can't get approved for more than ~2k worth of credit cards when I'm making 50k/year and have low debt.

That's 2 days with 4 sales and I was not the lowest price for any item. All were used items, but I don't list unless they are complete. The lower guys always have incomplete items. (sorry not gonna say what I sell)\n\nI've sold the same items on eBay and it would usually take 2 weeks on average to get the sales.\n\nI dunno why I waited to sell on Amazon. I guess it was good as I did learn a lot on eBay, but damn. Amazon's listing set up is far superior to eBay's in it's ability to drive sales to your products.","name":"t3_43xj98","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-03 02:41:59","week":5}

{"id":"4420fh","author":"bbpirelli","body":"Hey /r/beermoney - \n\nI wanted to draw your attention to a browser extension that I’ve been using to save money. While it doesn’t strictly involve earning money like many of the other resources on this sub, it does provide ample opportunities to save money (and thereby have money for other things). It’s an extension called Honey, and it has two primary benefits:\n\n1) When you make a purchase online, it will automatically search for, enter, and compare coupon/promotion codes for your purchase. It will then activate the code that saves you the most money.\nThis has been valuable for me for two reasons:\n\n* It has found coupon codes for me that I doubt I would have found elsewhere.\n\n* It has saved me a lot of time (seriously, a lot!) searching for codes. All it takes is one click on the extension, and it will do all of the work for you.\n\n2) They have a rewards program called HoneyGold. Through this program, you earn ‘gold’ with each online purchase from participating stores (Target, Macys, Uniqlo, etc). This ‘gold’ can then be redeemed for \"everything from Amazon gift cards to actual gold.\"\n\nThe extension works for every browser that I've tried so far (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). I highly recommend it.\n\n[referral link](http://www.joinhoney.com/ref/dolmbv)\n\n[non-referral link](https://www.joinhoney.com/)","name":"t3_4420fh","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-03 22:35:13","week":5}

{"id":"445juf","author":"catch3","body":"EDIT: Proof! http://imgur.com/6iGBsj3\n\nHi everybody - about a year ago I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2x1z8f/trial_and_error_how_i_made_over_1k_with_google/) on the /r/entrepreneur subreddit about how I had made a niche website and monetized it with Google AdSense, making over $1000 in profit. I'm happy to report that, one year later, I'm up to roughly $3,700 in profits from just Google AdSense alone. This post is to update my progress, let you guys know what works and what doesn't work with AdSense, and hopefully inspire you to create your own passive income site like I've done - if you feel like putting in the work. \n\nI went into huge detail the previous post about what I did in order to pick the niche, how to do keyword research, and details on how I built the site and how often I wrote articles, so for the purpose of this one I'll just provide some updates and answer any questions that come along. \n\nFirst off, some stats. \n\n\n**Site 1: (Main Site that I talked about in my prior post)**    \nTotal pageviews (lifetime) - 150k  \nTotal AdSense Revenue - $3,845  \nTotal Amazon Affiliate Revenue - $125  \n\n\n**Site 2: (Just started a month ago)**   \nTotal pageviews (lifetime) - 3.4K  \nTotal AdSense Revenue - $5  \nTotal Amazon Affiliate Revenue - $0  \n\n\n**When I mention \"site\" below, I am talking about site 1. Site 2 is still in the works.**\n\n\nI have monetized the site with Google AdSense but also have amazon affiliate ads as well. As you can see, it doesn't make that much, but it manages to have some good months and some bad. If you read on my last post you can see how I made a few mistakes along the way that really impeded my progress, so it's nice to have Amazon fully up and running. \n\n - What do you do now?\n\nThe site is on autopilot. I really don't do much other than log in each week and check to make sure the spam comments are removed and the plugins stay updated (I'm running on Wordpress). I know this sounds too good to be true, but it honestly makes money whether or not I do anything at all with it. I currently make, on average, $10 a day from just letting it exist. I am in Belize right now working on other projects, so the amount of time I have to dedicate towards the site is minimal (not to mention, the lack of internet in some places). With that said, I do have two writers who I hired that write a few articles a month, so I pay them to keep the content fresh and updated. \n\n - What is the site? Can you share the URL?\n\nI can't share the site with you. I can tell you everything you would want to know about it, but I can't share it with you because then I'll be subjecting myself to tons of copycats who will rewrite the articles I wrote and basically cut me out at some point. My best advice to you if you want an example of a niche site so you can see a real life example is to check out the folks at nichepursuits.com - they actually go through the whole process of picking out a niche, and show you what the site is and how they improve it. Those guys are awesome and are raking in the dough. \n\n - How do you hire writers? When should I hire my own? Is it worth it? \n\nI hired my writers through UpWork - I posted a job listing with exactly, in great detail, what I wanted, and then I added in the description of the job something along the lines of \"Respond with \"I'm a good writer\" in the body of your message so that I know you read this whole job description\".\n\nOnce I got all the proposals in my inbox, I just went through each one and trashed them if they didn't have that subject or sentence somewhere in thier message. It's not worth hiring people who don't read your whole spec.\n\nNext, I went through and got rid of all the non-native english speakers or people who had proposals in broken english. This sounds harsh but the reasoning behind this is that if I can tell that you have trouble writing in English for your proposal, then my readers can also tell when they read your article that you'll be writing for me. Once you cut out those two groups of people, you're left with a pool of qualified, competent writers who you can then pay $10-12 for a \"test\" article to guage thier writing, and then if it's good enough, cut it down to the top 2 or 10 or however many writers you need and negotiate pay and $ per 100 words or such.  \n\nI decided that, since the site was making roughly $10 a day, and that it costs $12-15 to write an article, than I could potentially have 20 brand new, keyword rich articles being added on the site each month and still break even or even still profit off the site. I also got tired of writing all the articles myself - it's a lot of work and I could be using that time for promotion, A/B ad testing, checking analytics, and etc. In the end, it was totally worth it, but I'd only suggest you hire writers once you're at the point where the articles pay for themselves like they do in my situation. Otherwise you'll be spending a lot of money with no indication of if you'll be able to make it back.\n  \nIf you have any questions feel free to ask! I hope that this helped you understand what I do and how I do it, but if you're still confused about any point don't hesitate to ask questions. One last note - unless you have a site-specific question or want to talk in private, I'd much prefer you ask on the thread itself instead of via pm, that way other people can benefit from the answer as well. \n\nThanks! \n\n-catch3\n\nCopy + Paste from my last post:\n\n**SHAMELESS PLUG TO MY BLOG HERE**\nYes I know you all hate blogs.

I've got a basic outline of the kinds of information that I need to gather, but I'm not sure how to get the mute detailed information without spending a ton of money.\n\nHere are the areas where I might need some guidance:  \n\n* Start up fees, payroll, accounting ,and tax information - using state of Ohio websites for info. I'm considering a consultation with an accountant when I'm ready to actual get started. And I'll probably use some online payroll system like adp.\n* Liability and legal concerns - since my business idea has customer liability concerns, I'm planning to consult with a liability lawyer. I'm concerned with finding a good attorney without spending a ton of money.\n* Location selection - I'm not really sure about this one - I'm going to need a specialty building (garage with at least two bays) - other than driving around and seeing cousins that have \"for lease\" signs, I've nut really had a lot of luck with this.\n* Business planning advice - I'm planning on connecting with similar businesses that are not close enough to compete directly - I'll likely try to find them online and email them to connect.\n* Equipment costs - I'm planning to talk to a couple of suppliers, but I'll probably check Amazon pricing first to get a ballpark of what I'll need.\n* Funding - once I have a ball park figure of how much it will cost, I plan on hitting up my friends and family for no interest loans first, and then I don't really know where to go after that. Also, I'm not sure about my options to limit financial liability so that I don't lose my house if the business fails.\n* Pricing structure - there are a couple of ways to price this service - hourly, daily, monthly subscription - how can I find out which one is more likely to work? (i'm planning to just pick whichever one I feel is going to work.) How do I figure out how much I need to charge? I know I have to figure my monthly costs and cover that, but how do I figure out how much I need to add for profit, and how do I figure out how many customers I might have? I know that there's a maximum number of customers that I could gave in a day, but How do I estimate how many people week come in during the first month/year/etc?\n* Marketing/advertisement - I don't really even know where to start with this. I feel like hiring a marketing firm to advertise for me would be a huge expense. but if I don't really know what I'm doing in this area, would it pay off more to just hire a company, our would it pay off more for me to figure it out?\n* Unknowns - what am I missing here? What are the things that I'm going to have to watch out for, or things that might bite me later? \n\nWhat are the alternatives to what I'm planning to do? Are there any ways to reduce the costs?\n\nSorry to make this a huge wall of text, I  really appreciate the feedback. If you need more details about my planned business, please let me know.\n\nEDIT: Fixed the formatting","name":"t3_449cys","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-05 06:06:28","week":5}

{"id":"44az6e","author":"kimberlitz","body":"Is having an online shop a lucrative way of selling goods? Building an online store from the scratch could be a tough and daunting job for starters especially if you don’t have a background in sales and marketing.\n\nI got this idea of creating my online shop from my sister who is an online buyer of clothing, shoes and ladies accessories. The first time I heard it from her, I was a little confused about the payment system and how would you know if the store is legit or not.\n\nLater on, out of curiosity, got myself trying to buy a dress from an online shop introduced by my sister on Facebook from the city where I also lived. We agreed to meet up in a certain place for her to give me the dress and for me to pay her. And the transaction went well.\n\nSo my interest in building an online shop got intensified and so I went through a lot of researching online about basic steps, tips to start it right, rules of buying and selling online and many others to make myself ready for this new endeavor.\n\nAlso, I’ve read articles about why companies succeeded and failed - https://www.process.st/2016/02/the-surprisingly-interesting-reason-amazon-killed-sears/ this is one of the best articles I have read about why Amazon is so popular nowadays and that efficiency of the delivery process is so important to build trust and reliability between you and your buyer.\n\nHere are basic things I have learned while doing my research on how to create an e-commerce site which will let you earn more money than you’ve expected:\n\n • Tell your friends, your neighbors, your relatives about your online shop. Being familiar with the people around you will help a lot about your existence. Also, you can ask them what goods they want to be available in your online shop.\n\n• Create a blog about your online shop or contact famous bloggers to write about your shop.\n\n• Visit forums where you can find your target customers and engage a great conversation with them.\n\n• Create social media account for your online shop (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest). These are the best tools to sell and post your products and product catalogs and just make it sure that you have high definition camera lenses to capture every detail of the goods.\n\n• When the profit and sales are soaring high it’s a high time for you to create a website for your online shop where you can add credit card payment and online payment.\n\nNow I am so thankful to my sister who gave me the idea of selling in a modern way! I hope you’ve learned something from this post and good luck to your future online store!","name":"t3_44az6e","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-02-05 15:13:27","week":5}

Can he contact amazon and do a \"chargeback\" of sorts saying someone stole his gift card code?

{"id":"44gwyl","author":"fffffreebies","body":"Hi folks! I wanted to show off something I'm really proud of, especially since I'm not from the US (I'm Canadian!). \n\n\n\nI got my first $100+ payout on TreasureTrooper! They pay out by cheque or PayPal. Minimum payout is $20. The site is geared towards US members, but I'm Canadian and have managed to earn a bit here and there. :) \n\n\n\nProof: http://imgur.com/AM85Dqw\n\n\nI admit that my earning potential may be bigger on sites like Swagbucks or ClixSense. I can access little things that help me earn a bit more there than on TreasureTrooper (offer paths and bonuses for reaching earning goals). But for me, Treasure Trooper has endured. \n\n\n\n\nSo, how to earn on Treasure Trooper? Well, there are the usual ways to earn - surveys and offers.\nThose are your best bet for earning real cash. \n\n\n\nIn line with its focus on 'treasure trooping', you can also earn gold coins (useful for the slot machine!), pearls (you can exchange 8 pearls for 2 referrals) and arrowheads (which can be exchanged for platinum coins or dragon scales). Platinum coins can be exchanged for Visa or Amazon gift cards, as well as e-Readers, gaming systems, and other prizes. \n\n\n\n What really makes this site special - the reason why it's the only GPT site I've stuck with - is its quirky, friendly feel, and unique RPG-like  elements. A talented artist does all the site artwork, so it has a consistent feel - the dragon illustrations are excellent! (More about dragons later.)\n\n\n\nSpeaking of being a friendly site: the forum, and especially the chatroom, are helpful and awesome ways to get tips on earning. But! You can also earn extra prizes in forums and chat. There are contests in the forums for cash and other currencies. In the chatroom, you can receive daily prizes just for participating. There are hourly contests for those in the US who complete the most offers. Every week, there is a bingo night - you can win $5 or $10 prizes! \n\n\n\nAlong with forum and chat games, there is also a treasure hunt you can participate in, as well as a slot machine you can play every day for prizes. \n\n\n\nNow we come to one of my favourite features - the dragon game! You can hatch dragons, fight them to win prizes, and breed different types of dragons together to see which new and special kinds you can get. There's a fight night in chat every week where we battle our dragons. If you want to make some real cash, you can sell one dragon a month. \n\n\n\nIt's a unique and special GPT site, and the thrill of hunting for treasure still gets me ever y day. \n\n\nCongratulations on getting through this long post! Thank you very much for reading, and I hope it was interesting and informative. ;)\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to join me on my hunt for treasure, feel free to sign up:\n \n\nhttp://www.treasuretrooper.com\n\n\n\nor use my ref link to sign up: http://www.treasuretrooper.com/1001036\n\n\n\nPlease let me know of any questions you may have. I am here to help you on this site in any way I can! Good luck with your earnings on any site you choose! :D\n\nEDIT: Just a general note - I wasn't trying to emphasize any particularly high earning potential the site may have, but rather the interesting and fun features available that are different from other sites. These features are what have kept me coming back, even though I could probably earn more on Swagbucks and ClixSense (I've tried both). \n","name":"t3_44gwyl","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-06 17:41:28","week":5}

What is the best way to categorize Amex Airline Incidental reimbursements (from MPX Amazon gift card purchases in my case). Do you categorize it as Income (this doesn't seem right), or as whatever you categorized the initial purchase that earned the reimbursement so that they cancel each other out, or do you use a different category altogether so that you can keep track of your reimbursements easier?\n\n1. I currently split-categorize VGC purchases between a Churning Fees category and a transfer to a Cash Equivalent account I created. (ex: 2/6/16 Staples $1034.75 as a split transaction; transfer to Cash Equivalents $1000; Churning Fees $34.75) This way, I'm keeping track of the incidental fees of churning to compare with the awards I've racked up at year-end.

{"id":"44j1fl","author":"macarena_of_time","body":"Hello!\nI am hoping somebody smarter than me will look all of this over and offer me some solid advice. Thanks in advance!\nMy debt consists of student loans and store credit card debts. I want to pay off my store credit cards before I graduate, and I plan on starting to tackle my student loans at that point. I'm pretty set on this course of action because all of my student loans are from the government so I can always do an income based plan if I need to in the future. I would really like a general credit card (which I have never had) because I would like to start earning rewards, specifically air miles if possible. In a few emergencies I have \"borrowed\" money from wal mart by getting cash back from my store cc, and I hate that. I hate owing wal mart money at all. So, for benefits and emergencies, I'd like my first general credit card. I am thinking that if I get a card with lower APR than my store cards I can pay off some of them and consolidate the debt on my new CC. I have noticed while looking around that some cards offer special rewards if you put x amount of money on the card in the first month. I have several 12 month interest deferment plans that are going to expire soon and I am not sure if I can afford to pay them off right now to avoid getting hit with the interest from the last 12 months. I am going to start planning a vacation for when I graduate, which is why I'd like as many air miles/ travel benefits as possible. Next month I am getting YNAB to help start saving and budgeting correctly. For now I just need help deciding on a new credit card and a plan to go about paying off my store CCs.\n\n\nDebt:\n\n\n*Best Buy- $435 -Owe full amount by 3/5 to avoid a shit ton of interest\n\n\n*Amazon- $700 -25.99% APR -Owe $225 before 6/17 to avoid interest charges.\n\n\n*Wal Mart1- $1,337 -22.9% APR -Owe $266 by 2/17 to avoid interest charges.\n\n\n*Wal Mart2- $476 -22.9 APR -Owe $153 by 3/2 to avoid interest charges.\n\n\nMy husband and I make about $35,000 a year combined. All of the information I gave you is our debt combined, we view finances jointly. We pay $925 in rent and our other bills total $625 a month, plus about $100 for the min. payments on those store cards. Our credit is decent. I'm not sure how to find the exact number. Last time we used annualcreditreport.com, experion started charging us like 20 bucks a month and it was a huge pain in the ass to get them to stop. So, I'm looking for a card that I can get with just average credit. We are both students, if that helps. I would also love advice on the best plan to pay off the store cards, even if that means transferring the debt to a cc with lower APR.\nAlright, I think that's all the info needed. Let me know if there is anything else I can answer. THANK YOU SO MUCH IF YOU HAVE READ THIS FAR!

{"id":"44jcb1","author":"Awit1992","body":"Hi everyone.\n\nBit of a background here. I applied for my first credit card through my bank a few years ago. I was fresh out of college about to start a high-paying job. I figured it would be nice to start building some credit. As a 22 year old with no credit history, my mom had to cosign the credit card and essentially be an \"owner.\" I was given a $7500 limit and usually kept my utilization pretty low and Always paid off my balance.\n\nFast forward two years:\n\nI now have a 750 credit score due to 4 lines of credit:\n\n•Original credit card listed above (mother is still a co-Owner and limit is the same)\n\n•Amex Delta Gold card: I'm the sole owner with a $22,500 credit limit. (Use this solely for work. Might put $2k on it a month and work directly reimburses me. So, no carried balance plus lots of travel miles!\n\n•Amazon store card: $2k credit limit. They keep asking me if I want to increase and I never do. I only made one $500 purchase using this card and only signed up for a promotional offer. It's currently just chilling. \n\n•Car loan: never missed a payment. \n\n\nOk, just a few questions. One, I hate that my mom is still on my bank issued credit card. Not that I'm not for boosting her credit, but I just really don't like looking like i need a co signer. I obviously don't right now. I tried to get my bank to remove her (even with my mom's consent) and they won't do it. They said I would have to open a new credit card. Is this CSR crazy? There has to be a way to remove her from the card. If for some reason there isn't, would opening up the card that is just in my name be beneficial? Obviously the credit limit would be much higher. Also to note is I will most likely be purchasing a house in a year or 2 and will be using this bank for the mortgage. Just trying to see what will make me look best as a borrower. \n\nAnd while I'm here, should I just go ahead and increase the Amazon limit for sh*ts and giggles?\n\nThanks guys","name":"t3_44jcb1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-07 02:45:01","week":5}

Upfront costs are very necessary and can be large no matter how simple and cheap your product might be.\n2. Don't expect to turn a huge profit during the sale of your first shipment of goods. It will likely get cheaper the second time around assuming you've already spent money advertising and marketing your product when it launched.\n3. You might make a high revenue the first time around but EVERY business, vendor, and service (shipping, trucking, fullfilment) involved in the process will get a large piece of the pie before you can enjoy your slice. This doesn't mean it was all for nothing.\n\nI am in no way an expert on eCommerce but I love to share what I learn as I learn about it in hopes to help someone who is a little more in the dark than I was just a few moments ago. I do not work for Jungle Scout or am friends/relatives with anyone at that company.

{"id":"44nh55","author":"Rivaladversary","body":"Hi everyone,\n\nThanks in advance for the responses. \n\nI have been teaching for about 7 years now and originally wanted to look into doing something on the side to get some extra money to help pay for supplies and rewards. I went to a thrift store for the first time in December 2014 as a way to destress from my job. Eventually, I started reselling online and made my first sale in February of 2015. It started off as a hobby (mainly to destress - I got a kick whenever people bought stuff from me), but it became more than that. I just made the 20k amount, which I am actually really happy about because I wanted the 1099 form. I will be contacting a CPA soon, and I will be filing taxes for my income. \n\nHowever, what I did not do was file for a permit in California. I honestly, did not really know about it until recently. I tried doing it a couple of times online but it appears that the application is only active during business hours. \n\n1. I have calculated my online sales and I have sold about $6000 worth of stuff in California during the 2015. The CA Sales tax is 7.5% That means that I should pay have paid about $450 in sales tax. I never collected the sales tax so I probably will have to pay the amount out of pocket. Is the late fee simply just 10% of the sales tax amount due? \n\n2. Is sales tax based off the product price, or do we also include the shipping credit paid for by the buyer (this is on Amazon)?\n\n3. Is the state forgiving for people who have not registered for a sales tax permit? \n\nI hope what I am asking about makes sense. Thanks.","name":"t3_44nh55","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-07 21:45:52","week":5}

They range from $10 - $75. But we've only ran those so far for our giveaway because when you post shoutouts for giveaways and one of the rules is to follow you get way more followers. In the past when we did them on our Etsy store we usually saw at least $100 in sales so it was worth it. But there's only so many accounts in our niche so we need to be strategic how often we do it so it doesn't turn into spam.\n\nI'm 99% sure our abandoned cart issue is the shipping costs. You can see at what price the cart was at when they left and most of the time it's with the shipping added in the last step. We sell several items between $20 - $30. On the larger items we charge $5.00 for shipping and do free shipping on the small ones. International shipping is insane, we have to charge $25+ for most items. There's no getting it any cheaper either. Yet I'd say 50% of our sales are international ones, mainly because one of our products we sell is also on Amazon and people in America will buy it there because it's slightly cheaper and it's Amazon, way more convenient.

You have already proved that the offerings of your company are in demand and that is often one of the hardest things to do.\n\nWe do not give advice merely an opinion (or two), so here are some opinions:\n\n* Create a new store on Etny. Same products on offer of course but use a new trading name and ensure that there is no association between the new name and the old.\n\n* Continue to develop your own website but do not get carried away with this.\n\n* Create additional stores as required and possible. Amazon and eBay are the obvious ones but there are also many others about. In essence simply increase your market potential as well as make your business more resilient. If Etny should remove your store then you have any number of other stores still available to sell from.\n\n* If you have a back office system that will allow for easy integration with new channels to market then use it. If not then now may be a good time to start thinking about it. There are some systems now available that make the creation of a new channel incredibly simple.\n\n* You seem to have a decent grip on the platforms and methods that are good for you in promoting your own offerings. Keep doing this but beware of ROI with your marketing spend.\n\n* The issue you have experienced is simply creating a dependency on a third party that once removed disrupted your business.

One point to keep in mind, if a company has a database that stores their user's and their account/info (like most websites do), and if they don't have any real security on the database and the only encryption on the passwords in the database is a base64 encode, having a complex password isn't going to matter because they will be able to easily decode a base64 hash (and do it in batch, so effectively they have all thousand/million accounts, emails, passwords, and possibly more such as names and address...dumped into a csv from a database pull.  \n\nAssuming I was being targeted (for whatever reason) brute forcing my passwords is unlikely to succeed.

{"id":"czk50ti","author":"aksfjh","body":"This whole thing wreaks of \"missing the big picture.\" Just some excerpts worth picking apart.\n\n&gt; \"You don’t really want to know what I do. The truth is I don’t really do anything.\" I hear this over and over again.\n\nBecause you're looking for it, confirming your priors, etc. Also, just because people don't think they are doing anything doesn't mean that they aren't doing anything or that they don't hold value to their employer. Not being able to see where you fit in an organization and it's goals does not necessarily mean your job is meaningless.\n\n&gt; We don’t really need telemarketers or lobbyists.\n\nSomewhere there is a strategist with an accountant that have done the math on both of these. If it wasn't profitable or didn't have value to the firm using these positions, they wouldn't keep them around (for long).\n\n&gt; If you look at it in the 1930s almost all the manufacturing jobs have vanished, the farming, domestic service are gone. Yet somehow the service administration and clerical jobs have tripled. We have 3 times as many people pushing papers even though we have computers. Why have we effectively made up these jobs?\n\nBecause somewhere there is a director, actuary, accountant, lawyer, engineer, designer, scientist, teacher, etc. that needs help to do their job and analyze data. A computer isn't a magic box that just makes things happen. It does make data collection, storage, and searching a lot simpler, so now there are jobs in relation to that. You used to have a lead designer, a manager, 2 secretaries/clerks, and 2 dozen engineers doing calculations for 4-6 weeks for an air plane design proposal. Now it takes one engineer and 2 data entry guys a couple of days, increasing the ratio of engineers-to-clerks by several order of magnitudes, but are able to complete so much more.\n\n&gt; If you had people do whatever they wanted, they would come up with more meaningful and useful things to do with their time than what the current system is allocating. No one says they want to be a human resource consultant. Maybe they would write poetry or start a band. Ultimately the benefit to humanity is that they would most certainly be better off than working in our current system.\n\n\"Better off\" in Graeber's definition of the term. Never mind the efficiency losses of not having HR consultants and other support roles in large organizations, which would probably knock on productivity and cause prices to rise for everybody. Huzzah! We now have 10 poets for every salaryman, but cereal is 70% more expensive and an iPad now costs $2k... This should reference the first point, in that sometimes positions don't have a visible purpose to the person in that position. Maybe they are a redundancy, maybe their purpose is simply to make an org chart balanced, but there is a purpose.\n\n&gt; You would have less parasites than now. More people would come up with more interesting things.\n\nNonsense. You'd have a lot of people playing video games, watching movies, reading books, having sex, and generally not creating any new technology. User-generated entertainment media (YouTube, Tumblr, Twitch, etc.) would probably become even more saturated than it is now. Poets, musicians, writers, etc. are great, don't get me wrong, but they don't make Amazon better at fulfilling shipments or help Lockheed Martin make the next passenger airline.\n\n&gt; If all garbage collectors or nurse vanished we would be in trouble. If all teaches vanished the world would be a lesser place. It is a problem in time. The same is true for Sci-fi writers or musicians. Maybe we don’t need them but the world is a nicer place with them. Its hard to imagine how a financial CEO is in that same category.\n\nI love a good, rich chocolate cake, the world is nicer with it. I would die if I only had these chocolate cakes. I would die if I ate primarily chocolate cakes. I would probably die (much sooner at least) if 20% of my dietary calories every day were chocolate cake. We simply aren't at a point where everybody can just **** off and do whatever they want on a whim. We need people in call centers just as much as we need garbage collectors. We need financial CEOs as well.\n\nTL;DR: We need these positions as they are support for other people that make more \"direct\" contributions to the economy.

{"id":"czl71nr","author":"bpfergu","body":"So the concept itself is great and, if implemented properly, would be fantastic.\n\nI have a few questions, though (and please direct me to the answers if this has already been discussed).  \n\n1.  While a good approach, the idea of sectioning images and allowing them to be highlighted and linked is not a new concept, and I'm not sure how it is patentable.  What exactly does your patent entail?  Is it the software that identifies the objects and creates the links?  The only novel idea here that I could see would be the image recognition software.\n\n2.  From what I understand, you are manually creating the \"pleenqs\" on your end after a user submits their site to you.  Obviously, unless you have the most advanced image recognition software in the world this would entail having to do research to see what specific items are, over and over again.  Sunglasses, for example, have literally thousands of different styles with only the most subtle of aesthetic changes.  In addition, there are literally endless variations of angles, colors, light exposures, and sizes of images that could display a single pair of sunglasses.  I understand that you are aiming to have a large database of items but I don't see how you are going to be able to get away from not only the time-consuming task of researching all of these products for every submitted image, but also doing thorough quality checks to make sure it is accurate.  How is this process going to be scalable as your clients grow? \n\n3.  I saw you mentioned that you have your own affiliate network (I think).  More specifically, all links go through your affiliate account.  Is this not a direct violation of many of the affiliate networks in place?  Have you received approval from, say, Amazon, that they are cool with you redirecting all of their affiliate clicks to your network and you getting a piece of the pie before the shopper ends up at Amazon?

You are freaking out because this will be a major lifestyle change and a commitment to operating as a family in an entirely new way.  This is an emotional response, because deep down you know there are considerations other than the cut and dry balance sheet.\n\nCan you afford this?  Yeah, it looks like it.  No reason you can't support a family of 3 or even 5 with that same house for $85k/year.  It's actually a comfortable situation financially for 95% of the people out there.\n\nAre you comfortable with driving a 10 year old crossover that smells like old milk and has cloth seats instead of a newly leased Audi every two years?  Are you okay with vacations being a little more boring and requiring a lot more forethought?\n\nCan both of you function and be happy (no long term resentment) if you can not afford to get drunk on a random Tuesday and buy pretty much whatever you want off of Amazon on a whim like you can now?\n\nWhen you come home from work a year from now will you feel like she positively contributed to the family while you were gone?\n\nAll of these things could be a resounding yes, but certainly things you want to consider.

{"id":"czlfpch","author":"dreadpirateviolet","body":"Cold calling definitely works. This is a terrific plan for a sales person. The problem I'm seeing is... you're not just a sales person.\n\nI'm also a web developer/designer/Internet marketing consultant that worked solo for the last 3 years. I know that I could have made a lot more money last year than I did had I aggressively cold-called local businesses, but I did everything myself and just wasn't able to balance marketing/lead generation AND project management AND implementation. Learned some very hard lessons about delegation and outsourcing fast and early. I'm currently on sabbatical because I'm so burnt out - I've taken a 6-month content manager contractor to give myself an entrepreneurial break, but I do believe that if I ever go back to it, I'll go the cold calling route. \n\nI do have a few questions for you if you don't mind.\n\n**Pricing**\n\nYou say you made $120K gross last year, or $10K per month. You also say that you \"made a sale\" 2.5 times out of 100, and that you made approximately 250 calls per week. That averages out to 6.25 sales per week or 25 new clients per month, which means that, per NEW client, you made only $400. \n\nThat's not even taking into account any recurring revenue from those clients, which you didn't mention (unless I missed something) which would drive your per-client fees down even further.\n\nIn 2015, I charged on average $1400 per project, and those are very straightforward custom WordPress sites, and that is slightly below industry average. IOW, unless you're selling ready-made template solutions that you can knock out very fast or small consulting packages, you are aggressively competing on price at a level most US developers cannot afford to, correct?\n\nFor transparency's sake, I charges an average of $700 per project in 2014 and had about 58 clients. Hence, I actually made *less* money in total in 2014 than I did in 2014 despite actually having far fewer new clients in 2015. \n\n**Implementation**\n\nIf you're spending 20 hours per week making cold calls and working the usual freelancer 50-60 hours per week, that's leaving you an hour and change per week for each month's new clients - not accounting for customer service, tech support requests, random inquiries, and all those hours spent \"meeting for coffee\" (which I have only done twice in the last two years because IMO they're a huge waste of time - but maybe I'm wrong!). \n\nSo I'm assuming that you have at least a couple of subcontractors that do the implementation side of your business and you act more as a lead generator/project manager/ customer service manager, no?\n\nI've priced out a full time developer from the Philippines, which you'd need at least three of for the 300+ clients you had by the end of last December, and even the cheap inexperienced ones (which have their pros and cons) cost $1400-1800/month. So if you have even just two of these, you only really grossed about $6400 net per month - working 60 hours a week, you made about $26.50/hour. Maybe you worked less than that - maybe you got lucky and snagged much cheaper subcontractors than I was able to find in the 15 months I looked, maybe you were just as brilliant about your support flow as you are about your sales flow and set up canned responses to customer service inquiries/ post-launch support/ etc. \n\nThat is still more money than I made last year, so I'm very impressed that you've gone against conventional wisdom in the freelance consulting field: you compete on price and volume, like Amazon does with books and products. All conventional sales tactics for freelancers tell you to compete on value and experience and not lowball price yourself out. \n\nI.e., Conventional wisdom says five $2000-clients are worth more than twenty $500-clients. But you've done the opposite of that, and in an industry where $2000 clients are harder and harder to come by for small operations like you and me, I think you're really onto something here if you're able to keep on scaling at that rate.

There will come a point in the future where such a move makes sense, however right now when there is growth potential it is a much better move to grow the company rather than take a profit. Whilst in this growth stage, EPS holds little significance other than to indicate that the company may be focused on growing. You need to dig further into the financials (which are all published in the IPO prospectus) if you want to understand the bigger picture.

{"id":"czlutc4","author":"80spizzarat","body":"That's the way it is with selling. Some things sell quickly, some take awhile. You can make an educated guess on how fast something will sell by past history, but you just never know. I bought a set of used dog clippers that came with 3 new blades for $12.99 at the thrift store. I split them up and listed the clippers for $20 and the blades as a lot for $30 on eBay. There was only one previous auction for the clippers and none for the blades so I figured I would be sitting on them for awhile, but they were both sold in under a week. After cost of goods, fees and shipping I made about $25, which is not bad for something that took about 5 minutes to list and ship.\n\nYou have to keep reinvesting your profits and feeding your store until it gets to the point where you get consistent returns from a mix of fast sellers and \"long tail\" items. \n\nI don't deal with wallets purses but from what I've heard from others on this sub and on YouTube is most clothing (including accessories like wallets and purses) takes awhile to sell unless it's a really hot brand. Probably not something you're going to find at TJ Maxx or Marshall's. That said, you can find stuff to sell there. Look at their housewares, kitchen gadgets and small appliances. That's where I would start.\n\nAs for whether Amazon is better than eBay, it really depends. You have to look at individual items on both platforms. A lot of stuff is also restricted on Amazon, which means you can't sell it until you're approved.

The packaging has to be pristine and unopened. If it has so much as a single tear or dent in the box you have to list it as used, no matter if the product inside has never been out of the box.\n\nConsider the first few months a learning experience. Watch haul videos on YouTube, read through all the flip of the week and weekly haul threads and learn, learn, learn.

{"id":"czm91gv","author":"BeatArmy99","body":"It's odd to say that they're questioning capitalism; what they're really doing is questioning the basic tenets of economics (in this case, the nature of competition).\n\nThe long and short of it is this:  Why haven't high profit margins invited competition, which cuts into profit margins, bringing profit margins down?\n\nLet's talk about those profit margins.  Take Apple, for example:  Though they sell only a small portion of the world's smartphones, they earn nearly all of the world's profits made from selling phones.  \n\nApple was nowhere with phones in 2006.  They came up with a better mousetrap and sold it into what was essentially a completely saturated feature phone market.  The rest is history.\n\nApple won't be around forever.  At some point I'm confident that they will join the likes of Nokia, Motorola, IBM, Xerox, Zenith, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the British East India Company.  Somebody will come up with something better, and it will come out of the blue to snatch the market right out from under Apple.  That new product might very well go on to capture all of the profits out there, and earn a high profit margin.\n\nAll of this is well within the realms and definitions of \"capitalism,\" and the economic concepts behind it - that high profits attract competition - will play out as they always have.\n\nIn the meantime, regimes change.  So what if historical profit margins once averaged 5%, but now they're averaging 9% (not actual #'s)?  Paradigms shift, technology improves and changes the way things were done.  At one point we thought that complete vertical integration was the way to go (River Rouge plant in Detroit); today you have the complete opposite in Amazon's Web Services.\n\nThings change.  Might just be time to change your definition.","name":"t1_czm91gv","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2016-02-03 15:22:37","week":5}

There is still the issue of oil that we are facing (and honestly, it just appears that that is going to be pushed to a breaking point where we see a washout in the energy sector.) People thought that we were in a rising rate environment so that would be positive for the banks. Now, as for rates...? Then it becomes what exposure do banks have to energy? There's other things, as well, but those are a couple of keys.\n\nAmazon with a 400+ p/e in a risk-off environment is not going to act well. See also things like NFLX. TSLA. etc.\n\nIt has done very well, but honestly, I just continue to be much more positive on financial technology provider Fiserv (FISV) and would much rather own that than a specific bank. I mean, 30 straight years of double digit EPS growth. Fiserv is not going to do well in a 2008 environment. However, that is a company that just sort of hits the ball year in/year out. Around 90% of revenue is recurring. They do not pay a dividend but have reduced the share count over the years considerably. This - to me - given the themes around financial technology (which I think is a theme that has a ways to go) is sort of a get/forget.\n\nAnd if you have nothing paying dividends, you aren't being paid to wait/reinvesting at lower levels.  I'm very happy owning REITs and a number of other things paying 2-3-4% and reinvesting over time. Am I thrilled about what is going on in the markets? No, absolutely not. But I'm not panicking, because I own things that I want to own long-term and declines are opportunities to add  (within reason and with a continued cautious view as to where things are headed; in other words, don't just pile in and re-evaluate things often) and most things I own pay me to wait. If I have a view that I want to own something for 10 years (which I have on a lot of things that I own) and at the end of 10 years, compound interest has really worked for me, hey, great. Anyone who is going through this period and is panicking needs to reevaluate their portfolio, as they've clearly gone beyond risk tolerance.

{"id":"czmebvl","author":"unclefire","body":"Well, in your case you made trades based on what you thought was going to happen to the underlying.  They were directional trades and you guessed right on the timing and the move.   \n\nI look at a variety of things-- the underlying, earnings releases, the market, the charts (Tech analysis), IV and then will make a decision on trade to make.\n\nThat can be a covered call against stock, an iron condor, credit spread, cash secured put, etc.    I generally like to sell premium, but will go long premium on a directional trade at times.\n\nRecently:\n\n- Sold a strangle (700 put/840 call) against GOOG for earnings.  Given the implied move of 50 I thought it wouldn't move that much so I took a chance and it worked out so far (I just closed the call this morning, still have the put)\n\n- FB -  Butterfly (shorted ATM straddle, long a few strikes out).  Went against me b/c FB moved a bunch.  Went long the next day on some calls and made some back.\n\n- NFLX - Had shares + bought put spread (107/97) as a hedge.  Sold NFLX AH near the high AH (117), closed puts the next day as NFLX dropped (~$600 profit)\n\n- AMZN - Iron condor (575/580/680/685) + shorted calls at 680 against my shares.    I didn't think it was going to move as much as the straddle would imply.  It was scary for a bit there, but it recovered and my IC expired at max profit + the short calls.  I got hurt on the shares which I still have.  But I'll be selling calls against those too.\n\n- VIX options - Screwed the pooch on weeklies.   I figured VIX was too high and would drop.  It did, but I was like 2 weeks early.  ~$2k loss.  Ouch.\n\n\nEDIT:  Additional thoughts:\n\n- Once I decide the strategy/type of trade, I use the Analyze features in TOS to figure out strikes, p/l goals.  I generally am looking for 50% profit vs. loss or even 1:1  (e.g. risk 1000 max loss to make 1000 max profit or more).  That's on defined risk trades obviously and looking at things like implied move, IV, Prob OTM, etc.\n\n-  On covered calls I'm generally looking for several hundred dollars of max profit on the calls by themselves.  I generally don't want to only make a few hundred on a trade b/c the risk isn't worth it if the underlying moves a bunch.  In other words, if the premium is $2 at a given strike then I've only got that much as a cushion on potential profits in case I get assigned.   I'd rather get assigned on a covered call than buy back at a loss b/c I figure with fluctuations I could potentially get back into the stock when it drops back down.\n\n- On cash secured puts, I'll also look at premium and what I'm willing to buy at.   I might allow it to get assigned, then sell calls against the stock, or just close the short puts at a profit.   In one of my accounts I shorted AMZN 610 puts, but closed them at a $800 profit before earnings.\n\n- If it isn't obvious, I tend to stick to a small number of stocks that have pretty decent option premiums.  Some stocks just don't have decent option premiums so it isn't worth it to me to trade them.

If you're using any medication, Costco sells it for cheap! \n\n5. Coupons and rebates! Many many places, you have to find your own coupons and fill out rebates. I've done this. It can be a pain. At Costco, all coupons and rebates are automatically applied. No coupon clipping necessary.\n\n\nAnother thing! Get the executive membership as you get cash back no matter what.

Been using it for months now and i highly recommend it. You can bring your current phone over as well and switching was really easy for me.  \n  \n**Internet** - Currently with Comcast. I have their blast plus (I think) which is just TV and Internet for $80 a month (125 down/75 up). It's more expensive to go internet-only (because of ad revenue they get from watching TV commercials probably). If you live in an area where Google Fiber is offered, go for it! Otherwise, get the cheapest internet with basic TV you can go for without sacrificing too much in-home bandwidth. Also, I was able to get a $10 a month discount just by calling comcast and asking for a discount, so make sure you try that too!  \n  \n**TV** - I just bought a PigflyTech mx3 Android TV Box. It uses the kodi plugin and has preinstalled addons. Allows you to stream movies and TV shows directly to your TV. It can be a bit annoying at times if certain streams don't work, but aside from the initial $60 it's free and there's no monthly service. It just requires an internet connection. It's legal because they technically don't host anything. It links you to streaming websites much like you would if you were trying to stream something for free on your PC. It's just the added benefit of having everything conveniently in one spot  \n  \n**TV Alternative** - Look into a Roku box or an Amazon Fire TV box.

It's a common tax in a lot of states.    \n  \nUse Tax was created in order to prevent people already living in places like PA from just hopping the border to get goods at a tax-free rate.  The states like PA did not believe it was fair, and that it hurt PA jobs, so they just want the fair share of taxes that they would have gotten if you just bought the goods there instead.  And so, they created the concept of Use Tax.  A lot of people don't think about it, but most states have Use Tax laws; only a few enforce them.  \n  \nCurrently, you live in Delaware.  Almost anything you bought while living in Delaware was meant for *your use* in Delaware (exempting gifts that you sent to other people).  Therefore, any goods you purchase up until your move you would be subject to Delaware Use Tax laws up until you move out of Delaware.  Delaware has no sales / use tax, so those are all clear.  \n  \nAfter you move, Pennsylvania use tax will start to apply on any purchases that you make out-of-state while living Pennsylvania, that is meant *for use* in Pennsylvania.  But, this only applies if you paid less tax than you would in PA.  Let's say you go to New York and pay 10% sales tax, and bring goods back to PA, where the rate is 8%.  You would not be subject to use tax since you've already paid the 8% due to somebody else.  However, if you bought goods from Delaware at 0% tax, you would be liable for that 8% tax, and pay that back at tax time.  Also note that internet goods that come from places like Amazon.com are subject to Use tax after you move.  Amazon will send you an estimated bill at the end of the year; other places may not.  \n  \nShort answer: it won't cost you to move to PA, but once you're there, be mindful of where you buy things for taxes next year.

{"id":"czn5y4j","author":"travelling_chap","body":"If I owned a cafe, I wouldn't care about $8k in sales. \n\n\nI would care about acquiring new customers. \nYou mentioned '68 new regulars', so, if I knew that my regular customer spent $8.50 a week, and my margin on that was 30%, I'd probably be willing to spend $80-$100 to acquire that customer.\n\n\nTo calculate it properly, I'd need to know other things, like how long my customers remained customers on average, at what rate they introduced new customers, at what rate those new customers became regulars, and also things like what the saturation of up-selling was before customers started to say 'no thanks' to 'large fries'. \n\n\nBut all of that is just my opinion. The cafe owner you're dealing with may not be across his/her figures, and even then may not place as much value on a new customer as I (hypothetically) do. \n\n\nI do promise you, however, that selling to your local cafe is just as hard (often harder) than selling to a company that turns over $5-$20m/yr. The difference is that the bigger company would almost certainly have someone who knows the figures, and would almost certainly be able to tell you immediately what their target acquisition cost for a new client/customer is. \n\n\nI remember reading somewhere that the marketing staff at Amazon, in the earlier days, were given carte blanche in terms of their methods and strategies, with just the condition that they spent no more than $x to acquire a new user. \n\nThat's the type of situation you want to work in, in my opinion, rather than a small business owner who tends to make emotional decisions rather than logical commercial decisions.

{"id":"czndajg","author":"TheExecutor","body":"If you actually look at the statistics, the primary recipients of H-1B visas are outsourcing companies like Infosys and Tata Consulting. Since the number of visas is capped annually, this leaves precious few for the tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple who are the ones looking for high-skilled labor.\n\nIt's why Ted Cruz's comment of a minimum H-1B wage of $100k was so comical: the *starting wage* for a *college graduate* software engineer at Microsoft, Amazon, Google, or Apple is already in excess of $100k and has been for some time.\n\nThe shortage of labor was such that *Microsoft themselves* proposed to Congress a $10,000 tax on H-1B visas, to be paid by the employer. This would naturally make it harder for Infosys and Tata to import cheap workers, but to companies like Microsoft would only represent a tiny fraction of the cost of a high-skilled engineer.\n\nThere's such a divide in the rhetoric because what ordinary people experience are the effects of massive cheap outsourcing by the likes of Tata and Infosys. But what you hear in the news is the tech giants like Microsoft and Google calling for more visas - because from their point of view they're really actually having a hard time finding talent despite exceptionally high wages.","name":"t1_czndajg","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-02-04 10:13:35","week":5}

Experiment with some \"fancy, restaurant-like\" dishes you don't normally make, served over multiple courses for a tasting-like menu.  Also try off-the-beaten path type activities - a painting class, laser tag, horseback riding, a poetry reading, etc.  Plenty of activities are less expensive than dinner with a holiday pre fixe menu, while still being fun and romantic.\n\nFor gifts, there are a ton of meaningful gifts that are inexpensive.  Pick up a couple's quiz book on Amazon ($8-10) and fill it out together. It's a blast comparing answers and finding out your SO knows things about you that you forgot yourself.  You can get relationship-journal type books for around the same price.  They have writing prompts that help you record your favorite memories and thoughts about your relationship for you to give to your SO.  If you communicate a lot via text, email, Facebook, or other typed means, you can make a word cloud (plenty of free programs to do this online - you can customize the colors and it's really neat to see the words you use together most often), print it, and frame it in an inexpensive frame ($7-15).  You can do multiples if you want to have ones by year or your dating days vs. after you were married. You can never go wrong with any gift that shows how much you love someone and how much your relationship means to you. One year, I bought a Zelda treasure box (we're gamers) off ThinkGeek for $20 and bought a day-calendar with \"The Office\" (we love that show) from the previous year, and filled the box with memories written on the day they happened over the previous year.  It took a while because I dug through our old calendar, emails for ticket purchases and reservations, texts that mentioned things we did, etc.  It turned out really well and it's still something he keeps in our closet and looks at from time to time.","name":"t1_cznwet3","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-02-04 20:37:22","week":5}

{"id":"cznx7zs","author":"jpoms13","body":"I'm with /u/doougle on this one. Especially if you happened to have good timing, lock in gains or at the very least take money off the table by selling a higher strike call option against your position.\n\nHere is an example (and a lesson) :\n\nBefore AMZN earnings a day or two prior when the stock was plummeting I bought  fairly distant out of the money call options for $9.30 per contract. the next day as well all know the stock flew higher, though because my option was so far out of the money, it only raised to about $19.00/ per contract. Most people would say happy day and take money off the table, I was dumb and greedy (lesson #1: don't be dumb and greedy). Instead I sold call options at the strike 20 points above my strike (bought 665, sold 685) against my long position and collected $7.75 per contract in premium. What this did was it allowed me to take some money off the table, but it also limited how much money I could receive overall on the trade. Lesson #2: when a stock moves in your favor during volatile times, do yourself a favor and lock in gains, even if you want to keep a net long position.\n\nLooking back this was poor management of the trade, because had I gone a few points in with my short call, I could have locked in profits by selling the 675 call options for $12/contract. This would have ensured that I would have made money on the trade and it left the door open to make more had AMZN gone higher...\n\n...but we know how that went.... \n\nLesson #3: When you can lock in decent profits and keep a net long position open, do it.\n\nLesson #4: Even when you make a losing trade, learn from it so you don't repeat the mistake.","name":"t1_cznx7zs","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-02-04 20:55:42","week":5}

{"id":"cznzs5b","author":"BobbyTrosclair","body":"First, I look to see if they are still worth putting in at, say, $5 or so, so I make a small profit but still better than what I will get in cash or credit from a used book store. This is especially true if there are some FBA lowballer titles at $3.98 but there is a big jump above that to $10 or so, I'll price it at the higher offer.  I'm willing to sit on it for a few months and see if the lowball titles sell. If there's a gazillion penny offers and multiple FBA ninny offers at $3.98, then no. If I get close to my FBA storage limits, I will do removal orders on those which won't cost me anything, but often they sell after some months, sometimes sooner.\n\nNext, I look to see if I can bundle any of them into a lot to sell on eBay, of the same author or genre. As others have noted, these often sell even if the books individually are priced at $0.01FBM/$3.98FBA. People who are suddenly into a new author often like the idea of getting the whole set at once. Young Adult books often do better in these kind of lots if they are hardback - the Twilight series, for example. Not sure why. Weird things sell well in lots, like John Carter novels by Burroughs or the Casca series by Barry Sadler.\n\nThen, I sort out any media, PC games, CDs (including the DVDs I am not gated to sell, like the BeachBody DVD series, or any that I am concerned might be scratched, or CDs with scratched or broken jewel cases), and scan their UPCs into decluttr.com. They lowball you as they plan to sell them themselves, of course, (just as you \"lowball\" a thrift store) but they still give you a marginally better amount than the used book stores will. Throw those in a box, print out their shipping label, send it off with free shipping and wait a few weeks to get a check.\n\nI take what remains to the local large regionally-owned used book chain that gives me more $ in credit than if I take it out in cash. I then go through their rare and collectible section and take out stuff that I can make a good profit on. (Make sure their policy allows this - book scouts have been doing this for generations, and some dealers will say that credit cannot be used for collectible books.) Usually, if some books are borderline salable but not for a whole lot, I will stick them in the lot to make the book dealer happy if I know him. They get tired of seeing endless crap (Reader's Digest editions, books with crumbling spines, etc.) come through and are looking for stuff that is in decent shape that will have a quick turnover and improve their profit margin. I know what the few smaller privately-owned used bookstores in town like to buy, and by taking care of them, they will take care of me and give me a better credit or take things they normally wouldn't take. This is something I learned when I book-scouted in the pre-Internet age, back when dinosaurs walked the earth.\n\nWhat they don't want, I take to Half Price Books which gives cash, not credit. I then use that cash to likewise buy some books I can resell. I keep a list of paperbacks that have a high resale value (mostly genre titles that were never reprinted, often \"cult\" titles, often connected with a film from which they were adapted) on a list on my phone, so while I am waiting for the clerk to figure what they want to buy, I am sorting through the (helpfully alphabetized by author) genre sections, looking for stuff that slipped through the cracks (easier to find in Half Price Books or other corporate-owned bookstores than in a dealer-owned store with a guy who is old as grit but knows the market better.)  Usually, I will pick up a title or two there that I can buy for $2 - $5 that sells from $40 to $100. The idea that mass-market paperbacks are always a waste of time to check is not entirely true, and you can train your brain to quickly look for them as you scan across a line of titles even in an unsorted rack at Goodwill. You generally can't scan MMPBs, though (some new ones you can), so you have to know the titles and authors you are looking for, and keep up on what was rereleased in Kindle and recently had a price drop. Amazon, for instance, recently re-released \"Roadside Picnic\" by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky on Kindle. Before that, paperback copies sold for the $40 - $100 range, now they're down to $10 and under. (The book, a Russian SF title, was the basis for the cult film \"Stalker,\" and so very popular.)\n\nWhat remains after that I will usually take a picture of with my phone, do a quick count of HBs and PBs, and take to a thrift store, particularly smaller ones where the staff is likely to remember me, and generate good will for me as a reseller.  I will take the charity receipt they give me and take a tax deduction. That's not worth a whole lot, unless you are a mega-seller, as Federal tax law allows a business to donate inventory at the lower amount of cost basis/market value. On a book whose cost basis is $1 and whose fair market value is $0.20, you are allowed to take a 20 cent write off. But I'll still take that, as I am always happy to trade dimes for dollars.\n\nHope this helps.","name":"t1_cznzs5b","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-04 21:53:48","week":5}

{"id":"czom98r","author":"clamclam9","body":"Because the best places to sell are where the most customers are, a site with a lot of customers isn't going to be not well known. The reason no one has been able to usurp eBay, despite eBay being clunky and outdated in a lot of respects, is because when anyone and their mom wants something vintage/used/out of production they go straight to eBay. They're not going to Offer Up, Grailed, or any other obscure platform. It's hard to get customers to change their buying habits, especially when you can't offer a bigger selection.\n\nAs for the re-seller bloggers and Youtubers, I would not waste your time with these guys. Re-selling, usually FBA, has become the new 'Internet Marketing' get rich quick / self-help racket. Tons of these people including the most popular ones who I won't name, are essentially the same bullshit 'gurus' from the forex, penny stocks, real-estate, internet marketing fads. Knowing nothing about them you can conclude the information they have is not very valuable if they're willing to share it with literally everyone for $30. If someone is selling you on an idea of how to make money, you're their idea of how to make money.\n\nThat being said obviously they do share some practical information alongside their self-promotion, but all that information is very easily found for free on the internet. All you need to to flip is an understanding of shipping, your selling platform (eBay/Amazon), and the basic math behind calculating your profit on a flip. That's it. Go to a thrift store and start looking stuff up on your phone. Look things up on Craigslist, look at what people here are finding, look at eBay's completed listings to see whats selling. The more research you do, the more deals you'll find. Remember, low hanging fruit like an N64 collection for $25 are obvious to everyone so you're not going to come across them very often. But if you research enough, and get a good enough understanding of various niches you're going to be successful.\n\nFor example, I picked up a pair of Murano glass lamps at a garage sale for $100. Everyone was walking right past them, one person even scoffed that they wanted $100 for a couple (admittedly kind of gaudy) table lamps. I snatched those bad boys up and they sold last month for ~$1000 before shipping + fees. And Murano glass is pretty well known as far as that sort of thing goes, so there's definitely a lot of room to build up a knowledge base.\n\ntl;dr: Stop wasting time on re-seller personalities. It's mostly self-promotion and any useful information they offer is available elsewhere in a better format. Also there's no 'secret tricks' to re-selling, just get out there and start doing and start researching. And if you must watch these types of videos, at least pick people like [golden finger picker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_WeVeXPx4) who have a lot of substance and information about particular items.","name":"t1_czom98r","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-05 08:51:46","week":5}

{"id":"czoto4y","author":"LaughGift","body":"When it comes to the adult website niche you want to have variety. Also try to tie them back into each other if possible. As for making money, when I first started I invested $100 in advertising per month and got a return of $24 - $29 per month. BUT my websites are easy to punch in and that $100 stayed the same but I started seeing an increase in revenue, especially when I visitors started signing up to my different affiliate programs. \n\nAdvertising an adult site isn't as easy as one would think. Google Adwords does have strict guidelines that you must follow for your adult site. Social media outlets can be frowned upon. It gets frustrating when so many people are searching for porn you have to search for people. \n\nBest tip, pick a name that is easy to remember and easy to type the URL in. Try to avoid URLs with numbers. I made this mistake and believe that I lost a lot of traffic to the fact that people forgot to type in the number 1 at the end. \n\nFind your niche. For me I felt uncomfortable doing hardcore porn (however one of my sites does have hardcore). But just look at Amazon erotic fiction section and you will see thousands of women that are interested in this niche, and that pay for a good read. Being a woman, I kind of had the upper hand there in what women want. Discreet but naughty.\n\nPush the product you know. If you worked in a sex shop for two years it would be a good idea to create an online adult toy store (e-commerce site) instead of a cumfeast (video porn) website.\n\nAs for being easy. Nope not one bit. But if this is something you want to do give it a try. One more tip - stay away from eBay adult sites that are for sale. Instead build your own site that you can have full control of it.  If you want a good list of affiliate programs for the adult industry please send me a PM.

{"id":"czovdun","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"This is not a market where things that trade at P/E's in the hundreds are going to be viewed as safety; if anything, just the opposite. When things go risk-off, the turn happens and it can happen quickly. Long-term, I think Amazon will continue to expand its reach and power in online retail. \n\nIn the short-term, the stock trades at a valuation I wouldn't go near and when the market goes risk-off like it is now, people are going to sell first and ask questions later for things like this, TSLA (at about a 52 wk low) and others. \n\nAdditionally, I think the market is not going to be nearly as forgiving if earnings are \"just okay\" or guidance is \"so-so\" in this environment. See after Amazon's recent earnings. See a number of companies obliterated after earnings in the last couple of days. Lions Gate -28%, Kohls -20%, DATA - 50% at one point, RL - 20%, etc. etc. In terms of Amazon, whatever you think about Amazon long-term, in the meantime, in a market like this, people are going to want Wal-Mart (WMT.)\n\nLastly, did great last year. Wouldn't expect the same performance this year. I can't imagine Amazon ever paying a dividend, but given that, this is another stock that is commonly discussed on here where you are not paid to wait. I like owning things long-term that pay some sort of dividend because if there are real declines like this, I know that at least I'm getting a bit more of this and a bit more of that at lower levels.\n\nAs I've said before on days like this recently, I'm not happy. However, am I freaking out? No. I own what I want to own and most of what I own pays a dividend and everything that pays a dividend is set to reinvest. \n\nIf you are freaking out, if you believe that this is going to be a disaster (I don't, but I do believe that we will probably see lower levels and volatility will likely continue), then what I suggest is not panicking and just puking up everything. I just think that when people get to the moment of maximum \"fuck this, I'm out\", then inevitably you are not far from a rally/rebound (even a brief one) that would have been better to sell into.\n\nLastly, if you have a portfolio of FB/GOOG/AMZN/TSLA/NFLX, that feels really good when everything is great. However, the second it's not (and the turn can happen quick), these names can get ugly quick. You have to have some balance and not just be all in aggressive hype names - or if that's where you want to be, you have to come to terms with the inevitable periods like this where those names are absolutely not where you want to be.  I've often suggested that people build a solid, reliable core portfolio (Boeing, Microsoft, Costco-type of names; not necessarily those but you get the idea) and then have a smaller amount that can be devoted to more speculative investments and the smaller amount devoted to that forces one to be more selective. \n","name":"t1_czovdun","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-05 16:22:30","week":5}

Sign up for the other, if/when baby #2 comes :)  That's if you decide to do formula eventually, btw.  Breastfeeding is the way to go.\n\n*  Use Amazon, sign up for Mom and use S&amp;S for diapers/wipes (and look for coupons that come out periodically for diapers--hopefully you can swap brands depending on coupons)\n\n*  Costco has great deals on diapers, formula, wipes, and diaper genie.  (Yes, get some type of diaper pail!!  Because, baby's poo won't smell too bad for the first 6 months or so, but after that OMG.  The smell is horrid!)\n\n*  Create a custodial account with ING for a $50 bonus (Pick a stock, trade once, and you don't ever have to use it again.  Just to get some free cash and have something to give to baby at 18.)\n\n* Buy clothes from Savers/Goodwill/etc.  Baby clothes are also dirt cheap on sale.  \n\n* Sign up for FSA.  I'm not sure if a change in status lets you sign up when status change happens, but you'll use a lot of it for medical expenses.\n\n* Get life insurance.\n\n* Don't need to sign up for dental coverage for baby until s/he's in their 1-2 year.\n\n* Absolute essentials I can think of to buy outside of obvious:  Pack n play, some type of baby carrier, infant car seat (to take baby in and out without waking)...Side note, if you do let baby sleep in infant car seat, always monitor and don't let baby sleep with head slumping over as this could cause asphyxiation.  Baby shouldn't sleep in car seat for more than a couple hours.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.  I'll edit as I think of more.  Have fun!\n\nP.S.

{"id":"czps9nq","author":"bumblejumper","body":"You couldn't be more wrong.\n\nOne tangible suggestion would be to take a look at the book \"Rework\" by the guys behind 37signals. You can pick up the book, and see the guys behind a successful software company talking about how they created a successful software company. Go to Amazon, and check it out for yourself. \n\nNot good enough? Ok, I'll continue.\n\nI've personally sold millions of dollars worth of \"how-to\" information related to online business, and have made millions of dollars doing it myself over the past 20 years. \n\nI can understand why you might be skeptical about my claims, even though they're true, so I'll keep going. \n\nYou may want to look at a company called Digital Marketer, which was founded by a friend of mine named Ryan Deiss. We aren't what I'd call \"real\" friends, but we've known each other in the business world for close to 10 years. The foundation of his Digital Marketer business is selling the information, and insights he gains from running 20+ other brands online. \n\nHe'll have close to 3,000 people attending an event in San Diego next weekend, all to learn from his company. What will they be sharing at the event? Insights they've learned from running multiple million dollars worth of advertising, and analyzing the data they've gathered on sending millions of emails per week. \n\nWhy would he do that? Because it's another multi-million dollar business. (again, check out Rework, it'll clear a lot of this stuff up)\n\nI personally know (as in, I've at least had dinner with) no less than 100 different people who are all selling online, and who are also selling \"how-to\" information about what they've done to create their successful online businesses. \n\nAre there scammers out there? Absolutely. \n\nAre there good guys out there too? There sure are.\n\nI personally spend tens of thousands of dollars on \"how to\" information every year, even though I've been in business for over 15 years  at this point. Why would I do that? My time is valuable, and when I can directly replicate something that has already proven to be successful, it can often increase revenues dramatically.\n\nFor example, maybe 8 years ago a friend of mine started testing what he called a \"2 Step Optin\" process. Traditionally you'd think that reducing the number of steps it takes for someone to opt-in to your email list would increase the number of subscribers you'd generate. In his testing, he proved otherwise.\n\nI'd never have tested his theory (which is very widely used now), unless I'd have purchased his course. The application of this one strategy nearly doubled by opt-in rate, and nearly tripled the revenue of the business I applied it to. \n\nNow you might be thinking. What a moron that guy was, telling people about his \"2 Step\" process. \n\nIn one respect, you'd be right. \n\nThis process did become a lot more popular, and is pretty widely used these days. Did he speed up the time before it was recognized and used by others? Probably so.\n\nOn the other hand. \n\nThis process would have been discovered by someone else. This process would have been published by someone else. Someone else would have made the 6 figures he earned selling the information, and he wouldn't be as well respected in the field as he currently is. \n\nYou can lose money by telling people about one of your processes, but you can also potentially gain more by selling access to that information. \n\nTLDR: You're wrong.","name":"t1_czps9nq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-06 07:48:54","week":5}

{"id":"czq16d0","author":"Nesting_Hen","body":"Hi, so you've got a lot of great advice so far! I definitely recommend /r/breastfeeding and /r/clothdiaps. Some other things that I'd like to add:\n\n-Most doctors recommend starting prenatal vitamins ~3 months before you get pregnant. You mentioned that your parents are doctors, so I am sure you know how important these are! But they are not especially cheap, and are one of the \"incidentals\" that most people overlook when budgeting\n\n-Buy cheap pregnancy tests! Look for \"Wondfo\" on Amazon. You can buy dozens of them for the price you'd pay for one store bought test! They are just as reliable (and pink dye tests are more reliable than blue dye tests!) Keep in mind: When you're trying for a baby, things don't necessarily happen as quickly as high school health class might've lead you to believe. It took my husband and I 7 cycles to conceive. We started when I was 26 and he was 27, are both physically active, healthy weights, etc. Don't panic if it doesn't happen right away! Also, check out /r/TryingForABaby too!\n\n-Maternity clothes. You can get away with buying just a few items if you plan it out. Definitely try to find stuff at Goodwill, but failing that, I recommend buying a few basic t-shirts and tank tops. I just layer a regular cardigan over them. Depending on how formal your office is, you might need some maternity slacks, or you might be able to get away with some jeans. I've had two pairs of pants that have gotten me through the whole pregnancy, though I mostly wear sweat pants or leggings when not at work. For basic tops/tanks/sweaters, I have found some good deals at Old Navy and H&amp;M. I spent more on my pants (which I bought from Gap) because I'm short and need a somewhat unusual size (2 Petite). I would wait on buying maternity clothes until you figure out what you like. Don't buy it all at once, though you might want to buy a pair of maternity pants earlier because the first trimester bloat is real and I switched to maternity pants at like 10 weeks, even though I could still get into my regular pants, they were just tight and uncomfortable. \n\n-Also, /r/babybumps is a fun subreddit! And feel free to PM me if you have any questions. I'm due in March and am super budget conscious/straight up cheap.

Utility companies used to be some of the lowest, but a lot of people have moved their money into them for dividends so the P/E has gone up, so now it's some entertainment companies and generally companies going no where.\n\nA high p/e means it's over valued, but not necessarily a bad thing, like in the case of AMZN, in fact most of the internet stocks which have high growth potential are around 100 p/e.\n\nWarren Buffett always references P/E, but he's comparing \"workhorse\" companies to the S&amp;P or to other similar companies to determine if they're undervalued and buys them.\n\nIn your case, low p/e most likely low growth, high p/e most likely high growth.

{"id":"czqgoe6","author":"Two_Scoots","body":"I agree with the other comments here that your are wasting valuable real estate with the huge logo. At 1600 x 900 resolution I don't even *see* your product unless I scroll down. Does Amazon do that? Nope. The biggest online stores have their logo tiny in a corner and focus on products and/or lifestyle images. When your page loads I should see a lifestyle image of a very fine beard and your product.\n\n- I shave, so I do not know what beard balm is or why I would buy it for a friend with a beard. I'm assuming it is some sort of styling balm, but what are the features &amp; benefits of this product? That's selling 101, even if it's fluff like the copy from a cologne ad, at least it's stating something.\n\nCheck out this copy from a Gucci cologne:\n\n*The result is Gucci Oud, a fragrance that celebrates the deep and sensual fragrances of the Orient. The intense richness of the fragrance is created with a natural and unique source of Oud, which has been specially selected, cultivated and purified for Gucci.*\n\n*When Gucci Oud is worn, the opening notes of Pear and Raspberry meet the vibrancy of Saffron before yielding to the opulent flowers of Bulgarian Rose and Orange Flower. Enhancing the deep sensuality of the Oud at the core of the fragrance are voluptuous ambery musky notes and, notably, Patchouli, a true icon of Gucci scents.*\n\nObviously, you don't want something as flowery, but talking about your ingredients and manliness properties is part of selling this product.\n\n- You have no descriptions that tell people what the difference is between your two balms. That's terrible.\n\n- You need copy to spruce up your descriptions and brand identity. Look at copy from your competitors or similar lifestyle products in clothing, cars, watches, cologne, etc., for inspiration. \n","name":"t1_czqgoe6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-07 00:23:33","week":5}

Also understand what types of surface finishes you need for your parts (if you care about them), a surface roughness comparator can be really helpful and can be purchased used on eBay for like 60-100$\n\nWhile you're a student if you can't take a straight up class in machining and metal fabrication - try to get a job in your on-campus machine shop.

I tried them all out running which is what I do anyway for fitness/fun and realized one common flaw in the product: the strap i.e doesn't work for skinny/oversized arms.\n\nMy designer friend developed a number of concepts that did away with the strap and we settled on a design that was the most simple (fold the velcro on itself). I then went to some factories in China, mostly in Guangdong/Fujian to get the prototype made. Once I had this, I handed several out to friends to get feedback. It's important you get critical feedback, I got a lot wrong with the initial design and the final design in some respects too. \n\nOnce we had the feedback, It was a case of getting it made. Not as simple as it sounds, involving three different parties; an armband factory, a packaging factory and a fulfilment company. I visited them all several times to get everything ready then launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amcg/legend-loop-armband-run-further-faster/) for funding and further validation. \n\nLuckily I got the target I was looking for and then it was a case of fulfilling those orders and building some momentum on the back of the campaign. With my own ecommerce site up and running I'm currently working on taking orders directly whilst building out distribution via Amazon and other online retailers/sellers.\n\nOne year in, I've made a ton of mistakes that's cost me time and money but in some respects I'm glad I've made them as I've learnt more than I ever did in 5 years in business/grad school in the past 12 months.
