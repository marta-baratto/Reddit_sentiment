You earn points for daily check ins and sharing tips which go towards a selection of GCs (including Amazon). Unfortunately there is no PayPal cashout.\n\nIt's been a couple of months since there was a Trusper thread but recently they got a new update involving the daily check in. Before you would simply \"check in\" and that's it but now you have to go through and pick 3 tips that you think should be featured tomorrow.\n\nInitially I was annoyed because check ins now take a little bit longer **BUT** if one of your selected tips gets featured you get double the points the next day. Also if you share the tip you earn even more points. So earnings for daily check ins are a lot quicker now.\n\nChecking in consecutively builds up points faster. Currently I'm nearly a month in and get 3 points every day before any of the bonuses. After a month it becomes 4 points every day. 1000 Points = $10 USD Amazon GC.\n\n[[Ref]](http://app.trusper.com/a/101473545086829123?channel=friend_invite&amp;data=eyJ1aWQiOjU4ODE3NTUsImMiOiJmcmllbmRfaW52aXRlIn0)[[Non-Ref]](http://www.trusper.com/)","name":"t3_3lq82t","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-09-21 00:11:04","week":39}

I'm ordering my first candy machine tonight (149$). I've looked into the ups and downs of this type of business. I will then personally go into several locations to attempt to find a place for it.\n\nSecond:\n\nI plan to become an asset locator. I currently have my unclaimed asset contract being written up (should take about 3 more days from the service I purchased to write a contract). However, currently the only way I know to search for people who have unclaimed assets is the actual government website. Would it be worth doing small claims such as 300-500$ for people? The contract that is being written for me will claim a 10% finders fee.\n\nI plan to register my business within the coming weeks. I will get all licenses I need as well so I can pay taxes on my vending machine business and my asset locating business. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me and my businesses and can help me work out the kinks in my ideas? I have about 2k capital I am willing to spend. Any advice or criticism of my ideas is appreciated greatly. I have gone through several ideas so far and I currently think these two ideas will be the most successful.

{"id":"3lt764","author":"Numou","body":"**TL;DR: bummed around out of high school, took a uni program I didn't like, dropped it, started another program at uni, having doubts about that one too. Accumulated lots and lots of debt in the process. No job, spotty work history. What do?**\n\nI was a dumb, naive teenager. I bummed around a lot. A year out of high school, I went to university in another province and took Computer Science. I dropped out after completing only one semester as I realized I hated what I was taking. $~15000 accumulated in a line of credit from that year, from a combination of living expenses and tuition, and my dumb spending habits.\n\nThen I came back home and worked from January-May. Gained no real money out of it because I spent it all, again, dumb spending habits. I find full-time night position at a former employer of mine; pays enough for me to move out of my parents' house and in with a friend of mine.\n\nFrom the time I dropped out of CompSci, I thought about what I wanted to do with my life. From around January until even now, I established that I wanted to be a Psychologist. I want to help people. So that summer I applied to and got into the Psychology (Arts) program at the local university.\n\nFast forward to September of 2014. Probably due in part to my night-shift schedule, my ongoing anxiety and depression is at an all-time high. My sleep schedule is messed up to the point where I am hallucinating and becoming paranoid. I get in touch with a psychiatrist. He gives me something and recommends I take some time off work to focus on school. Being the dumb young person I am, I quit my job; the job that was nice enough to rehire me after not working for them for years.\n\nThat year I focused almost entirely on school. I moved into a new apartment, alone. My expenses went up higher than I expected, but being the dumb young person I am, I ignored my parents' recommendations to move back home with them. I proceeded to get a credit card and run up debt.\n\nI finished my first year with pretty good grades (at least, for a first year student). Straight 75-80 range across the board, with a higher 86 mark in a Poetry class elective. The prof in that class asks me if I've ever thought about doing an English major.\n\nNow it's spring of 2015, and I start to look for a job. I'm not exactly sure what I was doing wrong (perhaps it is my spotty work history), but I failed to get anywhere until the end of July, where I was hired at a coffee shop.\n\nFast forward to now. September 2015. I left my job at the coffee shop. They lied about being accommodating to me for my school schedule, expecting me to work days I couldn't due to classes. They deducted time from my pay for breaks that I never received, as I was expected to work without any breaks (illegal). They've also cut other hours from my pay but haven't told me why, and won't answer my calls or messages. So I felt it was time to leave this place behind, and I quit.\n\nNow, I've made the decision to move back home with my parents, as my whole financial situation has finally come and hit me with a brick. I'm realizing my stupidities from the past couple of years. Moving back home will reduce my expenses to almost nothing; I will only have to pay for gas (which will be a lot, my parents live in a rural area) and my mobile phone bill.\n\n**I want to get back on my feet financially, or at least know that I will be able to down the road. I am expressing doubts about my current program in school. I worry that my degree won't get me anywhere, even if I decide to go for a PhD. I worry that I may finish my bachelor's degree (or not finish it) and find out I don't like Psychology and want to move on to something else.**\n\nMy debt situation is atrocious. I am only 20, and in my second year of university. I have $~24k in debt from a bank student line of credit, which is cosigned with my parents. The limit of it is $30k. It can be increased to $40k. I have $2000 in credit card debt, which is almost entirely to blame on myself. A little purchase here, a little purchase there, a big purchase here. I'm looking to stop using it and stop spending money I don't have.\n\nI have around $15k in student loan debt, and it will likely go up to around $21-22k this year to pay for my tuition. The good thing is that I don't need to start paying this loan back until I finish school.\n\nA nice list:\n\n* $24k line of credit debt, parents making (interest) payments on now\n* $15k+ student loan debt, do not start payments on until done of school\n* $2k credit card debt.\n\nI have no job atm. My spotty work history is likely making it hard for me to find a job; I have lots of jobs I had for only a few months at a time, with long gaps in between where I wasn't working. \n\nI can't work many hours; a lot of my schoolwork is/will be out of class research projects. I debate whether or not it is even worth it for me to find a job at all while I'm in school, as most of the money I make will go towards gas. \n\nIdeally, I would like to be able to make a bit of money on the side while in school. AFAIK Amazon mturk doesn't work in Canada, so that's out of the question. Not sure if there's anything similar to it.\nI am planning on selling a lot of my old junk as I move into my parents' place, hopefully that will net me maybe a few hundred dollars.\n\n* Would it be financially sound to continue the program I'm taking in school? Or should I drop it and go for something I know would get me a job (community college, a trade, etc.)?\n* Should I even be worrying about my debt at this point?\n* How can I stop accumulating all this debt and start working on paying it back?\n* Is a spotty work history a big deterrent to employers, and if so, how do I fix this and get a job?\n\n**EDIT: Thanks for the responses, everyone. I will be seeing an adviser at school next Monday. I'm going to tell her my situation and look at my options. Another option I was thinking about would be to change majors into something a lot more in demand and promising. That way I wouldn't have to drop out of school.**\n\n**I'll update this once I decide what's gonna happen.**","name":"t3_3lt764","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-21 16:49:51","week":39}

{"id":"3lude7","author":"creditcardquestions4","body":"Hi guys,\n\nI have several credit cards - one is the Chase Amazon card with a credit limit of only $500. The extremely low credit limit on the card often forces me to make multiple payments per month on the card, as I use it for any work expenses I can purchase through Amazon. I'm not sure why this card limit is so low - my other two cards have limits of $2500 and $3000. I've never missed a payment, and I always pay the statement balance in full.\n\nI knew I was riding pretty close to the limit this month, so I decided to check the balance this month - it read $509, which is $9 over the limit. I immediately initiated a ~$250 payment to bring it down and checked the cardholder agreement for language about exceeding the limit. It said that I will only be charged a $25 fee.\n\nWill I suffer any other consequences, like a negative mark on my report? Or do I only have to worry about the fee?

{"id":"3lvg5u","author":"MrMusAddict","body":"So, through some unforeseen events, I now have two credit lines that I opened and never used within the last few months, and I'm looking to open a third that I actually *will* use.\n\nFirst un-used credit card; July this year at Home Depot, needed a dryer, didn't have $350, but could easily pay it off by giving them $35/mo for 10 months. This would allow me to pay it off before accruing interest at the 12-month mark. As it turns out, the day after the purchase we received a spare dryer from a friend, so we cancelled the transaction. The Home Depot card is currently open with a $0 balance.\n\nSecond unused credit line: Wife's laptop broke (which she needs for her photography work), so we needed to buy a working laptop that could actually do what she needs. Went to HP, proceeded to check out by signing up with PayPal Credit (bill me later). Everything was approved, but the order had a processing error and did not finalize on HP's side. Took a few days, but the transaction was cancelled, and the PayPal Credit line currently sits at a $0 balance. This line was opened and zero'd out within the last week.\n\nNow we decided it would be best to simply have the laptop repaired instead of replaced, and keep it for emergencies, and build a new desktop computer for her that will do everything she needs for her photography work. This would end up saving us around $500, but I would have to buy everything through Amazon.\n\nUnfortunately, Amazon does not accept PayPal as a payment option. We cannot buy the products outright, so we were looking into opening a new line of credit through Amazon and their Amazon.com Credit program.\n\nWe have the monthly income to make this work comfortably, we just need to know if all of this activity of opening three credit lines within the past 3 months is going to screw us over, taking into account that two of them will not be used.","name":"t3_3lvg5u","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-22 02:03:57","week":39}

I dropped them a line enquiring what was up, and got the following response:\n\n\"Thanks for the email and I do apologize for the issue. Currently, we are out of codes for this gift card. We are in the process of getting the codes from our vendor and will update your gift card request as soon as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhat. The. Hell. Seriously? It's not like they're buying actual gift cards in bulk and there's some some intern sitting in a cubicle frantically scratching off the foil on them and entering the codes into a database.

{"id":"3m10j6","author":"financiallyprivate","body":"Hello, PF!\n\nThis is a throwaway account due to my IRL friends knowing my Reddit username. I do not wish for them to find details about my financial information at this time.\n\n**Here is my situation:** I am getting married in Spring of 2016 to my wonderful fiancee. We have been dating for a very long time and have now been engaged for almost a year. We are paying for the wedding ourselves and are trying to stay below the national average cost. We live in the Bay Area in California.\n\n**The point of this post:** I would like to verify that we have our finances in line, that we are not missing anything from our expected expenses list, and that the way we want to handle finances after getting married is sane. If you have a few minutes to spare, please read on.\n\n--\n**Our pre-tax salaries:**\n\n* Hers: around $65,000\n* Mine: around $135,000\n\n**Question 1:** From my calculations, it'd be best to file taxes jointly rather than separately. Is this correct?\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n\n1. Pay off student loans before getting married. We will both be done before we get married. We have no credit card debt and have credit scores that are consistently over 770.\n2. Boost our individual emergency funds and savings accounts.\n3. Make sure that we are both saving an adequate amount for retirement in our 401k accounts. My fiancee is currently putting away 6% of her salary, and I will begin doing the same immediately after finishing up my student loan payments, which currently average a 5.5% APR.\n4. Combine our take home salaries. This amount will be around $10k.\n5. Pay for expenses out of our combined account. Also, put away money to various savings accounts. (See more info below about this step)\n6. Divide the remainder equally and use that as our individual fun money for the month - money that we are free to do as we wish with (examples: buy video games, clothes, give to family, etc).\n\n**Question 2:** Does this seem like a solid plan? Is there anything missing?\n\n**Clarification of step 5 - our expected expenses ($10k combined take-home salary):**\n\n1. Rent - $2,300 (currently paying $1,800 but will move to a place with better amenities, like a dish washer)\n2. Electricity - $30 (we are not home much on weekends)\n3. Cell phones + plans - $133\n4. Internet + TV - $83\n5. Gas - $320\n6. Car 1 - $413 (goes away after 2 years)\n7. Car 2 - $400 (goes away after 5 years)\n8. Car insurance - $170\n9. Rental + other insurance - $30\n10. Eating out - $800\n11. Groceries - $500\n12. Savings for real estate - $2000\n13. Savings for other things - $150\n14. Savings for emergency - $800\n15. Travel - $800\n16. Other expenses - $300\n\nThis gives us a remainder of around $375 per month each.\n\nSome things I know we haven't considered just yet, although they may fit under \"Other expenses\":\n\n1. Gym\n2. AAA membership\n3. Services, such as Dropbox\n4. Amazon Prime\n\n**Question 3:** Is our expenses plan/budget realistic?\n\nWe are not planning on having children for at least 4 years.

{"id":"3m21dt","author":"Quatschlish","body":"Two weeks ago, I started work part-time for an essentially one-woman jewelry operation. She was looking for someone to help her with orders, shipping, inventory and new customer outreach. I see it as an opportunity to finally do professionally what I've always wanted to do; work in a small, artistic enterprise on the business end of things in an environment where my input is valued, relied upon and has a tangible, immediate impact on business.\n\nMy boss always treated her jewelry as a hobby, making some nice pocket change for herself selling on Etsy. This time last year, she was making 300/week in retail sales. This month alone, she expects to hit 20k on Etsy. She is now also one of their wholesalers, and will shortly be for Amazon's upcoming Amazon Handmade, an Etsy-like offshoot. She wrote about 30k in sales at the NY Now show in August. We are now prepping the first batch of orders to ship by the end of this week. I expect by the end of the year that gross sales will be around $200,000.\n\nIn a perfect world, she has remarked she'd rather do wholesale than retail, as a lot of time/money can be wasted on a single retail order.\n\nShe is utterly overwhelmed and working constantly, as she is still producing the vast majority of the jewelry herself. She is hiring a friend of mine this week to help in production. My questions are as follows:\n\n- Once we get past the trade show wholesale orders, what should my focus be? Streamlining order processes? Getting all her accounting together? Creating a wholesale catalog for 2016?\n\n- I think the business could be a huge success, and if so, one that I would want some sort of part ownership in, or at least profit sharing. Currently she is 1099'ing me. Assuming she finds me valuable and I am contributing a lot, I should look into suggesting alternatives by the beginning of 2016, shouldn't I?\n\n- Heck, I'm overwhelmed too, but in a good way! I know I'm overlooking a lot, and may have the cart before the horse! What other advice can you offer?\n\nThanks for any and all suggestions!\n","name":"t3_3m21dt","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-09-23 14:00:18","week":39}

{"id":"3m4spg","author":"Humblesalesman","body":"Hey guys,\n\nSome of you may remember me from my affiliate website case study I did last year. Some of you wont. All good, I am looking at creating a new case study just for r/entrepreneur.\n\nBut this time around I am looking to create something with a higher barrier to entry than your run of the mill amazon affiliate website. That barrier will be cost.  I set up my last website for a little over $120 USD and had it earning over $4k/month in less than 6 months. The case study was stopped when I sold the website for $90k to pursue a different project (youtube channel).\n\nThis time I want to do something a little different and have been throwing around a few ideas and want your feedback as to what you would like to read about. So far I am considering one of the following:\n\n**1. Affiliate website**\n\nA) Spend 4-6k USD/month paying others to set up an affiliate website and guiding you through the process, from tracking down good content writers and virtual assistants, training them and setting up processes so that you can run a hands off website (what I currently do with my website portfolio).\n\nB)Create a niche website with hands on reviews (like thewirecutter). Spend 4-6k USD/month on product, review it and monetize by affiliates. I would do all the work myself from setting up the website, photography, content creation etc. (I want to learn the ins and outs of this kind of website so that I can set up multiples in the future). A barrier with this one is my location (Australia) and where I would be looking to target (US) but I believe this can be overcome with a freight forwarding service and a step-down transformer (our 230V doesn't play nice with a lot of american products). \n\n**2. SAAS**\n\nI have identified a potential local niche that would benefit hugely from improved software (already validated). 60-100k AUD to contract someone (already in talks) to create this software while I would be responsible for selling it (door knocking, cold calling and getting the product out there) as well as training. I would document the entire process from finding a software engineer who is capable of building your vision to selling an unknown piece of software, however the first few months of the case study would be fairly boring as it would be largely me going back and forth with the software engineer. I will be pursuing this whether it is the topic of the case study or not.\n\n**3. Create a product**\n\nI am not particularly interested in white labeling items from alibaba but I already work with some sellers through my affiliate websites and based on the sales I drive them alone it would be worth me making a similar product but on american soil.  This will involve me setting up a new company, branding, negotiating with manufacturers and looking at fulfillment options. Sales will be driven by an existing website of mine so I will not be commenting on the sales and marketing side of things. I would be looking at spending 70k USD on everything up until the first product. This will very likely succeed given that I already have an email list and website to drive sales through.\n\n**4. Youtube channel**\n\nI have spent the last 5 months setting up and growing a youtube channel and I have refined the process so that content is created and uploaded without me overseeing it and I do not have much to do with the whole process. The channel is already earning remarkably well with month on month growth. *However* the biggest driver of that growth was the attached website by the same name where I also embedded the videos. I would be looking to create a new channel from scratch with all content created by me and talk you through the entire process from setting it up, cheap equipment to buy etc. Since the focus would be on churning out as much content as possible on a regular basis, I would be putting 60-80k AUD on the line for this one. I am giving this one the least likelihood of success.\n\n**Any other suggestions?**\n\nIll be honest, since paying others to set up affiliate websites it what I already do, this is the least likely option I will choose as I wouldn't learn much from it.\n\nMy goal here is to learn something new inside out so that I can replicate in the future with the same success that I have with my current Amazon affiliate websites. I find that if I have done the process myself and made all the mistakes myself, it is much easier to set up a system without errors when I pay someone else to do it.\n\nOver the next month or so I will be kicking these ideas around and will start documenting my journey on November 1 with the first case study to be released in December. \n\nThere is no catch. \n\n- I *don't* want your email.\n- I *don't* want you to read my god awful blog.\n- I *don't* want you to sign up for a course. \n- I *don't* want you to promote a product. \n\n\nThis is for me as much for me as it is for you. I find that reporting monthly helps motivate me to give something my all,  so that I can show off month on month growth (hopefully).\n\n\nThe idea of this post was to see what you guys are most interested in reading about. I will not be discussing any of my other ventures here.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n","name":"t3_3m4spg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-24 01:40:43","week":39}
{"id":"3m4z9j","author":"whattodo-whattodo","body":"I do software &amp; business development for eCommerce retail.  Mostly eBay, Amazon, etc.  \n\nA common upsell to a product sold through eCommerce is a service plan that extends the warranty of the product for years after its purchase.  Typically, only a small percentage of buyers actually get service plans so it becomes a numbers game.\n\nThe way it typically works is that a third party insures the product for roughly 5% - 9% of the product's value and the company which sold you the item sells it to you for about 20% - 25% of the item's value.  The problem is usually that the amount of people who actually buy this is so small that it doesn't pay to train a staff or set up automated e-mails, etc.  It comes out to very little money until it is scaled.\n\nEnter my idea.\n\nI am in touch with a company that has just set up the process and I am familiar with it from end to end.  My idea is to automate  the e-mail process.  Companies like eBay will allow the vendor to contact the customer to confirm order receipt, confirm that an order has been shipped &amp; even confirm that tracking shows it has been delivered to it's destination.  Within those e-mails, they also allow for cross promotion.  \n\nMy idea is to piggy back onto those e-mails.  I ask *Product Vendor* to sign up to my service and I e-mail customers (only in those predefined moments) on the vendor's behalf offering the upsell.  If the customer decides to bite, the calls go to a separate location.  *Service Vendor* then sells the plan to the customer.  Once the plan is sold, we divy up profit.  My idea was 40% / 40% / 20% where I take the smaller portion as the intermediary.  \n\n[This Google Doc Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bqdg7KMR0oUHXgg832J-aavEz7MEtIVeBBvNVPupYn8/edit#gid=0) has the details as I see them.\n\nI think that I can expect **3%** of all customers to buy a service plan.  From that 3%, I expect the service plan to go for about **20%** of the product cost.  From that I expect **20%**.  Basically, I need *about* $50M in yearly sales to get to about $40K in profit for me yearly.  To get to $50M in sales I could get 50 small sellers, or 3-5 middle players or some mix thereof.  The fields on the far right column are editable &amp; the spreadsheet is a matrix, so each edit changes all calculations.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?  Good, bad, or ugly?  If so, why?\n\n**EDIT**: For reference, Tiger direct does this &amp; does it beautifully.  I basically want to copy that, but across a network of vendors rather than a single company that has achieved scale on its own.

On top of that, if you refer somebody and they buy $5 worth of stuff, you get $5 credited to your account. Even without the referrals, this is a pretty good deal!\n\nI hope this post doesn't break any rules; Didn't see it being against the rules!

{"id":"3mi7tk","author":"[deleted]","body":"I am still extremely new to this so apologies if any of this seems completely stupid.\n\n**TL;DR - Chase unexpectedly pulled a credit report that has an ongoing legitimate dispute. Will they deny me for the CSP flat out or are data points that suggest disputed collections accounts are less harmful? If I am ultimately denied, what are my options for reapplying in the future?**\n\nAge: 22\n\nEmployment: Consultant, $84k/y\n\nRent: $530/m\n\nCards:\n\n- DCU, 7/14, $3k CL\n\n- CapOne, 9/14, $2.5k\n\n- Chase Amazon, 2/15, $2.5k\n\nSo, I had a collections account for $200 that appeared on my report erroneously. This fucked me when I first started applying for cards since I didn't know about it or ANYTHING about how credit works - I racked up ~12 worthless hard pulls just from not understanding why the hell I was getting denied for even the most basic non-secured cards. This was my first fuck-up. Eventually, I got lucky with DCU, then soon after with CapOne and Chase, and my credit started to improve. I was an idiot for not pulling my CR before going on this app-spree, but it is what it is. Otherwise, I have a spotless credit history and maintain low utilization, never pay interest, etc.\n\nWhen I found out about the collections account a few months back after discovering CK, I immediately initiated the dispute process with all 3 bureaus. A month or so ago, I received notice that Transunion finally removed the account from my file! Great! \n\nI work for a company where we are required to travel weekly, and I was getting antsy about the fact I had been wasting that enormous amount of spend on my semi-okay cards when I could be using a way better card... I did some research that suggested Chase only pulls from TU in my area, so I decided to take a risk and pull the trigger since the TU dispute had been handled. However, the Equifax and Experian disputes had not yet been handled. This is my second fuck-up - I should have been more patient.\n\nI received the \"wait 7-10 days\" message and realized that they must have pulled something in addition to Transunion. I knew from CK that they didn't pull Equifax, so I pulled my Experian report to confirm that was the case (it was). Experian and Equifax are both still handling the dispute on the collections, so Chase definitely saw the bad account on the Experian report...\n\nSo where to go from here? I'm assuming if I do nothing I will be denied (like so many times before), so I am planning to call the recon line Monday to explain the situation. Will they flat out deny me regardless of the in-progress dispute, or will they take into consideration that Transunion deemed the account fit for removal already? If I am ultimately denied, how long until it is possible to apply for this card again? \n\nThanks for any help.","name":"t3_3mi7tk","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-09-26 22:47:19","week":39}

Our survey should take 5-10 minutes, plus any time you decide to spend on the external 529 website--how long you spend on that website will be up to you.

{"id":"3mm4u5","author":"itscurt","body":"So the Silicon Valley is home to tons of tech startups, which include plenty of VC/seed money put into acquiring new users.  Below are some of the many online services and apps that I've used or signed up with, that includes bonuses for signing up:    \n**Curbside.io - (http://curbside.io Code: SNSSD) [Reward: $10 off first order]**  This is what I recommend all my friends to try. It's basically ordering from retail giants such as Target and Best Buy, without entering the store. You pick the items up on the curb, right at the shopfront, and agents will detect your location by phone and hand your items over to you. They periodically (every month) send a $10 off $20 coupon via email which are the only times I order. They do not mark up prices from the store, and their agents refuse to accept a tip. I guess the stores pay for this service to ease parking congestion. Only con with this issue is that the menu is limited because it does not include perishable goods such as items that need refridgeration.  \n**Munchery (http://munchery.com/invite/code) [Bonus: $10 off first meal]**  I've used munchery a total of 8 times, and is the best service IMO for meals delivered to you. Most meals are gourmet and around $10, salmon, steak, buttermilk chicken, you name it. Delivery fee is $2.75 and tips are optional, pooled, and anonymous (tip at least a dollar please.). I like Munchery because the food quality is actually very good compared to the others I'm about to list, but it's because you'd have to put in your oven for no more than 15 minutes.  Nonref (https://munchery.com/) [no bonus]  \n**Sprig (http://www.sprig.com code: WONG762236 ) [Bonus: $10 off first meal]** I've used this service only once, but the quality of the food is amazing and comes fresh to you. I've had this dropped off at doorstep, and was hot when I got home to eat it. Prices are a bit higher than Munchery, but comes hot and ready to eat. Expect average meal to be $8-15  Nonref: (http://sprig.com) [no bonus]  \n**Spoonrocket (http://sprkt.io/cwong788?p=1&amp;s=4) [Bonus: $10 off first meal (expires)]**  If you want to try everything on this list, go for it. I've had Spoonrocket twice, and both times were a disappointment. The only pros about Spoonrocket is that food can literally be delivered within a 5-15 minute timeframe. It's super speedy, and you pick up your hot food from the driver parked outside on the curb.

{"id":"cv8ijmm","author":"alexhoyer","body":"I would actually argue that insofar as Reich is advocating for a change from the status quo it's his responsibility to provide the counterfactual, and how it's Pareto improving. With that said, I think there is a reasonable case to be made that big tech continues to innovate. Netflix is successfully penetrating the content creation market, and will soon release its first feature film (Beasts of No Nation looks fantastic btw). Amazon has been integral to the drone revolution, is creating its own same day delivery service, is continuing to compete well in the ebook market, is entering content creation market itself, and has improved its cloud computing platform while building its own OS. Google just completely restructured its business model, continues to dominate in Silicon Valley where the prospect of being bought by Google inspires entrepreneurial risk taking, and may very well put out the first fully automated car. To be fair, this evidence is anecdotal. And it's difficult to determine the extent to which it depends on scale/networks without a counterfactual, as you rightly pointed out. But Reich has made an argument here that innovation is crowded out in concentrated markets, and I think there is a compelling argument to be made to the contrary. He needs to do a lot more work to make his point, particularly if he wants to invoke anti-trust law and risk what I consider to be a dynamic status quo.","name":"t1_cv8ijmm","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-09-21 02:47:11","week":39}

{"id":"cv8lwsz","author":"jumpax","body":"**Audiobooks**\n\nI recommend visiting the following reddit threads and browsing through them to see if you're interested in doing audiobooks.  \n\n*  Recent [question and answer session]https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i91ay/iama_audiobook_narrator_ama/) with a home audiobook recorder\n*  [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/2f3okw/making_reading_out_loud_for_audiobooks/) on making money from audiobooks\n\nAmazon has a [website](http://www.acx.com/) dedicated to helping people narrate audiobooks.  \n**Coding**  \n\nThis is going to be *much easier* because you're already a math/physics major and you already know some basics!  As a math/physics major you'll be significantly more employable the more coding skills you have.  Any good programmer (including math/physics experts who use computers and code) should have knowledge of the following:  \n\n*  [Mid-level programming language](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/defining-high-mid-and-low-level-languages) such as Java, C++, or C# including both basic syntax and [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library) functions\n*  High-level scripting language such as JavaScript, Python (very popular), or Ruby\n*  [Data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) to organize data for processing\n*  [Common algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) such as [different ways to sort a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)  \n\nTo help you get started coding, I recommend 2 books:  \n\n*  Either *Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in* [Java](http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-Computer-Science/dp/0486485811/) or [C++](http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-Computer-Science/dp/0486485811/)\n*  [*Introduction to Algorithms*](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/) \n\nI would explore the options for the types of languages, but in general it doesn't matter too much of what language you choose so long as you study it in depth.  Anyone can learn the basics of programming, but to program effectively and efficiently one needs to know standard libraries, data structures, and algorithms.  \n\n**Tutoring**\n\nTutoring for classes that you've already taken is a *great* way to reinforce the knowledge and make sure that you don't forget it.  The more you remember about previous math classes on the undergrad level, the easier it is to make connections and learn new material.  Math and physics are especially dependent on what you've learned previously.  For example, \n\n*  Calculus is used in probability, statistics, all of physics\n*  Linear algebra is used in statistics, vector calculus, and all of physics\n*  Abstract math (logic and set theory) is used in analysis, topology, algebra\n*  Vector calculus is used in electrodynamics\n\nAs you teach someone, you're making the connections stronger so you'll be in a much better position to learn new material.  Managing a training plan for a person is actually quite easy because the student is following a schedule from the professor.  It's just a matter of walking them through example problems and explaining concepts.  \n\nPeople skills in tutoring are really important.  Students want to learn from someone who can break things down, is patient, and enthusiastic about the subject.  A good tutor can make about $20 to $40 per hour\n\n**Gift Baskets**  \n\nLittle profit and sells slow, but easy.  Buy lots of individual sized snacks--variety is key here--and make an attractive gift basket.  There are a lot of tutorials on the internet.  You can sell them on Amazon (careful about shipping) or at your local school to your friends and fellow students for holidays and birthdays.  Guys like them because its a good gift for a girlfriend or mother.  \n\nYour profit comes from buying mini-snacks in bulk and selling a nice package.  You can do themed baskets for picnics with a selection of picnic food.  If you're willing to do more, you can arrange reservations for events online and make holidays for people.  \n\n","name":"t1_cv8lwsz","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-21 04:21:45","week":39}

{"id":"cv9a2x0","author":"clark_ent","body":"Trump speaks of the United States as if it were one thing, one single firm. A business. “We” are in competition with “them,” as if the country was IBM competing against Samsung. “We” are not 300 million people pursuing unique dreams and ideas, with special tastes or interests, cooperating with people around the world to build prosperity. “We” are doing one thing, and that is being part of one business.\n\nIn this capacity, he believes that he will make deals with other countries that cause the United States to come out on top, whatever that could mean. He conjures up visions of himself or one of his associates sitting across the table from some Indian or Chinese leader and making wild demands that they will buy such and such amount of product, or else “we” won’t buy “their” product. He fantasizes about placing phone calls to “Saudi Arabia,” the country, and telling “it” what he thinks about oil prices.\n\nTrade theory developed over hundreds of years plays no role in his thinking at all. To him, America is a homogenous unit, no different from his own business enterprise. With his run for president, he is really making a takeover bid, not just for another company to own but for an entire country to manage from the top down, under his proven and brilliant record of business negotiation and acquisition.\n\nIn the 18th century, there is a trade theory called mercantilism that posited something similar: Ship the goods out and keep the money in. It builds up industrial cartels that live at the expense of the consumer.\n\nIn the 19th century, this penchant for industrial protectionism and mercantilism became guild socialism, which mutated later into fascism and then into Nazism.\n\nTrump seeks political strategies that call on the organic matter of the social structure and inspire masses of people to rally around the nation as a personified ideal in history, under the leadership of a great and highly accomplished man. Trump believes himself to be that man. He sounds fresh, exciting, even thrilling, like a man with a plan and a complete disregard for the existing establishment and all its weakness and corruption.\n\nThis is how strongmen take over countries. They say some true things, boldly, and conjure up visions of national greatness under their leadership. They’ve got the flags, the music, the hype, the hysteria, the resources, and they work to extract that thing in many people that seeks heroes and momentous struggles in which they can prove their greatness.\n\nSo how do I think Donald Trump's policies would affect the economy over 4 years?

{"id":"cv9fuzk","author":"JakeSmithsPhone","body":"It's Monday, September 15th, 2025 and I'm just getting off work. I want to watch Monday Night Football with my friends, so I order a pumpkin-spiced beer to go from Taco Bell by tweeting a pumkin and beer mug at their twitter handle. After picking that up, I drive home in my Apple car and turn on the TV. My internet is provided by Google Fiber ($40/month), so using my Android phone and Chromecast presents no issues while I stream from my Watch ESPN app ($15/month). Thankfully I can pay Comcast $25/month to avoid providing me service. It is such a relief now that they offer that opt-out option.  \n  \nOn Tuesday, my son wants to play Call of Duty: Moderner Warfarer on their XBox First, so we let him. They have to buy all the guns that they want to use in the game, but at least they don't have to pay for new lives anymore. The screen is split so that my daughter can watch Dora The Explorer at the same time, but Microsoft doesn't include the Nickelodeon App subscription with their XBox Live subscription, so I have to shell out $8/month for her to have that ability. It is just re-runs, but Nick only allows the kids to access one released episode per week and then it sends it back into the Vault. For an extra $5/month, she could access the Vault, but we haven't decided to pay for it yet.  \n  \nOn Tuesday we all like to watch the Netflix show \"Cartel\" which means that we pay Netflix $20/month. It's worth it though. Everybody is talking about it.  \n  \nOn Wednesday, the season premiere of Survivor is on CBS, which costs us $7/month to access. You can only stream CBS on Apple products, so we have to use the Apple TV, which we have jailbroken to work on our Google Fiber internet. We weren't going to pay Apple for a second internet service just so that we can watch TV.  \n  \nOn Thursday morning I want to watch the Opening Bell on CNBC because China decided to devalue the Yuan again. Stocks are tanking. Unfortunately, NBC-Universal has an exclusive agreement with Amazon, so I have to watch it on my HP Laptop (my iPad won't play Kindle-brand products like CNBC). CNBC is free, however, with our $149/year subscription to Amazon PrimeBots. That evening we decide to stay in and rent RedBox from our RokuBox, which is free, but Mission Impossible: Ghost of Deception is a little hard to get into because Roku pops up ads every 15 minutes as part of our free subscription. It wouldn't be so bad, but they have like 4 ads that they keep cycling through every commercial break.  \n  \nOn Friday night we drop the kids off with my parents so that we can go out to the movies. We get push alerts throughout M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Ending\" which make sure that we know the twists before the movie can spoil them for us, plus allows us to vote on the ending that we want for the movie. We vote that the main character is dead. The Regal Cinemas App only costs $10 one time, but it does get us popcorn deliver from our seats during the movie, which totally doesn't spoil the atmosphere.  \n  \nOn Saturday ESPN College Gameday visits Pullman, Washington for the first time ever as the 3-0 Cougars face their fierce conference rival Texas Tech in the start of Pac-16 play. Once again, I get to stream College Gameday from my phone with my WatchESPN app, but the actual game is only accessible with a linked account on Draft Kings. From FanDuel, I am able to watch Jacksonville State in a highly-anticipated rematch with Auburn, but I have to reboot my TV in DirectTV mode in order to access FanDuel gamecasts. With the purchase of two Cokes, Michigan lets me watch their matchup in the early-season Dockers Clash at Ford Field in Detroit against ACC powerhouse Georgia State. #Pac16AfterDark presented by Twitter is provided commercial-free (with scrolling tweets from our sponsors) and live commentary from Jared Goff after every missed field goal. Twitter, however, is only accessible within the Pac-16 App if you get your internet from Comcast. The local sports bar, \"A place for sports\" has the game, so we watch Oregon play Maryland in a game where the Ducks have agreed to honor the Terps by wearing the Oregon Flag (wagon-side, not beaver-side) on their helmets in return for Maryland wearing dayglo green and hyper-yellow. However, in the middle of the broadcast, Time-Warner blacks out the screen and the sports bar has to pay an \"internet broadcast fee\" for showing the game to more than 6 people at a time. Everybody in the bar takes out their cellphones and sends VisaPay dollars to the bar's PayPal account. One guy tries to use SamsungPay, but his money doesn't make it, so the SmartTV never turns back on for him. Our self-driving car lets us get home safely, despite being completely hammered on pumpkin-spiced Jack Daniel's with Cinnamon Dr. Pepper 10 for Men, which is the exclusive provider of Soft Drinks at all sports bars on Saturdays.  \n  \nOn Sunday we are going to watch some Football, but CBS streams the AFC over AOL and Fox streams the NFC over Yahoo!, which is no longer available in Seattle, where Microsoft Bing has an exclusive agreement with the city. Thankfully we get both in Portland AND we get to shove it down the throats of those pompous Seattlites while we watch the Seahawks and they are stuck watching the Browns. Yahoo! charges $10/month plus a $5/game fee paid to NFL.com for access codes, while CBS is available free with a monthly dial-up connection with AOL. The NBC game of the week is shown on Hulu Business Class, an upgrade of the Economy service. That costs another $15/month, but it comes with all the old episodes of Parks and Recreation. My daughter doesn't like football, so she watches Sharknado 13 on her Amazon Bonfire. My son, on the other hand, loves football because it allows him to play 1-week fantasy for tons of prizes presented by Nissan when he correctly picks the number of Bubble Screens Lane Kiffin calls as coach of the New York Jets. Also that night is the U.S. Open finals, which has it's own app, but it is only accessible from a Rolex SmartTime watch, so we can't watch it.  \n  \nThe nice thing is that President Trump signed the \"SAP\" tax to keep internet prices down by charging $1.50/hour for Spanish-language broadcasts. It makes watching TV on the internet a lot more affordable. The downside is that HBO Go was outlawed because they offered an HBO Latino version without charging extra. AMC Go and Discovery AtHome have filled in with primetime programming set in  a Westeros and Essos, respectively.

{"id":"cv9h9oo","author":"jammbin","body":"Not really - we eat tons of fresh produce and healthy, nutritious, filling meals for about $70/week for two people. You just need to focus more on buying food that's a better bang for your buck in terms of nutrition. Meat is expensive - you could save a lot of money if you swapped out protein rich plant foods like lentils, beans, quinoa, avocados, etc for a couple of meals a week. If you cut out one or two of the meats you are buying each week you would save almost $1000/year. That's a fairly significant amount of money in my opinion.\n\nCheck Amazon for the stuff like protein powder/granola bars, etc. It's bound to be a lot cheaper than going to Whole Foods. Also, one thing I do to kind of stay within a reasonable amount of spending is not buying stuff that costs more than $3-$4 (things like chips, pastas, boxed food, frozen items). You don't think much about it, but it really adds up. Grab your latest grocery receipt and circle anything that cost you more than $3-$4 and then see if having all of that is really worth it.\n\nIt really does come down to lifestyle decisions, but I still think you could reasonably live off $400/month without a lot of effort. That's still more than the 2 adults in my house spend on groceries and you'd be saving several thousand dollars a year.\n","name":"t1_cv9h9oo","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-21 23:37:09","week":39}

I could be wrong, but unless there's another system in there that I haven't heard of during the 5-6 weeks that I've been hardcore studying ebay and amazon, I suspect that they have no method for doing that, if they even wanted to.\n\nI think the multi-channel fulfillment is more to allow you to multi-list your items for sale in various places (your own website, ebay, sears, whatever) as well as amazon, which allows them to potentially make a cut on all the sales, even if it's not sold through them .. although i think the \"cut\" on multi-channel fulfillment is miniscule, but it does allow them the opportunity to have made the sale to begin with and received a much larger cut.

First and foremost, best buy doesn't make their money on TVs, Laptops etc. They make their money on accessories- so if you ask me to discount a laptop, I won't, because chances are we're already either breaking even or losing money.\n\nWe also had some specific vendor agreements. Nikon I remember specifically was especially strict. If any of their DSLRs were sold at a lower than MSRP price in all of north america by best buy, the company would be fined. If it happened 3 times, best buy would lose their contract to sell Nikon cameras. There was no haggling.\n\nThere's no shame in asking a store to price-match another brick and mortar store, the manufacturer directly, or if their policy allows, \"sold by Amazon\" items on amazon. However, haggling a lower price because that's what you think it should be - that doesn't make you frugal, that makes you an asshole.","name":"t1_cv9wb62","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-22 06:59:09","week":39}

What fundamentals do is it gives the investor confidence that the underlining is heading in the right direction, both up or down. However the market is one giant auction house. So if I can sell you shit in a box for $1000 or many people like the market. As long as people are willing to pay $1000 for shit in a box, then it's value is $1000. After about 3 years of trading I stopped trying to understand the crazy shit the market does that defies all logic. Just happened, Hillary Clinton said she would introduce new regulations to rein in pharmaceutical companies. Now note we are year away from the presidential campaign, So in no way would any of her statement happen for at least a year. But what does the market do? Biotech goes down big and pharmaceuticals also down. So when trying to use logic and explain why that happened...you can't.

{"id":"cvb9ofb","author":"shuddertostink","body":"The deposit seems perfectly reasonable, but here's what else I'm reading in this:\n\n1.  Broke, just got some money, time to spend ! &lt;-- Yep,know how that goes, but it's a really bad habit to get into.  Ok, I'll stop preaching, this is personal finance not frugality, and sometimes you have to spend money to make money. \n2. Promotional offers with a tablet included. &lt;-- Someone's paying for that \"free\" tablet one way or another.  You can bet it isn't the company that gave it to you.  When you buy things like this, you have to be careful to look at the total cost; not just what you pay up front, but over the life of the contract, fees, interest, etc.  It's very common these days to advertise low initial costs to get folks in the door betting that most people won't actually do all the mathing and realize the full cost. \n3. Monthly bill around 85 dollars.  This is a LOT in my opinion. That's over 2,000 dollars over the course of the 2 year contract.  Is that cheaper than just buying a new handset outright and using a cheap service provider like Ting ? The only way to know that is to look at the actual minutes/data you've used on your existing phone.  Actually used, not your plan.  When I researched my family's phones I figured out we were using about 30% of what we were paying for\n3. Employees at the store just kept telling me that a cellphone contract like this would really build my credit &lt;-- They don't have your interests in mind, they have their own.  Could a cellphone plan help build credit ? I have no idea, but there's a sub called /r/credit with folk who specialize in credit who could probably tell you.  I'll tell you though that anytime someone starts telling me the benefits of a product that isn't actually related to their product, it makes me suspicious. \n5. I would ask your Dad for advice.  It's cool that he doesn't want to tell you how to spend your money, and it's really cool that you're actually asking around and trying to make the best decision, but your Dad's been around alot longer than you.  I bet if you said something like \"Dad I appreciate you not trying to tell me how to spend my money but I'd really like some advice\" he'll give it to you.  Unless your Dads sucks as managing money... then don't ask him. \n\nAlso forgot 6.  Refurbished cellphones can be pretty kick ass.  I bought a refurbed iPhone off Amazon that was so new and clean I literally thought they screwed up and gave me a new phone until I found a tiny little \"refurbished\" sticker in it.  It even had all the pamphlets, the headphones were still in plastic, etc.  And it cost a LOT less than a new phone, and I put it on Ting and ended up savings TONS.   I use Ting and like it, but there are other prepaid, \"bring your own phone\" places like it.

{"id":"cvb9oud","author":"meowhahaha","body":"This is a copy-paste from a post I made last night on here.\n\n&gt;What have you been buying for years just because you like it? I started with books because I read so many. Then I added in CDs because it was super easy. Then I realized I know quite a bit about luxury Italian soaps. Now I'm starting to branch out into craft supplies.\n&gt;\nThese are areas I'm an expert (compared to some) in.\nFor me, shopping to flip isn't really work. I'm going to be at thrift shops anyway shopping for me, so I just add stuff for flipping at the same time.\n\nI have made a list of all the thrift shops within a 10 mile radius (there's about 15), their hours, their haggling policy, price of pre-priced items (a lot of shops have all CDs are X price, all shoes are X price), when the get new merch in (some daily, some twice a week). \n\nI got lucky yesterday and stopped by one that is about to move location. Everything was 50% off. My best find was a 50c (price, not artist) CD, NIP, that I've listed for $25. There are only a few available, so it should move fairly quickly. \n\nExperience has also taught me who will haggle. Betty at X shop wants inventory to move quickly, she is willing to haggle down to ridiculous prices (50c/item down to 4c/item). BUT, she will only do it when Arnold (who is in charge of donations) isn't there because he wants every penny for every item. \n\nNow I know both Betty &amp; Arnold's work schedule. \n\nWhen it's cooler I'll start going to yard sales again. There are some every weekend, but I'm not going out in 95F weather. I'd rather miss a deal and experience A/C.\n\nIf you are in the US, Goodwill is a good source for some things. The Goodwill Clearance centers are amazing! Everything except shoes &amp; furniture is sold by the pound. So I get CDs for about 19c each (in the case). \n\nI do a lot of guessing on CDs. Christmas CDs are almost always worth nothing because they are seasonal and usually overproduced. But I do a lot of craft projects with broken CDs so I don't get too upset if I can't flip it. \n\nYesterday I picked up a set of 4 brand new mini craft stamps for 75c. I'm going to have to sell them on ebay since they are not on Amazon. \n\nI've only sold one thing on ebay and I have a whole stack of stuff. But I'm a little nervous about learning how to take &amp; edit good pictures for ebay, so I keep putting it off. \n\nI've never flipped anything from craigslist (although I've sold a couple of things). I use freecycle.org or Goodwill to just dump stuff I guessed wrong about and won't use for craft projects.\n\nMany of my items listed right now are books/CDs I bought for me, and am just passing on. Only about 50% are items I bought just to flip. ","name":"t1_cvb9oud","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-23 14:44:34","week":39}

I just need a bit of advice, nothing long winded and not a 5-year churning plan.  \n\nI am hoping to take my wife to Hawaii sometime in the next year or so, for the honeymoon that we didn't have the opportunity to take when we got married earlier this summer.  I would like to pay for a large chunk of it through points/miles and churning.  I'm not against paying some cash, but I'm also willing to put in the work, and if redbird keeps the status quo, I'm more than stable enough to float money to MS.  I have a reliable place to buy VGC and a target near me, with a redbird on the way from /u/noonradar (thanks). \n\nHere's a look at my current credit situation:\n\nCredit Score: ~740+  CK has me there, the CC websites have me slightly higher, around 755-765.\n\nHome Airport: Phoenix, Sky Harbor (Southwest hub and American Airlines/US Airways hub)\n\nCurrent cards and when I was approved:\n\nDiscover IT: 4+ years ago\nDiscover IT: 9/15/15 (to capitalize on AP DCB)\nChase Freedom: 08/12\nChase Slate: 08/13\nChase Southwest: 05/14\nAmerican Express Blue: 01/14\nCapital One Quicksilver: 08/14\nCiti Diamond Preferred: 06/15\nAmazon Store Card: 08/14\nBest Buy: 01/12\nCiti ATT 9/15\n\nCurrent Point Balances:\nMR: 1,000 (just recently cashed them out for statement credit x__x)\nSouthwest Rewards: 27,000\nNegligible amounts of the rest.\n\n\nI'd just like some quick input on what path I should take to get myself the best shot at getting tickets to Hawaii on the bank's tab.  It certainly seems to me that American Airlines miles is looking like the best option.  They fly to Hawaii, and are a hub out of my city, so I'll always have that option to use the miles domestically as well.  I've seen offers for 75k/$7.5k spent in three months, which is certainly doable with my MS plan, and even with just every day spending, I could likely get there.\n\nIf I were to close that Southwest card, how long until I would be eligible to reapply and hopefully get the 50k again.\n\nI've also leaning heavily toward the British airways 50k no AF for the free RT tickets to Hawaii.

While that's the case for many mainstream electronics sold by Amazon, obviously not the case for everything.  People also don't differentiate between Amazon and FBA merchants.\n\n* There are a lot of routes to get Amazon gift cards in addition to receiving one from as a gift.

{"id":"cvbina0","author":"GlorifiedPlumber","body":"Oooo I wanted to weigh in on this.  Note, I am a Chem E, so I can speak to that mindset, but I am basing the CS mindset off my prodigious internet reading, friends, and my time spent coding as an awkward teen.  :)\n\nThe Chem E mindset I think is one of \"Someone who knows what is going on, why you are doing what you're doing, sees the big picture, and has a high situational awareness.\"\n\nFor instance, I am working on a project that would be more than a billion dollars if they built it.  We have electrical engineers installing many 480V substations... all they do is complain there are more 480V substations than the last time they did this.  All they know is the power requirement went up... they have absolutely NO idea WHY the power requirements went up, nor do they care.\n\nThe only people who know why the power requirements went up beyond a one word description on this project are the chemical engineers.\n\nThe mechanical engineers are working to put in abatement scrubbers for exhaust... there are several new systems that did not exist last time.  They have absolutely NO idea why they exist... just that they do, need to go in, and they cost money.\n\nAgain, the only people who know WHY these new abatement systems are going in, are the chemical engineers.\n\nChemical engineering teaches you to see the forest through the trees, see the path through the forest, and to understand that each individual tree contributes to the forest process in a specific manner (like a unit operation).  It teaches you to defend your thinking, how to do napkin math (one of my favorite things to do...), how to smell BS, and how to \"draw the box.\"\n\nDoing a mass and energy balance is one of the most fundamental chem E \"activities\"... and it begins with drawing the box.  Defining the plot edges, the boundary by which things go in and out is so important... beyond the boundary is out of scope and out of your control... in the boundary... is in your scope and in your control (hopefully).  So much of everything I see, from politicians speaking, from governments starting and stopping projects, to daily activities, to peoples financial lives... can be explained by improperly or deceptively drawing the box or misunderstanding things that are crossing in or out of the box.\n\nAll of this lends itself to a high situational awareness, above and beyond other people, in my opinion.  On the previous project I worked, we had 4 chemical engineers, and then 20 non chemical engineering engineers, and then ~30 non engineers.  Including the management, who was SUPPOSED to know what was going on... I kid you not, only the chemical engineers could explain to you the complete scope of what everyone was working on.  You ask any other person, and you only got their \"scope bubble.\"  This lead to management using the chem E's as a crutch and psuedo project management... which lead to resentment and accusations that management was worthless overhead.  Seriously... E1's with 2 years experience out project managed project managers with 20 years of experience, simply because they knew WTF was going on.\n\nComputer science has MANY smart people... some of the smartest people in the world.  I listen to my friends (developers at MS, MS offshoots, Amazon, and some other Seattle companies) talk, and I remember my brain when coding, and I read books by Michael Lopp (Managing Humans and Being Geek, great books), and so much of it is about fanatical devotion to \"the problem at hand.\"\n\nThey talk of deep overnight 6 am dives into \"solving that one stupid problem.\"  They talk of rewrites to a code base because \"Wednesday.\"  They talk of algorithms and tricks and clean code and the beauty of code that works better than someone elses code.\n\nThese style things are just not what I hear out of chemical engineers or aren't things I need to do my job... I think they're all exceedingly important, it is just a different mindset. \n\nAnyways... my $0.02... I WISH I had done Chem E / Computer Science instead of Biochem / Chem E.  I'm in the process of breaking out my own coding skills myself to try and get good enough to get a developer job in the event that my chem E career or the local engineering market goes tits up (my wife would never move... so I am stuck).","name":"t1_cvbina0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-23 18:51:02","week":39}

Right now, again as per other comments, you're looking at the sort of calorie deficit that makes me dizzy to imagine. In order to eat well enough to maintain energy throughout the days so that you can work on getting to a better place, you need more calories. Furthermore, it's flu and cold season and a deficit like that could literally kill you if you were to catch something. \n\nWhile right now calories is what you should be working on, I also want to mention that eating a very plain diet can easily cause vitamin deficits. It would be very very wise to consider finding a cheap but quality multivitamin to supplement. \n\nAnother option is using Amazon (multivitamins and groceries alike!) you mentioned that you're not close to big stores like walmart and that you're limited by what you can carry. Amazon has a 6 month free trial for students for Amazon prime which gets you free 2-day shipping on lots of items. You'll need a credit card number to activate but just make sure to cancel before the 6 months is up and you won't get charged (I've done this). \n\nI don't know how great Amazon is for groceries, it may be cheaper to buy some stuff in stores.

I won't be able to do that, because I don't have a trunk to put it all in. I'll only be able to bring home what I can carry home on the bus. I have a full-time job but it's not much above minimum wage, and not enough at the moment to afford car insurance, so buying a car isn't an option at the moment.\n\nI live across from a post office so standard shipping wouldn't be an issue, but getting to UPS or Fedex will be a big hassle.\n\nI really love the idea of flipping. In online video games I play, I tend to always amass huge wealth being a trader/merchant and buying items low and selling them at higher prices to other players.

But my standard lately is boiling an egg w/ it and adding kimchi and bits of dried seaweed\n\nHere's an additional frugal tip - you can get the Shin Ramen in a giant restaurant-sized pack on Amazon for quite cheap. It keeps forever and tastes delicious. Shin Ramen Black is better but comes in smaller pack quantities and is relatively expensive... \n\nIn a good Korean or generic pan-Asian supermarket you can find many many more varieties of ramen though. You save tons of money and get way better food if you shop at big Asian supermarkets. If there's one nearby, just go and visit. If you're unfamiliar with the culture, this is a super fun experience. The reward is that everything is WAY cheaper there than at the big chains, and the meat and veggies are often fresher. Plus they often have all kinds of inexpensive household items that are super useful and super hard to find anywhere else.\n\nAlso another tip - if you want better mushrooms in your ramen but don't want to buy them fresh only to go bad, buy a pack of dried shitake mushrooms and use that.","name":"t1_cvd0l26","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-24 23:04:37","week":39}

We're talking NFLX numbers here!\" Of course, every single analyst report failed to consider the fact that they only get about 3M-ish viewers per show on free TV. So they were implicitly assuming that more than 1/3 of the people who get it for free would shell out money for the network. Really, the apt comparison would've been the trend for WrestleMania PPV purchases (which rarely exceeds 1M), not NFLX or AMZN Prime.\n\nOn top of that, when it launched, they said the break even number for subscribers was around 750K. They only hit that number once it launched internationally 9 months later, but of course that increased the break-even point to over 1M subscribers. Basically I saw no way for these expectations to even remotely match reality. I didn't want to do a straight short sale (and it's a good thing I didn't, because from $20 it went to a little above $30 before crashing down after announcing the actual subscriber numbers, which were slightly over 500K iirc), and there were no LEAPS available (I figured the market would at least give the network a year, but the price crashed as soon as the 500K number was released a few months after the network launched), so I couldn't.

{"id":"cvf0m2e","author":"FlippingCraze","body":"Yes -- This was my first concern. Evaluate your profit margins and item popularity before buying the item. Everyone's comfort level on a profit margin is different (i.e. 3xs or 4xs purchased price). Also, to echo other posts, simply open a small store for a year which is only $15.95 per month. This was one of the best business growth decisions in my first year. When you get additional free listings from ebay that is all gravy. This also reduces you racing to post free listings within 'x' days due to ebay's restrictions. Once you get the store 1/2 stocked I began to realize the same items could be crossed posted on other venues (i.e. Amazon, Facebook Groups, Grail). Sales increased as stock and strategies increased.

{"id":"cvfkfxz","author":"fungus_eater","body":"I haven't use ebay much, but I sell alot on amazon and I am from Canada. So I might be able to tell a few things base on me and other amazon seller's experiences.\n\nAmazon is VERY customer orientated. Base on what I read about ebay on these threads, I think amazon is much much more customer friendly than ebay and sometimes amazon policies are quite unfair and harsh to sellers. Especially A-Z claims, if a customer mistakenly files an A-Z claim on you, and even if amazon recognized that you are not at fault and it was the customer's mistake, the A-Z claim black mark will still be on your account and amazon won't remove it. \n\nIt is also very easy to get scammed selling high priced electronics on amazon. \n\nIf the customer claims that the item haven't been delivered to them even though tracking says \"delivered\", they can still go complain to amazon and amazon will give the customer their money back from your account as well as letting them keep the item if you don't back yourself up. Amazon doesn't consider tracking info as evidence of something being delivered, amazon considers something is deliver ONLY if the customer signs for the package. Sometimes if another person and NOT the customer signs for package, amazon may consider the item to be not received by customer and customer may their money back from your account depending who amazon sides with.\n\nWith the above, you can see that knowledgeable scammers who knows amazon's system very well have many opportunities to try to get free stuff and have a high chance of success with amazon.\n\nBasically, you really need to record everything and take lots of precautions to avoid being scammed or even let amazon believe you. \n\nSo the above are just worst case scenario situations. \n\nYou gotta know amazon's rules very well if you want to avoid making mistakes, or else you will easily get banned if enough customer complains about you. \n\nPros of amazon are that you can sell things more expensive on amazon then ebay, stuff seems to sell faster. You can list something in a minute, you don't have to take pictures. Their FBA program is very nice ESPECIALLY if you are selling in Canada. You will probably save alot on shipping costs in Canada if you just sent inventory in to sell and let amazon do the rest. Save on shipping= more profit. \n\n","name":"t1_cvfkfxz","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-27 08:03:08","week":39}

{"id":"cvfot2s","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"I don't think there's a lot of difference in gift card programs, i haven't seen anyone that offers regular discounts to the relatively standard price of 1c per point, but I would probably find it handy to know which of my rewards providers have which gift cards available.. so i think i'll blow some time right now clicking through their sites.. :-)\n\n* edit: wow, this is a monstrous post. I just typed all this. Then when I reviewed it, I was like \"holy wall of text, Baman\"\n\npoints2u.com is my crappy rewards program from my credit union.  The point value is much less than 1c per point, but is earned at the same rate as everyone else -- $1 = earning 1 point.  $25 gift cards === 3500 pts.  The value of their offering sucks, but when I realized I had over 50,000 points available with them, I figured I'd better do something with those points.  Nice thing, is that they do both regular gift cards, and eGift cards.  The eGift cards are, literally, instantaneous.  I can hit checkout on it, then click \"My Account\" and the info is up, and the card is ready to be used.  Just looking at their eGift card lineup, I presume their regular card lineup is same/similar:\n\n1-800-flowers, Aeropostale, Alamo Drafthouse, Athleta, Banana Republic, Best Buy, Boscov, Brinker, Cabela's Captain D's, Casual Male, Celebrity Cruises, Champs Sports, Charity Choice, Chef's Catalogue, Chili's, Columbia Sportswear, Crutchfield, CVS, Dell, Destination XL, Domino's, Fandango, Foot Locker, FTD, GameStop, Gander Mountain, GAP, Golfsmith, Groupon, Hal Smith, Hot Topic, iTunes, JC Penney, Landry's Restaurants, Lands End, Levy's Restaurants, LL Bean, Logan's Roadhouse, Lucille's Smokehouse, Maggiano's, Nike, Old Navy, Omaha Steaks, On The Border, Overstock.com, Overton's, Papa Gino's, QVC, Red Robin, Regal Entertainment, Rochester Big &amp; Tall, SpaWeek, Staples, Stein Mart, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, TGI Friday's, Cheesecake Factory, Home Depot, Tony Roma's, Torrid, Uno's Chicago Grill, Wine Enthusiast.\n\nPoints2u also offers a wide selection of merchandise that you probably wouldn't want to use points from them for, considering the redemption value is crappy.  The most expensive item I see is a 15-inch Macbook Pro that costs $2375 at Best Buy, but is 535,065 points here.\n\nChase's Ultimate Rewards program, I haven't used for gift cards, so I don't know if they are all electronic, or regular, or some combination.  They do occasionally offer a sale (right now you can get a $25 Kohl's card for 2250 points, so 10% discount).  You can also shop directly at amazon.com with your points, at 1c per point.\n\nChase offers 10, 25, and 50 dollar gift cards mostly at the 1c per point rate, from the following:\n\n1-800-Flowers, Amazon, AMC Movies, American Eagle, Applebee's, Aeropostale, Bahama Breeze, Banana Republic, Barnes &amp; Noble, Bath &amp; Body Works, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Best Buy, Best Western, Bloomingdale's, Brooks Brothers, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cabela's, California Pizza Kitchen, Callaway, Carnival Cruises, Chili's, CVS, Darden Restaurants ($5 increments), Dillard's, Domino's Pizza, Dunkin' Donuts, EXPRESS, Farmont Hotels, Fleming's Steakhouse, Foot Locker, GAP, Gymboree, Hyatt Hotels, iTunes, JCPenney, Kmart, Kohl's, LL Bean, Lands End, Longhorn Steakhouse, Lowes, Macys, Marriott, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Old Navy, Olive Garden, Outback, PF Chang's, Panera Bread, Papa John's, Pier 1 IMports, Pottery Barn, Red Lobster, Red Robin, Regal Entertainment, Restoration Hardware, Royal Caribbean International ($200 value, 20k points), Ruth's Chris Steak House, Saks Fifth Ave, Sears, Sephora, Spafinder Wellness, Staples, Starbucks ($5 for 500), Sunglass Hut, Talbots, Target, TGI Friday's, Cheesecake Factory, Children's Place, Home Depot, The Limited, Ritz-Carlton, TJX, Tourneau ($100 = 1000 pts), UNO Pizzeria, Williams-Sonoma, and Zappos.com\n\nYou can also redeem Chase Ultimate Rewards immediately into cash towards your account, as a check, I think, and you can use it for travel, using it for travel does net some percentage off of their regular travel rates.  You can also convert Ultimate Rewards points directly into some other airlines and hotel's rewards programs.\n\nDiscover also has a gift card purchasing portal, which you can use your cashback rewards to purchase, and it looks like they offer anywhere from a 10% to 20% discount on most gift cards, with some discounted all the way up to 50%.  They do list a separate section for \"eCertificates\", so my guess is that they probably offer both regular and eGift Cards for each of their vendors.  The vendor list is extremely long, though, so I'm going to try to limit it to things that I think someone might be interested in flipping (ie, not restaurants :-D ) ..  also, it appears that you can probably purchase these cards at these rates, even if you don't have enough rewards points to get them just on your rewards account .. which might make this very attractive to some... anywhoo, here's the abbreviated vendor list for Discover:\nAce Hardware, Autozone, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Crate &amp; Barrel, Crutchfield, Dell, Hobby Lobby, Lowe's, Pep Boys, Pier 1, Pottery Barn, Shell, Staples, Container Store, West Elm, Whole Foods, Williams-Sonoma, Pea in the Pod, Aeropostale, Aerie, American EAgle, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers, Destination Maternity, Express, Gap, Lands End, LL Bean, Motherhood Maternity, Neiman Marcus, Old Navy, Sunglass Hut, Talbots, Children's Place, The Limited, Toms Shoes, Zappos.com, Bergner's, Bon-Ton, BOston Store, Burlington Coat Factory, Carson Pirie Scott, Dillard's Elder-Beerman, Herberger's, HomeGoods, JCPenney, Kmart, Kohl's, Macy's, Marshalls, Overstock.com, QVC, Sears, TJ Maxx, Younkers, Barnes &amp; Noble, GameStop, Groupon, Bath &amp; Body Works, CVS, Mario Tricoci, Red Door Spas, Regis Salons, Sally Beauty, Sephora, SpaFinder, Athleta, Bass Pro Shops, Callaway, Champs Sports, Foot Locker, FootAction, Lids, Nike, Sports Authority, Under Armour ... AND MORE.  \n\nThe Discover \"Best Value\" tab is currently offering me 50% off on Alamo Rent-a-Car, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, FTD.com, Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet Grills, National Car Rental, Royal Caribbean International, Sandals Resorts...\n\nThe last credit card rewards program I have access to is Citi's, which to me is a mystifying clusterf**k of mess, where they usually are trying to get you to purchase products, and offering some discount when you turn in points to it.  They also have auctions(?!) such as one live right now, where for $99.75 + whatever number of points you bid, you can get an iPad mini 3.  It's not clear to me at all what a value of points would be for anything on this site, nor how you actually earn points.   ANYWAY, as far as gift cards go, they mostly offer the ability to use 5 or 10 points to get a 5 to 10% discount on purchasing a gift card.\n\nCiti offers egifts for: Staples, Brookstone, Express, Gap, Staples, The Limited, Burlington, Callaway, Columbia Sportswear, JCPenney, Lands End, Nike, and a bunch of restaurants.  I'm not even going to take the time to try to page through their non-egift selection.\n\n","name":"t1_cvfot2s","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-27 13:17:31","week":39}

Sounds so bureaucratic, but I guess there must be barriers to entry to avoid dishonest sellers.\n\nStuff sells slower on eBay, but the profit margins are much higher for us. I hear Amazon FBA sellers talk excitedly about buying an item for $5 and making $5 profit after fees. It's not uncommon for us to buy an item for $1 and sell for over $100 (even after fees) on eBay. So we might sell much less than a FBA seller, but we don't have to sell as many items to make a living.\n\nFBA sounds extremely enticing because they store and ship the items.\nIf you enjoy scavenging for the newer kind of items that Amazon likes, that seems to be a perfect scenario. Just send it in and Amazon sells it. \n\nWe still like eBay because we enjoy scavenging for the old, weird stuff buried in the corners of the world that people think is garbage. No bigger thrill when it finds the right home for a good price. Feels more like a treasure hunt and this keeps us going day in and day out, year after year.

First, you can have a contract, but you pay a monthly fee for the ability to do this.  It's around $15 a month (or $360 for a 2 year contract).  Or, they do the lease thing, which is pretty much the same.  Just go to Amazon and buy it outright, and you'll easily save the difference.  Or better yet, get one on craiglist.  Earlier this year I got an S5 on craigs for about $300.  It was a few months old and in perfect condition.  Over the course of 2 years, leasing it or having it as part of a contract would have cost me around $1k.  \ntl;dr - never get a phone through the provider.","name":"t1_cvfsplc","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-27 16:44:22","week":39}
