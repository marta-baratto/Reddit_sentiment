Here are your pre-market news movers on this Monday morning-\n\n&gt; **Starwood** — The hotel chain has signed off on an improved takeover bid from Marriott, worth $13.6 billion in cash and stock. The new deal comes after China's Anbang topped Marriott's original deal with Starwood with its own offer last week. Separately, Starwood signed a deal to operate hotels in Cuba, becoming the first U.S. hotel company to do so since the 1959 revolution.\n\n**TICKER:** HOT\n\n* [CHART](http://finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=HOT&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)\n\n(**[LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/HOT)**)\n\n&gt; **IHS** — The business analytics firm and financial market information firm Markit are combining in what's being billed as a merger of equals. The deal is worth more than $13 billion, with IHS shareholders owning 57 percent of the new IHS Markit and Markit shareholders owning the rest. Separately, IHS reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share for its first quarter, 5 cents above estimates, while revenue also topped forecasts.

{"id":"4bc9kn","author":"tubularjohnny","body":"Hey friends,\n\nYou may know me from my posts about free or heavily discounted food. I've even been honored with the flair \"Free Food Guy\". Since my posts are scattered, I thought I'd collect them all into one place along with some stuff I haven't posted before to create a Free Food Guide. \n\nHaving been perpetually poor/near-destitute for a while, I've been forced to find ways to cut down my food costs. I thought this info might be helpful to other folks out there looking to cut their food costs. \n\n**Eating out**\n\n1. [Scoutmob](http://scoutmob.com/). I just discovered this app, but it has some pretty amazing discounts, including stuff that is totally free. For instance, one coffee shop nearby has a coupon for a free medium coffee, a pizza shop has a coupon for a free slice of pizza, and one place that normally has $7 lunches is 50% off, which means a full meal for $3.50! It's even better than Groupon, because you don't need to make any purchase up front--it's just a coupon you show at the register, and you can use it unlimited times (though you may have to keep making new accounts to do that, I'm not sure). It has more offerings in some cities than others, so it's usefulness depends on your location.\n\n2. [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/e2444a5c-b867-4fc5-8303-e0d4170fc7e7) Groupon has some solid deals as well, typically 40% off, but sometimes more. They periodically release promo codes that give you an additional 20% off (for a total of 52% off for a 40% off Groupon), so I typically wait for those before buying them. If you're a first time Groupon user, promo code \"WELCOME\" should get you $10 off a $25 order. [referral link](https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/e2444a5c-b867-4fc5-8303-e0d4170fc7e7) /[non-ref](http://groupon.com)\n\n3. Free Waffle House. There's an app called [Roadie](http://roadie.com) (uber for delivery) that has partnered with Waffle House. Simply sign up, click the \"promotions\" tab, and there will be a coupon for a free waffle! Promo codes ROADIE10, LOVE16, ATL15, EARTH15 will stack up to give you $50 of credit if you actually want to use the app. A referral link will get you an additional $10 on top of that. [ref](http://promo.roadie.com/kUPb/jIPl0Z9AUq) / [non-ref](http://roadie.com) Edit: apparently ATL15 is the only promo code that still works.\n\n4. [Caviar](https://www.trycaviar.com/users/sign_up?referral_code=0t1ag5) / [non-ref](http://trycaviar.com). **FREE food + delivery from restaurants with Caviar.** Caviar is a service that delivers from local restaurant, like Seamless or Grubhub. Signing up via a [referral](https://www.trycaviar.com/users/sign_up?referral_code=0t1ag5) gets you $10-$20  /, and then using promo codes TAKEME10 (first time users only) for $10 off, or one of the following codes for $5 off: CAVIARMSP5,CAVIARWORKS5, OGXRTI5, MALAI5, CHICAGO5, NORANCH5, SLICE5, ILLEGAL5 (Illegal Food in Atlanta only), RMNMAY ($25 order required), FLEX5 ($20 order required). So the worst case scenario is $15 of credit, which is definitely enough for FREE food + delivery! \n\n5. [Delivery.com](http://www.delivery.com/share?code=raebc1c2) Signing up with a referral code each time will get you $7 off! Exact same thing as Grubhub, I also recommend pickup for optimal savings. [referral](http://www.delivery.com/share?code=raebc1c2) (gets you $7) / [non-ref](www.delivery.com)\n\n6. IKEA. Not ideal if you're far away from one, but it was a lifesaver for me when I could get a full, delicious meal for $4. They even have a $1 breakfast! I think they subsidize the food with furniture sales, so take advantage of that by going there just for the food.\n\n7. IHOP. Sign up for IHOP's [email club](http://www.ihop.com/pancake-revolution) and get a coupon for free pancakes. I just create throwaways each time I want another coupon. You receive the coupon within 24 hours of signing up, and the coupon expires in two weeks. You also get another coupon on your birthday--I've heard claims that they check ID to verify your actual birthday, so keep that in mind.\n\n8. Pizza Hut. If you sign up for Pizza Hut's [email club](https://order.pizzahut.com/hutlovers) (throwaways also suggested for this), they'll immediately email you a coupon for free breadsticks or free cheesesticks. I combine this with the cheapest menu item (a personal pan pizza for ~$4), and that's a sizeable meal/meal-and-a-half for under $5! You'll also get a coupon for free cinnastix on your \"birthday\"\n\n9. Other restaurants: In general, joining the email clubs of other restaurants with throwaways gets you lots of discounts, like $10 off at Maggiano's, free coffee at Starbucks, BOGOs at Bruster's and Cold Stone, etc. They also send you free stuff on your \"birthday\" so...do with that as you will. \n\n10. Taco Bell: Always order through app for 25% off!\n\n11. [Grubhub](http://www.grubub.com): Can get $7 of $15 order for each new email (do pickup for optimal savings). Unfortunately, it appears they've discontinued their referral program, but creating new accounts off others' existing referral links should still get you the $7. \n\n\n\n**Groceries**\n\n1. Use credit cards with high grocery rewards. For instance, the Amex Blue Cash Preferred gives you 6% back on groceries (for the first $6000 per year). It does cost $75 a year, but you'll more than make it up considering that most cards give you at best 3%, which means you'll save an additional $180  over a 3% card if you use all $6000 of your allowance, for a total of $105 in additional savings over a 3% card, not accounting for any of Amex's other benefits. Best of all, you can buy other gift cards at Kroger, etc. (like Amazon gift cards) and still get the 6% discount! \n\n2. Use sites like [cardpool](http://cardpool.com) or subreddits like /r/giftcardexchange to get giftcards to grocery stores at a discount. You can typically save 10-15% this way.\n\n3. Use [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/register?friend=ulvosom), which is an app that gives you rebates on groceries, and this is on top of all of the methods described above! I save 5-10% on groceries this way. If you use a [referral link](https://ibotta.com/register?friend=ulvosom) you immediately get a $10 rebate after your first use of the app. By combining the above three methods, there's no reason you can't save 20-30% off groceries. [non-ref](http://ibotta.com)\n\n4. Shop at Aldi. Cheap but quality goods.\n\nHopefully you found this info helpful. If you guys have any more suggestions for free/cheap food, let me know and I'll add them to this list!\n\n**edit: I've since created http://freefoodguy.com so you can find all the free food deals in one place and be notified via email of any new free food offerings! If you sign up for the newsletter, it'll automatically send you the most up-to-date version of this guide.**\n","name":"t3_4bc9kn","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-03-21 14:34:26","week":12}

{"id":"4bckus","author":"mvpetri","body":"This is the result of me being stupid and the culture of online subscriptions not being so common in my country. So sorry in advance if this is trivial to you.\n\nBack in September last year I was reading through this wonderful subreddit called /r/entrepreneur and they were discussing about this very nice service called Jungle Scout.\n\nBasically it is a service that provides you lots of processed information of Amazon products. It helps you to easily see what people are looking for, what products are more likely to have high demand and these sort of things. Very appropriate for some people at that sub.\n\nThe site offered a free trial and I wanted to try. So I signed up. It was a 6 months trial, and I think it was the best!\n\nBut it wasn't for me. Since I'm not in US and Amazon is not so relevant in my country yet, I haven't found a reason to use Jungle Scout's services.\n\nI never accessed the site again, and I didn't use their services. But today, 6 months later, a paypal email comes telling me that some money was deducted from my acc. From some company that I didn't even know (when I first saw the email, at least).\n\nI had to check my history and think for a moment to remember what it was. Damn! They made what I think everyone does by default: The trial subscription will be free, but your paypal will automatically deduct the next one when the time is due, and it is you who have to uncheck it.\n\nWell... apparently I didn't. I contact them saying what happened. Their response was:\n\n&gt; We do have a 14 day refund policy, to give people a chance to try out Jungle Scout and see if it works for them, but unfortunately we can't refund a purchase from that long ago.\n\nWhich I think is strange, because 6 months ago I didn't even paid (it was a free trial). I paid now (1 day ago).\n\nHow to deal with stuff like this? The \"14 days\" start counting when you pay, or when you sign up?\n\n","name":"t3_4bckus","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-21 15:56:16","week":12}

The majority of scratch tickets are \"losers\" (eg, win 10 coins), but sometimes you will get lucky (win 100). in my experience the scratch tickets are also marginal winners like the wheel. the scratch ticket also has a cool down similar to the wheel but it is not as long as the wheel\n\nThey also have slots, pay 3 coins or something like that. this one is always a loser and should not be played (i have spent 1000 coins testing it out). it has no cool down.\n\nThere is also a daily checkin (with bonus for repeated checkin) with a daily event, basically just stay on the page for 5-one minute intervals and you will receive a random amount of coins (around 10 each instance). you seem to get more coins if you do this.\n\n\nNow, the brilliant part about this app is that you will have the option to \"click ads\". some tiny little ads will pop up on the bottom and by clicking them (some will direct you to the ad on safari, but many of them will not. over time you will learn which will and which will not) you will receive double the bonus for either the wheel or the scratch card. you receive 30 of these \"click ads\" per day. \n\n\nI have had the app for about 25 days now and I have cashed out two $10 amazon GC.

I looked up comments based on the Visa Signature and people said that since it is a \"credit access line\" that they report the available credit as \"0\" instead of as whatever the credit limit used to be. This would hurt my overall utilization, as it is the only card I have 0% utilization on (I have 3 other cards that average out to ~14% utilization, but with this card, my utilization is under 10%). \n3. What are the benefits of having a Signature card?\n\n\nThanks so much for helping me figure this out. \n","name":"t3_4blfpk","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-23 07:27:02","week":12}

{"id":"4bp84r","author":"entrepreneursyoda","body":"We like to adapt sports phrases to business. The phrase \"go big or go home\" had its origins in extreme sports, used by the extreme athletes, who know that winning will require them to push their physical and mental limits.\n\nIt's a perfect description of the type of passion and effort that entrepreneurs need for business success. But, used by the investment community, \"go big or go home\" has an entirely different meaning.\n\n&gt;*And, often, just creates \"noise\" for the entrepreneur.*\n\nAs venture funds have grown ever larger, to be efficient, they need to make bigger and bigger investments in each business in which they invest. Naturally for better leverage, they want to invest in entrepreneurs attacking multi-billion dollar markets who can grow their companies into billion dollar valuations.\n\nSo they advocate \"go big or go home\" either directly or indirectly, by focusing only on businesses with million dollar market potential or trying to convince entrepreneurs to change their business model to fit their investment model.\n\nHowever, for every Facebook, Twitter or Google, there are hundreds and hundreds of companies who never got off the launch pad in these markets, despite big-time investments in those billion dollar markets. \n\n**A lifestyle business is okay.**\nMore important, there are thousands and thousands of successful small businesses filling a market need or solving a market problem quite well, while providing themselves a good living and jobs for their community, in markets that total well less than a billion dollars.And, most of them do it alone.\n\nMore than 600,000 businesses are started every year in the United States. Last year, while professional investors put $48 billion in entrepreneurial companies, that is, angels, private investors or venture capital funds, less than 70,000 businesses received that funding.\n\nAnd of those, less than 3,600 got their money from venture capital funds. So while it's a great slogan for effort, \"go big or go home\" in this context ain't exactly a good odds play for an entrepreneur to go chasing multi-billion dollar markets in hopes of gaining big-time investment, unless that's already the goal of your business model. \n\n&gt;*\"But that doesn't mean you have to be the next Amazon to do it\"*\n\nSure, you're ready to \"leave everything out on the field,\" but that doesn't mean you have to be the next Amazon to do it.  To keep things in context, here are some guidelines for channeling that \"go big or go home\" attitude, so it fits you and your model:\n\n**If \"what you know best\" and \"what you love most\" are the same, that's a great start!**\nMaybe your small business isn't going to develop the \"next big thing\" or a cure for a dreaded disease. Maybe it's just a business you believe in, something you're an expert in and something you just love doing that provides a product or service that addresses a unique problem or need in a market.\n\nThat's a terrific beginning. And, of course, if you can make money at it, then you have the foundation of a real business, no matter what anybody else thinks. \n\n**Find a niche you can \"own,\" even if it's not a billion dollar market.**\nYou may be in a billion dollar market, but it may have a lot of competition. Find the niche that is underserved and with much less competition; and one you can serve well.\n\nThen do everything you can to \"own\" that niche, using your expertise and your love for the business to create a market position for your product or service and driving to penetrate it.\n\nEven if the niche is only hundreds or even tens of millions, if you can create a unique offering to meet the needs or solve the problems of that niche, you have an excellent opportunity for long-term success.\n\n**Your long-term goal doesn't have to be \"sell for a jillion dollars!\"**\nCan you say \"lifestyle business?\" Among the boards, I sit on, are two companies where each CEO/founder has created a business that fits his lifestyle, professionally, financially and personally.\n\nThey both worked long and hard in the early going, sacrificing a lot, not taking much out of the company. Now that both companies are pretty successful, the founders now receive very healthy compensation and \"perks\" from their business, well beyond what might be considered \"in line\" for companies their size.\n\nAll choices they made without the assistance of outside institutional investors. They are nicely profitable, haven't been growing at more than a 10-15% pace for the last few years.\n\n&gt;*\"You have a choice.\"*\n\nWhy?  Because that was also a choice, they made about how hard they wanted to work at this point in their lives. Nothing wrong with that. Might they sell their companies? Sure, maybe someday. But right now, they're very comfortable, thank you! Take a lesson here. You have a choice.\n\n**Figure out \"how else\" you can fund your business.**\nRaising outside capital is not a given for success. I've written a previous blog post on this subject. But if you're not going to raise capital from professional investors, know that depending on how much or how fast you intend to grow, you will need additional capital, beyond just cash flow, to do it.\n\nSome good rules of thumb I developed, over the years, is that for most manufacturing-based businesses, you can grow about 25% a year and for services-based businesses about 35-40% per year through just the cash your business generates.\n\nBut you'll probably need a credit line to help you through the peaks and valleys of cash flow, especially if you're growing close to my rule of thumb percentages.\n\nAdditionally, if your business is at all capital intensive, you'll probably have to look at debt financing. The most important point, here, is that you don't need angels, VCs and the like to make your business successful. But you will need alternatives.\n\n\"Go big or go home\" is a great catch-phrase, but don't let it dictate anything but your effort. If you are going to chase a big market and big valuations, do it because it fits with your expertise, what you love to do and your long-term goals. Not because somebody says you have to.\n\nIf you liked this post, you can get more advice and entrepreneurial tips on [The Entrepreneur's Yoda](http://www.thesmallbusinessforce.com/blog/) blog.","name":"t3_4bp84r","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-24 00:56:53","week":12}
{"id":"4bpxyl","author":"Lost_In_Debt","body":"I downloaded the Credit Karma app about 6 months ago to monitor my credit score. I am 23 years old currently in college. When I first looked at my credit report, I saw that there were multiple cards opened under my name that I had never signed up for. These cards to date total $12,381. After researching the companies that the cards were opened under, I found out that 2 of them are Capital One accounts, 2 are Care Credit accounts, One is a Compass account, and the other is an affiliate with Victoria secrets. \n\nA little background: My family has had its ups and downs financially, but never have we lost a house or went into major debt as far as I know. My mom handles the finances in the family          (which i think is the problem) and my dad just does the work. On average through the last 10 years my dad has consistently made over 200k per year before taxes. \n\nI am under the impression that he does not know my mom has opened credit cards under my name and my brothers names (21, and 16 years old). Nor does he know the amount of debt she has racked up on these cards. \n\nI do need to mention that my dad has cheated on my mother before and has damn near torn this family apart after she found out. It only happened once, (as far as I know) but it was seriously rough when it happened. As a result of this, my mother and I are very close. More of friends than a mother-son relationship. She does everything for me, sends me money when I need it, buys me clothes, pays for college, insurance, cell phone ect. So as you may image it is a VERY sensitive subject. \n\nIn the past, If I had ever 'thrown her under the bus' with my dad, she guilt tripped me from the age of 6 to 23 to no end. 'How could i do this to her after all she has done for me all these years......\" ect you get the picture. \n\nSo to get to the point, I have never approached my dad regarding my knowledge of her having debt in mine and my brothers names. \n\nThe most recent episode of her adding debt to my name was when she opened a Care Credit account in my name. It was originally supposed to be for my orthodontist costs. However, I left for college before the appointments ever took place, and as a result there was never a balance on those cards. She has had breast implants goin on 8 years now and 6 months ago or so, she had one of her implants pop. Instead of her paying for the procedure out of pocket, she put $4,700 on one care credit account under my name, and $5,800 on a Capital one account to pay for the procedure. \n\nObviously when these charges were placed on my account Credit Karma sent me emails letting me know there was a large amount of recent activity on my accounts. Obviously I knew this wasn't me, and immediately went to my mom saying how my accounts had been compromised and fraud was committed against me. She turned red, turned around and said that she paid for her surgery with those credit cards, and to \"please don't say anything to your father,\" ... I didn't and just kept it to myself thinking that she would pay it off in a few months time. \n\nTurns out, she's making the minimum payments on these accounts and as a result my credit score has suffered due to having a 'poor' (very high) credit utilization to credit limit ratio. \n\nWhat happened today was the final straw for me. I was on vacation in Miami with a friend when I received an email stating that there had been a \"credit monitoring alert\" on my account. This alert showed me that there had been a Hard Inquiry for an Amazon Credit card. I Immediately called the credit card company and stated that I did not authorize this credit card. They stated that they will remove the hard inquiry and require a personal consultation before any more accounts are opened in my name from now on. They also said that they will send a white envelope in the mail within 7-10 days stating that the credit card that was applied for was denied due to my request. \n\nI know that my mom was the one who opened the credit card under my name, but I didn't tell the rep that. What I'm concerned about is her receiving the mail expecting a credit card with my name on it, and instead receiving a credit fraud notification. \n\nPlease tell me what I need to do in order to get this resolved. She already has a tremendous amount of debt under my name, let alone what she has under my brothers names. I have no idea what the numbers are total, but I believe that they could be well above 30k. \n\nHow do I approach this sensitive situation without causing her to think I 'betrayed' her and ruining our relationship..... \n\n(sorry for the wall of text)","name":"t3_4bpxyl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-24 04:02:27","week":12}

{"id":"4br0z8","author":"archer48","body":"I started a sourcing company that focuses on helping e-commerce sellers get products manufactured. Selling on Amazon is a popular topic these days, but I want to focus on the growth of my business and how we got where we are today. \n\nI love reading about the growth of companies, both small and large. So here is me giving back. \n\nAsk whatever questions you want, I’ll try to be as open as possible.\n\n**TL;DR My progress in building a company where I can act as an operator and not a micromanager**\n\n**The Beginning**\n\n22 months ago I updated /r/entrepreneur of my minor progress in quitting my job at a product development company where I set out to help businesses get products manufactured from China. \n\nYou can read about it here: [14 Days in, and what started as an idea, is becoming a global business.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/25j82l/14_days_in_and_what_started_as_an_idea_is/)\n\nAfter starting the company and hiring a small Chinese staff working out of my apartment, in Shenzhen, China, we began getting a lot of clients by word of mouth and basic networking. The business model was simple, we act as the eyes, ears and boots on the ground in China for our customers. Our customers ranged from medium and large scale Amazon/eBay sellers, to brands that you can find in Wal Mart, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Tesco and Target. \n\nOur profit margins were pretty good, because we were acting as the middle man and paying factories with our clients money, our revenue was much higher than our profit. But our risk was minimal as we were never holding inventory. It wasn’t before long before where we had multiple millions of dollars in sales, which looked nice, but our profit margins only ranged from about 1% - 10% per order.\n\nI realized we needed to scale, as my goal was to create a company, bring in talented operators and oversee operations without having to micromanage. \n\n**Trying to Scale Attempt 1**: \n\nTraditionally, Chinese companies scale via internal growth. The more employees you have, the bigger and more profitable you are. Our competitors have teams of 100+ people working in single offices. I don’t like this idea. Too much management, too messy and the overhead is too high. I tried to switch my clients over to a recurring revenue model. Nobody was biting. We tried to increase our profit, but the market was too competitive. The only possible option I saw to grow was to add a sales team and add more sourcing agents. - Again, an idea I did not love.\n\n**Trying to Scale Attempt 2**: \n\nChina works based on scale. The higher the order quantity, the better it is for everyone. Because of this, we would often get weekly requests from small quantity e-commerce sellers who we’d constantly turn away because their order sizes were too small, and the work wasn’t worth the reward. I never liked turning people away. I had a client come back to me and tell me that there are no services out there who understand the business model of an e-commerce seller. \n\nI decided I was going to find a way to help these types of e-commerce sellers.\n\nA serious gap in this industry was identified. The only services out there for e-commerce sellers were training courses teaching new sellers how to make millions on Amazon. These were just courses, nothing different from the affiliate marketing, forex trading, work from home courses that new age entrepreneurs are seen creating as a way to earn a quick buck.  Sure, some of this stuff was helpful, but there are still a ton of people out there who were actively selling online, they’ve surpassed the beginner mark and they are struggling to grow their business and deal with China at the same time. Having identified that group, our target customer was created. \n\n**The Problem:**\n\n We know that manufacturing works based on scale. So the larger the order, the lower the price, the greater the profit. Accepting to work with small sized importers was too dangerous in the existing model of sourcing suppliers, offering product quotations and hoping the client bites. There is way too much work involved just to offer a quotation, and hope the client was serious enough to place the order. \n\n**The Pivot:**\n\n We created a new service, outside of our existing website where the goal was to guide importers through the entire process of working with China. We’d act as the project manager, offering our purchasing office and resources in China in an outsourced model where we’d become a part of our clients company. We built an *a la carte* menu and offered our existing services to anyone who wanted them in a buy it now, productized fashion. They could purchase a sourcing service where we’d provide them with a list of qualified suppliers for a product they wanted to manufacture. They could purchase our negotiation service where we would negotiate for 8 days on their behalf. Clients could even have multiple samples shipped to our office in China, and we document them and ship them all together to them, saving them hundreds of dollars in shipping fees. \n\nThis service took off! We got tons of orders as a lot of people began talking about us on various forums and groups. But apparently this was not good enough. Everyone said, can you guys just do everything for us?  \n\nAt this point, I had hired some marketing consultants and had close friends following what I was doing. Almost everyone was telling me to just create a full package and offer everything. I was reluctant at first, I told them all it would never work, there were too many unknown variables. \n\nEventually I caved it. I stayed up for 48 straight hours planning the restructuring of the entire business model. Previously, we were using Chinese sourcing agent who we’d train and have them work from home to source suppliers for these e-commerce clients. This process was great, as the overhead was much smaller, but it was not super reliable. \n\nI stuck with the idea and built a service where clients could come to us with their product idea, we’d give them an idea of its feasibility, cost, etc. and then we’d get moving acting as their purchasing office. Total transparency. The client would know who the factory is, something most sourcing companies keep as a close secret. The goal was, for the client would be in the loop with everything, but would rely on a single representative at our company to handle all aspects in China for them. \n\n**The Marketing:** \n\nWe built a list of 300 email subscribers we found via three Facebook groups. These 300 people were going to be our beta testers. We started a drip series email campaign that would educate them about the pitfalls when dealing with China, scare them of the risks, and sell them on our service. The day to launch was near. We were hoping for a 3% conversion rate from this list. That would have been enough for us to validate the new service and let us know whether or not to continue down the road of offering a service to this type of importer. \n\nFive days after the launch our conversion rate from the drip campaign was roughly 30%. We were not equipped to handle that amount of sales. Frantic, I shut down the site, emailed all customers and informed them our site is down so we can focus on their orders.\n\nIn the weeks to come, I transitioned from half of our sourcing staff working from home, to a full staff in our office. Then we began interviewing and hiring like crazy. Brought three new sourcing agents on, left our small office and rented a new office which provided us more room to grow. \n\n**Rebuilding**:\n\nOnce the shock wore off, reality began setting in. This idea was not only validated, the problem was not demand, it was supply. The past couple of months we’ve been building training programs, adding a management team and structuring our company to fit the mold of my original goal, operating and not micro managing. \n\nNow, I have two strong managers. One manages the sourcing team and the other manages the account reps. We were able to build team leaders who are responsible for solving day to day problems, leaving me to focus on growth. All work is based on metrics, each employee is graded on their work, and the bonus structure is set up according to the monthly performance metrics. \n\nWe have a lot planned in the near future. It is definitely exciting to be paving the way in an age old industry with a modern approach. We are starting to see competition, and as an MVP in an arena of this size, that is to be expected. Our main focus is on continuing to strengthen our core, come out with new services and make sure all of our early clients are heard and their problems get solved. \nWe’ve been approached by some pretty large companies both in our industry and outside interested in investing in us. I am still the sole owner and we’ve yet to take a single investment. That time may come, but I am going to be picky with who we choose. \n\nIt is an exciting time for us, we’re not perfect by any means, I 100% work by the philosophy where you need to be ashamed of your initial launches and attempts, anything you’re not ashamed of, you took too long to release. \n\nI purposely left out our company name as I’d love to focus on the business growth, and I’m not interested in plugging anything at this time. \n\n**Some things we’re working on now:**\n\n* Better content management - we don’t have a great blog or content schedule. This is probably killing us in sales. \n\n* We’re working on rebranding our name. Multiple marketers said our name sucks, and we need something to captures our ultimate goal more precisely. \n\n* I’m slowly allowing myself to trust the management I’ve put in place and focus on the big picture as they are doing a good job with the day to day. - This took a lot of hesitation before I could give up a lot of power, now, I couldn’t be happier. \n","name":"t3_4br0z8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-24 11:25:42","week":12}

{"id":"4bsq5w","author":"stevenjhepburn","body":"I engaged a designer from Canada to create an 'infomap' of the New Hampshire 4000 Footer mountains.  Initially I was only interested in getting it printed for myself, however when I saw how good it came out, my entrepreneurial hat came out and I figured let's see if we can do something further with it.\n\nIn collaboration with my designer, Jesse, we have done a little bit of marketing on:\n\n* [His website](http://jessefletchercreative.com/product/4000-footers-map-print/)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/infomapic/)\n* Reddit\n\nI have also been in touch with local bookstores in New Hampshire and have 2 that are interested in stocking it, and will have a sales table at the AMC 4000 Footer Club Awards Night!\n\nMy agreement with Jesse has been very informal so far - I paid him for the initial design work (and requested the copyright), we have both been promoting the product, his website hosts the online shop, and I arrange the printing and distribution.  Payments have been made to his PayPal account, he has kept his share of the profit, and sent the balance to me for printing, postage and my share of the profit. We have sold 16 maps @ $40 each.\n\nNow we have reached a stage where I think we have to formalize things a bit more.  I am investing some more money up front to have 3 maps professionally mounted for display in each store, and on the awards night.  Jesse is designing some promotional material to be displayed alongside the maps, which I will have mounted. I have also just placed an order for 50 more maps that required payment up front.  \n\nI mentioned up top that Jesse is based in Canada.  He currently runs his own design business.  I am based in the US, and have no business.  I am keen to continue collaborating with Jesse on a 50/50 basis, not only for the current NH map, but also on other mountain groupings using the same style.\n\nSo, my questions to you r/entrepreneur:\n\n1) What is the simplest way to set up something more formal between Jesse and I to keep everything nice and clean?\n\n2) How else would you suggest we continue to build demand for this product?\n\n3) Have you had experience with a low volume product and listing it on Amazon?  I know a UPC code is required which costs a couple of hundred dollars.  At what point would that be considered a viable channel?","name":"t3_4bsq5w","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-24 19:00:54","week":12}

{"id":"4bst82","author":"jrline1988","body":"I'm operating a small Feed Mill in Ohio. It's been in business since 1935, my family has owned it since 1978 and over the last few years the store has begun to struggle. I'd really hate to close a business that has been operating for over 80 years in our community. However you can now get dog and cat food almost everywhere. The small dairy and hog farms no longer operate, its all big corporate farms now. While we used to move hundreds of tons of horse and cattle feed a year we now do less than 20. We also sell typical feed mill products like grass seed, mulch, topsoil, fertilizer, salt products, wood pellets, straw and all forms of small animal feed. But with Menards, Lowes, Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meijer, etc selling all of that and mulch (even gas stations sell bagged mulch now) its really hurt our business. Most of them can afford to sell at bare bottom prices too because they are buying such large quanities. We have our loyal customers buying dog food and bird seed but that's about it now. We have advertised quite a bit and it helped but its not big numbers. I've considered mixing our own high end critter mix (raw peanuts, shelled corn, sunflower seeds, pumkpkin seeds etc) to sell in the store and we want to get on eBay/Amazon. I'm thinking if we can make a high quality mix for the right price and sell online we can supplement our small in store sales. Depending how strong online sales are I think I could try to sell the critter mix to the Menards and Lowes of the world to sell in their stores. That way while competing with them I could make some money off of them at the same time. I'm wondering if anyone has been involved in a business like this and what worked or didn't for them. I know its a unique business so i don't expect a lot of response. If anyone has been in any feed mill type stores in areas where they are doing well I would love to hear what you noticed about that place.

{"id":"4buavw","author":"Whale_Whale_Whale","body":"Here's why you should care as of 3/23/2016 MU $10.65:\n1. MU's Forward Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 7.42\nThis means that within roughly 7.4 earnings periods based on future projections, Micron's current price of $10.65 will have 'earned' its keep. Other tech companies have MUCH more EXPENSIVE valuations (see: Amazon, Though it has a steady growth rate, AMZN has a P/E of 455.9!)\n\n2. USE The PEG ratio. It's used to determine a stock's value while taking the earnings growth into account. Per investopedia, The PEG ratio is used to evaluate stocks to determine whether or not the stock is under-priced. Therefore, a PEG ratio less than 1 is more desirable. Here, MU's PEG ratio is 0.65...\nFrom a value investor's prospective, and with long term growth in mind, THAT is a huge plus.\n\nRead more: Price/Earnings To Growth (PEG Ratio) Definition | Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp#ixzz43lumqDV5)\n\n2. MU's Price-to-Book Ratio P/B is 0.96\nThis means that for every 96 cents per dollar you invest, you would receive $1's worth of assets from company's books should the firm be liquidated. That's a 4.17% potential gain right there. \n\nThere are many other points to make about this stock.

I've narrowed my choices down to the two cards above (Amazon Visa rewards, Upromise). I know I could apply for a secured card but I figured might as well try to get a rewards card. Right now im working part time bringing in about 200 after taxes biweekly, soon to be 300 biweekly. So far i've been using a Navy Federal debit card for about 2 years, never overdrew, etc. My parents are okay with cosigning.

My only purchases would be Amazon (thank the lord for dank free shipping), Newegg, gas, and occassional things like Mcdonalds and stops at my local drugstores. No intention to spend any more than 300 a month, and I intend to pay my balances on time because who would want to pay interest. Not really interested in rotating catagories. So my questions are:\n\nAre there any other cards without fees that would be good for my usage?\n\nWould it be a good or bad thing for my parents to cosign?\n\nWith the Upromise card I would have to buy things through a Upromise portal/site, has anyone here had any issues with that?\n\nWhich of my two cards do you reckon would be easiest to get accepted for?\n\nThank you","name":"t3_4bvirp","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-25 07:25:31","week":12}

{"id":"4bwe4q","author":"thegreatbuttholio","body":"Not sure if this is even in the right place, but I really need advice, and the title is vaguely self-explanatory, but I should give some background; I'm a college student. I'm in my third year of a two year associates degree, I have over 200 credits, all towards being a commercial pilot. My parents have invested over $50k in my education, and I could finish up by October and get the associates and my licenses I need. I can then transfer to a four-year university and have a bachelors in business management by the end of next year (I have been taking a TON of business classes since I started, all higher level).\n\nThe catch is, I don't really know if I want to be a pilot for a living. As a kid, I loved flying for travel reasons, and even when I started the program at the college I really enjoyed it. But as the material and expectations rose as I got further into the degree, I lost interest, and actually dread flying. Not because it's scary, but because its so stressful. I walk away from a two-hour long training flight (of which I have three a week) and I feel like I could sleep for hours--it is that draining.\n\nBusiness, however, was fun as a kid, and still is. It has always come naturally to me. As a kid I would set up lemonade stands down the street and would sometimes sit on the corner of a street where I knew there would be a garage sale taking place in order to get more sales. I've since graduated from lemonade to buying and selling on eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, and other channels. I've been selling on these sites for around three years now, and I've accumulated quite a bit of capital/inventory (at least $50k) just buying and selling in my spare time. I started out with a $100 loan from my parents, that doubled, doubled again, doubled again, and it just went. I got good really fast at selling everything from power saws to pallets of cellphones. This month I'm set to make about $15,000 after putting aside some $ for taxes.\n\nWhy does any of this information matter? It doesn't really, but it might help you redditors give me advice as to whether I should discontinue my flight major and spend all of my time running a real business. I am thinking of finishing up the degrees then not pursuing the flight thing as a career. I'd rather be in business.. This information can also sort of help with this next part:\n\nI currently don't have a registered business name, LLC, anything. I have effectively no credit (because all of my purchases are done online with a debit card usually, and I have no other documented income). If I get sued, I'm screwed. (that rhymes, ha!) You get the idea.\n\nHow would I go about setting up all the necessary things to 'start' a business? I've only filed taxes this last year for a part-time job I had for about three months (I'd much rather do this for a living). Taxes are important, and as a self-proprietorship I believe I have to file quarterly in Oregon? Where do I even start? So many purchases are in person in cash, so many are hard to keep track of.\n\nShould I apply for a registered business name and/or LLC for liability reasons? Will this help me in the long-term or make things more difficult?\n\nIf I turn this into an LLC, does that mean I can file annually or bi-annually? Or would it still be quarterly?\n\n[edit1] Also, health insurance? Lack of benefits?.. Just thought of that too.\n\nAny help or ideas would be greatly appreciated!","name":"t3_4bwe4q","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-25 14:14:13","week":12}

{"id":"4bz1bh","author":"felixfff","body":"Not knocking [the other guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4bxgqk/i_quit_my_job_to_start_a_spice_blend_company_and/) at all - in fact, I admire the directness and the success his story and the promotion. Bravo, /u/DjOverEZ - its always good to see someone with a passion taking the plunge.\n\nBut in the same vein - I figured I'd share the story of and answer any questions about my slightly more established business - the [Good Morning Pill](http://goodmorningpill.com). \n\nOur backstory - \n\nIn 2011, I was a senior in college and had been selling homemade ski wax on Amazon (utilizing FBA) for the past couple of years. That winter (2011-2012) was my best year ever for the ski wax - I literally couldn't keep up with demand on Amazon. Those were the good old Wild West days of Amazon/FBA - and the success of my little ski wax co made me believe in the concept of \"if you build [list] it, they [buyers] will come.\" \n\nSo I bounced an idea off of a college buddy - I wanted to sell an energy pill on Amazon. (In college, I rotated between energy drinks, coffee, and plain caffeine pills, and kind of wanted a hybrid of all 3). He thought it sounded good enough - so I put the wheels in motion. I cold-emailed the first 5 or 7 supplement companies that came up on searches for \"private label supplement manufacturing\" or something similar. Eventually, I got an email back from a company that was willing to work with me and my $4,000 first order.\n\nSo the original [Good Morning Pill](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051BRR4A) was born, with the intention of providing an energy drink-like product at a much cheaper price.\n\nSales were pretty good right off the bat - as I said, these were the good old (less competitive) Amazon days when you could list a product and be ranked on page 1 instantly without any sales-boost shenanigans. The product sold well, and about a year or so after the initial launch, we came out with the [GMP Turbo](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009N9A5S6) - a stronger version of the original product (200mg caffeine in Turbo vs. 130mg caffeine in Original). \n\nFast forward to February 2014 and I thought I was going to get rich off of this. Sales seemed to be on a hockey-stick trajectory. The net payments from Amazon that month were larger than my (pretty well paying) job - even after COGS and other costs, my net income from the side business rivaled my real job. I had dreams of expanding the product line... getting into brick and mortar stores... quitting my dayjob... and much more. I was rapidly running out of product and placed larger orders than ever before.\n\nAround the same time, we launched our 3rd product - the [GMP Liquicaff](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AK7W4XI). It was a more unique and novel product than our first two - it's the first liquid-filled caffeine pill (at least that i've ever seen), and instead of having an energy drink-like formula (caffeine and b-vitamins), it had a formula that was more herbal and nootropic in nature. I thought it was going to a big hit.\n\nI ended up going out of stock of the first two successful products in May 2014, only very briefly, but the business never really recovered once the listings were back up. It's not clear whether Amazon heavily penalized the listings for going out of stock, or if lots of other competitors just hit the market at the same, but our ranking within amazon search results plummeted. We went from being near the top of the page 1 for \"energy pill\" \"energy supplement\" and similar terms, to being deep on page 2 or page 3. \n\nSo since then, I've had to learn how to deal with a stagnating/contracting business - giving away inventory to avoid literally throwing it away; struggling to maintain market share; trying to figure out how to revitalize the business. I've had moderate success using various review/sales boost services to gain new customers and make the product more attractive to the average Amazon buyer. Probably the best (and 100% lucky) thing that happened was Amazon let us do Lightning Deals last holidays season - we sold hundreds of products we otherwise wouldn't have, and gained dozens to hundreds of repeat customers. (I'm happy to talk more about that if anyone is interested in the details). \n\nSo that's enough of a wall of text for now - the spice guy had just inspired me to share my story of starting out, ramping up, the highs, and the lows. I'm happy to answer any questions about supplement businesses, selling on Amazon (including FBA and lighting deals), dealing with right-sizing a business, or anything else that interests you. \n\nAnd since I'd be dumb not to go through with the full self promotion at this point - \"REDDIT33\" will get you 33% off your first order of [any of our products at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Morning-Pill/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_9036722011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9036722011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=The+Good+Morning+Pill). We also have samples on our website (http://goodmorningpill.com) - I can't drop the price below the current $3/$4/$5 but I'll send double the stated amount.

I  feel like I've gotten to the point with my finances where all of my investments are fractured and I'd love some help trying to streamline everything.

{"id":"4c1mw2","author":"pooramericanboy","body":"Hey Reddit, so I am Industrial and Systems Engineering student, but I also have a passion for home/life automation. I've been working on building a company for a while now, and wanted to get some feedback from you guys to see if the market has any interest. So, to answer some questions:\n\nI would be selling the service of converting your home into a \"smart\" home. There are many ways the customer can achieve this. They can choose from a large list of products including Philips hue lights, WeMo switches and outlets, wifi enabled appliances, heaters, humidifiers, etc, as well as smart locks, thermostats, security cameras, and home audio equipment. These can all be tied together with nfc tags, your phone, and/or Amazon Echo. The customer can choose a package that includes some of these products, and my company will provide the products, install them, integrate them together, and provide technical support for the future (if needed). \n\nI've had an interest in home/life automation for a long time. I love to integrate nfc tags and voice activation into my life to make mundane tasks easier, and just to make some things look more flashy and cool. This type of technology is something that can really make a friend/guest/family member say \"Wow, that's so cool!\" when they enter your home. It makes you feel like we're really starting to live in the future we all imagined. My main motivation is to make peoples lives easier, more enjoyable, and to show them what our technology can really do.\n\nI'm fairly early into this startup. I've only been working on the idea for a few months, so I'm very open to criticism and new ideas. Because of this, I don't really have any concrete 6-1-5 plans for the future, as this is fairly new to me. \n\nOverall, i'd really appreciate if you guys could give some feedback on the idea. Would you want the service/how much would you pay? Do you think it would have to be directed towards people with more disposable income? Do you think there's a market for it? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to listen!\n","name":"t3_4c1mw2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-26 16:47:36","week":12}

I chose that one because my spending habits fit the cash back profile pretty well.\n\nWith Amazon Prime, I'm not worried about buying little necessities from Amazon, since the shipping costs aren't a factor. So most of the things I need I can order from Amazon.That is 3% cash back.\n\nI eat out for nearly every meal. That is 2% cash back from restaurants. I also get 2% cash back from gas stations.\n\nEverything else is 1% cash back, for me that is mostly bills like internet, electricity, water, phone, etc.\n\nIt was working out pretty well for me but they just notified me of a change in the way the account works and I'm not sure how exactly it is going to affect me.\n\nBefore, it had a hard $2000 credit limit. What I would do is use it for everything, and every time the utilization got over $150, I'd pay it back down to $50. That way they had something to bill me on every month, which I would pay in full after receiving the bill. It would also keep the utilization under 10% for when they reported to the credit agencies, so as not to hurt my score too much. In this scenario the $2000 credit limit really only limited me from making single purchases over $2000.\n\nNow they are changing to what they are calling a revolving credit access line. From what I think I understand, they basically give me a soft limit of $2000 per month, with any remaining being tacked on to the next month. I spend less than $2000 a month on the card, so in theory that credit access line should only increase for me from month-to-month.\n\nI guess the main thing I'm worried about is how this affects the credit utilization they are going to report.

Unfortunately these past 2 years have left me with a very large inventory of books that are worth $0.01 on Amazon and $4.00 on eBay. I really hate throwing out, or even recycling, perfectly good books. They are good books, just old editions that are no longer used. Yes, I know, I am weird. What can I do with such books? Is there anywhere that I can donate them to use in 3rd world countries or something to make them useful again? I have about 200 right now.

Most items sold within the first 3 days and I don't see that any of them were transferred to another warehouse. \nI also selected for Amazon to prepare a few of my items (I labeled them all but didn't have poly bags for 6 items that required them). Where do I see that fee?  According to the chart on seller central, I should have paid $0.50 per item for that as well. I can't find any of these fees.","name":"t1_d17aiws","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-21 01:17:16","week":12}

It is usually cheaper on eBay due to the lightweight nature of the item, so you will not have to pay much if you ship it yourself.\n\nThat's a good point so I checked. It looks like the fees for a lightweight video game via FBA is $2.91 + 15% of total sale price: $1.35 closing fee + $1.06 pick&amp;pack + $0.50 weight handling + 15% referral fee. On a game sold for $10 that's $5.59 after fees.\n\nThrough eBay with a store and TRS discount, we're looking at costs of (total sale * 10.1% for eBay/PayPal fees) + $0.30 paypal fee + $2.60 + cost of packing (padded envelopes are about $0.15/piece). In that case for a $10 game profit margin is $5.94, assuming zero costs to pack it up.\n\nHonestly that's very similar. That extra $0.30 in fees reduces my workload immensely, accesses a much larger customer base, and is probably made up through the higher selling prices on Amazon anyway.","name":"t1_d17fdwi","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-21 03:35:20","week":12}

Less competition + lower supply = a higher price you can sell an item for IF you get it in first. Flippers will also have to stay on top of their databases and update regularly as the market will be much more dynamic. The item that showed as non-restricted this morning could be by the time you list it tomorrow if other sellers listed it the same day.\n\nIt will kill the business models of a lot of large scale sellers who send all their ash and trash to the Amazon warehouses and hope that someone wants to buy their beat-up 200 copies of \"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell\" or \"50 Shades of Gray\" that they purchased from a landfill recycling company for a penny in the hopes they can flip them FBA for $3.99 each. Or the sellers that ship the 1973 edition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica (missing volume 19, in Acceptable condition) to the warehouse, gambling that someone, somewhere, will want to buy it.\n\nIt will also probably drastically thin out the ranks of sourcers who just bought their PDA and scanner and haunt the thrift shops and library sales.

I love being able to have the app up on my Nexus Player or casting in my living room or bedrooms for cleaning, lounging and getting ready in the morning/evening.\n\nYouTube red is also bundled in with the subscription which is AWWWWWESOMMMMMME.

{"id":"d1803ea","author":"aronk","body":"I think the reason is that it's very tough to 'start' on Amazon. Most people don't have the ability to lay down the necessary capital to continually drive their Amazon listing to have a good seller rank consistently, because when you run out of inventory, your ranking starts to dip. And of course, this doesn't even take into account a few missteps that might lead to a few poor reviews, maybe some returns, maybe some bad customer service, etc, that could all lead to a loss in your standing on Amazon. \n\nFor example, say you want to launch a product that sells for $20 on Amazon that's a standard size (so that you don't need to pay oversize fees), and you're using FBA. And say that your landed cost of that product, manufactured overseas, is around $4. The FBA fees are around $7. You also have to ship to Amazon, albeit at super discounted rates, but that adds about $0.30 to your cost, per product you send. So now, you're looking at a profit of around $8.70/unit. Pretty good, right? Well, here's the problem. \n\nYou're starting from scratch, and your listing won't rank anywhere close to where it needs to in order to make a decent amount of sales. Let's say that we believe that 10 sales a day is 'decent'. That means that we need atleast 300 units to cover about a month's supply. But, since we're sourcing overseas, you can expect lead times for manufacturing and ocean freight (since air freight is stupid expensive and will basically ruin any margin for this low cost item) to be about 60 days. 2 months. Also, if you want your cost to actually be around $4 for this $20 MSRP item, you'd need to be buying in larger quantities than 300 at a time. At the very least, you'd want to cover atleast 2 months worth of inventory, since your lead times for new inventory is also 2 months. Why, you ask? Well, you don't want to go out of stock when you're seller rank is increasing, because the lower your seller rank for the product, the closer you are to the first page, which means you're making more sales. But, if you're out of stock, you start dropping down the pages again, since you're not selling anything. So being out of stock hurts, and you don't want that. \n\nSo this means that, in this theoretical situation, you want, at the very least, 600 units if you anticipate 300 sales per month. And let's assume you can get the $4 landed cost even at the low MOQ of 600 units from your manufacturer. So, you need to spend (600 x 4) = $2400 on your initial batch of 600 units to get them to you. Then you need to label each unit for FBA, which adds a little bit of cost, but let's ignore that. Now you send the 600 units to Amazon. You're not going to have sales skyrocket immediately, and you do need to put in work to be able to get some reviews and exposure to your product on your listing. So maybe you start giving away some of your products at heavily discounted prices so that you can start getting some reviews. Let's say you give away 50 units at cost, $4, to get some reviews. Well, sure, you recovered the cost of your unit, but you still had to pay to ship out the product to that potential reviewer, which is more money you're putting in. Say that is costs about $5 to ship your item. 50 x 5 = $250 cost for some initial reviews. You're now down to a total of 550 units at Amazon's warehouse. \n\nHere's how this breaks down: \n\n60 days of inventory cost (600 units): $2400\n\n50 review units cost: $250\n\nProfit on remaining 550 units: $4785\n\nNow here's the problem. You don't want to run out of inventory, and you know it takes 60 days to get to you. You also know you're going to run out of your existing inventory in less than 60 days now, since your sales rank is getting better. You also need the cash generated from the sales in order to place that new order from your manufacturer, so you HAVE to wait for sales to occur on Amazon. And that means that you're going to have to run out of inventory at some point, which will hurt your seller rank again.\n\nBasically, it's a cash flow issue for a lot of people. If you're part of a company that already has capital on-hand to finance a larger order initially, and can spend cash on getting reviews and letting the listing build, then Amazon is a great channel. But the difference is that most people are individuals working a job and making decent money, but not enough to drop $5-10K on inventory in one go, especially on an unproven product. \n\nIf you want to play at Amazon, there is opportunity, just like there is everywhere. What people don't understand is that it's not something that will make you rich overnight, just like anything else, UNLESS you already have a lot of investable capital and the ability to spend money up front to get sales in the future. \n\n**TL;DR: Amazon isn't as simple as you're making it out to be, even if you have a profitable product. It's resource intensive up-front, which is why I think more people don't get into it.**","name":"t1_d1803ea","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-21 17:41:39","week":12}

{"id":"d182gew","author":"teamboomerang","body":"Agree with this.  They recently launched the inventory dashboard, and two of the most prominent sections were FBA inventory age and Manage Excess Inventory.  Sure....Amazon wants a one of everything store, but they know that some things will only sell one per year of some items, so it doesn't make much sense to have 10 of those items.  They want no more than a 90 day supply. \n\nNow, they're being rather passive-aggressive in telling us, I'll agree with that.  First they implemented long term storage fees, but that wasn't enough for some people.  They said if you created a removal order before LTS fees were implemented, you couldn't send more of those ASINs in for a period of time.  Then they implemented the inventory dashboard, and didn't really tell anyone about that. To me, the writing is on the wall--clean up your crap or get out because if pick a random book is only selling 1 per month, there is no reason for them to stock 300 of them.  \n\nI think they will eventually do this with PL items/new items as well by category/sub category.  Meat claws sell this many per month, and once we have so many, too bad so sad. \n\nI do agree they need to let people know in their app so sellers can make informed decisions before they purchase products to sell, and it was shitty of them to just spring this on us, but it's their sand box, so they get to make the rules.  \n\nI think it's also possible that this is just a software glitch that will go away in a few days, or it's a temporary thing they are trying out, but I kind of doubt that it's temporary.  My takeaway from that is to go into your inventory and either remove stuff that just isn't moving or have it disposed of, or improve the listings or verify you are competitive on price so it moves soon.  If it is temporary and it's because the warehouses are full, the faster everyone does that, the faster it will be resolved.  But really, I think this is Amazon's way of telling people they want them to run a leaner business and move towards just in time inventory with no more than a 90-day supply in their warehouses.","name":"t1_d182gew","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-21 18:36:19","week":12}

{"id":"d18av1y","author":"np20412","body":"Sorry - depends what they want to do for the power steering. Did they say what it was? Probably one of two things - either a power steering fluid flush (probably unnecessary at 100k) or top off if the fluid level is low. If it's just low, you can buy the fluid yourself and top it off. If it's a flush, you have some time before you need to do this, but even this is not a difficult job. You just have to find the drain plug, remove it, and refill the reservoir. \n\nUnless your engine is misfiring, has a very rough time starting or on idle, is drastically consuming fuel at a higher rate, or has compromised acceleration, you really don't need to do the spark plugs just yet. Modern plugs are designed to go for more than 100k miles. \n\nDo the brake fluid flush, just to ensure your stopping system is at optimal performance. If there is one thing you don't want to compromise on, it's your ability to stop or steer your vehicle. \n\nfor the other parts, you can either shop around at the big box stores (pep boys, autozone, etc.) or you try Amazon for cheaper alternatives. Just be wary with the knock off stuff on amazon, some of it is very low quality and you'll just have to replace again sooner. \n\nYou can google around for these things specific to a S80 and you'll probably find youtube videos for most.

{"id":"d18bgl3","author":"Zifnab25","body":"&gt; The move towards being cashless has been a consistent failure in terms of making our money more secure.\n\nIs the frequency of faked checks more or less common than the frequency of spoofed magnetic strips?  How about the frequency of hacked microchips?  Similarly, is the volume of money lost or stolen higher using more modern techniques?\n\n&gt; The move towards being cashless isn't about helping consumers (that's an occasional benefit as we've seen in Africa ). It's mostly been driven by companies hoping to gain market share and add transaction fees or gov'ts looking to track the movements of all our taxable income.\n\nI have little doubt that firms hope to generate profit by moving to a cashless system.  I also have little doubt that firms would try to turn a profit in a pure-cash system.  I've seen enough CoinStar machines in grocery stores to know cash doesn't make us immune to profiteering.\n\nBut when you say \"the move toward cashless\", you have to ask \"whose move?\"\n\nGenerally speaking, people aren't going to prefer a more-expensive technology.  Merchants need consumers to adopt electronic payments, and one way to do this is to pass on the cost-savings to the consumer.  Specs, my local liquor store chain, encourages customers to use debt cards over credit cards by offering product discounts when the store isn't subject to a credit card transaction fee.  Amazon offers a service that can only be accessed with credit or debt cards, but it offers rapid free delivery of goods and services.  Bitcoin enthusiasts have pressured merchants into finding a way to accept bitcoins in lieu of cash or traditional credit.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it appears that consumers are leading the charge.  It's *their* move, with a number of payment options to choose from.\n\nWhat you paint as a conspiracy by merchants, I see as technology filtering through the hands of early-adopters and into the mainstream based on the appreciation in the free market.","name":"t1_d18bgl3","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-03-21 21:57:23","week":12}

Amazon is VERY particular about how stuff is sold used though. You can sell stuff without boxes or instructions, but it has to come with everything described in the listing. So if you're selling a DVD/VHS combo that originally came with a remote and component cables, that's what you have to sell yours with. If you don't a buyer can open a claim and Amazon might refund their money and let them keep the stuff.\n\nI wouldn't be too worried about eBay.

If you buy a lot of groceries, the AMEX cards are good (either Blue Cash or Blue Cash Preferred if you buy a LOT of groceries/gas).\n\nIf you like revolving 5% categories, check out Discover It or Chase Freedom. Both offer 5% on Amazon/Online Shopping during the holidays, so I love using my card for that.\n\nIf you want a card for international travel, the Capital One Quicksilver is a nice no-fee one and gives 1.5% on all purchases. Barclays Arrival+ or Chase Sapphire are good fee ones, but you have to spend a lot to make the fees worth it over the Quicksilver. The sign-up bonus of paid cards is generally really good though, and the first year is often free. Could be worth it.\n\nIf you want a simple one for spending in the US, the Citi Double Cash is pretty good for having 2% cash back on all purchases after paying your bills on time. I think this one requires a better credit score than any of the other mentioned cards here. It comes with no sign up bonus, afaik.\n\nWhy not convert your BoA card to the rewards one? It has pretty good rewards. 1% everywhere, 2% on groceries, 3% on gas.

Then reach out to companies and offer to review their stuff. The best part is that you can also earn affiliate income by linking to the products on Amazon using an affiliate link.

Maybe more of an explanation of the research you've done and what you were considering paying would have helped. But sometimes, people just don't like a thread because it sounds like a \"please do my work for me\" thread. Not much you can do about that. I don't see anything wrong with it though.\n\nYour other thread was extremely vague, and bordered on 'bad advice' as a couple people in the thread mentioned. Maybe explicitly calling out the item that this worked for you on, and then quickly mentioning the types it wouldn't (i.e. selling a video game console without a power adapter on Amazon would be pretty awful) would make it a more popular post. Also, complaining about people downvoting right away (we seem to have some enemies from other subs that downvote you to 0 or -1 pretty immediately, so it's nothing to fret about) also gains some ill-will from people, and they'll downvote you even more, just to see you squirm.\n\nI honestly don't believe that people go around downvoting anything that doesn't spoon feed them.

Makes me question a product if so many reviews end with \"got this product at a discount/for free in exchange for a review.\"  Wondered if I even got something for free, do they police and enforce that you leave a review? \n\n\nAnyways, I was never curious enough to ask sellers (as suggested in the comments) or look be part of some freebies club. For 4+ years I've bought stuff from Amazon and never got anything, until 3 weeks ago. I got an email from a company offering some microfiber towels for $1.97($20 regularly). I had bought a previous product from this company about 9 months ago that I loved, yet didn't leave a review. The offer was in exchange for my review as it was a \"new\" product. Wary, I went for the offer. I got the towels and they were nice, specially for the price. Left a review, didn't make a mention I got it at a discount either. Another thing I always wondered if that was required, but it was never required by Amazon or the seller as far as I can tell. I think it's just a courtesy from the reviewer to disclose that information. Last week, I got another offer from the same company for the same product I got 9 months ago. Not for a review, but because I guess that color didn't sell well. I went for it. \n\n\nJust two days ago I got a card in the mail from another company I had previously purchased some vitamins from. Card was an offer for a free bottle for my review. Did the form online last night, so I haven't received it yet. I don't know if the prior caused this one, or a it's coincidence, but it could be I've got my foot in the door for freebies, or it's all totally random and varies by seller/vendor.

I live near a lot of thrift stores, Bargain Hunt, Big Lots, etc, I feel like there's opportunity.  But I don't really know how to intelligently factor in shipping when I'm standing in the store looking at a possibility.\n\nFor example: Last night I found a bunch of vacuum filters on clearance at Walmart for $1 each.  I checked them with the Amazon Seller app (basic, not pro) and they list at $11 new.  I can see in the app where I can enter shipping cost, but I don't know how to \"guess\" what it should be.  They only weight half a pound but are fairly large.  How would you on-the-spot estimate with some accuracy a shipping cost if you FBM?  I *assume* FBA becomes more logical in bulk?

{"id":"d1b4zus","author":"Corporate666","body":"You didn't ask for related advice so forgive me if this is unwanted, but....\n\nBe careful about this business idea.  I buy some stuff from China that I use in my manufacturing business.  Over the years I've started importing and selling some parts too.  There are some serious considerations to keep in mind about this type of business.\n\n1) There are incredibly low barriers to entry.  Anyone can go on Alibaba/MadeInChina and find the same parts and import them.  Unless you have deep pockets and can buy in bulk and/or have the sway to negotiate exclusive deals (virtually impossible to do), then you aren't really adding any value - and there will always be someone else whose willing to make less money than you that will import and undercut you on price.\n\n2) I sell a lot of product on Amazon and eBay.  If you are not the low priced seller, you get virtually no sales.  I can tell when someone has undercut us on price because 95% of our sales disappear overnight.  I go into eBay and adjust our price so we're the low price supplier, and it's like turning a light switch back on.  It's all or nothing.  Amazon/eBay make it easy to reach a huge audience with little work - but the downside to that is anyone else can do it too.\n\n3) There are software programs (like TeraPeak and others) that let you analyze eBay/Amazon.  You can research categories, sales, volume, pricing.  You can find out what the top selling products are in any category, what the margins are, who is selling the most, etc.  It sounds like a gold mine of data, until you realize ten thousand other guys are doing it too and all getting the same data.  I was shocked when I started listing a little electronic accessory for one of my products on eBay/Amazon.  I bought them for $3 (shipped to my door) and only one other competitor was there and selling them for $26.  I set my price at $19.99 and I would sell a few hundred a month.  Within a few months, 6 or 7 other people jumped in and now the eBay price is $3.99 shipped.  Take out eBay fees and first class mailing costs and the person selling them is making literally pennies and from their listings (and because I know the Chinese manufacturer and I asked them), the other seller bought a bulk order of several thousand of the parts and got them for $2.50 delivered to him.  It's a lot of work to pack and ship an item and deal with loss, warranty claims and theft just to make $0.25 per unit.\n\n4) When Chinese sellers notice they are selling a lot of product to you, they will go and list it themselves on eBay.  People are getting more stuff shipped direct from China, and China subsidizes shipping costs - so you'll never be able to compete with the price.  Making your competitive advantage solely that you can deliver quickly.\n\n5) Aliexpress and other sites allow consumers to buy direct from China, skipping the middle man (you) entirely.  That is growing fast.\n\n\nIncome is earned based on value.  If your sole value is that you happened to be the guy that found the product in China and bought some - then you will get eaten alive in short order by competition.  There will always be some guy living in a trailer in Wyoming who has overhead costs you can never hope to match.  And there will be a huge eBay seller moving 10,000 items per week that has buying power you will never be able to match.  \n\nI am not trying to shit on your idea - just letting you know that you are venturing down a very difficult road.  My advice is that you MUST find a way to add additional value.  Get a customized version of the Chinese product made for you with some additional feature or something.  Get them to agree (in writing) that it will be your exclusive.  This will cost more - you will need to pay an up-front engineering cost and place a minimum order, but then you have a selling point you can use to add value and command a higher price.  \n\n","name":"t1_d1b4zus","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-24 00:13:01","week":12}

{"id":"d1bddk7","author":"southpaw303","body":"Wall of text incoming: \n\nIn July 2014 I had to do this with fairly short notice (1 month). My apartment is small, but through online shopping/bargain hunting/bed bath and beyond coupons I was able to completely furnish and decorate a 1 bedroom apartment for under $2500 (with all new items- bed, bedframe, headboard, nightstands, sofa, coffee table, rug, side table, tv stand, all kitchen stuff, etc etc).\n\nI chose to purchase new items for a variety of reasons. If you're less interested in buying new, skip the rest of my post and listen to the people saying estate sales (be wary of Craigslist)! \n\nI wanted to be able to have cohesive decor in my apartment, and I wanted things I knew would last a long time or have good return policies/customer service. I think Costco is a good start for you, but they might not have the selection you desire-- if you're less picky than me, they're probably perfect for you. FWIW, all the stuff I have from IKEA is their solid wood variety (not particleboard). In my last home I had a dresser from them for 7 years, still looked new, functioned perfectly and was sturdy AF after 4 moves. I routinely stand on my TV stand and Nightstand (to reach the damn smoke detectors... GOD DAMNIT, I LIKE TO PAN SEAR/BAKE MY STEAKS) and at 250lbs, I'm not small.\n\nI suggest making a simple Excel file with a list of all the things you're going to need, then giving yourself a budget for each item (perhaps a range of what you'd be comfortable spending) and just start searching. It's a time/research game. \n\n\nHopefully it's not looked frowned upon here, but these are where I found the best deals after searching like crazy ($2500 was 25% of my savings... I had to make every penny count)\n\nBed: Amazon has an amazing selection for mattresses. I got a 14\" Memory foam that has done wonders for my back and sleep for $300. (Don't forget Amazon prime!) \n\nBed Frame: google smartbase platform frame-- this style of frame can be used with any mattress (and no box spring) and it is sturdy and folds up. Will attach to many headboard styles, or you can just go without.\n\nTables: IKEA really is your friend if you have one locally. Does Costco have tables? They probably have a great option too, but I just don't know. \n\nSofa: Appliances Connection&lt;-- weird, right? When I was searching, they had killer prices (sometimes $300+ less!) than local competitors for furniture. I was floored (free shipping too).\n\nFor small kitchen appliances, pots and pans: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (only with a 20% coupon off) or Wayfair (daily deals is your friend-- I got a rug, coffee table and some random laundry stuff from them). \n\nFor decor and \"accessories\" (plates, silverware, towels, bath rug, stuff like that) I went to Home Goods/Marshall's/TJ Maxx-- I was able to match everything to my 'style' and it was really cheap. I still managed to get crazy soft Polo towels.\n\n1 big thing not to forget to budget: all the crap you don't think about until you need it-- cleaning supplies, plunger/toilet brush, mop, vacuum, laundry basket, lights, storage, iron/board, etc.","name":"t1_d1bddk7","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-24 04:27:31","week":12}

Who knows without trying, right?\n\nIt's 6 months of finance with $149 purchase, 12 months with $599, 24 months with \"special\" purchases.\n\n**You must pay at least the minimum payment every month.** Just because it's zero interest for the promotional period doesn't mean you don't have a payment.\n\nIf you miss or are late for a payment, the promotional period may end. **You may be subject to retroactive interest.** What this means is you'll pay interest on the initial (ei entire) balance, not at what it was at the end of the promotional period.\n\nIf you don't pay off the entire balance by the end of the promotional period, you'll pay **retroactive interest** on the entire purchase. \n\nWhat you should do it divide the purchase by 2 months less than the promotional period and pay that amount monthly.\n\nFor example, if your purchase is $600 and your financing is 12 months, you should be paying $50 monthly to pay it off in those 12 months. But what happens if you're short on money 1 month? Or you're sick and miss some days of work? \n\nIt's better to pay $60 monthly to pay off the $600 in 10 months. That way if you're short 1 month, you can probably still afford the minimum payment. Then, the month after, you won't be so far behind. Plus, that's only an extra $10 a month.

{"id":"d1cfbzi","author":"poorwhitecash","body":"When selling on Amazon, especially Amazon FBA, it is important to know the sales rank of an item. The sales rank tells you how well an item has sold in the past(for the most part). This is a chart of the top 1%, 5%, and 15% sales rank for each category. It helps you determine how well stuff sells basically. The lower the sales rank, the better an item sells. Here's an example:\n\nYou pick up a book at a thrift store for $1.99. You find on Amazon that it sells for $24.99. Awesome right? Not necessarily. You check the sales rank of the book and it is 25,972,075. This essentially means that it will probably take a long time to sell this book. Because as the chart shows you, it is nowhere near the top 15% in the books category. \n\nThere are a ton of the things to factor in when deciding on whether to sell a product. Sales rank, competition, storage fees, shipping costs, etc. As you do it and study more, it will become much easier. \n\nBtw...

{"id":"d1cn68u","author":"timix","body":"Time to step back a bit.\n\n1. Business in general. Starting a business is not easy or cheap. Shopify will charge you an amount each month just to run the shop, eBay would take a percentage as fees, your payment processor (Paypal or otherwise) will take a cut to move money around. That's before you start looking at the cost of stock (you'll be buying these watches from someone else before you can sell them to anyone), marketing (how are you going to find customers?), running the business (what're your tax obligations? Know a good small business accountant? What does it cost to register a business where you are?). These things are all time and money before you sell a single item.\n\n2. Watches. You can get a cheap watch anywhere - what will be special about your shop? Do you offer fast shipping, free shipping, good recommendations for watches, can you offer them particularly cheaply? What's your unique selling point, why would someone buy one off you instead of another shop, eBay, Amazon? People don't just come and give you money for things just because your shop exists, even if you can hone in on models that 'sell well'. You've got to provide better value somehow. How will you do that? The market is flooded with cheap watches, and it'll be tough competing on price even if you're buying in bulk - and if you do, how are you going to shift 1000 of the same G-Shock, when there's like 50 different colour schemes and everybody likes something different? If you're interested in watches, come over to /r/watches and read a bit, ask some questions, see if there might be a market for something you'd like to do. If there isn't a reasonably clear opportunity, don't try and start a business doing it.\n\n3. What do you really want to sell? If your heart is set on doing something with watches, why not make straps? There's a fair few businesses out there that were built just on making and selling watch straps from leather and other materials. Cutting and sewing straps isn't too hard. Maybe you could identify a USP in that market to exploit - maybe nobody's doing them in a particular style, or you can offer completely custom straps with any material/colour, maybe you can invent a self-closing buckle or something. You're more likely to turn a profit making and selling stuff of reasonable value yourself than reselling already cheap items... but I'm not saying you'll make a profit at all.\n\n4. You're in college. Have you got time to start and run a business amidst your studies? If you're looking for something to cover your expenses, something you can throw a few hours a week into and earn some cash, starting a business isn't likely to do it. You'd be better off working for someone else, biding your time and thinking about what business you'd like to start later on. I don't want to put you off - this sort of thing can be ridiculously rewarding, but it could also be ruinous if it's not done right, or (as it might turn out) if there's no market to sustain the business.","name":"t1_d1cn68u","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-03-25 04:06:55","week":12}

But I also have quite a few games with everything (maybe not promo codes if they did have them), so should those go to FBA or is it still too risky?

I've sold about 60 things so far on Amazon and gotten no feedback yet so I don't want a few game scammers to sink my operation.  \n\nAlso, I've never sold on ebay before so I don't know what to put in my descriptions.

If you select United Airlines as your carrier, you can go into the United app and buy a $100 Amazon gift card that earns the rebate.

Same great customer service, but no fee.\n\nAlso, your math doesn't make sense to me. Let's say you pay an annual fee of $95, and buy a $100 gift card to get a 5% reward. Your net is $5 - $95 = -90. If I buy a gift card with my card, I only get 2% back, but I pay no annual fee, so my net is $2. That's $92 ahead just by changing cards.\n\nYou'd have to buy 95/5 = 19 gift cards, or $1900 worth of Amazon gift cards, just to get enough $5 rewards to break even with the annual fee. Do you really buy that much? Even if you do, if you use a card with no annual fee and 2%, buying $1900 of credit gives you $38 of cash rewards, which still beats breaking even, i.e. $0.","name":"t1_d1dalo3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-25 19:24:31","week":12}

There are currently about 500,000 potential customers. We have only been in business a little more than a year. \n\n&gt; If you are working for a well known brand I guarantee I can buy your products on amazon for cheaper then a brick and mortar.\n\nWe control the supply chain, so there are no price wars. We sell direct from our online store and have stores on Amazon, eBay, etc. Generally pricing is near MSRP. If any vendors are heavily undercutting the competition, we tell them to knock it off. \n\n&gt;Why do you care if you sell to a BM or ecommerce? Also, ecommerce is doing something you cant do yourself.\n\nMany of the BM shops also sell online, but they have incentive to keep prices reasonable. The reason I want them in BM shops is so that people can look at the item in hand. We are at the point where a good portion of our potential customers have heard our brand, but have yet to see the product in person.\n\nRetail pricing on our products ranges from $100 to $1,000. That means we don't get a lot of impulse purchases online. People are still hesitant to trust reviews. We find our customers are much more willing to buy once they see the merchandise in person.\n\n&gt;I appreciate your view, i like knowing how the other side thinks. How long have you been in your industry and do you feel successful?\n\nAs I was saying before, we are a new company with a new brand. I wouldn't say we are a success yet, but we are growing fast, and I don't see anything stopping us from being successful. While we are still growing, we need to have strict controls on pricing.

You can cook almost any vegetable in the microwave. For example, potatoes or yams-- wash, trim, poke with fork: 7 mins, turn over halfway through. You'd also need a biggish bowl or 8-cup measuring cup in pyrex glass (not plastic or metal) to cook fluid things in if you don't have something like that already. You will be able to warm, steam (w/ a lid), simmer, stew and boil with the microwave.\n\nAn electric crockpot would increase your cooking options and cost about $20 at Walmart.  In addition to letting you cook rice and soups and stew inexpensive cuts of meat, it could cook hardboiled eggs-- a very affordable portable protein.

{"id":"d1dk3pa","author":"The_Squidd","body":"My experience has ranged everywhere from getting nothing at all to a miracle of a secret santa who gave me a $100 donation to my AFSP page (the only thing I asked for) and a $100 Amazon gift card, then when he learned I spent the amazon gift card on my family he gave me another one! It's been months and his generosity still makes me tear up a little.\n\nSo, yeah, I recommend it. Even when you do get the unfortunate match who sends nothing at all (or maybe it really does just get lost in the mail) the giving spirit is still fun, and no one should give up giving for the sake of frugality if you can. And when you do get something, while no, it usually isn't so tremendous, it's still fun. It's a surprise, and unlike gifts from friends and family, it has a whole extra layer of suspense and wonder to it.","name":"t1_d1dk3pa","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-25 23:30:22","week":12}

{"id":"d1drk1u","author":"serialboss","body":"I sell children's products (toys for girls age 0-6) to big box retail stores all over the country. **I started with literally 0 sales experience so I totally feel your pain and think I can offer you some insights.**\n\nSome background - my first job out of college, I worked at Macy's Corporate (NYC) on the buying team for cosmetics and then later for home products, so I really got to know the \"mind\" of the buyer and I think that's what's made my pitching techniques so successful when I switched to the sell side. Now, I sell stores like **Walmart, Toys R Us, Zulily.com, Amazon, TJ Maxx, Home Goods, Marshalls, HEButt, Kroger, etc.**\n\n\nSome tips to get started below. I hope this helps! I'm actually building an online course to teach people just like you everything I've learned about getting on shelves. There's no good info out there!\n\n\n**Step #1 - make a list of the retailers you want to reach out to**. I'd start with a general Google search for your product category. Whoever pops up first are usually the big guys to note.\n\n\n**Keep in mind that some of the best retailers you might not even be aware of yet!** For example, when I first started in \"toys\" I never thought grocery stores had anything to do with that. I figured my best toy buyers would be places like Toys R Us, Babies R Us, FAO Schwarz, etc. Guess what? It turns out there's a major market for toys happening in grocery chains and they're now a huge portion of my business! Same goes for rest stops off the high ways (kids always picking up new toys there), airport shops, etc. \n\nThink outside the box for the non-obvious answers! There's usually less competition in those realms.\n\n**Smaller regional chains (5-20 stores)** are great to start with too. Their buying procedures are usually much less complex, it's way easier to get in touch, and it's way easier to get a \"YES\" than it would be reaching out to someone like a Walmart. Plus, if you succeed in stores like this, it's GREAT leverage to use when you finally start approaching the bigger guys. \n\n**Big box retailers LOVE knowing your product is already a success story.** I once landed a major retailer (who continually ignored me) by telling them via cold email that \"I'm having great success with X item at a similar retail store - we sold $XX dollars year-to-date and we're turning product X times/month. The item is proven. I think it would be a great opportunity for your stores too.\" I got a reply QUICK! They love easy wins focused on sales, margin, and turn. USE THOSE KEY WORDS if you can!\n\n**Step #2 - Get personal contact info. DON'T submit your product or your company through a \"new vendor\" portal on their site.** While I know this is \"protocol\" for some retailers, it's essentially a dead end in my opinion. It could take months to hear back and you never know if it got to the right person. Instead, find the exact buyers' names on Linkedin. Contact the buyer directly via private message or email. \n\n**Step #3 - Perfect the pitch. Write an email that is CONCISE and to the point. Introduce yourself in 1 sentence or less**. No one really cares about your \"story\" or \"company history\" or all that other fluff we add in. They'll hear more about it later. \n\nInstead, get right to the point. \"Hi, my name is [X] and I'm the [TITLE] from [X company].\" is enough as an intro. Make a direct request immediately (whether it be for a meeting to show your product, permission to send samples, etc). Attach a photo or link - something that gets them interested. **The shorter, less \"beggy\" your email is, the more enticing it'll be**. Buyers get solicited all day long and hear the same over-lengthy, over-fluffed pitch continually. Be concise. That's what will make you stick out. Be confident. Re-read your email before hitting send and ask yourself:\n\n- Do I sound like I'm begging/desperate? If so, change it. Imagine that you're doing THEM the favor (which, you kind of are if your product turns out to be a success!)\n\n- What can I cut out to make this email more concise? Now what ELSE can I cut out to make this email concise?\n\nGood luck!! You can do it.

{"id":"d1e0hh4","author":"Thirst_Trap","body":"The BIN to Auction percentage is something like 75/25. Half of that 25% using Auctions aren't flippers and the other half is split in thirds of sellers dumping product, sellers taking a risk on an item they can't price, and sellers of a really desirable item. \n\nOk, so I used a little shooting from the hip logic but I think those numbers would be pretty accurate. The fact of the matter is eBay has matured beyond it's rapid growth stage and the buyer base just isn't as active. eBay's heyday was before the economic downturn in 2008. People were spending money like crazy 2006-2007 in my opinion, I flipped cellphones during that time 80% sourced from eBay (their search algorithms were much weaker those days and could be taken advantage of) it was easy to double $30-75 investments, many times you could relist the phone using the same pictures and an optimized listing have it sold before you received it, 3 day auctions weren't that risky and a 7 day listing posted on Sunday evening would sell for going price from $.99 a majority of the time. Buyers just aren't as engaged and Amazon has a shit ton to do with it.\n\nSo, with all that being said I think 30 day BIN sometimes with BO w/ higher BIN price than you'd expect to get is the best route to go. Of course there are exceptions and I think the second best route for certain items is a 7 day auction from Sunday afternoon as u/poorwhitecash mentioned.","name":"t1_d1e0hh4","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-26 09:36:57","week":12}

Every seller has a different type of buyer. If you're selling primarily new items you can go after the quality crowd, If you're selling 1000 of those items a month all over the country, you can find the average of your shipping costs and do just as well as if you used calculated shipping.\n\nThose of us who deal in used items, refurbished parts, and repairable items are going after a different crowd. We're competing for the bargain buyer, the one who wants to buy somethihng as cheaply as possible so they get our $15 dollar new part instead of the $25 new one on Amazon. I might sell a 5 dolllar part to the next town over or I might send it to Pourto Rico. With $10 shipping included in the price I'd never sell to the first guy and I'd loose my ass every time I shipped to the second. With calculated shipping I avoid this problem and everybody's happy.\n\nDifferent sellers, different markets, different strategies, but in general, I agree with calculated shipping unless you're shipping enough identical weight/size items to enough varied areas of the country to know your average shipping cost and to have it actually average out. (Unless you plan to use a flat rate or First Class shipping option, then it's irrelevant)","name":"t1_d1el9y2","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-26 22:57:00","week":12}

More than likely they are looking for a specific style in a particular price range. What is someone's motivation to buy the oxford Ferragamo shirt I sold yesterday? Guy wanted high end fashion for a fraction of the price.\n\nNeither one of these people's chief consideration is price. Price is relative and usually comes into play after several other conditions have been met. To judge which strategy is best by looking at price mainly is a disservice to you the seller. Which strategy is best depends on your particular situation, but as a blanket statement free shipping is a smart tactic (assuming it is accurately accounted for).\n\nWhy is it a great strategy, marketing. A lot of companies have paid a lot of money to drill it into consumers heads that free shipping is extremely valuable. Just as most people prefer Coke over Pepsi when given the choice but prefer Pepsi over Coke in blind taste tests perception is a real thing that defies logic.\n\nWhat I'm saying is the boost in views, search, and perceived value makes up for it's deficiencies and then some in a lot of situations. \n\nAlso, just as many Amazon users click Prime, some eBay users may click free shipping only for commodity items. Which changes the game completely.

{"id":"d1en84r","author":"_imjosh","body":"Good points.  I'm struggling to come up with a succinct explanation that would be a more comprehensive treatment of shipping price strategies.  If you have any more suggestions, I'm all ears. I'd like to write a more general article about this.\n\nTo be clear, here I am talking about large/heavy items with substantial shipping costs.  I used a $25 max example, but I've sold things that cost over $100 to ship. I sell lots of things with free shipping because they can go first class and also due to competition pressure.  \n\nAlso, I am talking about your average Ebay flipper. Amazon gets shipping rates that we mortals can only dream of with volumes I can't even fathom.  They also aren't profitable FWIW. Boosting my sales by operating at a loss does nothing for my share prices... ;)\n\nI did a bit of looking on Ebay for large/heavy things and how they're listed and I did notice something I find pretty interesting.  Mattresses.  Search for new mattresses on Ebay. All free shipping.  That's crazy.  My only guess is the sellers either do enough volume to make that work on average, have good negotiated freight rates, and/or have multiple distribution centers, and probably have a ton of margin built in.  What is clear is that as a small-time seller, I wouldn't want to try selling mattresses on Ebay.\n \n\n","name":"t1_d1en84r","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-26 23:54:16","week":12}

{"id":"d1epkgw","author":"st33n3rs","body":"Hey, another Wells guy! Congrats on paying off the student loans!  I'm not in Wealth Management, but I'll do my best if I were in your shoes.\n\nIncome: 94 a year in NYC/upper NJ will get you to an assumed 47k after federal, state, &amp; city taxes.  This is about 4 grand a month, and with your expenses of 2.5k a month, you have 1.5k going into saving, either to your bank accounts or 401k.  This is pretty damn impressive for a person in their mid to late 20s IMO.\n\nCredit Cards: My rule for credit cards is to never have more than 3 and to only have 1 annual fee card.  Cancel the Chase United and the Macy's card, as it sounds that these are just collecting dust.  I'd look into getting a BoA Cash Rewards card, as it's a no-fee card and you will probably get better rewards with this than the Everyday Amex or the Amazon Visa.  Also, look at canceling either the Amex premier rewards or the Chase Sapphire, or get them to at least lower/cancel the annual payment for you to stay.\n\nCash/ SHTF scenario:  Given a SHTF scenario, I'll assume that you will cut your food budget to 400/ month, drinks to 200/ month, and uber to 100/month, which will put you at 2.1k/ month.  Combining your securities into your balances, you have about 28, 29k in liquid/near-liquid assets, so I think you are pretty secure as far as a emergency fund, given you are willing to liquidate your RH/Motif accounts.\n\n401K Distributions: This I would need a bit more clarification to offer an opinion.  Is the 401(k) Roth or non-Roth?  The base rule I go by is to put your money into Roth's before 40 and into non-Roths after 50.  Sidenote- nice job on the employer max; if you are looking into getting into investing yourself, possibly lower the 10% to the 401k to 8%, and throw the rest into your RobinHood.\n\n401(k) Investments: Now, I don't know your risk tolerances, so it's hard to speak here.  Personally, I don't like target year date funds, as these are one-size fit-all investment instruments.  The feeling that I'm getting from looking at your 401k investments is that you don't have any plan to touch these investment in the near term.  So I'd throw out this plan for your 401k account.\n\nInitial balance: 25% in US small caps, 25% in mid caps, 25% in large caps, 20% in international equity, and 5% in a bond index, with contributions matching the position balance.  Every 3 years, move 1% from each of your equity account into your bond fund, and move contribution balance accordingly.  \n\nNon-retirement investments: This is where you lose me.  You say that you want to put your high risk in your Roth IRA, but from my point of view, the only non high-risk trade that you have is USO. NRG is on the border of bankruptcy, BABA's Chinese accounting is suspect, and the current enviorment isn't the greatest with Xi Jingping starting to go dictator-mode in China, and NFLX, TSLA, and TWOU are trading at extremly high multiples, and don't have the cash flows to support the valuations, in my opinion.  If your plan is to put the riskiest funds in the Roth, then throw your NRG, BABA, TWOU, TSLA, and NFLX in there, and move the USO into the RH and Motif.  But my main question is what led you to think that these names are good investments? \n\nThe bitcoin I don't know enough about to give you advice.  I know that it is mined by allocating excess processing power to a mining program which then slowly creates the currency, and that the currency is highly used in the illicit markets in the dark web. Other than that, have no idea of what the value of a bitcoin is.\n\nEdit: Disclaimer - I am not an investment advisor.","name":"t1_d1epkgw","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-03-27 01:04:07","week":12}

{"id":"d1ezehy","author":"Faiyee","body":"I was just about to say this. I worked in the lost package investigation department for UPS a few years ago and Amazon was one of those odd companies. They didn't actually have use start an investigation, they insisted we refer their customers to them. Normally they'd just ship out a new item if it was shipped by them, but if someone repeatedly says that an item never arrived, they will do an actually investigation. I'm not sure what their policy is exactly for you to get put on this, but I do know they are very lax until they hit this point. (This isn't lost in transit packages, this is for shows delivered but you never got it.) \n\nIf an item is damaged. Return it, you have proof it was damaged. If the item gets lost and never shows up, report it. But if the item consistantly doesn't show up, start looking into alternatives on how to recieve it (pick up at center, delivered to a friend or family member, etc). You have people who abuse companies missing package policies and they are on the look out for that. Not only the company, but the package carrier as well. They will stop delivering to you, and your only option would be to pick it up at the center. \n\nFunniest conclusion to an investigation I ever came across involved a guy who always claimed that he never recieved his packages. The driver would always swear up and down that he delivered it to the right address and that sometimes the guy would physically take the package. Driver got sick of it and took a picture of him handing the guy the package, and I guess the guy thought the driver was texting, because later that day, the guy reported he never recieved it. That investigation closed so fast, that center was ready. Picture uploaded to database, short response of \"Driver took picture of handing the customer the package. We will not deliver to him again. In the future, he can pick up his packages at the center by showing picture ID and signing for it.\" Depends on where you live, but some package centers just don't play around with that. Moral of the story: Don't abuse the system, but report legitimate problems. ","name":"t1_d1ezehy","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-27 07:26:27","week":12}
