{"id":"3r5461","author":"nixtamal","body":"Here's where I am right now:  FICO score around 775 for the past year.  In terms of what I am looking for, probably from the best to worst for me would be a straight cash bonus, hotel rewards, flight rewards, and lastly higher % cashback cards.  Since redcard died I haven’t really done any manufactured spend and most of my normal spend goes on credit union cards that give perks I want for reaching a certain number/amount of transactions in a month.  I feel like I am in sort of a “maintenance” mode.  I’m fine on flights/hotel rooms for the next year but think I need to clean up a lot of what I’m doing with my current accounts as some annual fees are coming up and maybe I need to shut down some cards so I can redo the bonuses again in the future.  The only plans I have now are that I will try to grab the two Chase cards for the Southwest Companion Pass at the end of 2016/beginning of 2017.\n\nHere's what I have and my questions (if any) about each card, along with their opening dates in parentheses:\n\n* Amex Blue Sky &amp; Amex Blue Cash (both Jun 2007) - I use these for Amex Offers.  I really see no reason to cancel either of these.\n\n* Amex Serve - Closed it for redcard, reopened after redcard died so I could at least do Amex Offers on it.  \n\n* Bank of America Cash Rewards (Visa) &amp; Bank of America Better Balance Rewards (Mastercard) (Feb/Mar 2013) - I use the BBR, but I don’t use the CR account.  I’ve tried twice to convert CR to BBR based on other people’s posts here but I’ve been unsuccessful.  What should I do with the CR account?\n\n* Barclay Arrival (Jun 2013) - Downgraded from the Arrival+ when the annual fee came up.  Can I close/reopen this in the future for another Arrival+ bonus?  If so, when?\n\n* Best Buy (Jan 2013) - I rarely use this.  It’s a store card and I guess there’s no real good reason to close it because occasionally something with Best Buy will come up, but it’s pretty rare and I don’t think there’s much to churn here if I shut it down.\n\n* Capital One Venture (Feb 2014) - Got them to waive the annual fee in Feb 2015, but I doubt they'll do it again because I haven't used the card.  Should I just cancel this or is there another option?  If I do cancel this, can I get it again for another signup bonus or is it one time only?\n\n* Chase Amazon (May 2003) - My oldest card, I used it more in the past and might again in the future.  I see no reason to close this.\n\n* Chase Freedom (Feb 2013) - I used to use this a lot more for the cashback but almost never use it anymore.  Can I close/reopen this for a promo later?  If so, when?\n\n* Chase Slate (Jan 2015) - Using this for a balance transfer (after moving a bunch of credit line to it from other cards) because I can just invest the money for a year with no fee/interest.  Is it possible to reopen it again in the future for the same promo offer of no fee and no interest?  If so, when?\n\n* Chase Disney (Feb 2015) - Someone referred me so I could get $200 Disney GC on a $500 spend which I did but haven’t used it since.  I would love to be able to refer other people but haven’t gotten an offer from them to do so yet -- does anyone know how you get the referral offers?  Alternately, can I cancel this and reapply later?  If so, when?\n\n* Chase Marriott Rewards Premier (Feb 2015) - Did a 5k spend/70k pt offer.  This has an annual fee that I really don’t care to pay.  I assume instead of downgrading I will just cancel it.  Can I redo this card bonus after I cancel it?  If so, when?\n\n* Discover More (Apr 2012) - Used to use this a lot more for the cashback but almost never use it now.  Rarely some deal will pop up but nothing like with Amex Offers.  Should I cancel this or no?  I really wanted the Discover It card but you can’t have both.  \n\nClosed accounts:\n\n* Amex Costco (Nov 2007 - Jun 2009)\n\n* Sony Store Card (Dec 2008 - Aug 2013)\n\n* Chase Southwest RR Premier (Mar 2013 - Jan 2014)\n\n* Chase IHG Rewards Club Select Visa (Oct 2013 - Oct 2014)","name":"t3_3r5461","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-11-02 00:28:32","week":45}

{"id":"3r7cqi","author":"A_Ham_Sandwich","body":"Hi all,\n\nI posted about Ibotta as a comment to another thread, but since I have been having good luck recently, and since there is an excellent promotion for new members going on right now I thought this would warrant its own post.\n\n**The Basics**\n\nIbotta is an app available for both Android and iOS where users earn money for shopping at Ibotta's retail partners (currently supporting around 160 stores) then scanning their receipts to prove what purchases they made.  Certain stores allow you to link your loyalty card so you don't even need to scan the receipts - those purchases are automatically reviewed by the Ibotta team.\n\n\n*How does it work?*\n\n1. Download the app\n\n2. Select the store you plan to shop at and complete tasks to unlock rebates.  These tasks are extremely easy (personally I knock them out when sitting on the can).  Tasks range from answering a one question poll, \"learning a fact\" which amounts to clicking one button, or watching a short video (generally 15 seconds - 25 seconds long).\n\n3. Once unlocked, the rebates are stored in your phone. Go to the store and locate your items.  You can scan barcodes to make sure that the item you are purchasing is valid for the rebate.\n\n4. Once you make your purchase, go home and submit your purchase information.  To do this you scan the bar codes then take a photo of your receipt and submit through the app.\n\n5. Ibotta will review your purchase (generally within 24 hours) and apply your credit to your account.\n\n\n*Bonuses*\n\nUsers can earn bonuses in a variety of ways.  By purchasing certain groups of items (e.g. buy 3 of 7 supported Glade brand products earn another $1 for free) users can earn bonus cash to their account.  These bonuses come and go, but there is always something.  Generally they will stay active for a few weeks before being replaced by something else.\n\nThere are special bonuses for holidays as well.  For example, I earned a free $5 just by redeeming 5 rebates over Halloween weekend.\n\nFinally, there are monthly team bonuses.  Your team is comprised of you, plus anyone who signed up with the team captains referral link.  Every month, work your way through bonus reward tiers as a team by using rebates.  This is a great way to make extra free money buy buying things you normally would.\n\n**Currently there is a special signup bonus for new members.  If you sign up using a referral code you will get an instant $10 bonus**\n\n\n*Payouts*\n\nThe minimum amount for payout is $10 which is super easy to hit.  Personally, I can hit that in one household shopping trip.  Payouts are fast!  Available payout options include:\n\n* Paypal\n* Venmo\n* Amazon Gift Card\n* BestBuy Gift Card\n* Starbucks Gift Card\n\n\n\n*Other Information*\n\nOne of the neat things (to me at least) is not everything is branded.  There are generic rebates for things like milk, eggs, orange juice, fresh vegetables, bbq sauce, canned soup, etc.\n\n\n**How to get Ibotta**\n\nIf you want to be awesome and get yourself a free $10 at signup, use my referral link: https://ibotta.com/r/xouqqfj  (I generally carry myself through the monthly bonuses so if that is an added plus for you, it won't take much work to hit the monthly bonus goals)\n\nUpdate on bonus $10.00: https://ibotta.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1572505-invite-friends-get-2-give-1\n\n\nIf you really want to be a self-made man or woman you can signup yourself without a referral link at www.ibotta.com, though this would make me tear up a little.\n\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps anyone who is interested.  I am happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks to the mod team for tagging this post US only for me since I forgot to include that information in the title when I posted :)\n  ","name":"t3_3r7cqi","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-11-02 13:38:05","week":45}

{"id":"3rdid8","author":"[deleted]","body":"In the past couple of years I have browsed this sub and noticed a few questions that are perpetually surfacing. \n\n\"How do I make $5,000 a month in passive income?\"\n\n\"How do I start a business selling _____.\"\n\n\"I am an expert in ______ how do I make money using my skills?\"\n\n“My friend has made a fortune selling _____; can I do the same?”\n\n“What do you think of _____ idea?\n\nAnd a **ton** of other questions in the same vein. \n\nBut there is one thing that these questions have in common: **they are all asking the wrong type of question.**\n\n*****\n\nThe purpose of this post is to shift your mindset from  consumer thinking to producer thinking. We are going to learn how to think like an entrepreneur. \n\nLet’s face it. The vast majority of us are raised to go get a job, work 9-5, maybe attend college or university, make money, save money, and buy stuff. Hey! It’s not so bad is it? I think this is a pretty nice cushy life. **But I know that it isn’t all it is talked up to be** and you know this too. That’s why you are here. \n\nLet’s for a minute assume that we have been programmed a certain way. The way that we don’t think about starting a business, being self made, or helping others. I am going to assume that everybody reading this thinks this way and this way only. If you don’t that's great! **You are already halfway there!** But for everybody else, prepare to enter the rabbit hole because there is no going back from here.\n\n*****\n\n**A quick bit about me**\n\nYou may want to know what I do or why I am giving advice. So here it goes. I will keep it quick.\n\n- I am an entrepreneur\n- I went to University graduated two years ago\n- I have started 6 businesses in my life\n- 3 of them have failed\n- 1 of them wasn’t scalable so I scrapped it, call that 4 fails\n- 1 is an e-commerce business where I sell multiple niche products.\n- 1 is an “offline” business\n- These business currently make a low 6 figures in revenue combined\n- These businesses are growing and can be scaled up\n- That means they have the potential to grow indefinitely\n\n**Things I will not do**\n\nI will not spew bullshit on how to get rich quick. Get rich quick doesn’t exist for 99% of people. \n\nI will not pretend that I am a millionaire.\n\nI will not talk specifically about my businesses. It will detract from the purpose of my posts which are aimed to help get others started. \n\n\n**Things I will do**\n\nAnswer questions as best as I can.\n\nI will help anybody who has questions if I can provide a real life experience I had that can be relatable. \n\nI will continue to provide value. \n\n*****\n\nNow, where were we?\n\n**The chicken or the egg?**\n\nA lot of people will ask themselves (or others), “will this product work?”\n\n“Will this service work?”\n\n“How can I get rich?”\n\nI believe that is is **the wrong mindset**. Earlier I told you we were going to shift our mindset, so that's what we will do. \n\nAll the above is a consumer based mindset. We think about what we want to buy, what needs we want to fulfill, what we want to make **ourselves** feel good, love, happy, better, etc. \n\nAll this me, me, me; I, I, I type of thinking. \n\n*That is consumer thinking* \n\nConsumers think about themselves. Consumers buy get rich quick. Consumers want to make a quick buck; they don’t care how they do it. \n\nIf you want to be like everybody, think like everybody. \n\nI don’t! I want freedom from the 9-5. I want happiness. I want to be *different*.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**THINK DIFFERENT** and be different\n\nHere is one of the most important thing you will read in this post.\n\n**Put others ahead of yourself**\n\nThat is it! \n\nThere is no magic formula. All you need to do is slow down and listen. \n\nInstead of thinking about what to sell, think about who you can help. \n\nLet me repeat that. \n\n**Instead of thinking about what to sell, think about who you can help.**\n\nNot only has this worked for me but it has worked for countless others!\n\n*****\n\n**Markets before products**\n\nWhen I am looking for products to sell via e-commerce I always brainstorm markets. The more specific the better. Here are just a couple off the top of my head:\n\n- new moms who don’t know where to start\n- people looking to work from home\n- vegetarians looking to build muscle\n- coffee drinkers who want whiter teeth\n- young professionals who want to learn to network\n\n\n\n**Then** I try to figure out what problems they have. \n\nJump on forums, jump on reddit, get on whatever platform you can think of and look for phrases like, “why can’t, this sucks, I need help, I love, I need, etc.” And try to create a list of problems. \n\n** Let's take vegetarians who work out for example**\n\nSome problems:\n\n- How can I eat enough protein on a plant based diet to build muscle?\n- How can I get enough protein for under $100 a month?\n- What are some easy high protein recipes for vegetarians?\n- Is it possible to have healthy joints and be a vegetarian?\n- How can I get all my nutrients without buying a thousand supplements?\n\nFrom those problems I try to find the ones that need solving. Even better if those needs are not currently being met by a competitor. \n\nTip: We are looking for problems that are a psychological need. They evoke emotion. I learned this when I was teaching myself to copywrite. We always want to create emotional products and that means tapping into the emotional needs and problems of our market. \n\nI like the protein one for under $100. I like it because of some emotions/feelings like:\n\n- wanting to look better, impress that special guy/gal\n- be more attractive\n- long term health\n- not wanting to harm animals\n- wanting to better themselves for whatever personal reason they have\n- be a part of the active lifestyle community\n\nI also like the under $100 one because it is measurable and it shows that the market is willing to pay for a solution **and** they have some emotional needs.\n\nSo, some product ideas? \n*****\n\nThe Active Vegetarian Cook Book\n\nThe Active Vegetarian Diet Plan\n\nA catch all supplement containing vitamins, BCAA’s, protein, etc. One supplement that costs $60-100 a month that has everything they would need. \n\n*****\n\nThese are all solutions to a problem. I would never know that there was a need for a product like this if I didn’t first think of the market. \n\nSolve problems. Make money. It is incredibly simple. \n\nYou see, the best thing is, **you don’t have to be the only one solving the need**. Competition is great! It just goes to show you that there *is a market*. \n\nAll you need to do is one of these things:\n\n- Offer a better product\n- Market it and connect better\n- Improve a design\n- Tailor the product to a specific user (niche)\n- Continue to innovate and release products\n\n\nNow, think about if you do it the opposite way. You want to sell xyz product. You run the risk of it not selling and you have no way to pivot. \n\n**If you find unique solutions and solve them better than other people, you will make money.** Plain and simple.\n\nMarkets should always come before products. \n\n*****\n\nMy last word on markets before products is that when you brand your product in your niche it allows you to piggyback off the other product and expand a product line. You can have 5 products in the niche instead of 1 product that sells mediocre in a bad market. \n\nIf you just create a product and have some limited success in a market and your single product stops selling, your income disappears. Gone. Poof! Maybe Amazon locks your product. Poof! No income for two weeks or until the problem is sorted out.\n\nIf you have multiple products solving problems for a niche if one stops selling you have a backup and you have a brand that is going to continue to sell\n\n*****\n\nLet me know if you like the post and if you have any suggestions on how to improve the posts in the future. Criticism makes us better!\n\n*****\nEdit: some formatting and words. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks everybody for the kind words. It is very rewarding to see this has helped some people out! \n\nI have seen the \"then what\" questions a few times. I am considering a post detailing some strategies for digging into niches.\n\nWhat do you guys/gals want next? Leave a comment or PM if you have some thoughts on where to go from here. \n\n\nEdit: A lot of people wanted more detail on the process:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3scfrj/identifying_niches_and_their_problems_examples/\n\nthere it is!\n \n","name":"t3_3rdid8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-03 18:14:24","week":45}

{"id":"3remed","author":"helloforrest","body":"An Amazon Prime membership can save you some serious money (especially if you have a .edu email address) if you already pay for other music/video services. I cut my cable subscription after I got Amazon Prime and the amount of money I have saved is staggering. \n\nHaving been an Amazon Prime member for the past 6 months I would like to give an honest Amazon Prime review about my experience with the service.\n\nAmazon Prime is a subscription service that has quite a few benefits:\n* Free 2 day shipping on most items bought from Amazon\n\n* Free same day delivery in eligible areas\n\n* Prime Instant Video (comparable to Netflix)\n\n* Prime Music (comparable to Spotify Premium)\n\n* Prime Pantry – have your groceries shipped to you\n\n* Extra deals not offered to others (Right now they are offering the new kindle to prime members for $89.99 rather than $119.99 for non-members)\n\n* Kindle First and Kindle Lending Library (Kindle benefits I don’t personally use)\n\nThere are several other benefits I didn’t highlight. These are the ones I use (minus Kindle benefits).\n\nPrice: $99 per year, or $49 per year for students.\n\nI use Amazon Prime’s services on a daily basis. With a student email address it only costs $4.08 per month or $8.16 per month for non-students. Okay let’s compare this to the prices of comparable services.\n\nNetflix costs $7.99 per month. Not too bad. Hulu Plus is $7.99 with commercials or $11.99 without commercials (What!? Commercials on a paid streaming service? Go home Hulu Plus, you’re drunk).  You want a good music service too though? Spotify Premium is $4.99-$9.99 per month based on whether you are a student or not. Pandora One costs $4.99 per month but does not offer as much freedom as Spotify Premium or Prime Music.\n\nStudent cost for comparable services: $12.98 per month (Spotify + Netflix)\n\nNon-student cost for comparable services: $12.98- $16.97 per month (Spotify or Pandora One + Netflix)\n\nDid I mention that Amazon Prime is roughly $4-$8 per month? Plus you get free 2 day shipping and a ton of other services.\n\nI can honestly say Amazon Prime membership is the best deal out there right now. The only valid argument you can make against buying Amazon Prime is that you prefer another music or video service’s content more. In which case sticking with that service is quite understandable. I like Netflix’s content so I pay for Netflix as well. Could I get by without it? Yes. But I don’t pay for cable so I personally don’t mind the $7.99 a month Netflix costs me.\n\nTo sum it up Amazon Prime offers a ton services bundled into one yearly payment. The yearly payment works out to a much smaller monthly payment when compared to other services. It has allowed me to cancel other services, saving me money in the long run. It also allows me access to music and video content that other services do not have. In addition, I find myself buying random stuff on Amazon without having to spend more than $35 to get free shipping. And it gets here in 2 days. Having something in the mail gives me something to look forward to even if it’s just a small $4 item.\n\nThey also offer a free 1-month trial which is basically just an extra free month if you end up staying signed up with Prime.\nTL;DR\nIf you're looking to save a big chunk of money look into getting an Amazon Prime membership.\n\nEDIT: took down link and transferred info over from my blog. Not sure why people insisted on down-voting for having a link that I prefaced by saying I would be happy to take down. Just creates more work for someone trying to contribute relevant information to a subreddit.","name":"t3_3remed","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-03 22:22:09","week":45}

{"id":"3riqt9","author":"wildmankyle","body":"Quick note: I can move this to What Card Wednesday if that would be more appropriate.\n\nI recently got an AT&amp;T Access More card to upgrade my phone to take advantage of the Apple Pay promotion.  I'm also an AT&amp;T customer.  However I'm questioning whether the card has significant value via the anniversary bonus or if I should cancel it before the next AF.\n\nI can earn 3x TYP for paying my AT&amp;T bill (after the AP promotion expires), and I've already met the minimum spend.  Most of my online shopping is Amazon or otherwise infrequent, I think for the most part I could find a better deal with one of my other cards.  Nearly all of my spending categories pay out better with my other cards so it doesn't make sense for me to put a great deal of ordinary spend on this card for 1 TYP/dollar.  To meet the anniversary bonus I'd be MSing (currently investigating Serve/BB).\n\nHere's a breakdown of my calculations, are there any glaring mistakes?\n\nTYP earned from $2k minimum spend: ~3500\nNecessary spend remaining: ~$8k\nJanuary - September wireless expense: ($55 * 9months) = $495\nNecessary MS: $7500 = 15 $500 VGCs\nVGC fee: 15 * $5.95 assumed = $89.25 (forgot the Simon Mall price, will shop for cheapest card)\n\nThis leaves me with approximately 22.5k TYP (3.5k min spend, 1485 AT&amp;T bill, 7590 MS, 10k anniversary) for paying 2 AFs and the $90 VGC expense.  If I divide the cost by the points I get 0.01237, does that mean the TYP earned above cost 1.2cpp?\n\nIf my math is correct, it sounds like the anniversary bonus more or less offsets the annual fee.  I have another TYP earning card and was toying with the idea of redeeming several Citi signup bonuses over the next year at 1cpp to pay down a student loan as I'm not currently in love with Citi's travel partners.\n\nWhat do you all think?

{"id":"3rivfp","author":"AshleyPomeroy","body":"Random question, and I apologise for waffling. Back in 2013 I wrote a blog post about the dot.com boom. Google Books has a fascinating archive of old computer magazines from the 1990s, and I spent an afternoon reading through Infoweek and PC Magazine and Kiplinger's Personal Finance etc. You'd be surprised how many of Infoweek's cover stars turned out to be fraudsters.\n\nThe March 1999 issue of Kipling's recommends **PMC Sierra**. \"*Buy stocks and mutual funds on the periphery of the (Internet) phenomenon*\", it says. \"*Those with at least a couple of degrees of separation from the Amazons and eBays. Kevin Landis, portfolio manager for Firsthand funds, explains the hierarchy this way: at the bottom is a company such as PMC Sierra, which makes semi-conductors for the communications market. Its biggest customer is Cisco Systems, etc etc routers etc, which sells to MCI WorldCom, the giant telecommunications company etc etc*\".\n\nThe paragraph is quintessentially dot.commy - it has Cisco and Worldcom. Kevin Landis obviously wasn't a complete doofus because he continued to run Firsthand albeit that in 2013 there was an attempt to oust him and he seems to have done very badly of late:\n[http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/21/star-tech-investor-kevin-landis-in-fight-for-his-job/](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/21/star-tech-investor-kevin-landis-in-fight-for-his-job/)\n\nPMC Sierra's share price graph looked like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ii0nTt6Mtog/UmA8sQJaN7I/AAAAAAAAJws/KCsRz-zi91c/s1600/pmc.jpg) in late 2013. It split a couple of times and peaked at $245 a share post-split, if I'm reading the chart correctly. From 2001 to the present day it has slowly slid from $20 a share to $6 a share, although it recently recovered a little bit. e.g. over the last decade it has wavered within a dollar or two of $7.\n\nPeople seem to have bought and sold shares in the company, but I struggle to find any significant news about them over the last fifteen years, or indeed ever - even back in 2000 people seemed to be buying the shares because it had a tangential connection with Cisco.\n\nMy question is this - why did people buy shares in PMC Sierra in, say, 2006? From an investment point of view, what did the company have to offer over the last fifteen years? It seems to have made a modest, steady profit selling microcontrollers and similar things, but from an investor's point of view, what was it *for*?","name":"t3_3rivfp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-04 19:33:44","week":45}

{"id":"3rl3r8","author":"TA_Dreamin","body":"So this evening I arrived home from work to a package on my front porch. Nothing out of the ordinary as I was expecting a few things from Amazon. I proceed to open up the package and find a pair of Snowboard Bindings which I have never heard of shipped to me from a company i have never heard of. I immediately logged in and checked my accounts and noticed almost 1K in fraudulent charges to this company. I called the CC company and let them know what was going on and they have closed the account. I then called the company that the stuff was ordered through and they told me that all of the orders were actually shipped directly to my home. Which means that some creepy asshole is out in my neighborhood stealing shit off my porch. So a few questions I have. What should I do to protect my finances? I assume this guy stole my mail and that is how he got my credit card. What steps can I take to help protect my sensitive information? Setup a PO Box? Maybe this isn't the right thread for such a question.\n\nAlso,I really want to catch this ass clown and make sure he gets prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But I know that will be extremely difficult. I have tracked down the e-mail they used to purchase the stuff as well as a UPS Choice account they created. Still waiting to hear back from UPS, but do you think the Owner of the Anonymous e-mail service might be of any help? I tracked down the owners contact info through Whois.

{"id":"3roqg7","author":"Debellatio","body":"I've worn through two fitted sheets from two different bed sheet sets. After a few years they've just developed holes in them.\n\nI have been looking around to see if I can just buy bed sheet separates, to just get replacement fitted sheets. I really don't care about color matching for these sheets, so that's not a huge deal the colors wouldn't match my flat sheets and pillowcases. I've been looking, and it seems very difficult to find anyone selling decent quality fitted sheet separates. Most places I've looked simply don't offer them. \n\nIkea has a few for $15 / each (full sized bed), but they are selling a new matching set (so adding a matching flat sheet and 2 pillowcases) for just another $5. I'm not going to buy a sheet separate when the set is just $5 more. Target has one color in a full on clearance for $9, but half of the reader reviews mention they are cheap quality and develop holes in them after a few washes, which would just put me right back to where I am. Amazon, Walmart, Overstock, Kohls, etc. don't seem to sell anything other than sheet sets, and the few places I have found fitted sheet separates, the prices are almost as much as just buying a whole new set. I am not willing to go get a used one for this type of item.\n\nIs there an option I've not finding for buying decent or good quality fitted sheet separates, or should I just go for new sets? It seems like a waste / shame to need to buy new sets when the flat sheets and pillow cases are still 100% fine, but I'm not willing to pay almost the same price as a new set for just a fitted sheet.\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: nevermind on the Target sheets option.

Over the last year I have listened to and been to various seminars about improving  companies and management / leadership skills.

The company turns over around £1.5 million per year, and this year I am set to have solely brought in about £300,000. \n\nBeing a small business I have had the luxury of getting to know how businesses run, how to implement systems and quality control without the risk of me owning my own company.

{"id":"3rqhle","author":"ok100k","body":"My net worth including all assets / debts surpassed $100k this week!! It's no earth shattering number but I'm pretty excited about this for a number of reasons. I don't have any new advice, but figured I would share my story in the event it helps / inspires anyone. \n\nI think the three biggest contributors to hitting this milestone were:\n\n1. a big bump in pay a year and a half ago ($70k -&gt; $150k)\n2. some early investing / no student loans\n3. following the advice of this board\n\n**Early 20's**\n\nI dropped out of college after two years because I couldn't focus and had no idea what I wanted to do. After getting a job at a small software startup--making $12/hr--I learned to wear multiple hats, and essentially self-educated for the next several years (a little support, coding, IT, sales, etc.). I worked pretty hard and was able to negotiate a bump in pay every year, but after 5-6 years I hit a wall around $60-70k. \n\n\n**Late 20's** \n\nAt this point I started shopping around and managed to find another company with an open position for sales consulting for a software company. The recruiter flat out told me what the position's salary range was, and on a whim I asked for 15% higher than the top end of the range. After proving myself in interviews they offered me what I asked--a ~100% raise---and somehow didn't ask for pay stubs from my previous employer. I don't know if I was incredibly lucky or if this is now accepted practice in tech, but nevertheless I got the opportunity and have since proved my worth. \n\nI can't tell you how uneasy I felt not know what my future held without having a degree, but at 29 I've managed to become an exception in a sea of statistics. And it fucking feels great. \n\n\n**Investments**\n\nThat said, my investments have not been entirely disciplined. Instead of monthly, automatic contributions mine have all been large cyclical transfers (even in my early 20's I just had a few years where I dumped ~$5k into a brokerage and then nothing for a year or two), but a lot of this was due to some aggressive traveling so I don't regret my path. \n\nMy current allocation is:\n\n* $58k brokerage that's mostly equities I've held forever (goog, aapl, amzn, and a few GSE's)\n* $22k 401k (70% S&amp;P Vanguard fund / 30% bonds - current contribution is 12%)\n* $7k roth\n* $3k HSA\n* $15k Ally\n* $10k cash\n* $3k monthly credit card debt\n\nAs you can see it's fairly aggressive, but I don't plan to buy a house anytime soon. I plan to focus my contributions over the next year in some safer investments to lower my overall risk.\n\nI think my biggest mistakes so far are not maxing out my Roth contribution early on, trying to time the market with short term trades, and needless spending (I'm spending less today than I did 2 years ago!). I should probably be worth $150k, but I've recognized these mistakes and no longer make them. \n\nMy biggest challenge moving forward is lifestyle creep, but every time I think about buying a used Porsche I check Mint and try to envision how much easier life will be when I'm FI.

They are doing a $5 sign up between now and the end of the year if you use a referral link.  If needed for the sign up, please use my member ID: 36650.\n\nCash out minimum is $20 for PayPal (account must be 45 days old), but with the referral link you are already a quarter of the way there!  You can also cashout for select gift cards such as Amazon.  Here's a run down of what you can do on the site:\n\n[Sunshine Rewards Daily Deal Mail](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/dailydealmail.php) - sign up one time for an instant 0.25\n\n[Gift Reminder Service](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/giftreminder.php) - set a reminder (I used my birthday) for an instant 0.05\n\n[Forum Sign Up](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/forum/) - sign up and enter \"sunny\" in the box that asks for a password from Sunshine Rewards.  Confirm via email for an instant 0.10\n\n[Radio Loyalty](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/radio.php) - Unlimited.  Earn 0.01 each time you enter a captcha.  Not my favorite, but to each their own\n\n[Daily Surveys](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/othersurveys.php) - Click the green surveys for the best chance to qualify.  Some are available hourly or daily.  Most surveys are worth 0.50 to 1.75 and take in the ballpark of 20 minutes.  Max of 10 surveys per day.\n\n[Sunshine Scratch Off](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/scratch/) - Up to 0.03.  Free to play and only takes 2 seconds of your time. Daily activity\n\n[Paid Clicks](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/ptc.php) - Not a big thing for this website at the moment.  Rarely available\n\n[Paid Sign Ups](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/paidsignups.php) - Standard sign up offers.  They can take a while to credit (2-4 weeks).  If you're not in a hurry, these are easy.  Credit values vary widely.\n\n[Shopping](http://www.sunshinerewards.com/leads_sales.php) - This is one of my favorite things.  The list of merchants is extensive.  You'll probably find a store that you shop at on this list, and you might as well get some cash back.  It takes about a month to credit (par for the course with shopping portals).  Cash back percentages vary.\n\nI hope this helps.  As you have noticed, Sunshine is best for if you like surveys, sign up offers, and shopping.  Nothing passive on this site.  Sorry guys.\n\nPlease enjoy responsibly.\n\n\nEDIT:  $20 minimum for PayPal cash out.  Account must be 45 days old to cashout with PayPal.","name":"t3_3rt4fq","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-11-06 21:43:34","week":45}

Now that I have a steady job, just purchased a house, etc., I'm looking to add a few cards to my wallet to continue improving credit, as well as get some that have decent reward returns. I've been doing quite a bit of reading, but there are so many options I had a couple of beginner questions before I finalize anything.\n\nI'm currently looking at the following cards to start with:\n\n* Chase Freedom - for the all around spender with rotating categories and no annual fee\n* Chase Sapphire Preferred - for travel and dining; we dine out fairly often so the double points on dining seems beneficial\n* Amex Blue Cash Preferred - for groceries and gas; I spend about $100/week on gas traveling to and from work, and groceries are a regular purchase\n\n(Note: I have prequals for all three at the moment)\n\nWith that, my main questions are:\n\n1. Are these reasonable choices for a first go around, particularly when combined like this?\n2. On the CSP, I'm still a bit uncertain of whether or not this is a good choice. I don't travel a lot, but would like to do more and the option of accruing points for when I do travel seems nice.

{"id":"3rze1b","author":"thatmovieguy","body":"G’day fellow entrepreneurs. Please bare with my horrible grammar, sentence structure &amp; body odour. And AMA.\n\n---\nI have seen a few subscription box threads on r/Entrepreneur from people bagging the niche or just getting an idea off their chest. This thread in particular https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3rv2zk/im_thinking_of_starting_a_subscription_box/ is very critical of the niche but gives some good insight into 1 persons opinion on the industry. \n\n\nI'm not going to tell you my opnion but i recommend you read through this post, many other previous /r/entrepreneur [subscription box posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=subscription+box&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), google a whole lot and and form your own opinion.\n\n-----------\n\n**TLDR** - I started [Musclebox.me](http://musclebox.me/) at the start of this year with a partner and launched in July 2015. Being a long time redditor i discovered [lootcrate.com](lootcrate.com) one of the kinds of the sub box niche and decided to try out the idea with the bodybuilding niche. We developed a great product and released it to the market using shoutouts on Instagram. If my head doesn't explode from the stress we will hit $1,000,000 in revenue in December. \n\nOur main marketing strategy was instagram shoutouts to build up a email list. We released our product to the market and have since slowly grown over 5 months organically through customer referrals and instagram. We are developing a proper marketing strategy for the new year that will encompass all avenues in digital marketing. \n\n**I highly recommend doing research on reddit and google about using instagram as a marketing tool.** \n\nWe have huge plans for the Muscle Box but have had some hurdles in place which have really held us back in many ways. Being a Australian company trading in the USA has caused monumental problems so the next major phase is to try relocate to the USA and potentially seek funding for expansion.  \n\nI literally have pages up page of information i want to write but time is not on my side. I've left some dot points below including some tools i’ve used but please ask as many questions as you like. Cheers.\n\n------------\n\n\n**Why did i start a bodybuilding subscription box?**\n\n* Me and my partner have been bodybuilding for over 10 years. It’s a hobby and also a lifestyle so why not apply it to a business idea. **I have been told many times go into ventures that you like or where you are personally interested in the niche.** \n* The subscription box niche was growing and there were no decent boxes out there that that covered bodybuilding.\n* Between me and my partner we were able to build every single part of business at next to no cost with our own skills. This included nearly everything from the website to marketing and executing everything. One of the defining moments that made us push forward with the venture was because we could build a $50,000 website and management portal ourselves. Even the branding was done at next to nothing. \n* My partner has many connections in the fitness/bodybuilding world that gave us 1 foot in the door. \n\n\n**What was our strategy?**\n\n* Actually give the customer something fun, useful and good value. \n* Work on high volume and low margins.\n* Use our social media accounts in the bodybuilding niche to market and build a email list at no cost.\n* Concentrate on one product only and expand our line later down the track.\n\n**Problems**\n\n* Australian based merchant selling to the USA caused many many problems including lost revenue/reputation - https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/39p2yl/paypal_made_a_mistake_when_opening_my_merchant/\n* Website crashed at launched under stress.\n* Delays in shipments due to holidays.\n* Suppliers sending defective products.\n* Customers complaining on social networks unjustly.\n\n\n**How did we do it?** \n\n* Wordpress (i have been building wordpress sites for 5 years +. Started as a hobby and for me its the number 1 platform.)\n* Amazon aws (server)\n* Chargify.com (Management portal for recurring bulling)\n* Photoshop + 99designs + upwork (graphics/branding)\n* Stripe (credit cards) + Braintree (paypal)  - Read here about how braintree screwed me over. https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/39p2yl/paypal_made_a_mistake_when_opening_my_merchant/\n* Zendesk (customer support)\n* trello, google keep &amp; wunderlist (lists, management)\n* Google drive + dropbox (spreadsheets etc)\n* Ambassador (referral program)\n* mailchimp (email marketing)\n* Shopify (online store for one off purchases opening soon)\n* Instagram + Facebook + Twitter ( marketing)\n* Fulfillment company in the USA. PM me for details.\n* Reddit.com (keeps me sane)\n\n\n**What’s next?**\n\n* Expand shipping worldwide.\n* Build out our product line.\n* Improve on a few quality control aspects of the business.\n* Move the business to the business fully to the USA.\n* Explore funding options.\n\n---------------\n\nP.S Thanks to r/Entrepreneur over the years it’s been a source of great information and inspiration. \n\nJust in the past week i was especially taken back by the following from [localcasestudy](https://www.reddit.com/user/localcasestudy) in his [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3r8hzo/so_were_now_over_2_million_per_year_in_combined/). Another thread spoke about [depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3c16k3/the_darker_side_of_entrepreneurship_depression/?ref=search_posts) which i highly recommend if your having a tough time. \n\n**“FEAR IS MOSTLY A LIE\nAnd I say mostly because it's useful in some very specific scenarios. Being chased by lions in the plains of Africa, fear is a super helpful thing. It triggers adrenaline glands to make your body do some amazing things.\nBeyond situations like this though, and especially for new entrepreneurs fear is a lie. It's by and large a cognitive error that exists in our heads that essentially creates a fantastically negative story about all the bad things that happen if your business fails.\nBut as someone who has gone through business failures before, here's what really happens: Nothing.\nLike Kevin says, fear of a business failing is like being afraid of the dark.

I just don't understand the concept. \n\n1) I thought it was against amazon policy to buy and sell on amazon\n\n2) If I buy on amazon, and sell on amazon the market price is the same right? So there is no margin when we first purchase? That means I have to wait till the price goes up?\n\n3) Amazon price goes up and down according to keepa, camelcamelcamel etc. So what is basically happening is that the products we invest in are stocks. We buy products low on amazon and go on camelcamelcamel to see what it was listed the highest before. List our product on amazon at the highest price we find. Then we just pray and hope that the price point for that particular item shoots back up to the highest price by what camelcamelcamel said?

{"id":"3s01rd","author":"drteq","body":"The site was stonermall\n\nPeople - it's with a sad heart I want to let you know I received an email yesterday that Amazon cancelled my affiliate account for the shopping site I posted last week and spent time and a small \nFacebook ad spend on.\n\nI was reluctant to post this because I didn't want to impact any other companies that are doing similar but actually getting paid, but at the same time I have talked with a few people that were thinking about doing this.\n\nI've decided to post a warning, remove the old post and not mention any other sites as the best approach for the situation.\n\nIn the end I had generated an estimated between $150-$200, including all of the reddit traffic which was about 3,000 unique visitors.  I can't tell exactly how much was 'lost' because they already deleted the affiliate account and I can't even see the history.  \n\nThe reason I'm estimating is because the immediate earned commission seemed to be lagged and since the actual account was completely destroyed I have no way to find out the last days activity or if anything came through the day before.\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for applying for the Associate program. Upon review, we are unable to accept your application. A part of our criteria is that your site has to be established with enough unique content. We rejected your application due to one or more of the following reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Lack of content which is original to your site and beneficial to your visitors\n&gt; - Pages that are mainly empty when advertisement content is removed\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, we arent able to review an application once its been rejected. If your website has been further developed and now contains appropriate content, youre welcome to submit another application by using the following URL\n\n(the typo was actually in the email)\n\nIt's actually depressing to receive this denial a week after running things and getting some momentum.  Admitting failure is hard and it's always disheartening for me personally when an outside factor completely implodes on your core strategy.\n\nGood luck to anyone else out there making it work, and if you want to try it out - you are warned there may be some risk going the pure amazon route.\n\nI believe the site idea itself is viable but obviously amazon either doesn't want the business or doesn't like the idea of a better interface for their platform. :)  I'm pretty sure there are quite a few sites in the affiliate network that \"don't add value beyond products\".\n\nFuture - Many people recommended I just list my own products or products from other sites.  I'm thinking that over at the moment.  At least 20 products reached out to me from reddit so there may be a way to make this all work.   In the end I wasn't relying on the success of this site to make or break me, I'm just extremely disappointed.\n\nEDIT - \n\nI originally did not mention the site for fear of related sites getting shut down also? Maybe that was a bit silly, but regardless I realize someone will post the site against my wishes.  Which leaves the dilemma of posting so other people don't waste their time or not posting at all to protect the similar sites?  I choose to leave the post  and assume the other sites will be just fine.\n\nI reviewed a few other sites that are similar but not kicked out.  I believe perhaps having multiple sources of products could solve this problem I'm facing.  Thinking it over.\n\nRegardless, the site went from being cash flow positive to losing money right now.  Lesson learned, don't count the money until it's in the bank.  \n","name":"t3_3s01rd","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-08 13:58:36","week":45}

{"id":"3s1njq","author":"milano_siamo_noi","body":"With all these DD posts my dick has doubled in size(possibly quadrupled).  \n\nAnyway let's do a intro to futures.  Most of you already trade an underlying that technically is a derivative of a future.  UWTI/DWTI are related to crude oil.  UGAZ/DGAZ are related to Nat Gas.  NUGT/DUST are related to gold miners(or diggers) who are related to gold price.  And the big daddy of liquidity ES(E-mini S&amp;P) related to S&amp;P.  Why don't you fags trade futures instead?  \n\n\nLet's start with the advantages\n\n**Leverage.**     \nYou only need 5k and you can trade 1 contract of something.  Let's take the E-mini S&amp;P(ES), with 5k you're trading 100k worth of stuff.  So with the same result that you would get by buying 100K worth of SPY stocks you would by buying just 1 contract of ES.  1 mini S&amp;P = 500 SPY shares.  Do the math yourselves if you don't believe me.\n\n**23-5 Trading hours**.       \nOh that's right futures are open 23 hours a day 5 days a week.  Worried about AVXL crashing the market?  You can offload your futures Sunday night before the open on Monday.  Good earning report on AMZN, GOOG and AAPL?  Buy some NQ(Nasqad mini futures).\n\n\n**Taxes.**   \nWeather you hold for half a second or the month(Remember you gotta roll over to next month) you will always get taxed under the 60-40 rule.  60% of your profit from futures will be taxed as a long term gain, 40% will be taxed as short term gain.\n\n**Longing/Shorting.**   \nYou can buy or sell as you wish, no need to borrow stock or pay interest to your broker.  Long and short like you were going OCD on the body of Megan Fox.\n\n**Options.**    \nDamn right you could option on these motherfuckers and the premiums are better than NFLX on steroids.\n\nThere's no disadvantage other than you could ~~lose~~ YOLO your money.  But that's the way of the YOLO.  Obviously better than being Vanguarded to life support.  And you can always roll the contract to the next quarter or month.\n\nThe only thing you need to remember is the tick size, the more tickles to your dick the better for you.  The more tickles down your ass the more bad for you.  Unless you're shorting than it's the opposite.\n\nEDIT:  Almost forgot:  You don't need 25k in your account.  You can buy and sell 1000 contracts a day if you want.\n\nEDIT2:  thank you for the NUGT, stranger.

I have 3 CCs with them (Amazon, Marriott, and CSP) all still open that I regularly put charges on now and again. I have a checking account that has always maintained around a healthy amount of positive cash. It is my main checking account and my payroll direct deposits into it.\n\nI was prepared to call recon if I got denied but didn't need to in the end! After I got approved, I applied for 1 more Chase card and 3 Amex cards.\n\n11/8/2015 AoR:\n\n* **Chase Freedom** - Auto-approved for $7,500\n* **Hyatt** - Auto approved for $5,000\n* **Amex Platinum 100k Offer** - Auto-approved (Was targeted in the mail for this)\n* **Amex Everyday 25k Offer** - Auto-approved (Was also targeted in the mail for this... I have not managed to pull up this offer incognito at all. I think it's gone.)\n* **Amex PRG 50k Offer** - Auto-approved\n\nI created a new AMEX online account after Plat 100k was approved but have been unable to add my 2 other cards to the account. I suspect it might be because the account is too new. Hopefully I can consolidate all the cards into one account after a few business days pass.  I really don't want to make a phone call to AMEX. I didn't get the confirmation email for the Everyday card although I was approved.. not sure what's up with that.

I worked at Chase bank.  All these people pretending like it's a piece of cake are idiots.  Could it theoretically happen once in a blue fucking moon?  Yes, totally. \n\nAre they valid risks to worry about?  Not generally speaking, and definitely not if you are running a normal business.  There's also no reason that says you can't make the sale through Amazon or Ebay. You lose the fees, but you gain an insurance policy.   Amazon would require that you mail the item though, with signature, and tracking so keep that in mind.  \n\nIn the end though, you have identical protections on Paypal. You can write up a short invoice and contract stating it's as is, etc etc.  take a photo with them and their id and their signed contract.  If they try any charge backs it'll be investigated, you get to show your information and that should be that.\n\nIt's all about common sense protection and too many people don't have it and get fucked.  It's the same type of people who come on here whining about ebay or amazon not siding with them.  Due your due dilligence and you're generally gonna be okay.\n\nThat said.  Cash is the only thing you can guarantee will never be taken from you except by robbery once you get it and get back to your car.  If you're a person who likes to live in absolutes, this is the only answer.\n\nI would just meet inside a bank or some other business to avoid any drama like that.  I like banks because generally there is a lobby and if it's your normal bank they dont scream and hollar over it.  You can also go to a grocery store or inside the lobby at a police station.  Cash you have to proect yourself on site, any e-payments you protect yourself prior to the sale with signed contracts, a card swiper if ya got it, or some of the other ways I suggested.  \n\n","name":"t1_cwl7l18","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-02 04:35:42","week":45}

But in reality, you're always better off just eating shit on the transaction and refunding in full. After you get your shit back, of course.\n\n\nNever.  Ever.  Ever.  \n\nThis, in my opinion, is the very worst advice to give.  You were great through the charging a restocking, but you lost it with the rest stating it was a bad idea.   You are NOT always better off giving a refund and eating shit.  How are you better?   You lost money, you wasted time, and you didn't get shit for doing it.  I don't see a single pro in this entire scenerio of \"reality\" that you just described.  There is not a single tangible and useful Pro to ad to a list.  Don't you dare say negative feedback because that's bogus and everyones \"goto\" excuse for bending over and taking it like roman servant.  \n\nPeople like you who think this way are why there is a large and avid scam and return market.  People know they should just ask and most people will bend over like a reed in the marsh!  No no no no no no no no no.  This is how we got to this place to begin with.  \n\nIve never accepted a free return unless it's my fault. I don't do refunds outside of Amazons policy.  I don't do partial refunds.  I don't take returns on Ebay, ever. I have YET to accept a return on Ebay and ive had an active accont for about 5 years.  My account isn't suspended, my metrics aren't shit, and I haven' had any of these terrible things happen to me that people talk about.  If I can charge you a restocking fee for wasting my time you better bet your ass I am going to.  \n\nWhat's the downside?  You know, OTHER THAN keeping my hard earned money.  Seriously, fuck those customers.  Do exactly what you have agreed to do and not an inch more.  If you are part of any problem because of poor listing or service, then own the fuck up and take care of it.  Otherwise, fuck them.   No refunds.  No discounts.

Not only do they want you to lose money and time, but them go and spend the money you didn't make on a cigar?  Whaaaat?\n\nMay I ask why you think somewhere in the middle is ideal? I always refund on amazon within 30 days.  Never after.  Sometimes people are just wrong.  I don't do compromise on contracts.  Don't make the deal if you can't follow it.  It isn't as if there are any unreasonable terms on Amazon or Ebay for customer or buyer.  \n\n\nLet me ask you this.  When was the last time you sent a bunk item to a customer and they let you keep the money?  Keep ANY of the money?    \n\nI always refund/take return or whatever if I am at fault at all.  mislisted an item, a piece was missing, maybe something was broken, etc.  \n\nThat's it, and in those cases I am also obligated to, as the system should require and does.  \n\nWhat is wrong with the simple premise that people simply do what they agreed to do? When you go above and beyond on ebay or amazon you're benefiting no one except the other person who is asking for an exception to the rules because they don't want them to apply to them.  I do not believe I should take a penny of loss from a customer.  I never agreed to that.  \n\nI disagree on this from a business point, from a personal responsibility point, to an honesty point.

Now 8 years and 100,000 miles later I've gone from knowing zero about cars to changing my own brake pads, timing belt, clutch, oil change, head gasket etc.\n\nI've made a lot of mistakes but have learnt a lot. Hopefully you can learn from it.\n\n- Use every resource available: mechanic friend, Haynes Repair Manual, Owner's manual, enthusiasts online forum, Youtube, etc.\n- When doing a new procedure look through 2-3 guides. Make sure at least one is a written guide and another is a youtube video. If you just read text you get a lot of the detail but it can be hard to visualize it. If you just watch youtube videos you can visualize it but will miss out on a lot of details. By using multiple guides you're eliminating any blindspots or assumptions made. \n- Take each what each guide says and write down the steps into your own self-made guide, compiling everything you learn, onto a notepad. By writing it down you make sure you're internalizing the guides and will have notes handy to guide you through any steps you forget. Make sure you write down what tools you need and acquire them before you start.\n- Really the only tools you need to own are socket wrenches, sockets, extensions, perhaps a breaker bar, and some screw drivers. Plus a jack and jackstands to keep the car up. Quality tools last almost forever and can be acquired frugally used. The rest, special tools or torque wrenches can usually be rented at autoparts stores.\n- I like using Amazon &amp; RockAuto.com for replacement parts. \n- Before you take anything apart, take a couple photos with your phone so you can remember what you're taking apart is supposed to look like. It takes just a couple seconds but can be a life saver if you're unsure if you put things back together correctly.\n- Once you get started make sure to keep things clean and organized! I like using plastic baggies or an ice cube tray for nuts &amp; bolts (I label them with a sharpie if a project will take more than a day or two).\n- Luxuries: I like thick nitrile gloves to keep my hands clean. I also have a pair of mechanics gloves to keep my hands from being banged up too bad from loosening bolts. Another type of thick glove can help as well. A creeper can make working under cars a lot more comfortable.\n- Maintenance tip: there's no need for brand name oil as long as you maintain the proper maintenance interval.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work but good preparation and some common sense will save you time and frustration in the long run. Good luck with buying and owning a car!

They also do pay something, forgot the name at the moment, but that's just PayPal rebranded. So get an authorize.net gateway and a merchant account that's compatible. Last time I set this up you still need a PayPal account setup, make a test listing, delete the listing, and then you'll see the options for merchant accounts. You will get confused buyers (people associate eBay and PayPal together) so it's wise to say in every listing that you do not accept paypal or you're going to get a lot of order cancelations and ticked off customers.\n\nAmazon accepts Amazon Payments, as far as I'm aware that's your only option.","name":"t1_cwm2ese","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-02 22:26:48","week":45}

That puts me at about 45k to work with and this is how I've split my money thus far. \nTotal expendable per month: 3500\n\nRent (one bed 800 Sq ft greater philly area): 1185 - 200 from gf = 985\n\nUtilities: ~200 (elec and cable)\n\nStudent loan: max 450\n\nCar lease/gas: 240/100 = 340 (10 mile commute each way)\n\nFood: 300\n\nThats about it for monthly stuff and I believe that puts me around 2275 give or take maybe 100 per month. Thats net 1200 or so per month. I live by myself but my gf throws me 200/mon because she spends a lot of time at my place but is not on the lease. I put about 5% of every paycheck into savings and I've been able to accrue about $10,000 since I started 8 months ago because I've been especially frugal and I was fortunate enough to live rent free for a couple months after starting work. I've bought furniture and a TV and I have spotify premium and Amazon prime which is minimal per month. \n\nMy best advice would be as simple as keeping an eye on your account on a weekly basis. If you see for some reason you're overspending somewhere, try to cut it as much as you can. If you account for the major costs like rent, loans, car, and food you should be perfectly fine. Having your SO help will be especially beneficial, as I front all bills single handedly with the exception of the 200 for rent each month from my gf. \n\nGood luck, OP.

{"id":"cwn3tbu","author":"TheDarkPassenger","body":"To me, you have three options when buying a vehicle if you want the \"I don't want to be hassled when buying a car\" experience.\n\n1) Go to CarMax and buy from them with their no-pressure setup, but finance through your company's or community's local credit union unless CarMax is offering one heckuva low interest rate on the loan they offer you.\n\n2) Check into the local credit unions in your area, see if you qualify to join any of them, and ask if they offer a car purchasing service. In these circumstances, they will not only provide you with the best rate on a loan for financing a vehicle, but once you become a member of the credit union, they will negotiate a price on your behalf, and tell you to just go to a particular dealership, ask for a particular sales person, you sign your papers, and walk out with the keys and your vehicle.\n\n3) Use a fax machine or just email dealerships in a 50-mile radius a message with the vehicle that you want with all the features that you want. Tell them you want this vehicle with these options, and tell them you are asking all the dealerships in a 50-mile radius what their best offer is. It gives you leverage by getting dealers to bid for your business. Many won't bite, but a few will. Do this within the last five days of the month when every dealership is motivated to sell as many vehicles as possible to make their quotas. There's a site called www.fightingchance.com, which I got this technique and advice from. For a small fee to them, I got prices on Accords and Camrys, so I knew what dealerships were paying for their inventory of those two cars, and I could better assess the offers dealerships sent me.\n\nDon't always go for the jugular using this technique because if you plan to have routine service done at the dealership, you don't want to burn bridges with the people you may be interacting with on a regular basis when you bring the car in for service. A car is a depreciating asset. It has zero value outside of its ability to get you to and from work, school, home, Grandma's house, etc. safely. We spend ungodly amounts of money on cars (i.e. taxes, tires, fuel, oil changes, brakes and rotors, timing belts, wiper blades, tune-ups, etc.) They are effectively all money pits. \n\nI love cars, too, but at the end of the day, if you aren't made of money, they are a license to dig a hole in the ground, set that hole on fire, and then throw money into it over and over and over again. Choose your vehicle carefully, and the biggest expense you will have aside from insurance and taxes is fuel, so try to pick a vehicle that's a bit easier on fuel, and maybe don't go for the most powerful engine offered, since it almost certainly won't give you the best miles per gallon. \n\nIf you want a track day experience, pay for one and do it in someone else's car. Your daily driver shouldn't help you rack up speeding tickets and reckless driving charges. \n\nEdited to say that I've done business with the website mentioned, and I've bought from CarMax, but I do not work for either of them. I'm just a satisfied customer of both. The Fighting Chance people also have a book you can likely read at your local library or buy from them or Amazon.","name":"t1_cwn3tbu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-03 18:59:50","week":45}

It's inefficient and tedious to me to chase down potential things to flip or jump on BOLOs rather than simply find (IOW, discover) things I know about to a fair degree of understanding. \n\nFor example, if I were a film enthusiast, I might have a wide or working knowledge of vintage consumer film projectors. That knowledge can be used to an advantage when sourcing because I'm aware of the projectors and I know the good from the bad and their relative values to other enthusiasts. I might also be able to spot when a seller has no idea how to work a projector thus assuming what they have is broken or when a seller describes their projector incorrectly. So by simply browsing relevant sections/searches on eBay and the like, I can stumble upon deals.\n\nThat's roughly exactly how I source. On one hand, I can rip through pages on eBay pretty fast and find deals but at the same time, the largest caveat is that you're not as liquid as you might be if you were flipping hot products. However, it's a stable flow of income and it's enabled me to play with the things I flip before reselling at fairly high margin rather than shit sitting on shelves for weeks. \n\nSourcing new stuff, particularly for RA, requires homework. \n\nI've compared the online listings/ catalogs of several shops vs eBay/Amazon listings for the same products. A given store selling 1000+ products might yield ~20 flippable deals, the best part being most of these have very little competition.","name":"t1_cwn6cev","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-03 19:58:12","week":45}

That said, I like gold over dollars (as a wealth storage medium), but I can't spend it, so it's not really \"useful.\"\n\nBitcoin is ... interesting.  I'm a programmer, and I really like the bitcoin/blockchain technology.  I've done research and posited methods for using the blockchain (and thus bitcoin; they're inseparable) for everything from selling art to holding fraud-free public elections.  As a wealth-store, it's still pretty volatile, though about on par with other small currencies, and has been leveling out over the past few years.  As a currency, it's far more usable than gold, and in many cases more useful than dollars.  (When's the last time you spent dollars at Amazon? Likely you spent credit or gift-credit.)\n\nSo, both gold and bitcoin have their strengths and weaknesses, and each is good for something the other is not.

The cost of the physical space could be supplemented or offset entirely by offering merchants\"featured\" or specialized placement of items (this would obviously be at a cost to the merchant).  Heating / cooling could be supplemented by solar or other alternative power sources.  They could even have dual use from the building and use it as a regional shipping location as well.\n\nFor the consumer, it would be beneficial as you could actually touch, try on, use the merchandise and take it home immediately. (Personally I find it \"risky\" to buy clothing through Amazon.  Things like jackets, hoodies, even socks... unless I can feel the weight, thickness..etc I won't it buy it online.)\n\nIf they set it up kind of like IKEA, you could just walk around, find something you like, use your smart phone and Amazon App to \"add to cart\".  Then at the end your order has been assembled and it is ready for pick up.  Just pay through your phone and show the confirmation to a checkout / order facilitator and off you go.\n\nAs an incentive to increase Prime Membership, only allow Prime Members to buy things and make it like a \"club\" like a CostCo.. or if it was open to the general public maybe have \"Prime Days\" where Prime Members get crazy sale pricing a couple times a year.\n\nNo registers, little to no wait, get your items immediately.

{"id":"cwngdyb","author":"[deleted]","body":"Woah, great question. In fact it is so good of a question I may have to make a post detailing the steps. \n\nBut a quick overview is that once you have a niche market in mind you want to dig deep. \n\nHead into some forums, go on reddit, twitter, facebook, search google, etc. and see if you can find people complaining about something. Or complaining about a product. \n\nsearch the markets name with the words \" I can't, I hate, Why can't, this sucks, I wish, I want\" and see what comes up. \n\nGo to Amazon and see what products are targeted towards that audience and research what people are saying about those products. Bonus points if it is a hot seller on Amazon.\n\nIf I can't find any big issues in a few hours I usually move on to another niche market and see what I can dig up there. \n\n&gt;How do you present your idea to them without having a real thing?\n\nWell, that is tough and is one of the reasons that people fail. It is tough to validate ideas. With e-commerce you can have some samples made, put it on Amazon, give away the samples at half price in exchange for an honest review, if they love it great, order more and you are off to the races, if they hate it, well you have some work to do on improving that solution. \n\nI pull the trigger when I see the problem surfacing over and over and nobody is properly fixing the problem.

Pretty guilty of the typical over-working and complication of a first basic working site. I really should have had a basic MVP out the door and live a month ago.\n\nDo you think there is real benefit to individual product pages on an affiliate site? For example my main content is articles, like \"the best X for Y\", \"the top 10 X's\", or \"explaining some technical workings of X\". Most of these articles are 1000-3000 words and sometimes feature comparison tables. Lots of links to Amazon (not too many repeated), but I also have a \"more details\" sort of button, which links to an individual product page (within my site) where there is more info, images etc. This is replicating a lot of the content on Amazon and is actually a lot of work to maintain. But it's not like I'm managing a network of sites here and I can put a bit of time into this if it's going to pay off at all. Do you think that individual product pages with more information are worth it? Should I try and add some unique content to these individual pages and make each one like a mini review post in its own right?\n\nAlso I'm in the UK, should I have affiliate links to amazon.co.uk, US, both?

{"id":"cwo168i","author":"Humblesalesman","body":"Firstly the country question. Where are you targeting in webmaster tools? If it's the UK, stick with linking to Amazon.co.uk, given the difference in language (British english is so different to american english that I have to use an american spell check to remember the oddities, colour/color etc.) Traffic from USA will be minor, if anything at all. As your site grows you can work on geolocalizing links but for the sake of Earning an extra £2 a month, it really isn't worth your time worrying about it in the beginning.\n\nSince you are starting out I would skip over the \"more details pages\" and focus on the longer content. Once this longer content hits the front page of google you can test adding \"more detail pages\" to it and see if you get any more bites. In my opinion you are just adding an extra click before sending people to amazon if you do this, without seeing how your website is set out, this will almost certainly lose you conversions, particularly if the content is somewhat spun (not unique). The only thing that these \"extra details\" pages may do is rank for longer tails but to do that the content will have to be reworked to make it a little more unique.","name":"t1_cwo168i","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-04 12:50:06","week":45}

{"id":"cwo5qe9","author":"tfpriest","body":"Nice post OP, covers quite a few bases. \n\nThere should be a hidden disclaimer on this post though before a bunch of people start itching to spend a bunch of time and money trying to create their own \"passive income\" affiliate site.\n\nWhile all of the methods mentioned are great - the absolute, single most vitally important, ridiculously important, EARTH SHATTERINGLY important fact that OP only grazes on here is..\n\nTraffic. \n\nYou mention \"your audience\" numerous times and you mention saturation a few times and all of this is very vague.\n\nThe fact is, all of these methods work great if you can get traffic, and meaningful, converting traffic only comes from two sources:\n\nSEO and PPC advertising.\n\nThe true cost in all of these models can be extraordinary. I don't care if you are an expert, are a master photo editor, copy crafter, coder, and CMS wizard. \n\nThe only close disclaimer OP makes is: \"Affiliate marketing is hard work. It is boring. There is little sign of progress for months and you will have to spend hours sitting on you butt writing about things you don’t even remotely care about. It is definitely hard work but the gains (knowledge and earning) are potentially huge.\"\n\nNo KC or competition score is really going to guarantee free flowing SEO traffic from targetting keywords. Long tail traffic is hit or miss. You can adhere to all the best practices and create content until your fingers bleed but you will never, virtually ever, see success unless you are willing to invest in major SEO or PPC efforts. \n\nWhen I say SEO, I don't mean refining title tags, h1's, alt tags, and meta descriptions. Off-site SEO, at the end of the day, is what will rank a website for free organic SEO. You can spend a couple months banging out thousands of words of content and never see fruit of your labor. \n\nThe reason almost every affiliate fails is not focusing on the traffic source. A single person creating one of these sites expecting to strike riches off a couple hundred dollars worth of hosting, themes, plugins, and content is in for a big surprise. \n\nFailure.\n\nI'm just being realistic - a couple years ago you could use EMD bonuses and thin but good on page SEO to rank and bank but its almost 2016 and I can tell you from experience most of this trickery is done with and if you to succeed you will have to spend thousands of dollars on either massive amounts of content, or massive amounts of quality off-site SEO. \n\nYour month you spent creating 3 or 4 \"epic content\" posts will need to be met with another 3 or 4 months of outreach and networking or thousands of dollars in PBN's or outreach services.\n\nYou can say all day \"theres thousands of untapped niches with low competition\". It takes months, or years, to get good enough at understanding SERPS and keyword research to identify these and even then you could still be throwing paint at the wall. \n\nI'm not trying to discourage anyone from becoming a successful affiliate, but it took me a long, long time of testing and spending and creating to find something that works, stands the test of the time, holds value, and isn't subject to an algorithmic penalty by Google or risking your advertiser or affiliate accounts from bans.\n\nCreating a brand that is recognizable is extremely expensive either monetarily or time wise. \n\nSEO will take you 8-12 months especially on a new domain IF you know what you're doing.\n\nAmazon holds payments for 3 months so if you start today and did everything right, you might get some type of meaningful payment this time next year but probably not until Q1 of 2017 if you're going for strictly SEO traffic.\n\nIt takes thousands of dollars to test and learn and create a profitable PPC campaign to an affiliate site, especially when the real profit margins are ecommerce sites bidding the same keywords. \n\nBottom line for every entrepreneur or wantrepreneur wanting to create an affiliate site: You will easily burn through $5000 or hundreds or thousands of hours of time either doing out reach, creating a social media presence, creating content, or some form of all the above.\n\nRegardless if anyone disagrees with some of these points, it doesnt matter if you have a 1 page site or a 1000 page site, the absolute most critical thing you need to consider is traffic. You can skyscrape content all day, create an epic 10,000 word post, that never sees a single eyeball because authoritywebsite.com has 1 million backlinks pushing up their 200 word Q &amp; A to page 1.\n\nBest of luck to anyone pursuing an affiliate site - it's a lot, and I mean a lot of work to become successful.","name":"t1_cwo5qe9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-04 15:52:00","week":45}

{"id":"cwob1aa","author":"teamboomerang","body":"It depends on how you define a business.  The author defines a business as something that runs itself when the owner is away.  Since that's what most people think they want when they start a business, that is his approach.  It's not right or wrong.  It's just a way of thinking about it.\n\nLots of people would define the bake shop in the book as a business.  And if the owner is content with it, there's nothing wrong with this author calling it a job and the owner calling it a business.  It's just an opinion.  \n\nI think this ruffles a lot of feathers in this sub because I think a lot of us, if not most of us, want something that runs itself. We want fancy beach vacations and five-star restaurants and nice cars and big homes while our minions make us crazy amounts of money, and we know we have to work hard to get to that point.  Then we read this book, and get slapped hard with this statement.  We suddenly think everything we've done is all wrong or bad.  It's not, necessarily.\n\nI think the takeaway from this book is that you need to ask yourself periodically if what you're doing with your business is what you want to be doing. If you're working towards something that you can step away from and still make lots of money, you need to be sure you are taking steps to make that happen.  The author of the book is targeting his message to those folks, and it's really easy to get caught up in the minutiae of the day to day stuff and forget about that.\n\nSo I was unhappy with my 9-5 and decided I was going to start selling on eBay and Amazon.  I treated it as if it were a business.  I kept track of my expenses and revenues, kept personal and business separate, worked on growing my store and my sales, but then I ran out of time.  I hit a ceiling.  I had to find a way to either get more stuff in less time or find better stuff or hire someone to list for me.  \n\nI was calling that a business, but to this author, it was a job, so when I read that book, I was offended at first.  Then I realized he was absolutely right, and I was mortified.  I mean, I was telling people I had a business, and I was making big plans for warehouses and employees, but I really only had a job.  After a couple weeks, I realized that I did, indeed, have a second job, but it was a job that was perfect for me.  I got to have all the control and work when I wanted, even if that was only one hour a day.  There was no way I would ever be able to find a job working for someone else that would allow that.  \n\nI kept at it for a while anyway because I liked the money and the work, but I still kept thinking about this book because I really, really wanted \"fuck you\" money.  Then it hit me--an idea for a business, only this time, it IS going to be something that can run itself eventually, if I want it to.  \n\nHere's the thing--if I told someone I had a job selling on eBay, they would think I worked for someone else, and i would feel less somehow, and that wasn't what i wanted them to think.  I wanted them to think I was an entrepreneur, a business person, someone powerful.  I kept telling people, even after I knew I really only had a job, that i had a business partly because it was just easier to explain, but the takeaway from the book, I think, it not to get caught up in that if you truly want something more or something different.  \n\nLong and rambling, sorry, so I hope that makes sense.\n\n","name":"t1_cwob1aa","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-04 18:02:56","week":45}

Write down any of the keywords that have some sort of buyers intent or that you could sell a product in a related article.\n\nThen you can head to http://www.dmoz.org/ and Yahoos Business Listing Directory. Find your keywords and see what it brings up. These will help you explore categories that are related to the subject matter as well as give you websites to take a look at. (You can then use these websites and tear them apart taking advantage of all the keyword research THEY have done).\n\nAnother great way to find keywords and connect with people who will ACTUALLY be reading your content is forums. I cannot stress this enough. Forums are where people interact with others and want answers directly to their questions. If I wanted to hike Everest and wanted an oxygen mask while doing so, I may head over to a forum about extreme climbing and ask the members there what they would recommend. If you have a site based on extreme climbing, you could have a great article about all the things you would need during your climb, and have a section on the best oxygen masks. Forums are a GREAT resource and super easy to outrank if you have a great site.\n\nFrom here, I usually take the big list of keywords and head over to the Google Keyword Planner. Enter all the keywords and hit enter. Click on the \"keyword ideas\" tab, which will show you how many searches your keywords get. Below that box you will see a bunch of related keywords. Go through this and keep building out your list of keywords you want to target. I highly recommend you do not go for any keywords that are PURELY informational because while it can be done, selling products in these type of articles will lead to a lot less conversion. Example: If you were to do a site about blisters, instead of an article about the different types of blisters, you want an article to be about the blister treatments for each type.\n\nYou can also go back to the ad group ideas and check out some of the categories they have there. You may have missed some keywords that would be great to target. Example: I just typed in blisters, and from the ad group ideas I saw an ad group for water blisters. I clicked on this and https://gyazo.com/f4a2f5012c8b66f8d21f1cb57190e335 BOOM, great keyword to target.\n\nOnce you have your big list of keywords, you may want to make sure that your keyword is not just a hot trend for the moment. Trends are a GREAT way to make fast money in affiliate marketing but are not sustainable for long periods of time. Head over to https://www.google.com/trends/ and make sure. You can also use this to check the seasonality of your products. If you are selling motorcycle helmets in the middle of winter, you are going to have a hard time.\n\nKEY POINT: When in the google keyword tool, you will see competition as high medium or low. This has absolutely nothing to do with how hard it is to rank the keyword. This just shows how many people are spending money with google to advertise for those keywords.\n\nNext take your big list of keywords, and open up an incognito window and start Googling them. This is going to take a long time, and even longer to figure out what you are looking for, but you need to determine the competition yourself. Everyone is going to do this differently, but I take a look at the top 5 ranking pages for the keywords I want to target. I will look to see if the keyword is in the URL, ill run them through http://tools.seobook.com/general/keyword-density/ to check and see if they are keyword stuffing, and then ill run them through ahrefs or any other backlinking tool to check referring domains.\n\nTypically, the less referring domains a competitor has the better. When I write my content, i keep the keyword density at around 1% but can go up to 2% if it sounds natural but I rarely do this. I also try to get the main keyword in the URL but not JUST the main keyword. \n\nYou can also use backlink checkers to see if they have real links, or are making use of a PBN. PBNs are super easy to spot, and each post will have a link back to their site with typically a pretty bad short article. These work damn well, but my recent strat has been to stay away from them because of how many times I have been burnt in the past.\n\nThis ended up being a little bit longer than I thought it would be and is a massive wall of text. Best of luck!","name":"t1_cwodi9c","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-04 18:59:29","week":45}

Neither of us had to sell a kidney. \n\nMy husband finally got a job. I started selling things on Amazon, then learning enough to shop at thrift shops and sell higher on Amazon. \n\nIn the past 11 months, we have paid off 31% of our debt.

Last vacation was so long ago I don't remember where or when. \n\nLittle things that keep us going: our cats - good for hours of entertainment for the price of fresh catnip or a few free cardboard boxes; internet - source of entertainment, socialization, information, and my online sales; each other; small treats, whether that is always getting the good toilet paper, or a manicure every 3 months, or the occasional dinner out.\n\nThe first thing we did was keep track of every penny for 3 months, spending as usual. I found I spent much more money than I would have ever guessed on fast food.

But that person will very likely decide to go and buy on Amazon.ca instead, since that will likely be cheaper for them, if they can even get shipping from the .com store. When they buy on .ca, you get no commission. The only way I've solved this is by providing a US and a Canadian link to products.

{"id":"cwoq764","author":"Mortgasm","body":"I think you are making it a little more complex than it needs to be. \n\nYou are already going to put the  Wireless expenses on that card.  You can't get 3x anywhere else for that unless you have an Ink Plus or Ink Cash, right?   \n\nYou also already paid one AF.  It's a sunk cost.   It doesn't factor anymore into the question of the anniversary bonus.\n\nI'm not even sure the next year AF matters.  If you spend $10000 this year and they post quickly, you could cancel and not pay the AF.  (You have 90 days).\n\nSo the only question is,  'Is it worth MSing $7500 for 17,500 TYP'  \n\nWith $7500 using a 2% cashback card, you could have had $150.  And you'll pay $90 for the VGC.  So you are 'paying' $240 for the privilege of getting 17500 TYP.  \n\n$240/17500  = 1.37cpp.  You'll break even if you get 1.37cpp out of those TYP.  So if you were redeeming for a mortgage check at 1cpp, you would be losing money.  But if you got a great deal on Airfrance awards for 2cpp, you'd have done well. \n\nIf you can't decide, I would pass.  This is a marginal deal, meaning it's not a surefire winner unless you know how you would be redeeming the TYP.  Personally I wouldn't do it. \n\nBUT I don't understand why you don't count your Amazon expenses which if you used this card get 3x and would reduce the amount you have to MS.  Where are you getting better than 3x for Amazon?  You can even use MileageplusX with this card, get the 3x and 1.25x more of United miles.  You might not be evaluating that correctly and it could change the math.","name":"t1_cwoq764","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-11-04 23:54:08","week":45}

Bezos is clearly trying to outrun them with AWS's success (so far) and a series of other Hail Mary plays, but I'm worriedl that strategy won't succeed. I remember what happened to colocation providers during the dot.com crash, and IAAS is essentially colocation with an internet connection. The next recession is overdue.\n\nThat may sounds bearish, but I'm not happy about it. I was rather surprised that so many people who post here failed to appreciate the significance for AMZN of the Fire phone's failure, the least damaging aspects of which were those that were discussed so much: the embarrassment for Bezos and the write-off. Sellers of items or services that are purchased and delivered electronically via iPhone or Android mobile devices have to pay AAPL or GOOG a 30% commission, so AMZN no longer sells such items through its iPhone and Android apps. Its media and software sales are declining, slowly but steadily. A successful Fire phone running on a forked Android O/S was AMZN's best hope for stemming that erosion.\n\n\nE-commerce's growth is primarily in mobile now, less so in the U.S., where people are still more likely to make purchases on their computers, but in Asia, Africa and S.A., mobile is the primary mode for shopping, so the Fire phone's failure now hamstrings AMZN's media and software sales in most of the world.","name":"t1_cwoqyp4","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-05 00:14:34","week":45}

If you follow their very formulaic approach to making money... you have to start by subscribing to a pro-Amazon Seller account ($30 / month), so you can then spend money on Jungle Scout (about $80?), then order a butt load of inventory from CHINA through Alibaba, where you'll inevitably double the cost per unit with shipping (which might take a month)... only to have it intercepted at some port in California, and pissed on by Amazon once it get to their FBA shipping center. \n\nNo thanks.\n\nI'd much rather walk my ass to the Dollar Tree, pick out a few items, and sell them on Amazon for a few dollars - which sounds to me like what RA is, no? \n\nAnyway, for those of you who sell your retail purchases on Amazon, are you all using FBA?

Just remember, there is more to investing than 1 company's over circlejerked funds. \n\nYou won't learn anything about investing in one of their funds. I'm sorry but you won't. You won't see what they do with your money or how it works. Just that it will fluctuate up and down.\n\nIf you want to genuinely get interested in/learn about the stock market, I say you break that 1,100 up into 2 halves and buy 2 different stocks with it. Maybe you don't know exactly how to research stocks yet, but 2 stocks of companies that you see around you in your daily life. You can read the news about these companies and see how they are doing.  \n\nThese aren't my suggestions, but just examples - Walmart, Amazon, Exxon, Chevron, PG, Home Depot, Disney, etc. \n\nSure it's more risky than throwing it into a vanguard fund, but I think the reward of you learning about the stock market and possibly making a nice return much outweighs that risk. And if you lose some, oh well. In the grand scheme of life, this $1100 will be peanuts. None of those companies I listed are going to go to 0. \n\nI'm sure my advice is going to get downvoted by the vanguard circlejerk and ripped apart, but I think that by investing in physical companies that you know, it will motivate you to follow the market and those companies much more than just throwing it all in some vanguard fund.

Even Moto's recent fall from grace is an example of the inherent benefits of having the entire ecosystem owned and operated by a single entity. That being said, Apple isn't without fault in the mobile space. Each passing update makes my corporate-issued 5C worse and worse. And I think they quit providing updates to the 5 (4S?) a few releases ago. But that's the way things go. Most people have a 2 year lifespan on their phone (long enough to get a new subsidized one with a contract). \n\nI think this is a good example of how Amazons Fire tablets (with the cheapest model being $50) and relatively closed ecosystem can be successful. It works for Apple and a lot of people love it. I also think there's a significant difference between the random no-brand $50 tablet you find on random sites and Amazons offering at the same price (I.e. the former sucks, the latter is a fine device). \n\nLaptops and desktops are a whole other beast. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree there. My Windows PC and HTPC were built 5 years ago and still perform excellently, especially with the occasional upgrade.

{"id":"cwql11g","author":"teamboomerang","body":"For someone just starting in clothing, I would advise choosing one \"section.\"  Men's shirts or men's athletic clothing, for example.  I say that because the entire clothing section would just take too long and be too overwhelming, and one section is usually an aisle or two.  You can gradually add sections as you feel comfortable.\n\nAnd the only way to learn is to just start looking stuff up.  After a while you'll start to learn which brands to avoid and which ones sell, and you'll start to learn to spot certain brands without even looking at the label.  However, when you start a new section, you need to look things up again.  For some brands, certain things sell and certain things do not.  Some brands sell well if they're women's, but not men's and vice versa.  For some brands smaller sizes sell but larger ones don't and vice versa.  \n\nAnd don't just write off lesser brands like Target or Old Navy.  Not everyone has one in their town, and for them it's cheaper to buy online.  The style is important, too, and many times the style matters more than the brand.  Just an example but I buy 35 pound bags of dog food for my dog.  I hate hauling it in from the car, so I'm willing to pay a couple bucks more to order it from Amazon because it's delivered to my door, and I don't have to remember to go to the pet store when they're open.  People shop that way for literally everything, including clothing.  I have Target and Old Navy in my town, but some people have to drive an hour one way to shop at one, so if they know Target brands fit them really well, they'll order online. \n\nAnother little tip for clothing is if you find something with a better label, check that size and gender carefully because more than likely there will be other items as well.  People don't usually donate just one shirt--they clean out their closet.","name":"t1_cwql11g","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-06 13:59:48","week":45}

{"id":"cwqreb9","author":"drzowie","body":"Amway is the granddaddy of all the multilevel marketing outfits.   It works by being a pyramid scheme, with sufficient \"working parts\" that look legitimate, to head off prosecution.\n\nBack in the 1960s and 1970s, the \"business\" part of Amway was actually a pretty good deal:  it was a way for individuals to get involved with the distribution system, without the up-front expense of a brick and mortar store.  In those days, distribution market friction was high, because inventories were controlled by people -- so you had multiple layers of organizations whose job was to take large quantities of items (coming from factories or whatever) and cut them up into slightly smaller quantities of items (going to individuals or to smaller consumers).  The jobber/distributer/regional-wholesaler/retailer system worked, but it worked pretty inefficiently, and by getting people to spend \"hobby time\" doing the information management, Amway could compete with that system just fine.  Other companies also did the same thing quite successfully.  Tupperware, Avon, Kitchen Craft, Herbalife, Kutco, and others fit in that genre.\n\nThe problem with all of those schemata is that modern distribution systems are *fecking efficient*.  The transition to big-box retail and JIT delivery removed two layers of the distribution system (so that, say, Home Depot or Walmart go straight to jobbers or factories, and sell directly to consumers, distributing from their own networks of large store/warehouses). Modern quasirobotic (and fully robotic) picking systems are allowing folks like Amazon to jump even further, going straight from jobbing to the consumer even without the physical presence of a large store capable of retail interaction.\n\nThe hand-to-hand-to-hand, divide-by-ten-to-thirty system of distribution just can't compete with terabyte databases and picking systems.  (I haven't looked closely at Amway in years, but I understand that now they've even streamlined the goods drop-off, so members can order stuff shipped directly from Amway HQ in Ada, MI -- though the markups and \"distribution\" bennies still go to the recruitment network. )\n\nThe shady part of Amway and Herbalife and all the others is that they're *unstable to pyramid-like behavior*.  All of them offer legitimate business models (distribute goodies, take a markup) but deliberately leave the door open for unscrupulous operators to engage in pyramidal activity.  They do that by offering bonuses for recruitment, unto the *n*^th generation, and by allowing associations of \"distributors\" that themselves market tools directly to the distributors.  The distributor networks that grow fastest happen to be the ones that are the most like pyramid schemes.  That is no accident, it is designed -- but it gives the parent corporation plausible deniability.\n\nThe \"catch\" is that the market is pretty saturated.  You end up trying to sell overpriced (compared to market) goods to friends and family, leveraging your personal connections as a marketing tool.  Some of the products are complete crap, some are very good -- but the only advantage you have compared to the larger industrial-distribution outfits is the hope of living the American dream.  If you want to \"make it big\" as an Amway distributor, you have to sell that Amway distribution network idea -- at which point you're a pyramid operator just like any other.","name":"t1_cwqreb9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-06 17:17:33","week":45}

Have you ever talked to anyone who's said their job is selling Amway?  Have you ever talked to them three months later and had them say they're still doing it?  Likely not.

The problem is that making money in these depends on selling the IDEA, not any product, to other people.  If you get two friends to sign up they know that you've already hit up all of your mutual friends, so that shrinks the size of their potential targets.  \n\nI'm actually amazed something like Amway is still in business.

What that means, is that they do very little business outside of their own people who are supposedly selling their stuff to other consumers to make money.  The reality is that while they catalog isn't bad in terms of quality, it is not priced very competitively, and delivery and order fulfillment falls way short of places like Amazon.\n\nAll of that is really moot, though, since the scariest part of Amway is the cult-like way they build up the pyramid.  Not only are you sucked into the act of selling products, the \"real\" money involved is in recruiting and building your own pyramid underneath you, and they are relentless about absorbing you into the culture of training, marketing, and \"self-improvement\" in order to \"help\" you build your network.\n\nMost of the stories out there, in fact, revolve around people who get pulled deeply into the multi-level marketing portion and ruining themselves trying to build their own little piece of the pyramid and funneling endless money into their training and marketing machine all while providing a false sense of success to their peers by over-extending on things like luxury cars, etc.","name":"t1_cwqstg5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-06 17:52:11","week":45}

{"id":"cwqu3ng","author":"bitwarrior80","body":"We had bed bugs two years ago and we got rid of them without calling in the exterminator or using poison. I had this old laminate wood bed frame which was like a bed bug condo in every nook and cranny. It was a nightmare I can tell you! The first step was to get rid of the infested bed frame. The second step, I bought bed bug mattress and pillow covers. 3rd. we took all of our old cloths and sealed them up in bags and tossed them out. 4th, Isolated the bed by moving it away from the wall, night stand, literally anything the bugs could use to crawl up to the mattress. You have to realize, that as the food source you are the most important thing to the bed bug's life cycle. This is what makes them so terrifying, but it is also the key to defeating them. By isolating their food source (you) the bugs will concentrate where ever they have the easiest access to feed. The last thing you want once you know you have an infestation is to not sleep on your bed. That will only cause them to disperse around your home. Now this is the part where the prey becomes the hunter! Buy a bag of dichotomous earth (its a non-toxic powder that kills the bugs.) and a buy a pack of reusable plastic containers. Fill up the containers with dichotomous earth and place one under each leg of your bed frame. If you don't have a traditional metal bed frame get one. This won't work with a mattress on the floor. You can find one on amazon for pretty cheap http://amzn.com/B006MIUM20. Also liberally apply dichotomous earth to every nook and cranny in your bed room. Now the trap is set, any bedbug that tries to crawl up or down the leg of the bed frame has to pass through the dichotomous earth filled container, thus killing them. You should continue to wash your sheets frequently and inspect anyplace you might suspect bedbugs could hide. We left our bed like that for a few months just to be safe and have not had a problem with bedbugs ever since. Good luck to anyone who has to deal with these terrible pests.","name":"t1_cwqu3ng","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-06 18:22:56","week":45}

{"id":"cwqzwdq","author":"ImjusttestingBANG","body":"Hijacking my boyfriend's log in to comment here. I work for Amway. Actually, technically I work for the Alticor group of companies to which Amway belongs. I work in their logistics / distribution company and am based in Europe. \n\nAmway is not a bad company in itself. As an employee, I have 0 complaints about them when compared to the other companies I have worked for (mainstream big names).  But like any business, it makes money from people buying stuff. I think many of the products are too expensive, although several of them are superior to supermarket choices. Their food supplements (vitamins etc) range is very good in my opinion. \n\nTheir European logistics is actually pretty modern, operating more like other e-commerce companies too. It's perhaps not as modern as the Amazon robot picking machines, but it's a pretty smooth, slick organisation. Not just saying that - 4 years ago I'd never heard of Amway, so I was very surprised at the modern and professional set up. Sure, some Amway IBOs still order in bulk and distribute their orders personally to their downlines. But lots of people now order online and their orders are shipped directly from the warehouse to the IBO at home. Every day, tens of thousands of products are shipped out from the location I work in. So from that side of things, it's like any other legitimate business. \n\nI have met brand new IBOs who didn't earn a penny yet. I have met ancient IBOs that are filthy rich. And everything in between. I've seen people go on luxury resort trips, all expenses paid. I have met people who were going on paid cruise trips. I have met prospects who were unsure and after a couple of meetings decided it wasn't for them. For the goodies, you need to qualify by generating new IBOs and selling products. Lots of both!! It's not a free ride or get rich quick scheme. \n\nWhat you need to remember like everyone else has said is that it relies on 1) buying and selling products and 2) getting other people to do it with you and for you: your downlines. It's perfectly possible to earn a lot, but it's not quick, it's not easy, and it's not guaranteed. And you really do need to be a salesperson with excellent people skills to have a remote chance of success. \n\nWould I be an IBO? No. I'm a practical, stop talking shit and let me get on with it type of person. I couldn't sell a product if my life depended on it. But if you are good at selling, if you really have the time and willingness to go for it? Sure it can work for you. But it's also a case of pot luck and gathering enough downlines. Those people that I have met that are an IBO live and breathe Amway, they are emotionally connected to that business. They are batshit crazy about Amway. I'm not: it is a business like any other business, it has good sides and bad sides, but they don't screw over more people than the average stockmarket listed big name. In fact, overall they're a pretty nice bunch to work for. \n\nIs it a pyramid? Well, yes, because those at the top earn the most. But that is true for any business in our capitalist western society. The CEO of Vodafone earns a hell of a lot more than their contactcenter employee. \nIn a way also no, because what you buy, you get. I can assure you that the products are there and are shipped :) And they do pay out the bonuses, etc. It wouldn't still exist as a company if they were faking that either. But you do need to 'grow the business' in order to make money. Which in my opinion isn't easy. People don't like being approached to buy stuff or for 'opportunities'. Inherently we are sceptical and with good reason!\n\nPersonally? If you have time, and you enjoy sales, and you don't mind people avoiding you, give it a try. The possibilies for a high income are there, but aren't easy to achieve (because it's an old company, lots of people above you heavily invested in it already, they're the one earning the top dollars).  If you just want a job, go and get a job. You'll get paid by the hour, you won't be the CEO any time soon, but you'll get the preagreed amount each month. I would always choose the latter, but then I don't find that a high income guarantees happiness and longevity. \n\nAs for the numbers, you can earn a lot, but you have to put in a lot. You won't get shit for free and there's no guarantee that the time and money you put in will be returned financially.

{"id":"cwrcfdk","author":"jrossetti","body":"There are two sets of fees on Amazon.\n\nOne is fulfillment fees, and those are only charged to FBA members.  It includes the packing, wrapping, shipping, postage, labor, boxes, tape, and anything else needed to mail that item to the customer.  This cost is almost always going to be cheaper than normal postage cost for MF.  On top of that, you dont even have to worry about supplying anything.\n\nThis market isn't as good as it was last year, and you will make more if you bundle it with a game as well.\n\nDont use the old wii fits, get the new wii fit plus. \n\nThose legs sell for about 10 bucks too.\n\nEdit: Plot hole!  Forgot the other part.  THe second set of fees are just for selling on Amazon and relate to the final sale price and such.  These fees are identical for both MF and FBA.  Basically, look at the fees I am copying here.\n\nNow tell me that's not worth sending it all in?  FBA is best for the seller who can sell 40 items a month.  If you have 100 items, Id say go for it. You have one month to see how well it works, and that's gonna be your motivation.  PLus this is quarter 4, everyone buys all the shit this time of year.   It's ridiculous.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201119410\n\nI dont know why people keep trying to argue this on this sub, but it's flat out next to impossible to beat Amazons rates for shipping, AND they supply all of the materials.  You just need to score boxes to send in a bunch of stuff at once.\n\nOnce you factor in OPPORTUNITY COST, it's a no brainer.  My advice.  Flip to FBA.  Everytime an item sells, ad that time to your source budget. Once you have enough time banked for a worthwhile trip, go and source for that hour and get some more items.  You HAVE to treat this like a business once you get into FBA and keep those items going in.\n\nWe're up to about 200-300 sales per month now and we send a minimum of 100 items in per week and do it consistently.

{"id":"cwrd48m","author":"jrossetti","body":"Even better is you can still sell those items on ebay if you wish, I just find it's quicker and easier to not.  You get a higher price point on Amazon and if it is allowed to be sold there, it'll nearly always sell faster and for a higher price point.  \n\nFBA is a brilliant way for you to make money while a student.  Just make sure you set aside a sourcing day.  There are tons of other opportunities you can do as well while a student!! Lots of students sell their games to gamestop for a new one. Offer to buy for a few bucks more and do it yourself and you can even come to them for pickup.  As long as you do your homework you should be fine and have a constant source of income.\n\nYou can use the amazon labeling service, we do.  But you can't let them label everything, and you need to mark any similar items very clearly.\n\nYou will love having more space. Now a typical day for us is sourcing for a couple of hours, come back list it all, split it up into shipments and at least once a week we send it all in.  If you're without a car just remember it's cheap to use an uber or lyft or taxi to go a mile or two.  If you follow the system and only buy when you can make double you can afford that extra expense considering you'll be making it back eventually anyway.  (assuming you research properly)\n\nGive it a go man. If you want more anecodotal evidence I can go all day long, but the other thing you can do is try searching reddit for posts from....well...anyone, who's started doing FBA and hates it.  \n\nNo conversely you can easily find posts about success stories.

You wrote \"often I'll store content in a database and then create pages dynamically, so that the same content can appear on different pages in different ways/formats\" — can you elaborate? Is the content generated based on user searches or..?\n\n2. In regards to content sites, while it seems like your approach is to exhaust a subject and move on, do you go back to the sites and add specific posts/content based on what visitors have searched for after the site has been launched?\n\n3. While on that subject, are your top earners content sites or dynamic?\n\n4. Do you have \"service\" sites? Those are the ultimate in terms of hands-off, allowing you to not even have to create the content in the first place, just add functionality. If so, are any of those in the top 6?\n\n5. You talk about one site getting unexpected Google love and you leveraging that. I wonder, are all your top earners in the same niche then? Or do you have at least two entirely distinct niches bringing significant revenue?\n\n6. I'm surprised to learn you don't use Wordpress on all your sites, it's rare these days. I wonder, were your PHP sites penalized by the recent \"mobile-friendly\" update, or did you take steps to make your sites responsive before the update hit?\n\n7. How do you manage security? A few years back, on one of my sites running on a custom framework we had a security hole we didn't catch in time. Hackers got in, installed tools on the server, and proceeded to attack other sites from our server. That's one of the reasons why, these days, I'll always prefer pre-made solutions were holes are found by the large userbase before anyone with malicious intents (that, and I have to deny half of China's IP ranges basically).\n\n8. You've recently started doing niche research prior to entering a market. What would the SERP for a GOOD niche look like? Describe the top 5 results. Are they Amazon, YouTube, etc or..?\n\n9. Of your top 6 earners, how many rank #1 for the target keyword?

{"id":"cwrfpvt","author":"gabriel87120","body":"For this game, I'm going to try to spend 1-2 minutes analyzing each chart quickly so it mimics quick trading decision making. And try to be fair I won't read the news or earnings to keep this as pure of Technical Analysis as I can. So this is going off of nothing I know about the companies personally, and just what the charts show. This leaves the door open to error from a fundamental I do not know, but I am trusting the price action to have built in these fundamentals on the short term for me already.\n\nHere's the format of each response:\n\n[Stock chart link] - Price we need to break above for bullish confirmation based on momentum - price to break  below for bearish confirmation based on momentum - my ultimate prediction for a 1-3 day move (negating single day overall market down day) - and any explanation to go with it.\n\n\nThe two price targets I state if crossed will change the momentum in said direction. This is because that instrument is in consolidation in the short term, meaning the price has settled out. It can go either way, so the backup estimation comes from momentum alone to choose whichever I think it will be. When I trade however, I just watch whichever of the support/resistance line wins and then make my trade. You will blast through one, and the one that is followed is the winner. Since most of these are in consolidation, they each really have two answers as of now. Consolidation will break at the open of the trading day Monday, and then within a few minutes you will know the real answer to each. So my guess will be either proven wrong or correct, but the real answer to these is \n\n\"long if the support holds, short if it doesn't\" or \"short if the resistance holds, long if it doesn't\"\n\nThese estimates are also a 1-3 day swing trade just to eliminate any short term market tank/rally's effect.\n\nHere we go!\n\n\n[AMZN](http://i.imgur.com/JNf2uWE.jpg) - 659.05 - 654.9 - Long. In a TTM squeeze currently with upward momentum, three support lines and no resistance lines. Could be way up.\n\n[FB](http://i.imgur.com/NdkPJMz.png) - 108.81 - NA - Short. FB will trend down for a few days to meet that support line at 104-ish, then from there it will either test and go up, or fail the support and fall.\n\n[DIS](http://i.imgur.com/Y0sJQ1e.png) - 115.59 for both - Long. DIS closed in consolidation, so immediate price action at open will dictate trend either way. I'm on the fence with this knowing nothing but Star Wars is awesome, so I would say the immediate trend is up so Long as long as we follow the support lines drawn, or a slight gap down to meet the SMA and then bullish for the week.\n\n[WMT](http://i.imgur.com/R3klIZi.png)  - 58.87 for both - Long. WMT closed in consolidation on the hourlies, so immediate price action at the open will dictate trend either way based on which consolidation line is broken. There was a gap up at $58.19 yet to be filled (bullish), there are also two drawn established support lines and one resistance line. 2 &gt; 1, so slightly bullish in the short term. Momentum is up but we are in a squeeze and also consolidation, so it can go either way. My guess is it will go flat to up. The long term trend is down with increasing momentum likely 3-6 months from establishing a base for a bottom and consolidation in a $50-60 range. In the near term it's very oversold on the weeklies so a weekly long play to slowly drift to meet a $62 -$63 price target possibly higher over the course of a month or two [like this](http://i.imgur.com/uOYOMSn.png) would also be a long short term swing to meet the weekly resistance line which the obvious trade from there would be to test a short again. \n\n[F](http://i.imgur.com/bm6MkL2.png) - $14.50 - NA - Short. Gap down that hasn't been filled, momentum to the downside on the dailies. It closed at the drawn support line of $14.50, if it crosses above it can trade up very short term, but my call is that it won't. Also, F has been, and will always be a shitty trader. It has for the last 15 years traded in a narrow $10 window. I've never owned a Ford or a Ford share for that matter lol. \n\n[PAY](http://imgur.com/2C7n8U1) $30.99 -NA - Long. There is a gap down at $32.66 not filled, and a gap up at $28.53 not filled. Unfilled gap ups are bullish in the long run, and this guy needs to test $32.66 before I'd even call bearish. There are two support lines and no resistance, and momentum on the dailies just went positive this last trading day. If we open above $30.99 and bounce off the drawn support line, bullish.\n\n[AA](http://i.imgur.com/cNnUfpm.png) $9.25 - $9.05 - Short. Price is consolidated at $9.12, so action to pass either support or resistance in the short term will dictate short term price action. A lot of these are consolidating and that's because of the S&amp;P itself trading to a consolidation point into the close of 2100 on the dot. I call down because the momentum is down as of yesterday. At least to test the $8.61 lows.\n\n[CSCO](http://i.imgur.com/UAP804v.png) $28.46 - $28.39 - Long. We've broken through all resistances and created a new support Friday. As long as we trade above $28.46 and don't cross down the support it's a buy. That indicator at the bottom is one I created for determining if there are more buyers or sellers on a momentum basis. It's green so I say long. That little number in the top left is my indicator of a reversal. &lt;-0.7, it will pop up very soon, &gt;0.7 it will fall down. It's less than -0.7 so I'd be a buy on the short term.\n\n[WFM](http://i.imgur.com/GXRiEz9.png) $30.93 - NA - Long. It has consolidated, and looks like it can go lower, but I believe it will trade up to the major resistance line drawn from it's fall since April. Momentum points upward on my indicator and as long as the support holds it's long, else it's short on the cross down. Could be a good low forming and we'll know Monday morning.\n\n[LL](http://i.imgur.com/knB18Au.png) $17.09 - $16.43 - Long. It consolidated like many of the others. As the rest go, whichever winner comes out at the beginning of the day is the line to follow. Momentum is upward, so I choose long.\n\n","name":"t1_cwrfpvt","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2015-11-07 03:57:55","week":45}

The rest of the items I just shipped out today to Amazon FBA. Due to separating out a few items (separating 6 packs to sell individually etc) i still should make around $1000 profit. Interestingly enough, almost every single product had Amazon FBA labels.","name":"t1_cwrh54h","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-07 04:45:56","week":45}

{"id":"cwrq5gp","author":"pbspry","body":"1.  Example: I have a website that is basically a directory of locations - many many thousands of them around the US and Canada.  Let's say 10,000 to keep it simple.  For each location I've written a couple of paragraphs of text, have geolocated its latitude/longitude on a map and show its Google Street View image.  All of that content is in the database, so I've written 10,000 \"pages\" of content in that respect.  But the site is dynamic, meaning there are many different ways that the same content is displayed.  I.E. there is a \"single location\" page showing all of that data (10,000 of them).  There is a \"city page\" showing all locations within a particular city.  (about 35,000, one for each city).  There is a \"state\" page showing all locations in that state (50 of them + Canadian provinces).  There is a \"county\" page showing all locations in that county (something like 3,000 counties).  And then there's a \"what's nearby?\" page that geolocates the user automatically and shows what's within a 50 mile radius.  So I wrote 10,000 pages of content, but the site has something more like 50,000 actual \"pages\" based off of that content.\n\n2.  I will go back to sites and update/expand them every couple of years or so.  Deciding what to update and how varies widely but I'll always take user feedback into account.  \n\n3.  Most of my sites are dynamic in some way, some more than others.  They are all content heavy but whenever possible I try to store the content in a database and display it in multiple different ways (both to \"stretch\" the total amount of content on a site and to more easily do multivariate A/B testing)\n\n4.  Not really.  I always have content of my own creation at the source of my sites.\n\n5.  Of my top earners, 4 are in the same sub niche, and the other three are each in individual, more or less unrelated niches.\n\n6.  I never saw a mobile penalty, and I still have several sites that aren't yet responsive.  That said, I have seen a decent bump in mobile traffic when I do make them fully responsive.  So I've definitely seen gains with responsive design, but haven't seen any steep drop-offs for the sites that are still stuck at 1000 pixel width templates.  (That could change and its something I'm working on still.)\n\n7.  Yeah, I hate hackers.  I block all access to my servers by default - only a list of approved IPs can get in.  Makes it a bit of a pain when you're traveling but it eliminates 95% of all headaches I used to have to deal with.  Still have issues with DDOS from time to time but CloudFlare looks like the next solution we'll look into for that.\n\n8.  If I saw the top results for a potential niche as Amazon and Youtube I'd be SUPER excited (unless I'm looking up a book title or song title) - because that would mean there are no actual websites that cater well to that keyword yet.  More often you'll just get normal search results for other websites.  Good opportunities would be the 1-2-3 spots are linking to sub-pages of other, larger (less focused) sites.  Or if 1-2-3 are narrow and topical but aren't done very well - poor writing, small amounts of content, outdated, etc.  If you see the 1-2-3 spots and think to yourself, \"Hey, I can do WAY better than this\" - that's usually a good sign that this is a market you can be competitive in.\n\n9.  Top six earners... off the top of my head I'm #1, #1, #3-4, #2, (not ranked, more on this later) and #1.  The \"not ranked\" one is a bit unique because its actually our #1 site in terms of unique visitors (but not in total earnings).  We get HUGE amounts of google love there, but it is all long-tail linking to specific pages deep within the site.  We get almost zero google love to the homepage on our primary keyword.  But, the site is only 2 years old, and its a very busy niche with lots of competition, so hopefully that will change over time.  (Our main competitor for the homepage keyword dates back to the late 1990s... it'll take a while to unseat him, if I ever do!)\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_cwrq5gp","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-07 13:01:38","week":45}

{"id":"cwrsnvv","author":"teamboomerang","body":"As a potential customer of a subscription box, let me give you my thoughts.  I've thought about and researched many of these, including dollar shave club and all of the makeup ones and loot crate.  I started with dollar shave club because razors are expensive as hell and more expensive than they need to be.  Tried couponing for them because you can often get them for free that way, but that was just a pain in the ass.  Ended up finding Dorco, and now I buy razors for my son and I there.  They're cheap, and they work.\n\nWith the makeup subs, I've been tempted a few times.  See, I stopped wearing makeup for a long while, and I wanted to get back into it because let's face it, society expects a woman to look put together, and it makes a difference in business.  My coloring has faded with age, though, and I don't know a thing about all these new products, so I though a box would be a great way for me to try some new things at a low cost.  I thought it might be a cheap way for me to build up a bit of inventory.  It was always going to be temporary, and if I did find products in there I liked, I would look for the cheapest place to get it or look for a cheaper alternative.  I never ended up subscribing to a makeup box because I can get samples from Sephora and department store makeup counters, AND I get personalized service.  There is less risk of getting samples of something I don't like or that doesn't work for me, and I don't have to pay for them.\n\nLoot crate I was only thinking of subscribing to to resell the stuff, and I haven't because I know lots of other people already do that, and I'm conservative, so I'm not sure I want to risk it.\n\nSo you might think I would subscribe to something if you found the right thing, and maybe you are right, but I'm probably only going to subscribe for something I know I'm going to use and only if it's cheaper or only a tiny bit more expensive for convenience.  And guess what, most of what I would subscribe to I can already get on Amazon prime, and I can already \"subscribe and save\" and set the frequency I want.  \n\nI like the idea of getting fun goodies in the mail, but even if I do end up deciding I am willing to spend the money, it's probably not going to be for much more than a year.  I even like some of the ideas people have come up with for boxes, but I wouldn't want them for a whole year.  I might want them on a one shot deal for a gift.  Like right now I might buy my step-brother a Colorado Springs box because he misses the Air Force Academy.  He still goes back to visit, but it would be a thoughtful gift for me to give him.  I'd be willing to buy that box because I don't live there and can't get there easily to do it myself.\n\nI think these boxes can be profitable, and I like the idea, but I think you need to go into it with the realization that this is temporary for the great majority.","name":"t1_cwrsnvv","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-07 15:23:18","week":45}

I will often buy Amazon.com cards at the grocery store, but obviously there are dozens of stores to choose from.\n\n* 3% at gas stations.\n\n* 3% at major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others). \n\n* 1% on everything else.  \n\n* Varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back, $10 off a $10 purchase at walmart, $5 off a $5 purchase from itunes/app store, I have used all of these personally) that vary with time.  There are usually like 20-30 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods.\n\n* An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.\n\n* Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).  A free yearly FICO score.\n\n* And perhaps the most important thing of all,... \"among the best customer satisfaction\" of all the credit card companies ( http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-us-credit-card-satisfaction-study ).\n\n* Last tidbit is a story I would like to share.

{"id":"cwsbera","author":"jrossetti","body":"Your first mistake was not factoring this in before buying and it sounds like your source wasn't the best.  The price point certainly.\n\n\nYour second mistake is assuming you'd only make a dollar on FBA.  I'm a huge FBA supporter, give me the item that you sold and I'll give you better details.\n\nItems on amazon generally sell for MORE money than on Ebay, and items on FBA generally sell for more than non FBA items on Amazon.  FBA prices also include all of the materials for fulfillment and includes full protection from scams, claims, or anything else in the form of a reimbursement as if it the item sold.  You still wouldn't have made that much, but it's quite likely youd have made equal or a bit more.  \n\nNow, you have to look at this from a more reasonable point of view.  You made 5.58.  How much time was spent doing so? Was that the ONLY item you bought?  For example if you were in target buying shit and you ran acrossed that and on a whim scanned it and sent it in your total time is about 10 minutes for 5.58. That's still over 50 bucks an hour in pay.  If capital is not an issue, this could be a money making business model for you.  However I would advise against it.\n\nSource better. If you can't at least double to triple your money, then you should be holding out for better items.  If capital is no issue, then you should be focusing on fast selling items, and three weeks isn't too bad for that.\n\nNow you asked how to find items like that?  Generally speaking you won't get that kind of ROI from internet deals or from retail arb.  You tend to find those in craiglist, thrift shops and places like that.\n\nFor example I snagged some ti platinum calculators from the thrift this weekend for 1.50 each.  Those sell for 60-70 bucks online.  I know they will sell, so that's going to be massive ROI.  \n\nYou didnt' lose any money man, you learned a lesson, and you got your first flip and unless you spent like an hour to source and send that item you still made great dollars per HOUR.  \n\nWhat you can afford to buy for flipping will largely depend on your situation.  I for example have a year round business that brings me excellent money for most of the year so I am less worried about sales rank/time as I know that I am going to be getting more money from somewhere else.  I dont need that to flip as fast.  The advantage is I was able to build inventory with slower moving, but profitable items and hold for them to sell.  \n\nFor example I bought some toners for the large printing presses for 15 each and have had them listed for 105 for 9 months.  Both finally sold last week for a combined take home of 150 to 160 or so.  Even after factoring a years worth of storage for their space I came out WAY ahead.  However, that isn't nearly as useful as someone who only has 500 bucks to work with right now and can't get more.  \n\nNow to address your last point. I think you're crazy in how you are approaching this.  You spent time online to find that deal and then list and sell. The advantage to RA is you can theoretically source a shit load of an item for smaller profit. Most items that are in retail stores sell at a pretty regular clip.  So if you have tons of cash to throw at it, you can stick to this method and be okay.\n\nHowever, if you're not going to be investing mass amounts of money to make that profitable, minute for minute, you're usually better sourcing at a thrift but I have no idea how your market is.  I can easily spend a grand a week at local thrifts and guarantee a doubling of my money every time.  If you expand your market you can almost always find something worthwhile. I am over a year in and I can still count on one hand how many thrift shops resulted in me not getting at least $20 an hour.  \n\nNow I'm going to throw something out there for you to consider.  You appear to really value your time.  Do you have any  nieces or nephews or someone who you can hire?  You can go out with them and teach them how to scan barcodes first.  Theres plenty of items that can make profit and if you give them a clear route and process on what to do while inside. (Go to the cd's and scan all barcodes with the seller app, buy anything that sells for 3x or higher the cost of it.\n\nDo the same for all video games. (don't even get into saying sports games are shit, let them learn that through repeated shops on their own), you could even have them scan books too.  Then if you really want to get them going you can have them look up items manually while in the store for things like toys that are not barcoded although that will require some trust and good training on your part.  \n\nI started paying someone $20 an hour to do cleaning 7 days a week at my house and have instead spent that time sourcing.  We generally make 50 to 100 an hour sourcing so paying $20 to someone else was a no brainer.  Our next step is to pay someone to clean, label, box, and ship our FBA shipments.  \n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that a solid sourcing plan will easily support hiring help for a task that you're personally doing that ISN'T making you money. Maybe it's cleaning your home walking your dog, what have you.  Either hire someone to source, or pay someone to do shit you're currently doing and go source yourself.  \n\nNow please keep in mind that I am in a very urban area and although I believe this policy will work for most flippers, there is a portion of the population who are in areas this would not apply.  I see no reason this can't work for you though as long as you are in a major city or suburbs.  \n\nI know that ive been able to find source opportunities in the most rural of areas and made several purchases, but since I was simply traveling through i have no idea how often inventory is refreshed and whether it can be consistent.  I do know that's not an issue for my primary locations.  I have one thats a 5 minute walk from my house that i can pull 300-700 in profit a week out of consistently :P\n\nLastly, part of being more efficient is being able to sell more items.  That involves unlocking various categories.  This can be incredibly useful for things like health and wellness as well as beauty products as you can find soaps, shampoos, and supplements at any number of places. Unlocking them can be the biggest trial of your patience that you have ever experienced :P\n\nSorry for the long post, hope it's useful for ya!\n\n","name":"t1_cwsbera","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-08 01:04:56","week":45}

Most of the easy, fast and free ones won't necessarily get you straight on the path of right back into college but they will certainly help you hone the skills you have and possibly expand them.  As someone else said, we're nearing the holiday season and perhaps getting a retail job within walking/bussing distance might be a nice start as well.  Also, a lot of retailers will hire out of their temp pool if they choose to hire permanently after the holiday season so that can give you a nice leg up.  \n\nIf you'd like any additional information about MOOCs just ask! \n\nAnd no, generally college credits do not expire.

I'm looking to work with other bloggers and vloggers, share info, share contacts, share knowledge, etc. The way to attract readers is to add value. I could blog about whatever I want but that's not what people want to hear about. People want valuable info which is what I'm trying to give to them to attract readers and viewers and if that means giving away a few hot selling products I'm cool with that. Also, personally speaking I love ecommerce but as I say over and over again, I don't like dropshipping which means I hold physical inventory. My goal is to become location independent and I can't do that when I have an office or warehouse of physical inventory. I have to be in the USA to ship items and don't really trust scaling to the point I have others running my business. I'm trying to break into some additoinal revenue streams I can do mobile so maybe in a year I can sell my ecommerce business, move somewhere on the beach and just chill and do a couple hours of consulting a day and not ecommerce so I'm kind of making an exit plan though I'm still making my sole income from ecommerce and selling stuff on Amazon, eBay and my own websites. I get where your comming from like with all these house flippers if you make so much money why are you holding seminars and selling books right? Yeah I get that but it doesn't mean your a fake because you want other revenue streams as well. Lastly I would like to say I've been really into the whole self improvement business stuff lately. There's a rule of thirds. Basically surround yourself with or spend time with 33% of people below you and mentor them, spend 33% of time with peers and people on your level and 33% with people who have more experience and knowledge than you. Basically mentor others, collaborate with peers and try to learn more from a mentor. Thats something I'm trying to implement right now. I'm trying to share some knowledge with people just getting started making money online and hoping that inspires someone to maybe take me on and mentor me in things they are better than me at.

Have they in other countries with similar geographical etc factors to America?\n\n&gt; The reason we don't a private alternative is because USPS can offset its parcel prices via a monopoly on first class mail and things like zero infrastructure taxes.\n\nI posted a whole article about why this statement is misleading in the extreme. Did you read this article before commenting?\n\n&gt; Are you serious? Competition is more effective than centralized planning. This has been shown over and over again.\n\nIt has not been shown over and over again, this is a religious statement more than anything. It's true that markets are more effective in some situations, but central planning is more effective in others. For one important example: corporations are the very pinnacle of command-and-control centers, why don't they dissolve into individual market actors if markets are so superior? (Ronald Coase answered this question long ago.) Beyond that, markets function terribly when you have natural monopolies (typically with large infrastructure costs, such as the mail service). Markets also fail when you have built-in large asymmetries of information, like with health care or education. In fact, market failure is by far the norm rather than the exception. We've had like 400 years of capitalism showing this, again and again. Every capitalist with a brain wants to destroy markets, because that's how you get to take rent.\n\nSo no. You can't just keep chanting \"markets are superior\" like a Gregorian monk. It really depends on the application.\n\n&gt; How so?\n\nThe USPS provided great service to the entire country since the inception of the US. Or do you mean how did saddling the USPS with gigantic pension liabilities that are not standard anywhere else in the public or private sector act as right-wing meddling? I suppose that should be obvious, really.\n\n&gt; People are actually willing to pay more just to not have to use USPS. Think about that.\n\nIs your argument that while UPS and FedEx are utter shit, and the market has failed miserably there, the USPS is actually worse? The thing is that a lot of delivery is done with deals through big companies like Amazon and eBay and so on. That's where they get their market share. From my experience individuals sending the odd package actually opt for USPS.\n\n&gt; That is very unlikely. There are so many other alternatives.\n\nSo where has it happened that can be accurately compared to the US (i.e, not Luxembourg or some tiny city-state)?\n\n&gt; So we should be clear, you are in favor of equal outcome, not equal treatment.\n\nIt obviously depends on the situation. Equal outcomes when it comes to the use of public infrastructure/goods is quite clearly better than being able to buy your way into more. I hope you don't think that people should be able to have votes in elections that accord with their net wealth.","name":"t1_cwt2xlm","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-11-08 19:37:28","week":45}

{"id":"cwtci6t","author":"passthefist","body":"You're absolutely right about a lack of flexibility and that computers are best at solving a specific problem. Even if you go worst case sci-fi level, realistically we're pretty far away from practical strong general AI. Combined with how slow people usually are to roll out new technologies, especially within large risk-averse enterprises, I think you're right that it'll be a while before we see large scale implications of this stuff.\n\nHowever, one of the interesting things about Computer Science (the math/theory side, not programming) is that there's alot of problems that can be broken down into subtasks that are individually logic or decision problems but together compose problems that seem human solvable only.\n\nTake the manager of a retail shop. Their responsibilities might include employee disputes, employee work schedules, creating incentives, managing inventory and shipments, and basic accounting. Inventory allocation is a solved problem. Programs exist that track and estimate the demand for items and can automatically pre-order the right amount of that good before running out, keeping inventories lean. Amazon has stocking robots, so deliveries only need to be dropped off and can be stored appropriately. Scheduling algorithms are also solved, so employees could mark time off in an online calendar and let that application assign hours. All your employees want the same day off? Increase the pay for that day until someone accepts. Or even better, use something like the Stable marriage problem to find an optimal solution. Christmas coming up? Corporate can update the system to give bonus commissions on key items.\n\nEmployee disputes would pretty much need a real person, and realistically I don't see the above actually happening. The greater point is that we have all this tech today, individually. Talk to a software engineer working on current or advanced projects about this stuff, and I'd bet they'd generally agree that there's more tasks that can be automated than people expect.\n\n&gt;  ... workers will become more sophisticated ...\n\n&gt; Management, dextrous or varied jobs (such as construction or food service), and tech jobs are only going to increase with more machines.\n\nI'd argue if anything workers would be less sophisticated since they're just operating automated systems, like any other industrial worker. I could see management jobs increasing, and of course tech. But food service and particularly fast food wouldn't be too hard to automate. McDonalds is already more or less automated. A worker opens a bag of frozen nuggets, sets the fryer to 'nugget', and waits for the alarm. Burger King pre-grills their patties in a conveyor like machine, and then stores them until they are ordered. 3D printed buildings exist, and though currently small I've seen prototypes that could create much larger structures.\n\nTo me it's not a quest of what or how to automate, but rather when will there be economic incentives to do so.","name":"t1_cwtci6t","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-11-08 23:23:50","week":45}
