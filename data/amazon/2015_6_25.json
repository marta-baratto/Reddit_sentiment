{"id":"39upbn","author":"Thehealthygamer","body":"Haha first, sorry for the provocative title, but hey they work, and our sales have gone up 800% between the two shows :) Wanted to share this experience because it's fresh on my mind. It will help me crystallize some of these lessons and hopefully it will help some of you generate ideas or grow your businesses.\n\n**Background**\n\nThis is the latest in a long series of companies I've worked on. I've had a website helping gamers get healthy(thehealthygamer.com), opened/sold a CrossFit gym, and now I'm part of a start-up helping to bring more education/life balance to gamers.\n\nMy purpose with this gun show business was to learn product based e-commerce, importing, and gain a lot of direct sales experience and generally eliminate that fear of asking for a sale.\n\n**Idea to Execution**\n\nHad the idea in December. Started browsing Alibaba and looking for optics vendors(red dot sights). I decided on optics not for any particular reason. I really can't remember why I decided it would be red dot sights I sold, but that was the decision.\n\nSpoke to quite a few suppliers, ordered some samples. Most of the samples were really crap quality. Finally found one that had well-built products that I liked.\n\nSo then I ordered a very short run inventory from them, totaling around $2,200 buying between 3-10 of several different models of sights. \n\n**The Business Model**\n\nGo to gun shows to test out prices and see what models people liked and didn't like. Simultaneously build out a e-commerce platform and create a lot of high quality content using pictures/video. Then try a lot of various channels to see if we can gain traction online - through eBay/Amazon, running ads, seeing if we can pull in social media influencers to support our brand.\n\n**Where we're at now**\n\nI brought a friend I'd worked with onboard - he's the inventory manager at the e-commerce place I used to work at and thought this was a great idea. \n\nSo we took the optics to our first show two weeks ago and had nothing prepped - just some optics and sticky-price tags, not even a table cloth. Sold a few small accessories and only one optic there, for $120 in total revenue. \n\nLessons learned from that show:\n\n* We grossly overestimated how much we could sell Chinese import optics for. I was thinking we could get at least $200 for most of the optics based on Eotech and Aimpoint being $500+ but apparently our idea wasn't so unique and I saw quite a few white-labeled optics at the show that came from our same supplier. \n\n* Presentation is really important. There are a billion tables at gun shows and if your table doesn't look interesting people won't even bother stopping by.\n\n* It's all about interacting with people. The few sales I did make were because I stopped people and talked with them. I woulda made 0 sales if I hadn't actively engaged people walking past.\n\n* Gun shows have a lot of people but very few that are looking specifically for an optic.\n\n**How we improved upon those lessons learned.**\n\n* I took pictures of all our optics and paid a friend to design it into a nice brochure. Printed 25 for people to look at at the show. We got a nice table-cloth and built some risers to seat the optics on. And overall really cleaned up the layout and presentation and the booth went from looking terrible to looking really professional. The brochures for sure closed a few sales on optics because they just gave the brand a way more professional look/feel. When someone had a question I'd pull out the brochure and reference it to answer their question, and hand it to them, I think that element of seeing something in print really helps reinforce what I tell them.\n\n* We made 3 different designs of t-shirts as impulse buy items. They sold REALLY well, we moved 18 total shirts at the show, priced at $20/ea but definitely discounted down for some people to make the sale happen.\n\n* We made sure to actively engage every single person that walked by. I think we would have made less than $200 in sales this show if we had just been sitting behind our tables like most of the other guys at the show.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n* If you want to be successful, you need to ASK for the sale. We were a bit nervous at the beginning of the show and let a lot of people walk away when they said \"I'll think about it\" \"let me look around\" etc. Then we said we have to explicitly ask for a sale with everyone we talk to. \n\n* The best example of how important asking for the sale: had a guy walking by, I asked him what he was at the show looking for, he said \"nothing in particular, just looking.\" So then I pointed out our shirts and he took a look at them and laughed at one and started moving on down the table. Now at this point, before, I would have just said something like \"thanks for stopping by\", making the ASSUMPTION that he wasn't interested in a shirt. Instead, I said \"they're great shirts aren't they\"(at this point he stopped walking and looked at me) and I pointed out the premium fabric they were printed on, then I asked \"do you have a favorite design? Can I interest you in one?\" He kinda hemed and hawed and said \"well let me think about it and look around\" and we knew from experience that no one ever came back if they were going to \"think about it\" so I asked for the sale again \"what can I do to help you walk away with one of these great shirts?\" And he thought for a bit and asked for price-break, so I gave him a $3 discount and made a sale that otherwise wouldn't have happened.\n\n* The biggest lesson learned today is that rejection is absolutely no big deal. I was told \"no\" in one way or another probably 500 times this weekend. But I was also told \"yes\" exponentially more than our last show. \n\nI'm really amped. I mean the sales we made this weekend, when you factor in our travel expenses, and time, absolutely doesn't make it worth our time. But the EXPERIENCE gained of direct sales is invaluable. This is going to carry over into all my other businesses. It'll make it so much easier to ask for a sale with warm prospects now. And I think with some time tweaking our product selection and constantly refining our sales message and marketing efforts we really can make a gun show worth the time.\n\nAnd then there's the whole other side of e-commerce yet to explore.\n\nSo just wanted to share and hopefully inspire someone else to just run with an idea and see what happens. \n\nOh and the other big point - **persist. If we would have quit after the first \"unsuccessful\" show we would have missed out completely on all these great experiences, and we didn't make our first sale until 11am Saturday(were there since 8am) and if we let that discouragement stop us from trying, we wouldn't have found all the great strategies that started working for us. So persist, persist, persist!**","name":"t3_39upbn","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-15 01:06:34","week":25}

{"id":"39x13e","author":"cheresier","body":"I know nothing about flipping clothing or footwear, so rather than pulling the trigger myself I am posting it here. Recently I came across a site that catalogs all expired MyHabit sales (in case you haven't heard, MyHabit is a luxury flash sale arm of Amazon). Presumably, the premise is that if you have a link to an item from an expired sale you can still order it, even if it no longer shows up on the front pages of the main website. So I guess that means that one can get access to a \"dark pool\" of sales not accessible to general public. So I am wondering if it opens up any opportunities for flipping. Here is one example - right on the first page of the site (it looks like all MyHabit and Gilt sales by default are sorted by discount) I see Valentino women's shoes for $23: http://www.myhabit.com/#page=d&amp;asin=B00NBQFTPG with sizes 5 and 5.5 in black still being in stock. I checked eBay and there seems to be a decent market for those shoes with attractive markup opportunities. I am also thinking that there may be an opportunity for drop shipping the items - I suppose one could post the shoes (for example) on eBay and ship them directly to the buyer when they sell, takign advantage of the fact that since the links are not public the inventory will not disappear quickly. \n\nDo folks here have any experience with flipping fashion items? Are there any possible caveats that I am not thinking about? \n\nOh, here is the link to that tool: http://www.sortedby.com/m/?c=1","name":"t3_39x13e","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-15 16:24:10","week":25}

I've had one loan that was in my mom's and I's name. It was for 100,000 and was paid off in installments.\n\nSo I wanted to start building credit and figured a credit card that I put ~500 dollars or more on a month and pay off would be a start. I already use my credit/debit card for every purchase now, so I wanted to start collecting the cash back for transactions.\n\nI decided on the Amazon credit card because I shop on there frequently, but was turned down. The letter didn't say why I was turned down but did mention that my credit score was 891.\n\nWhy do you think I was turned down, and what should my next step forward be?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: \nAs is mentioned in the top comment, my FICO credit score is not 891. I went home and took a look at the letter. It states:\nScoring System Name: Card Acquistion Risk Score\n\nSource: Chase Bank\n\nDate: 6/5/15\n\nYour Credit Score: 891\n\n\nSo you can see why I thought my real 'credit score' was 891.","name":"t3_3a1elt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-16 15:56:07","week":25}

I go through all of the rss feeds, visit the sites looking for the biggest price drops on amazon.  I then cross check the biggest drops to ebay using their advanced search and see the price history of that item.  I am not looking at resales, only NIB.\n\nOnce I find something I can earn about 25% profit on, I pull the trigger and buy 10-25 of them depending on cost.  Once I have shipping confirmation from Amazon, I immediately list the items on ebay with a BIN price.  I normally do free shipping as well so I count that cost into my formula.   My goal is 1-2 solid items a day.  Oh, and I use a credit card that offers cash back so win win.  I have a UPS account but have a UPS store about 2 miles from my home.

I posted a bit ago with feedback on our website and now I'm in the hunt for those informed in the food distribution world.\n\nOur company, Paleo Baking Company, sells baking mixes for specialty diets and lifestyles. We have strong and growing sales through our website and on Amazon but we want more grocery representation (as in LOTS more.)\n\nWe have been working with a distributor now for a few months, and aside from an initial vendor event we did with them we haven't had any orders come through, and generally, seem to be neglected. The event was really us selling to lots of buyers that they just brought into a room together.\n\nThey're a large regional distributor however I was under the assumption, probably incorrectly, there would be a bit more hustle to get us into some of the larger stores in our region.\n\nWhile online sales are great, at the end of the day, most buy baking mixes in a grocery store, and for us to pass our current barrier we need to start moving into more stores.\n\nI'm looking for suggestions from anyone in the industry on the distribution or manufacturing side. Should we pursue a food broker? Find a distributor who hustles more? Or should I not expect the distributor to be hustling for us at all and it rest on us?\n\nI've been spending time going down as many roads as possible with groceries, but so many of them have so many gate keepers to get at the people making the decisions.\n\nAny help appreciated!\n\nOh and here's our website for more information about our company: PaleoBakingCompany.com\n\nThanks Reddit!","name":"t3_3a2z6c","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-16 22:40:22","week":25}

{"id":"3a6l97","author":"[deleted]","body":"I am currently self-employed and when I am unable to meet my financial obligations for the month, my husband covers the funds needed. Food, shelter, utilities, etc. is covered by husband. We live in the country in the U.S. My job prospects are better now since we have a better internet provider and I can actually do remote work without hitting a data cap or being throttled.\n\n**Debt**\n\n1. Private student loans current total of $7,953.98. \n2. Stafford Loans current total $32,417.30.\n3. Perkins Loan current total $2,522.20.\n\nAll accounts are up to date. We have a small amount of CC debt that is paid off each month (we use it for the Amazon points) and $11,000 in savings. There is no other debt, such as a mortgage or car loans.\n\n**Retirement Account**\n\nThe account is under a state-funded retirement account from a job I previously worked at in a different state before we moved so my husband could pursue his dream of being a farmer (3rd generation, whoop!).\n\nDetails of the retirement account:\n\n1. As of Dec 2014, I have $6,945.34.\n3. 2014 interest earned was $260.14 and I think that my interest rate is 1.75% based on my service credit?\n4. I have to make a decision within five years of leaving employment as it will stop earning interest. I left this job in January of 2014 and I do not intend on moving back.\n5. The pamphlet says I have three options. (1) I leave my contributions and allow it to earn interest until January of 2019 and then do something. (2) Roll my contributions over into a tax-sheltered plan like a 457(b) deferred compensation plan, 403(b) annuity, an IRA, or a qualified retirement plan with a new employee (nope). I don't know what most of those mean or which one would be the best. (3) Have the account paid out and pay the taxes and penalty for early withdrawal.\n\nI'm kind of torn on what to do. On one hand, I'd like to pay down my student debt as quick as possible and this money could help me eliminate my Perkins loan and a portion of my private student loans or my Stafford loans.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't want to end up like either of my parents with no type of retirement plan in place. So I'm leaning towards rolling my account over to a different type of retirement account and letting it sit forgotten until I'm at the age of retirement.\n\nAdvice is greatly appreciated.

{"id":"3a784o","author":"porkupyne09","body":"Two years ago my credit was terrible. Like, low 500's terrible. I got a secured card with a very low limit and got to work. Months pass, my credit limit increases. I get excited and max it out. Immediately realizing it was a bad idea, I vow to myself to not do it again and I try to pay more than the minimum every month. Usually 2-3x the minimum. Somewhere along the way I got way off course and started using it and maxed it out again. I make the minimum payments, but nothing more.  \nA few more months pass, my car is falling apart and I got new car fever. I walked onto the lot, pointed at a truck I liked, and said I want to buy that one. I promptly signed papers without a second thought. In the end I'm paying $32k @ 16% over 6 years.   \nA few months pass and times are getting hard (no doubt because of my $700/mo truck note). I got another credit card and promptly maxed it out.  \nFast-forward another couple of months. Times are even harder. My wife and I each get another card. We've been paying bills with our credit cards. Now we're at the end of our rope. All of our cards are maxed.  \n\nThis is our current breakdown:  \nAmazon Card:      $672.62  \nCapital One #1:    $646.35  \nCapital One #2:    $909.47  \nChase:                 $1942.17  \nUSAA:                 $894.05  \nStudent Loans:     ~12,000  \nTruck:                  ~30,000 (I'm upside-down ~7k)  \nCar:                     ~10,000  \nPlus roughly $400 in medical debt that collection companies are harassing us for.  \n\nWe also owe $1k on a Boy Scout trip that my son and I are going on in a month (I'd back out of this if I could but the troop has already paid everything on my word that we were going, so at this point I'm paying them back). My wife wants us to try to get a personal loan to pay off the hospital bills to keep them off our credit, as well as to pay off the trip. I think it's a terrible idea but I don't see an alternative. \nI want to let my truck go back for the sake of our sanity but that's a lose-lose situation for multiple reasons.  \n1) It negatively impacts my credit  \n2) I lose a vehicle that we need to have since we both have jobs  \n3) I feel like (even more of) a failure  \n\nWTF am I supposed to do?  \n\nEdit:  \nPlease spare me the, \"You did this to yourself. They gave you just enough rope to hang yourself and you did,\" speech.

{"id":"3a8b2k","author":"GoKone","body":"Hello all. This is a continuation of the story behind my men's boxer briefs startup. You might've seen a prior [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2v7fib/how_i_gathered_35000_emails_in_2_weeks/) on gathering e-mails for a product launch (more on that later). We recently launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1184319318/premium-boxer-briefs-ridiculous-comfort-at-a-fair). Here's a personal write-up on how we reached this point, and what it took to get here.\n\n**Find your Product**\nThis is the point that's easiest to get to, and at the same, easiest to drop away from and back to your normal lives. I listened carefully to everyone around me for over a year, learning about their problems with brands, pricing, personal stuff, lifestyle issues, etc. I forgot to listen to myself until it came time to buy more boxer briefs. I looked online. My first choice was Amazon.com and found Calvin Klein underwear for $28. I said, ok, that's better than buying it at $31 plus tax on Nordstrom. I added 1 to my cart, and then proceeded to change the quantity to 7. Total was $196 with free prime shipping (yay for free shipping!). But heck, $200 on underwear? I might as well make my own! **ding!**\n\n**Think of a Sales Channel**\nI've been a massive fan of online retailing since its inception. Ordering from home and getting it a few days later seems like a viable alternative to driving through traffic. I looked at amazon fulfillment and found fulfillment prices there don't work well with items that cost less than $15. It is because of this that I decided to launch my own store online. But be careful, this decision has plenty of repercussions:\n\n* Designing the Website - if you can't do it yourself on Shopify, you'll run into a $5000 charge for a decent website. And even if you can do it yourself, making it look spiffy is a whole other deal. And knowing how it's built is important to understanding problems later on.\n* Optimizing the Website - you need fast load times! I used [jpegMini](http://www.jpegmini.com/) to optimize my images and Mac's Keynote and Adobe Photoshop to design other things. I had to do plenty of googling to find tips and tricks on image design. Everything you see on my website was crafted by me.\n* Connecting the Website to Fulfillment centers - API's, connectors, apps. - I use [Fulfillrite](http://fulfillrite.com) fulfillment. They have an app that connects through your Shopify store. It updates inventory, tracking numbers, and has a slew of great mapping features to offer your clients all the shipping options you want. They also have great pricing on a per order basis, low storage charges, and excellent shipping rates.\n* Connecting the Website to Accounting Platforms - API's and connectors - I use [Zapstitch](http://www.zapstitch.com) on Shopify to connect to Quickbooks online. You'll need some light accounting experience to get it right as you'll need to do some account mapping.\n* Marketing, SEO, &amp; Maintenance - If the above things break, you won't have time for this, which is why you have to get everything right before you launch.\n* The result: [ComfortableBoxers.com](http://comfortableboxers.com). A fully optimized, connected, and live e-commerce platform, so far with decent google rankings on key words. Try **comfortable men's boxer briefs** or just **comfortable boxers**. I'm still working on more key words.\n\nWith this came the decision to launch a Kickstarter project to launch to product beside the e-commerce platform. We want to really test the product and the market before we stock up. Besides, I need the money to do so. However, there's still spending to be done to get to this point.\n\n**Source your Product**\nSourcing is the most expensive portion of the process. Because you don't want to stock up on inventory that's not guaranteed to be sold, you'll want to partner with someone that will sit with you throughout the process. Most factories want quick orders and deliveries and then you'll never hear from them again. Others, however, care about what they deliver to you, and make sure you're ordering at a time when you can and are able to. Finding the right factory requires time, a bit of traveling, and some swift negotiating on a friendly manner. Look for a factory that cares about you, and I mean this in a business sense. The higher your chances of success, the higher their chances of a repeat order. I gathered a team of known associates in the textile industry to source the best possible factory for my boxer briefs. I ordered samples, trials, prototypes, tests, and then repeated until we reached our current version. This can get quite expensive, but if you're sure you're making a great product, you won't have a problem spending the dough. \n\n**Arrange Logistics**\nI pre-partnered with [Flexport](https://www.flexport.com/) for shipping logistics. I was lucky enough to be accepted into this startup. When the product is ready for shipment, they're ready to get these bad boys over to my [Fulfillrite](http://fulfillrite.com) fulfillment center in New Jersey. They handle a Door to Door service, meaning you won't have to deal with customs, BL's, documents, taxes, etc. You must follow strict receiving guidelines like labeling and tagging, otherwise you'll be charged extra for labeling at the fulfillment center. This is why you have to coordinate carefully with the factory to have them labeled correctly from the **source.**\n\n**Build a Kickstarter Project**\nYou must first design a script, have it reviewed, then shoot as much video as you can. Make sure you use specific keyword that match the audience, in particular the crowdfunding aspect behind it. You then record a voice over. You shoot and record, you build a film, tie the audio and video together, and add a nice background song that goes along with your script. This is best done by a novice filmmaker with some Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premier experience. If you're a perfectionist, it can get quite stressful. But I learned Final Cut Pro and did it all myself with the help of a experienced camera man on shoots. After that, you design your rewards scales and price them at below your retail price after the campaign, offering backers additional incentive to pledge. If you have any special items you can give away, make sure you do! As for the storyline, make sure it's neat, concise, and flows well. Charts and graphs are a plus!\n\n**Prepare PR**\nYou can't launch to crickets! I found this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/28z20d/my_crowdfunding_campaign_raised_550000_in_5_weeks/) to be extremely useful. Here are the ones I paid special attention to:\n\n* [Hacking Kickstarter: How to Raise $100,000 in 10 Days](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/)\n* [Hack Kickstarter - 6 Experts Reveal How They Crowdfunded $1mil](https://www.udemy.com/hackkickstarter/#/)\n* [The hackers guide to getting press](http://austenallred.com/user-acquisition/book/chapter/press/)\n* [Advanced Kickstarter linking strategies](http://www.gamesonthebrain.com/blog/advanced-kickstarter-linking-strategies)\n* [3 Simple ways to get PR for your startup](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2014/01/15/3-simple-ways-to-get-free-pr-for-your-startup/)\n* [How we helped raise $75,000 for an Indiegogo campaign](https://www.blonde20.com/blog/2014/01/09/how-we-helped-raise-75000-for-an-indiegogo-campaign-step-by-step/)\n* [Six steps to run cheap and successful Facebook advertising campaigns](http://www.dipoll.com/blog/2010/11/six-steps-to-run-cheap-and-successful-facebook-advertising-campaigns/)\n\nThe e-mail list I gathered in early January didn't work too well, as most of my signups were women looking for coupons. About 80% of total signups were women from Canada. It got a little out of control, so I started a new referral campaign using [Kickofflabs](http://www.kickofflabs.com) and gathered 2000 signups, 80% U.S. males. I used the same methods as before, but this time I set-up e-mail validation confirmation and avoided any superfluous rewards.\n\nWe then placed a small manufacturing order to ensure our quality control methods were sound and partnered with another sourcing expert to supervise the manufacturing. All of this because, as a sacred rule of business, it's best to find problems during and not after manufacturing. We used these items as samples for bloggers and influencers to review. \n\n**Launch**\nGetting to this point took 12 months since the idea was born, and 6 months since the last prototype was built. It takes time and patience, something most people can't afford to have. But what if I told you that I did all this while on a full time job? I quit just last month to get the ball rolling on the PR. The samples that were sent to bloggers and influencers are currently being reviewed, and we're expecting some great outlets to feature us later this week. \n\nAs for Kickstarter, you'll need to have your project pre-approved by their staff to make sure it meets their guidelines. The moment I clicked launch, I fixed up all the URL forwarding with the project URL, notified the influencers, and sent out [e-mails](http://imgur.com/32fuIRW) to the Mailchimp lists, friends, and family, and this is where we are. Here are [some screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/a46qV)\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the process, the product, the apps and services i've used, feel free to ask. I'd be more than glad to help out.

{"id":"3a8zsp","author":"MMYourWay","body":"If you are anything like me, then youâve had plenty of dreams of becoming the next big internet entrepreneur. Unfortunately, the chances of becoming the next internet affiliate marketing superstar is actually fairly slim, now iâm not saying itâs canât be done, I just feel that itâs a lot more difficult than it used to be, as more and more people are trying their hand at making money online.\n\nSo late last year I decided to take a slightly different approach, so I created a web store that sold physical products. I realised that I wasnât quite ready to abandon my goal of making side income online, but I also didnât really want to turn into one of those shady affiliate marketers that would push anything â so an online shop seemed like the perfect solution.\n\nSo today I am going to talk about my experience creating an online store and how it is going so far. Note: I wonât be giving specifics on the product I am selling.\n\n \n\nGetting Started â It Costs Money\nProbably the biggest thing that I realised when I started out with this web store, was that getting started was hard. Having an idea is one thing, but actually putting things into action is quite another.\n\nNot only is it very time consuming, but it can be very expensive as well, and as someone who is big on saving money, I really wanted to be sure that I wasnât going to be flushing my money down the toilet. After all, you have to buy stock, organise supply chain management, promote your website and most importantly of all â you need a product that people want to buy.\n\nOverall my wife and I have spent close to $20K on our business so far, and to date we have only returned about 20%-25% of that. But considering that we only started in January, and that our sales have started to become nice and steady (see screen capture below), I am confident that in the long run we will end up turning the business into something that is very profitable.\n\n What I've Learned By Starting an Online Business\n\nNow many of you are probably thinking that Iâm crazy spending that kind of money on a new internet business, but I did do a lot of initial testing to ensure that there was a market for this product.\n\nIn order to test the market, I created a website that sold similar products (the products were through Amazon) and I ranked the site to the 1st spot in Google for one of the keywords I was targeting. What I discovered was that people not only liked the product, but that I was getting between 3 and 4 sales per day.\n\nNow unfortunately the way I tested the website was not sustainable, and eventually the site got hit by a Google penalty. I suspect this was because I purchased black hat links to rank the site â I was a little annoyed, but it served its purpose and it did tell me that I could easily make money in the niche I had selected. This gave me enough confidence to spend a fairly large sum of money setting up my own product line ready for sale.\n\n \n\nPatience\nThe next big thing I learned was patience. During the first month I was pretty upset that we werenât getting any sales, and even the second month where we had just a couple of sales I was still pretty concerned. You see doing things the right way takes time, and I am in this for the long haul, which means that I am not interested in ranking my website the same way that I did the test one with shady links.\n\nAnyway, after a while things have started to settle down and now we are starting to make around 7/8 sales per month, which works out to be about $700 per month. Obviously this is a lot less than the 3 to 4 sales per day I could be getting if I was at the top of the search results, but itâs enough to keep me satisfied that eventually we will have a good steady side income stream on our hands.\n\n \n\nMarketing &amp; Diversify Traffic Sources\nMarketing is probably the hardest part of any business, whether it be a traditional bricks and mortar business, or an online one. This is something that took me a while to learn when I first started building websites online, but in short â no one is going to buy your product if they canât find it. It sounds so simple now, but back then I just didnât have a clue about internet marketing.\n\nI also used to think that targeting search engines was the answer to getting people to your website, but in reality I think this is a mistake. Itâs so easy to get caught up in the massive amount of traffic search engines like Google can provide, that people often forget about some other really great traffic generating websites that exist.\n\nOne of the big ones for me is social sharing websites like Pinterest or shopping websites like Wanelo. They are both great at sending quality traffic to my site, and the best part is that it converts far better than Google.\n\nMy analytics stats for the last 6 months showing Google &amp; Wanelo\n\n Google &amp; Wanelo\n\nI honestly feel that these types of sites are too often overlooked, and that they can provide a great way for online businesses to generate sales.\n\nI would love to hear about any of your own experiences with starting a business online. What did you learn and what can you share with others before they start out.","name":"t3_3a8zsp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-06-18 06:27:18","week":25}

Microsoft has the BizSpark program that offers free software and hosting on their Azure Web Services (similar to Amazon Web Services or even Godaddy).  With that you can setup websites that will do everything from your custom website to cookie cutter installs of Wordpress, and other out of the box solutions for CMS, blogs, ecommerce, etc.  I've been using the service now for about 2 years, and it works great.  With the service, they give you up to $750 per month ($150 per user, up to 5 users) in free hosting - you decide how you want to use it.  \n\nLink to learn more: [Microsoft BizSpark](http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/)","name":"t3_3adgs4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-19 07:40:49","week":25}

They create a unique ASIN and it gets housed in a particularly kentucky warehouse.  They then charge only the $1.50 pick pack, $1 referral and $.09 per ounce Handling.  That is rough numbers, but I know it is a few bucks less than the normal FBA fees. \n\nIf you have an item that fits into this model, ( light weight, small, popular w/ multiples), then email them ASAP.

{"id":"3ahax6","author":"[deleted]","body":"**Site** www.musclefitbasics.com\n\nI have always preferred basic clothing over branded but the problem was always finding great quality unbranded clothing. The plain tees from American Apparel, H&amp;M, Topman etc could never compete with the quality of the Abercrombie, Superdry, Ralph Lauren etc.\n\nThe only similarity between the elite brands which the lesser lack is the cotton type, 'Sueded' to be exact. Sueded Cotton is not only extremely expensive but it is on average 5x heavier than your standard cotton, this results in superior softness and strength.\nhttp://imgur.com/RUFDeib\n\nAfter a year of sampling and another year selling on ebay and Amazon, I made the decision to open my own store! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ITCLsnM.jpg\n\n**The Launch?** I have no prior experience building a site so watching all the youtube videos and reading reviews was a long process but I opted for shopify. Its been decent, traffic has been okay and I have made 7 sales thus far totaling around Â£200.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C33AS14.png\n\n**Advertising** With Shopify you get Â£75/$100 free google ads vouchers when you sign up so I used them and managed to drive a decent amount of traffic to my store but it didnt really help with sales. I also read about facebook ads and spent around Â£20 to see if it was worthwhile, it wasn't worth it at all. I think for Â£20 I received around 50 clicks and 20 likes.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/musclefitbasics/\n\n**The Future - Instagram** What a beautiful app, its made my advertising more effective and really fun. The interaction I have had is really promising, I have sent a few of my tees to some fashion bloggers and in exchange they have worn the tees in their posts and left reviews on their blogs. I only started contacting people through instagram a week ago but it has been by far the most useful. I'm in talks with a couple of 100k followed fashion bloggers so if that goes through it could take my business to a whole new level.\nhttps://instagram.com/musclefitbasics\n\n**Contact** email me (Ahmed) Info@musclefitbasics.com or please comment in the thread with your ideas/suggestions and I most definitely get back to you.","name":"t3_3ahax6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-20 06:24:35","week":25}
{"id":"3ahdnf","author":"OpinionatedSouthern","body":"I hadn't seen this site mentioned on here before, so I figured I'd review it and let you in on the secret. I wanted to get a few reviews and payments under my belt first to ensure I was passing on good information.\n\n  I've been using ProductTube for a month or so now and have received 5.00 for an introductory video, a 25.00 Target card, and a 25.00 Amazon card. \n\n  The gist is easy. I've been sent about 6 surveys and qualified for 2. If you qualify, you then go to whatever store they say and take a short video on your buying process. For example, I had to go to cat litter and talk out loud about the different types I saw, sales, etc. Then I chose one and said why I chose it. If you take someone with you, it's less weird. You don't have to show yourself, just the aisle. They recommend 2-5 minutes per video, so it's not lengthy. Your videos are never shared publicly- they are just for marketing purposes. \n\n  My referral code is CAYLA7026 which can be used when signing up if you'd like. They say in the FAQ that they don't currently have referral incentives, so I'm not sure what good it will do but I'd appreciate it anyways. Here is the regular link to the site: http://producttube.com/\n\n  The website, mobile site, and app are all very user friendly and customer service is excellent.

Mostly everything checks out and revenue seem scalable enough; I just need to know if this service is even legal and also if there is already a big company doing this.\n\n**What:** This service matches 2 or more people (college students for now because of security and geographic proximity) purchasing stuff online to combine their purchase to take advantage of promotions such as BOGO sales, spend over XX and get XX% off sales, free shipping over XX sales, etc.\n\n**For example:** \n\n* Joe wants a $25 shirt\n* Kate wants a $20 skirt\n* Situation: Buy one get one 50% off sale, $5 shipping or free if order over $35. (very standard situation with American Eagle)\n* Individually, Joe's final price is **$31.75**, Kate's is **$26.40** (including tax and shipping)\n* This service charges 2.0% for each person being matched together (this is flexible and will change once analytics come in)\n* After being matched, Joe now pays **$22.19** (30% off), Kate pays **$17.76** (33% off) #murica\n* Both get delivered to the same mailing center in the university (privacy issues addressed with \"let me choose my match\" button vs. \"choose the cheapest match\" button.\n\n**My Issue:** I've already done a lot of math and am pretty deep into programming the engine behind sorting through different promotion types and matching the best purchases for maximum benefit for everyone. I enjoy math/economics/programming so it's at least a good brain exercise if this doesn't go through, but I have two important questions:\n\n1. Is this legal? By \"this\" I mean the process of consolidating orders offsite and buying them in groups using a single account to make things cheaper basically. I read through Amazon's license and access statement and the jargon is just above me... Was thinking about using big online retailers like Amazon, AE, the usual... \n\n2. Are there any big companies that already do exactly this? Mostly not worried about small competitors.\n\nThanks so much for any help, feel free to tear this idea apart, tell me everything wrong with it.

I'm getting a re enlistment bonus for about $40,000 (after taxes) and I'm only getting half up front which would be around $20,000. \n\nHere's what I owe. \n\nCar payment: Monthly payments of $360, interest rate: 4% I owe roughly $19,800\n\nAmazon Credit Card, Interest is high 15%, I owe $4,7000\n\nDiscover Card, I have 0 interest on this for about six more months, I owe $3,900\n\nNow I know it would make sense to pay off my credit cards first since they have the higher interest but here's the problem. When I had bought my vehicle initially, I had no credit card debt. All I had was my car payment. I dont know how it got out of control, I just started racking up credit card debt. \n\n\nAnyway, so my plan was to pay off the car completely, that might even allow me to get liability insurance and thus paying less for insurance. Also, I was thinking about transfering all my amazon credit card debt to another credit card which would give me 1% interest for a year. with paying the car off, that would free up $360 a month which would normally go to my car payment but instead, it could go to my discover card, I figure once I pay that off, I'd pay off the Amazon card. Also, I think I'm going to either cancel my credit cards or maybe just stash one away in case of emergencies sine I can't seem to control myself sometimes, how does that sound? \n\nI should also had that, I'll get the remaining $20,000 over the next 6 years which is about $3,000 a year. I know a few of you might say to put some of this money in savings but, I've re-enlisted in the military for 6 years so, I'm guaranteed job security for the next 6 years at least, unless I goof up or something.

I suppose I could have each of those be a separate campaign, but that doesn't seem like it would be a terribly useful way to segment the list.

About 2 weeks ago I was shopping at Wal-Mart and came across a clearance rack and got excited and started scanning with the Amazon Seller app. Here is what i picked up:\n\nItem #1 Miller fortune drink glasses - UPC 846757385188\nOn clearance for $2.50 listing for $7.49 on Amazon and ranked #2745 in drinkware\nBought 3 of these\n\nItem #2 RIT Liquid Dye in 3 different colors\nUPCs: 885967883206, 885967883503 and 885967884302\nBought each for $2.50\nRanked #65, #63 and #69 respectively in Dyes\n\nSo here are my questions/concerns:\n\nDid I buy poorly?\n\nI was planning on shipping these for FBA and was assuming about $2.50 in fees from Amazon, is that accurate?\n\nIs it naive of me to send such a small shipment to Amazon for FBA? should i just ship them myself to the purchaser? It seems that it wanted me to send them all to different warehouses, can i choose not to do that?\n\nHow do I know these ranks are good? I would assume that the ones below 100 are good but what about the glasses ranked #2745. That seems good to me as i was seeing items ranked in the 60k's.\n\nTrying to ship these to Amazon is more than confusing but thats another post. I'm fairly savvy when it comes to navigating sites and figuring things out but the site is overwhelming. \n\nAs I said at the onset, I'm only about 2 weeks into this and bought this stuff as an experiment to see if this was something  Ican really do. This Sub has been helpful as a lurker and hopefully I can get some direct help. \n\nThanks","name":"t3_3akz1m","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-21 07:41:53","week":25}

{"id":"3amngk","author":"lovebes","body":"First of all some background: \n\n- We cater to a specific niche of travelers. Business model is somewhat similar to any of the short-term renting businesses. Now, we've been going strong for 5 years, net income (~$20k/yr) is pretty low, with the only option for further growth being getting more rooms, which what with our current stats seem impossible. We'd like to stay away from additional loans.\n\nHere begins the spin-off business ideas we were brainstorming, in order of feasibility:\n\n0. Increase business presence = campaign\n - We could try to branch out and get more diverse streams of customers. \n - Couple things to do: offline presentation, mailing list generation, social media compaign, enhanced website design/format/content/facelift\n\n1. Local business advertisement firm\n - Our business-related keywords returns our site in top 5 Google search results. This is how we get all our customers. I've been managing the entire operation, writing scripts to advertise our business in 10+ related bbs/community websites automatically for the last 5 years. All operated under respective spam rules.\n - The tech (more like basic scripting skills ;) ) has been fine-tuned over the years, where now I can spend only on copy-writing and less on updating the individual scripts to do my bidding. \n - I've seen some businesses that offer similar service for Craigslist, so this market is a tested one. I will simply offer my service to related niche businesses, and also develop one script for Craigslist.  \n - I'd like to try out mastering copy-writing as well, and further branching out as a web-design firm (I know the tech, just need a designer) is an option.\n\n2. Subscription box business for busy mid-age mothers\n - With our business, we've gotten some knowhow of how to save time for busy mothers with daily duties pertaining to children. We're still brainstorming what would be the best item to sell with subscription boxes (lunch set, dye for hair), but each items are all through experience.\n - Thing is, reading about the business, it seems you can't go in this with no investment - there are likely upfront costs.\n\n3. Drop-shipping vs Fulfillment by Amazon\n - This is more out of desperation. I've seen the answers for 'business with low investment' questions and this seems to be the popular answer. I have zero experience in this, but if it does seem like a possible thing with zero investment, I would like to try it out.\n\nThanks for reading! As you can see I'm pretty set on #1 but wanted to have some honest feedback in all, as well as a general opinion/advice. \n\n","name":"t3_3amngk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-21 20:50:07","week":25}

If you do, count that towards the food budget. My biggest variable expense has definitely been food because I'm not as strict on myself as I'd like to be at times. Make your shopping list at home looking at your cabinets so you don't wind up with duplicates. \n\nI'd also suggest calling Comcast and telling them you're considering dropping them so that they transfer you over to retention and give you a new promo price. I've got centurylink and I call them pretty regularly to make sure I'm paying as little as possible. Right now my bill is half of what it \"should\" be. \n\nKeep the online shopping to a minimum. When I had Amazon Prime I found myself buying stuff online too often (particularly decorative things for my apartment) so when it came time to renew Prime I cancelled it instead. \n\nI always make sure my rent is paid above all else. Utilities can be paid a little late without a penalty usually (that's been my experience anyway) and with other things like Internet and cell phone bills you can usually call a customer service rep and tell them you're going to pay late, and they won't shut you off (plus they usually waive the late fee if you call ahead of time, tell the them what day you'll pay the bill, and actually pay it when you say you will). Buy your groceries after everything else is paid when the budget is tight; you'll be amazed how cheap it is for one person to eat for a week when you've got to scrimp (I've managed to eat pretty decently for a week on about $20 before). \n\nOh, and try to save when you can.

The answers are going to be (regardless of what you posted):\n\n\n\n1) Use the eBay completed listings function, if it sells there for a decent price on a regular basis, use eBay\n\n2) Search for it on Amazon.ca, look at the sales ranking, decide if it's low enough for you\n\n3) Search Google for a niche site to sell your category of items (a quick Google search for 'Buy and Sell Boardgames' yields the Bazaar section of Boardgame Geek, Fine Games.com, NobleKnight.com, and [this thread on /r/boardgames that talks about where to buy and sell boardgames](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1xdjbp/best_place_to_selltrade_board_games/))\n\nThings that would have made this a non-newbie question would have been:\n\n1) If you had found something super rare that you really couldn't find much info on. Maybe you have records of it selling in an eBay auction in 1998 and it sold for $25,000 and you wanted to know where you should price it today, and whether people still want it\n\n2) If you had posted all of the research that you've done on several boardgame selling sites and you wanted to know which one was superior, which ones people have experience on, or things to watch out for (tricky rules and such) on each platform\n\n3) If what you had was particularly hard to sell. Boardgames are easy. If you had a 1950s era \"High Pressure Jenny\" (an early type of steam powered pressure washer), you'd probably be struggling to find buyers (surely there must be collectors... but where in the world would you find them? The Internet surely hasn't helped in my hypothetical searches) and you'd struggle to find a marketplace where you'd get exposure and where you limit the costs for transportation (these things are bulky and heavy!). That would be a discussion worth having.\n\nAs it stands, I'm not sure what people are going to be able to tell you. In the Newbie thread, people would give you general, helpful eBay and Amazon advice. Here, some people might be helpful, but most likely people will just downvote you, report you submission, and be snarky.\n\nHowever, as I said, I brought it back. Hopefully you get the advice you're looking for.","name":"t1_cs6pwns","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-15 03:27:22","week":25}

Size trumps interest when it's close, but exceptions are made for drastic differences.\n\nThe correct order for you would be:\n\n1. Amazon card.

While the interest is the smallest, it's also got the smallest balance and can be knocked out the quickest.

You must pay, at least, the minimum on all debts.

Once that debt is paid off, the next debt in the priority is targeted. \n\nBarring extreme differences (such as the Amazon card), the amount of interest that a debt will accrue while you are targeting another debt is far smaller than the amount of the minimum payment that you will no longer have to pay once the debt is paid off.\n\nBy targeting the smaller debts, you end up paying off all debt far faster and for far less, than by targeting the larger interest rate debts (again, barring large differences like the Amazon card).","name":"t1_cs7grof","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-15 20:48:30","week":25}

{"id":"cs7jxb5","author":"OneSkinneeJ","body":"Hey, everyone, looking for some feedback on my plan to minimize the costs of a cruise my wife and I have got planned for November 2016. This cruise departs from Galveston, TX and returns to Port Canaveral, FL. We live about 45 minutes away from Port Canaveral. We're trying to cover as much of the airline cost from FL to TX, 3 nights in hotels in TX (2 in San Antonio and 1 in Houston/Galveston), a rental car while in TX, and transportation to a FL airport (either MLB or MCO; MLB preferred since it's about 10 minutes from our house), from a TX hotel to the Galveston cruise port, and then possibly from Port Canaveral back home following the cruise.\n\n**1. What is your current FICO score?** 798 (this was prior to the CSP and Freedom apps, as mentioned in #3 below)\n\n**2. What do you currently spend per month on credit cards?** Broken up over several, I would put it between $1250 and $1500\n\n**3. What credit cards do you currently have?** \nI've been researching a lot the last week and have already applied and been approved for both the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Freedom. They should be here today or tomorrow. That brings the credit card total to:\n\n* Chase Sapphire Preferred (June 2015)\n* Chase Freedom (June 2015)\n* Barclays Sallie Mae World MasterCard (December 2014)\n* Fidelity Investments American Express (April 2012)\n* Chase Amazon.com Visa (~2011)\n* Citi Dividend World MasterCard (~2006)\n* Bank of America MasterCard (~2000, I don't recall any more specific details about it)\n\n**4. What are your goals?** \nAs mentioned above, mostly reducing the costs of our trip next year. I'm 6'4\" and have a bad knee that will prevent me from sitting in a cramped economy seat for several hours. We'd like to fly first class because in addition to the extra leg room, we should get more checked bags (which will help as we go on a 12-day cruise), and also just want to experience flying first class.\n\nAs mentioned in question #3, I was approved for the CSP and Freedom. Our plan is to meet the $4500 minimum spend on those two combined to earn 40,000 + 5000 (CSP + authorized user) + 20,000 + 2500 (Freedom + authorized user) + another 4500 from the spend itself and get us in the neighborhood of 70,000 UR points. Using the dates from this year as an estimate, that gets us 2 one-way tickets from FL to TX.\n\nSometime around December 2015, I plan to try for the Starwood Preferred Guest Amex. Once the minimum spend is met there, that would cover the 3 hotel nights in TX, staying at reasonable properties for 7k to 10k Starpoints per night.\n\nAround April 2016, I'm thinking that the Barclay Arrival Plus and its signup bonus will cover a good deal of the rest of the trip. Transportation to and from airports and cruise ports, car rentals, etc. It would also be the card given to the cruise line for our onboard spending. Any of the sign-up bonus that doesn't go to miscellaneous transportation could be used to help cover the onboard spending.\n\nThanks so much for any feedback!\n\n**TL;DR:** We've got the CSP and Freedom and should be able to get 70k UR points to cover 2 one-way first class tickets from FL to TX. Starwood Preferred Guest to cover 3 hotel nights in TX at 7k to 10k Starpoints per night.

When we asked him to describe the issue(s) he never responded, so we just approved his return request (no return shipping costs covered).\n\nHis return was shipped to the wrong address in the same complex. I assume this was so he could show tracking saying that it was received, but not have proof of THE BBQ COOKBOOK THAT WAS INSIDE instead of a laptop.\n\nThankfully, the guy down the way contacted us. I told Amazon that we received a package from the buyer, but it contained a cookbook, not a laptop. Their Indian customer service agent responded with a \"Thank you for letting us know you received the package. We expect you to refund the buyer in a timely manner.\"\n\nA quick phone call (e-mail will just go back to an Indian rep. with what I can only assume gets paid based on the number of cases they respond to, not their accuracy) to explain the situation, and then sending pictures of the cookbook, cleared things up.\n\nThe case wasn't closed for a couple months, but that all consisted of communication between the buyer and Amazon. I could see that they were e-mailing, but no idea what was being said. I can only assume they were trying to get him to send the \"broken\" laptop back.\n\n---------------\n\nBut then I had one where the guy requested a return for a broken laptop. We sent a pre-paid return shipping label which was never used. 3 months later an Indian customer service rep refunds the guy his money because the shipping information never updated. He assumed it was lost.\n\nNeither me, nor the buyer, requested Amazon to look into this. This rep. did it on his own and was completely off base. The initial appeal was just responded by another Indian customer service rep who, obviously not looking into the details, blindly supported his co-worker's decision.\n\nI'm still working on this one.\n\nIf you can't tell, I am not happy with Amazon's Indian service department.","name":"t1_cs7v4za","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-16 03:20:22","week":25}

Been lurking for quite a while researching what products to sell, sourcing, shipping, etc.  I seem to have a grasp of the basics, and have made some pretty good home run sales in recent weeks. (i.e. - Bought a board game at a yard sale for a buck, just sold on amazon for $95.00+shipping). That being said, i recently read about FBA and am interested in sending a lot of stuff in.  However, in researching, I came across someone who posted about the tax in different states? This is where I'm stuck. Do I have to charge tax depending on where the items go? Does Amazon automatically charge the tax? Do I file separately myself? I technically have a business, ein, and registered name, but have not had any sales or services rendered in my field for about a year. Can I include Amazon/Ebay into my business taxes?  So many questions and it all seems so complicated all of a sudden!

If not, get it. \n\nDoctors are expensive. Even if you can afford to pay them, get on a payment plan. Its usually 0% interest.\n\nBabies need stuff. First time parents want to buy their baby lots more stuff. If you get that urge, snuff it out. If your wife gets that urge, I can't help you. (I could not help myself :) ).

{"id":"cs8whuo","author":"mixed_biznits_please","body":"Some things to consider to help save money after the baby comes (and I second a lot of what other posters have said):  \n\n- DO NOT BUY ANYTHING NEW.  There is so much unnecessary baby shit out there and a lot of it helps streamline things and make your lives slightly easier, but this is probably more of a luxury item for you guys than a necessary expense.  There are a lot of ways to buy baby clothes via Craigslist, consignment sales, Facebook garage sale groups, etc.  Trust me - the shit is cute, but it really adds up.  You can buy perfectly good clothes for cheap and your baby will grow out of it so fast that you'll be glad you didn't spend that much money on them. I should say that the one exception to this is a car seat; you'll probably want that new to make sure it's safe and hasn't been in any accidents.  I would not recommend buying a travel system (e.g., carseat, stroller, etc.) as the strollers are usually huge and bulky and a pain to pack in the car.  Just stick with a car seat, a car seat base for each of your cars, and a cheaper stroller frame that allows you to just transfer the car seat into the stroller.  They are lightweight and you can buy them in a resale store for cheap.  Don't worry about shit like a Diaper Genie or a wiper warmer or any of this stuff - just use a regular grocery bag and throw out the diaper right away.  Some necessities are a Boppy (again, you can get this used), a breast pump (many insurance cover this 100% now, so look into that), bottles and nipples, clothes, blankets, bassinet/crib, diapers and wipes.  Don't worry about fancy baby washcloths, just use regular ones, same with towels.  Babies don't need the fancy stuff - I know I said this a hundred times but it's easy to get stuck in that trap of \"OMG that's so cute!\" and before you know it, you've spent $500 on shit the kid doesn't need. \n\n- People will want to buy you new clothes if you create a registry, so I would recommend explaining to people to stick to the registry and perhaps only set it up to provide you with grocery gift cards, Amazon gift cards, or Target, etc.  This will probably make the best use of your money. You could also ask for the high ticket items like the car seat and bases.   \n\n- Have your GF look into breastfeeding. Have her take a free breastfeeding class, if necessary.  THIS WILL SAVE YOU $$$$$$$$$$$$$$.  Breastmilk is free.  If you plan on breastfeeding, she'll also need a high quality breast pump so she can pump into bottles and send them with the baby to daycare.  Formula is ridiculously expensive so I would stick with breastmilk, if your GF is able to nurse and the baby takes to it like a champ.  This will literally save you hundreds of dollars, if not thousands. ","name":"t1_cs8whuo","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-17 00:34:38","week":25}

{"id":"cs94f2j","author":"ally-saurus","body":"Congratulations! You have gotten some good advice (and some disrespectful advice) so I don't have too much to add. I just wanted to say congratulations because I know how important it can be to hear that right now. \n\nI'm not in your same situation but I am in a situation where money is tight (due to child support on my step-kids from his previous marriage). We decided to have a kid (his third, my first) even though we live in a 2-bedroom apartment and don't have a whole hell of a lot of money left over at the end of each month. It was a wonderful decision. Probably the best I've ever made.\n\nDaycare will be the hardest thing to afford. Depending on how much your girlfriend earns, it may not make sense for her to go back to work immediately - especially if she is in a job where turnover is high. On the bright side, if she is in one of these jobs she can probably pick up part-time hours while you are in class, and avoid daycare fees that way. Childcare will absolutely be the hardest part, financially, so anything you can do schedule-wise to keep it to a minimum is good.\n\nBuy everything used that you possibly can. EVERYTHING. I bought just about all of my son's clothing (10.5 months old now) used. We have a Once Upon A Child store near us and they sell onesies at 10 for $10, plus other stuff (rompers etc) for like $3 each. I got a swing, a stroller, and all sorts of other stuff used as well. Basically everything except the car seat. For the car seat, well, I made a registry almost solely for the purpose of returning the bulk of the stuff. Sad but true. Tons of people will probably want to give you fun cute stuff that you won't need. If you register for that stuff (clothing, wipes warmers, diaper genies, etc) then you can return it all to the store you registered at for store credit. I did that - I returned all this little miscellaneous fun stuff that had mostly cost like $15-$20 each - and used all my store credit when it was time to switch over to convertible car seats. Lifesaver. If you don't register, then people will buy that stuff wherever they feel like, and then you can't use the store credit as effectively because you will have like $20 here, $50 there, etc.\n\nA word on car seats: this is really the first big financial choice you will make re: a baby (aside from medical stuff). You will have two options: a \"bucket seat,\" which is the kind that has a base in the car and the seat itself clicks out so that you can carry it with or click it into a stroller frame; and a convertible seat, which stays in the car. The difference is convenience and price. The bucket seat is SUPER handy in the early months, because when that baby falls asleep in the car you can just take the whole seat out and sneak inside. But.....it's basically buying a whole extra unnecessary car seat, so it is a luxury. The weight limit on these seats is somewhat high - usually around 30lbs - but most kids outgrow the height first, and lots of people only get about 6 months or so out of a bucket seat. Then they have to upgrade to a convertible seat, which is made to \"convert\" from rear-facing to front-facing and will typically fit a kid until they are like 4 years old. In your situation it probably makes sense to go with a convertible seat from the beginning. Most of them go down to like 6lbs. It is scary to put a newborn in a huge convertible seat like that because their heads immediately slump all over the place, but they do that in bucket seats too, and it stops pretty fast. You can roll a towel up and put it around their head to keep it in place for the first couple weeks. A bucket seat is not more comfortable or safe for the baby, it is just more convenient for the parent.\n\nSo after childcare and car seats, diapers are probably the next biggest non-negotiable expense. Some people will tell you to use cloth diapers, and that is a viable option, but it may not save you that much money. It's also very hard in an apartment. I got a bunch of cloth diapers for free from friends who had already potty-trained, so I used them for the first four months until I went back to work. It was not really very complicated or hard at all, but the laundry killed me once I was working again, so I switched to disposables. I would say that disposables are probably the way you want to go, because (unless you have a bunch of friends giving you stuff for free) cloth is a huge investment upfront and the savings come over the next couple years, whereas you really are going to want to save money upfront and pay a little bit at a time in the coming years instead. \n\nDon't stock up on diapers before the baby is here. Get about two packs in newborn size - two different brands - and two in size 1, and nothing else until after the baby is here. Then buy a gift card every couple weeks to wherever you shop - Target, etc - so that you are putting money towards diapers but not committing to a brand or size that may not work for you. Babies are all born different sizes and shapes, and you will have no idea what works best for your kid until you try. Amazon has good pricing on diapers, and I know lots of people love the Target Up &amp; Up brand as well (didn't fit my baby well but lots of my friends swear by it).\n\nHold off on buying a crib. Get a secondhand cosleeper or bassinet (a pack and play with bassinet option is probably available used wherever you are) and use that until the baby outgrows it. I got a crib when my gigantic baby outgrew his bassinet at 3 months, and then he went through a major sleep regression at 4 months and has been sleeping in our bed ever since. Don't scoff - I swore I would never let my kid in my bed - this is what works and it may be what works for you too. And it's free! Now that he is getting older I have his crib mattress on the floor, and he sleeps the first half the night there before waking up and needing to come into our bed - but that is literally the most use we've gotten out of the crib in his first year. So wait on the crib until the baby is at least a couple months old.\n\nDon't bother with a changing table. Waste of money, waste of space. I have a changing pad that I store under the crib and pull out when he has a dirty diaper, but if it's just wet I usually just change him wherever. You will not be laying that baby lovingly down on a changing table for months on end - you will get tired of that shit and eventually he will too, and he'll start rolling and crawling away, etc. I mostly change my baby with him standing up playing with a toy on the coffee table these days - I only force him onto the changing pad if he is actually dirty. Screw a changing table.\n\nThat said, Ikea is great for baby stuff. Cribs (if you want one) are like $100 or so. They also have toys for dirt cheap, really nice ones.\n\nAh, toys. Don't bother with them unless you really can't help it. Try to buy them used whenever possible. Your baby does not need them and will only want YOUR SHIT anyway. My baby's favorite toy bin is a mixing bowl that I keep on the floor of the kitchen, which I fill each day with new (relatively safe) kitchen supplies. He feels like he is getting into something new and forbidden, and he likes the novelty of it. I mean I literally put, like, empty cardboard packaging, measuring cups, ramekins, spoons, whatever - different stuff every day - in it. He loves it. People will buy or give you toys and you will drown in them even if you never buy any yourself, and your baby will inevitably be way less interested in them than he is in the power cord to your laptop. Try not to waste your money on them, at least not until you have a sense of what your kid might really enjoy. My baby is highly sensitive to music and gets excited whenever my SO plays the guitar, so I got him a cheap ukelele. He just slaps at it and throws it around, but he loves it. That sort of thing is a luxury and if you try to buy these things ahead of time you will only waste your money and end up with piles of stuff that your baby does not ever play with. Wait and see what he likes, and then ask for it for holidays or save up and buy it. Avoid everything else.

I've not always had luck but I lucked into a few things.\n- a Schwinn airdyne bike (older model) paid $45 already sold for $250 on Craigslist.\n- about 10 unopened toner cartridges paid $1 each. They look to sell on Amazon for 20-30 a piece.\n- unopened Microsoft office student teacher edition for Mac. Paid $20 looks to be going for $300.\nAbout 12 other odds an ends that will sell for 30-40 a piece. (Board games, books, Lego sets, etc)\n\nThis truly was my first \"sucessful\" garage sale shopping weekend. The other times I've been out people just had a bunch of crap and took too much time. The thing that helped  was finding an affluent neighborhood garage sale with multiple participating. I was able to hit up 20 garage sales in two hours.

Some money saving tips I have:\n\nBuffets are cheaper than plated dinners (more bang for your buck). I thought I wanted a plated dinner until I realized how much more expensive it would be.\n\nWe went with cupcakes instead of a wedding cake. Also cheaper and we didn't find a bakery we liked better than Sprinkles cupcakes.\n\nFor things like programs, I designed them myself and then ordered the printing through FedEx office. If you pick it up at a location, no shipping costs!\n\nI used my Discover card for a lot. They give you 1% cash back bonus on everything, which you can then use dollar for dollar on Amazon for decorations or hotel bag supplies, etc.\n\nWe also registered at Target. The gift cards I got at the bridal shower came in handy. We stocked the bar ourselves and most of the soda and beer was purchased with these.\n\nMy most important thing was that the wedding really reflect our personalities as a couple.

A native mobile banking app likely also uses HTTPS to communicate to the bank's servers, but I can't be as sure of that as I would be on a desktop because native mobile apps do not have HTTPS padlocks. As a compromise, one could not use the mobile banking from the device's app store and just use the bank's mobile website through in their in-phone browser where the HTTPS padlock would be visible. \n\nIf you are willing to shop on Amazon.com or pay bills online or something like that, you're already exposing yourself to the same risks that exist using mobile and online banking. It all uses the same forms of security technology to transmit your card and login details back and forth.\n\nThose technical tidbits aside, I consider it very safe. I've online banked and been a Quicken user (which contacts my bank and downloads all my transactions to my computer) since 2008 and have seen no evidence that my banking credentials have ever been compromised. Others, however, have not been so lucky. Usually though, any insecurity is due to something on their end, not the bank. Key loggers are an example of that.

{"id":"cs9gol0","author":"OneSkinneeJ","body":"Hey, everyone, I posted in the Moronic Monday thread a couple days ago and got some great feedback regarding a trip from Florida to Texas, where we'd take a one-way cruise back to Florida. Unfortunately, that entire cruise itinerary has been canceled and we're now looking at other options, so our credit card plans are changing as a result.\n\nOur new plan is to take a one-way flight from Florida (preferably from MLB preferably, or MCO) to New York City, where we'd go on a different one-way cruise from NYC to Miami, and then get a one-way rental car from Miami the 3 hours back home. I'll answer the usual questions and then what I'm thinking...\n\n**1. What is your current FICO score?** 798 (this was prior to the CSP and Freedom apps, as mentioned in #2 below)\n\n**2. What cards do you currently have?** \nI've been researching a lot the last week and have already applied and been approved for both the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Freedom.\n\n* Chase Sapphire Preferred (June 2015)\n* Chase Freedom (June 2015)\n* Barclays Sallie Mae World MasterCard (December 2014)\n* Fidelity Investments American Express (April 2012)\n* Chase Amazon.com Visa (~2011)\n* Citi Dividend World MasterCard (~2006)\n* Bank of America MasterCard (~2000, I don't recall any more specific details about it)\n\n**3. Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back?**\nI believe the best targets will be hotel points, followed by airline miles/points. More on this below...\n\n**4. What point/miles do you currently have?**\nNothing at all. No points, miles, or hotel status. I'm just getting off the ground in this game.\n\n**5. What is the airport you're flying out of?**\nIdeally, Melbourne International (MLB) in Melbourne, FL or Orlando International (MCO). MLB is about 10 minutes from our house and we could get a ride there with a friend or take a short shuttle/taxi. Mostly Delta, American, and US Airways fly out of MLB. MCO is about an hour away but has far more options so it's on the table, for sure.\n\n**6. Where would you like to go?**\nRight now, we're pretty confident that our plan is New York City from Friday 11/11/2016 to Wednesday 11/16/2016. From there, we'd take a one-way cruise from New York City to Miami, and then make the 3 hour drive back home from Miami.\n\nWe just got the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Freedom, which should get us about 72k UR points (40k Sapphire + 5k Sapphire authorized user + 20k Freedom + 2.5k Freedom authorized user + minimum 4k Sapphire spend + minimum 500 Freedom spend). Ideally, we get to at least 75k, which I think we should be able to do pretty easily.\n\nMy original plan was to redeem these UR points for airfare, but with the destination change to NYC, it seems like converting to Hyatt points may be best. 3 nights at 25k (if we get 75k UR points) or 30k (if we reached 90k via Freedom bonuses) per night would get some very nice hotel stays (any of the Andaz/similar for 25k or the Park Hyatt for 30k) would blow away any airline conversions.\n\nI'm also looking at the Chase Hyatt card to get the 2 free nights. Assuming we can combine those 2 nights with the 3 nights from the UR conversion, that covers 5 nights.\n\nNot using the UR points for airfare does leave us without anything to help cover the flights. Delta and American/US Airways are the most flexible for us since they both fly from both our local airport (MLB) and Orlando (MCO). I'm 6'4\" and have a bad knee and need leg room, I can't comfortably squeeze into an economy seat. We'd be looking at upgrading to either Delta Comfort+ or AA Main Cabin Extra. I think Delta's options out of our local airport are a bit better so it may make sense to target either a Delta-branded card or a Delta-convertible card before an AA option.\n\n**TL;DR:** We're looking at flying from Florida to New York City and staying there for 5 nights before taking a one-way cruise that returns to Miami. I think we should be looking at the Chase Hyatt card to get 2 free nights and combine that with 75k-90k UR points to cover the 5 nights. Then either a Delta or American Airlines-branded card or one that converts to either of those, preferably Delta, to cover two Delta Comfort+ or AA Main Cabin Extra flights. Maybe the Gold Delta Skymiles Amex? Ideally, not long before we leave, we get a Barclay Arrival Plus and use that to pay for (and later pay off with miles) any car rentals, shuttle/taxis, onboard charges on the cruise, etc.\n\nThanks so much for any feedback!","name":"t1_cs9gol0","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-17 14:10:46","week":25}

{"id":"cs9nkqn","author":"DGLGMUT","body":"Hey guys I tried posting this last week but I think I waited until too late in the day so I never got a response. Here goes nothing!\n\n1: What is your credit score?\n\nâ721 Barclays TU FICO\n\nâ739 CK TU &amp; Equifax\n\nâ739 CS\n\nâ688 Mint (Always lower for some reason)\n\n2: What cards do you currently have? For better results also add the date you were approved for the cards.\n\nâVisions FCU Visa Classic (11/12 $750)\n\nâAmex Delta Gold (8/14 $2000)\n\nâBarclay's Sallie Mae WMC (12/14 $2000)\n\nâBarclay's AAviator Red WMC (12/14 $5500)\n\n3: Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back?\n\nâCurrently targeting cash back and AAvantage Miles. Trying to save up for an \"Around the World\" ticket (200k miles needed?)\n\n4: What point/miles do you currently have?\n\nâ~69k Skymiles\n\nâ~56k AAvantage Miles\n\n5: What is the airport you're flying out of?\n\nâSeveral options within a couple hours (NYC, Philly, etc)\n\n6: Where would you like to go?\n\nâ\"Around the World\" with AAdvantage Miles. I figure I'll use the Sky Pesos for domestic flights or random stuff. Haven't really worked them out yet.\n\nOkay so with all that listed, this is my current short term game plan:\n\nâ Apply for Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select with 50k mile sign on bonus. I will keep this card for a year before downgrading it to a Citi DoubleCash. I will be keeping my Barclay's AAviator Red because it has a 10,000 mile anniversary bonus (carried over from when it was the US Airways card).\n\nâ Try to get Amex to waive Delta Gold fee or possibly PC. I no longer fly Delta monthly so I no longer need this card. It was a way to get my foot in the door with AMEX but currently none of their other cards are appealing to me with the exception of the SPG due to SPG points having a good transfer rate to AA. I wouldn't product change to SPG because I want (need) the sign up bonus. It just sucks that AMEX doesn't back date anymore. The SPG might be something I try to get next year after I downgrade the AAdvantage to the DoubleCash. In the mean time I need to figure out something for the Delta Gold.\n\nâApp for Discover It card. I will probably do this after going for the AAdvantage card since Citi is tougher on new inquiries. Assuming I can find a decent sign up bonus (like the $150 that doubles to $300 or at least the Amazon credit) this would be the perfect 2% back card for the year that I need to wait to downgrade to my DoubleCash. Plus with the categories doubled to 10% for the year as well some will be of great use to me (gas, online shopping/holiday shopping).\n\nâApp for BofA Better Balance Rewards card. I always pay my balance in full and earning $100 a year for making minimal purchases seems like a no brainer. The bonus will go towards my AAviator Red's AF so that way I can continue to collect my 10,000 mile anniversary bonus \"free of charge\". I'll of course go through retention yearly to try to get some extra miles here and there too but the BBR card seems like it makes sense for anyone who can assign it a regularly occurring bill and pays in full every month.\n\nSo there you have it. That's my plan for the next year. Now all I'm wondering is when to do it all. My Delta Gold fee hits next month so I'll need to do that first. My two Barclay cards only counted as one inquiry on TU and I only have one other inquiry on Experian from Amex. Do I app for the Citi AAdvantage next month as well and then go for the Discover It &amp; BofA BBR all in one shot? I'm just worried about losing out on the 50k offer from Citi and you must enroll by the end of July to get the double cash back bonus on the Discover It card. The BofA BBR can wait longer than these two but it is free money and I don't want to miss out and have it get nerfed like what happened to the US Bank Cash+. I have done a ton of reading and research but I am always willing to learn more. Any suggestions or improvements to my plans? Basically I am trying to get my around the world ticket through sign up bonuses and I will put priority on their manufactured spend but I prefer cash back in general. Any advice welcome! Thanks!\n\nEdit to add: My income is pretty limited at 25k on my apps. I currently have a total of $10,250 available credit so I'm not sure how much I can get without issue. Always around 1-5% overall utilization with the only negative things on my report being 3 late payments from back in 2009. I am also racking up student loans (currently ~25k but will rise yearly for the next couple years). Thanks again!\n\nEdit For Repost: Recently got an offer from Chase to get their Freedom cash back card with a $200 bonus. This would slot in above the BBR card for me and maybe above the Discover It if I can't find a good sign up bonus. I heard that once you get another Chase card you can transfer your cash back UR points to be used like regular UR points which could be much more valuable if they transfer well to airline partners. How are UR points for use with AA?  Thanks!","name":"t1_cs9nkqn","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-17 17:53:08","week":25}

{"id":"cs9wy4r","author":"PlumberODeth","body":"Here's a story about Amazon and their recently rolled out same day deliveries: I ordered a couple packages as a test for this new rollout.  The first package came, the driver couldn't find his way into the building (UPS and FedEx drivers have buiding keys to get to our mailroom), left me a message on my phone asking me to call him.  I called back several times over the next couple days and received no answer, no return calls.  The company could not reach the driver when I called them.  Eventually, a couple days later, we just gave up and I got a refund.  The next try, on a separate occasion, the package arrived but very late at night, around 10pm.  It was the same driver (recognized the voice) and it turned out that it was just some guy and his wife in their family car.\n\nI hold no animosity against the driver, it's hard being an individual taking on a new service and trying to maintain the same level of professionalism and liability as a delivery company that has millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of employees.  I will say, however, that I do question a million dollar company that tries to cut it's corners by contracting inexperienced, unprofessional amateur drivers as it's replacement delivery service.","name":"t1_cs9wy4r","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-06-17 21:53:58","week":25}

But the \"G,\" growth, is a fraction (unless it's growing at over 100%, which is quite rare). But to make the PEG work, you need to convert the fractional G into a whole number, i.e. P/E of 15 and 20% growth rate = 15/(.20 * 10) = .75. Why not just multiply the 20% growth by 100? 1,000? 1,000,000?\n\nSecondly, what type of growth are you measuring? Sales? EBITDA? Net income? FCF? Of course the \"correct\" answer should be EPS growth, since you're using P/E in the PEG. But then doesn't that mean that, say, AMZN isn't \"growing?\" Is NFLX still \"growing?\" Further, doesn't that imply that IBM actually IS growing? And how long out does your growth rate go?

And maybe there's someone out there who would say buy it and flip it successfully when others would stay away.

{"id":"csa5rhe","author":"WestCoastBestCoast01","body":"I'm guessing that you're applying to schools soon?\n\nFirst of all, private schools generally give out a lot more financial aid than you might expect. My private, $56k a year school in an expensive city was less expensive than the in-state school 20 minutes from my parent's house (though I probably made up the difference in cost of living). Fill out and send a FAFSA, even if you don't think you'll get anything. Do it anyway, at least you might get some federal loans which have better repayment options. Until you get your financial aid awards you shouldn't make any decision based off of finances. You have no idea what kind of scholarships or grants they might be able to offer.\n\nAnother important thing to consider: the best companies and the best jobs recruit out of the best schools. You think kids from ____ State are getting recruited by Goldman or Boeing or Amazon? Not impossible but unlikely. Similarly, when you go to more prestigious schools you're more likely to be surrounded by people who have more lucrative social and professional networks--networking is the reason you go to a prestigious school. The prestigious school will open more doors for your first job, but after your first job it becomes less meaningful than your work experience.\n\nLastly, there are no guarantees. If you're a high school senior right now the economy will be in a different place 4 or 5 years from now. You are *definitely* not guaranteed a job. You can weigh your decision on likelihood of getting a job, but you need to understand that things might not work out.

{"id":"csag9i0","author":"Zac112","body":"Not that i've found. Besides, even if there is, the overall cost of applying it to all your sales/annual cost usually is close to or exceeds the amount of potential fraud in a year anyway. You're better off just applying some 80/20 boundaries to who you accept as a customer. Just because you're selling something doesn't mean you're obligated to sell to anyone waving a dollar in the air.\n\nWe now process all transactions through Paypal, but have certain countries/regions blocked in our system (all of Africa for example, Moldova, other poor countries where fraud is prevalent etc)\nOrders above a certain amount are automatically put on hold. When this happens we just refund the customer, politely inform them that for larger orders we require payment via Western Union or Wire Transfer, and are happy to accept a 50% upfront payment 50% on completion for mutual security. Sometimes we've even blamed Paypal's 2.5% policy for doing this. \n\n9 times out of 10 we never hear from those people again- possibly lost business, but our annual losses due to fraud have also plummeted to almost nothing. Net gain for us.\n\nIf these giant orders were legitimate, and the customer is looking to buy so much stock, they shouldn't have a problem with using a more secure service.\n\nIf an \"unauthorised purchase\" claim is made, the customers bank is obligated to give you two weeks to prove the purchase is legitimate, but we've sent copies of signatures, tracking numbers, IP addresses etc- once we even had actual photos of the customers Facebook feed holding our stock and LAUGHING, while posting about how easy it is to \"hack\" small businesses. So far we haven't won a single case, because it isn't in their best interests to do so- the customer is their client, so they want to keep them as happy as possible, the merchant is a complete stranger. Banks are even worse than Amazon when it comes to Merchant protection.\n\nEvery time I see a bank promoting their \"24 hour Credit Card Fraud Protection program\" as an incentive now I quietly fume inside because I know how they do it- the banks never cover the loss of fraudulent transactions when a customer makes a claim- legitimately or not. The customer gets their money back and is happy, the bank gets to look like a hero, and small business owners like us end up screwed from both sides- now with no money AND no stock.\n\nWe haven't tried filing a fraudulent claim with a physical signature on an order invoice though- who knows? Impractical to get across international borders though, and my overall experience is that if the bank thinks there is any possibility they can get away with rejecting your defense, they will.","name":"t1_csag9i0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-18 08:17:22","week":25}

{"id":"csalavd","author":"day1patch","body":"Let's see, I hope the formatting on this won't get all wrenched up because this will get a bit longer :) \n\nFirst some basic tips, then gigs that sell well (for me at least). I will take a blog writing gig as an example for the first part:\n\nthink through your gig description. You will want to explain yoyur conditions and what you offer as thoroughly as possible to minimize questions and misunderstandings. That means \"I will write 500 words\" is not as good as \"I will wirte up to 500 words in \"several topics that I know something about\". Include a disclaimer \"message me first to discuss the gig\" to give you the possibility to cancel orders you don't like.\n\nSet your delivery time one day higher than you normally need to allow for breaks.\n\nIf you can only offer gigs that don't require much work. 4$ after fiverr takes it's cut isn't enough to justify more than half an hour of work in my opinion.\n\noffer extras, most notably the \"fast delivery\" extra. If you followed my advice to set one day more than you need this is an opportunity to earn 4 more dollars with no additional work. Other extras can be \"I will write 500 more words\" or \"I will include a picture\" (make sure to account for the cost of stock photos).\n\npublish the same gig more than once. If you look around on fiverr you will find a lot of people who offer \"I will write articles\", \"I will write blog posts\" and \"I will write on any topic\", all three of them are basically the same but attract totally different customers.\n\nDon't deal with idiots. Often times people will just order without messaging me, can't write proper English in the single sentence they use to order or show their idiocy otherwise. These guys are just awful and will give you unneeded trouble.\n\ndeliver on time. If you can't, at least inform the other person that you will need more time.\n\nDon't take more work than you can handle.\n\nThere is a page called \"buyers requests\" where people can write what they need and sellers apply for the job. Especially in the beginning that works wonders.\n\nDon't think that a gig you could offer is so stupid that no one would buy it. I am selling \"I will watch and comment on 10 of your youtube videos from a German IP\" and people buy that (sometimes at least). I have seen \"I will edit your face into historic photos\" with several hundred reviews. People buy \"I will skydive and hold a board with your message\" or \"I will have my village people dance and sing the name of your loved one\" (this one really cracked me up lol)\n\nUse common sense and actually do your work proper. It seems that the great majority of people on fiverr are just plain stupid and can't even do proper work because I get \"you were the first one to actually deliver / that was able to communicate in whole sentences\" etc. from customers. And all I do is write \"hello\" and \"kind regards\" with meaningful sentences in between.\n\nFinally: Just put your gigs out there for people to see them. In the beginning I didn't get any offers and mainly put the gig online to check the waters but after a week the first offer rolled in and since then I get offers daily.  A positive rating is the most important thing, so keep it civilized.\n\n\n\nNow to the gigs that sell well for me:\n\nIf you can translate into languages other than English you have a winning gig already, even though it can be a lot of work. I get most of my money (usually over 500 per month) from translation jobs between German and English, offering 500 words at 5 Dollar that I can complete in half an hour. A lot of cool stuff by the way, I translated whole books that were very well written. Not the best pay per hour, but fun and a lot of work to be done. \n\nWriting gigs are actually a lot of work, but there is a high demand for quality blog posts so go ahead.\n\nAmazon reviews. I offer to receive free products and review them for 4 Dollars. Free stuff and additonal money, yeah. This one is probably the highest paying one per hour, it costs me one minute to buy the product on Amazon and five minutes to write a review. People send me a gift card to cover the product costs and I make sure to come up with a positive review that is meaningful. I have only been doing this for two weeks now but I am getting about two inquiries and / or orders per day now. It is most important to set the disclaimer that you will only review products you like or you will end up with your neighbors wondering who in the world could find usage for three dozens of sex dolls. If you can, get amazon prime and get family members on board to be able to offer multiple reviews for a single product.\n\nYoutube Views from a real person. I never thought anyone would buy this, not with all those gigs that offer severa thousand views and likes from bots, but apparently people want real comments really  bad. I don't sell many of this gigs but a couple per month add up over time.\n\nWordpress site setup. Setting up a wordpress site takes twenty minutes or so but a lot of people don't know how to do it. This can be anything from \"almost no work required\" to \"customer wants so many changes I would like to change his life expectancy downwards\"\n\nIf you are able to programm / code anything (as simple as keyboard macros) you can offer those programms. Think bots that automate logins, hotstrings in Autohotkey that expand \"btw\" to \"by the way\" , IRC chatbots or really any smaller programs people might need. I offer a lot of those that sell every now and then.\n\nyou can set up presentations, pdfs or short video tutorials about certain areas, mostly \"how to make money\" and offer to send them over. This is really the easiest thing after setup, just send them a pdf file you have already written. In fact, I will probably do that with this post after finishing it :) \n\nI hope you can draw some useful tips out of this text.","name":"t1_csalavd","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-18 13:44:08","week":25}

{"id":"csanxnw","author":"djbr22","body":"Having created several blogs, I can tell you it's hard work - but, if you've got solid information and a few months to really dedicate towards it, you open yourself up to an endless variety of options.\n\nI wouldn't start off with a \"money based podcast\" like /u/ImportGuy says. No offense, but no one knows you yet, so you won't have any listeners for a while. This will definitely eat up your time and money, and you aren't even sure if you have an audience yet. You can do this after you've established credibility for yourself.\n\n1. **Start a Wordpress blog.** I use GoDaddy Managed wordpress. Buy X-Theme from theme.co, and use the Renew theme. Super user-friendly, and you can see your blog edits in real-time. I'd be happy to help you out with this as well. Use Google's Keyword Planner to find a domain name ending in .com\n2. **Find a \"niche\" in the finance category.** \"Finances for teenagers\", \"Investing for young investors\", \"Finances for  come to mind right away. For instance, my newest blog is centered around DIY projects - but I specialized in \"Pipe desk plans\", http://pipedeskplans.com. Once you find the niche you want to target,  buy that domain \"financeforteenagers.com\" or whatever. Once again, use Google's Keyword Planner tool to determine which keywords have a decent amount of traffic, but low competition. Now, you can optimize your site's SEO and have a much better chance at ranking on Google, rather than competing with the thousand other \"finance\" blogs.\n3. **Create quality content regularly.** You'll spend a couple week fine-tuning your site to your liking, and after that, you'll have to create content regularly to keep your readers interested. Find other similar blogs and use their ideas, but in your own words.\n4. **Affiliate income.** As more people come to your blog, they will be more likely to trust you. Trust = sales and relationships. You can make a recommendation for a book someone else has written on finances, and using Amazon's Affiliate Program, anytime someone clicks on your link - ANY purchase they make within the next 24 hours you get affiliate income for.\n5. Now that you have a \"following\", now you can get to the fun stuff. Create an e-book, give it away if they register on your site, start up a podcast because you know people will listen, run contests or giveaways if people your content, etc. You'll get the hang of it.\n6. **Create a youtube channel, and give your readers  quick 2-3 minute video tips &amp; tricks.** Most of us don't have the attention span to spend 10-15 minutes getting learning everything, but for those f us who are, you can create longer segments every once in a while, but I would say try to stay around 2-5 minutes.\n6. **Create a social media presense.** Facebook(business page), LinkedIn, and Reddit will your best friend for your niche. Create your content, share it on LinkedIn and Facebook, and find smaller subreddits to occasionally post into. PLease don't SPAM any subreddits, but adding your link to a comment every once in a while about a particular topic(especially if the thread is new), gets you a better chance of being upvoted, thus creating more views to your blog.\n\nGood luck, I hope this helps you out!\n","name":"t1_csanxnw","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-18 15:36:04","week":25}

However, if anything I'd say when you're young and have fairly basic expenses it's easier to build good habits, so it might still be worth it.\n\nIf it helps, I have 8 active credit cards, and both Chase and AMEX have easy auto-pay options. I have all cards configured to automatically pay the minimum balance, and then I log in each month and manually pay the full balance instead. This way if I forget it still keeps me from paying a fee (though interest will of course kick in), but I'm not signing myself up for unexpected thousand dollar withdrawals from my bank account. It also forces me to keep up with my spending (though I do this with Mint anyway) and all that sort of thing. In 8 years I've missed exactly one payment, by about an hour, so I've payed something like $25 in fees and a dollar in interest, or something along those lines. Totally worth it, and it was missing that one payment that got me to figure out auto-pay.\n\nI highly recommend Chase cards, as they're easy to qualify for and tend to have decent bonuses without annual fees.

{"id":"csb0rol","author":"spring_chicken","body":"I'm an accountant and run a payroll service that is regional to Southern California, so I'm biased, but with the disclosure out of the way....\n\nFirst, check with your accountant to see if they have a recommendation or if this is a service they provide. You can typically get better service for the same price, and when you call with questions, you'll talk to an accountant instead of a minimum wage customer service rep or salesperson.\n\nIf you decide to go with one of the big guys:\n\n* ADP has a few options. ADP Run is their online payroll option. Much cheaper than their other service, but it requires you to do more work setting up your employee (rates/W4/etc) and entering hours.\n* Paychex is full service and tends to be costly for smaller employers. \n* Zen Payroll is new and is California only. They've had a few growing pains, and they provide a decent service, but I've heard a few complaints. They don't deliver payroll, so either employees all need to be direct deposit or you need to print stubs and then cut checks. And direct deposit payroll needs to be sent in 4 business days before payday. Industry standard is 2. That's a deal breaker for most.\n* Intuit Online Payroll is a good option for a new employer. Like ADP run, it's more hands on where you'll need to set up employees and enter hours, but you can print payroll from your computer directly onto laser checks, and they'll send you reminders when taxes are due so you can log in and authorize them to be sent (instead of taxes being impounded like with most other services each payday)\n\nA few California only things you should keep in mind:\n\n1. You need to get workers comp before your first employee even starts. Look into it now.\n\n2. Buy a Federal/California employer poster on Amazon ($15). The DOL does random checks and if you're caught without one, it's a 5-figure fine\n\n3. Payday for weekly or bi-weekly employees needs to be no later than 7 days after the end of the pay period. For semi-monthly, 10 days, and for monthly, they need to be paid by the 25th of the current month.\n\n4. Minimum wage is currently $9.00 per hour and goes to $10.00 per hour January 1\n\n5. There is a new law on the books requiring employers to create a Sick Leave policy that meets the minimums established by the new rules. [Link to my write up explaining the minimums](http://www.primepayrollservices.com/blog/employee_benefits/CA-Paid-Sick-Leave.htm)\n\nHope that helps a little.

A lot of this is based off of your agreement to pay the merchant and how the merchant pulls the funds.","name":"t1_csbhe7b","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-19 05:05:22","week":25}

You have it shipped to Amazon (or another 3PL) and they agree to do order fulfillment for a fee.  You then create an Amazon or Shopify store and market the products.  When you earn a profit on the products you bought and sold, you pay tax on your profit.\n\nOn Kickfurther you buy products that brands have a track record of selling.  The brands do order fulfillment.  You even get the ability to sell the products you've invested in to earn your profits faster.

It would be the case if I was buying stock in the company, but that's not what you appear to be selling here.\n\n&gt; Imagine you go to aliexpress.com and buy some inventory. You have it shipped to Amazon (or another 3PL) and they agree to do order fulfillment for a fee. You then create an Amazon or Shopify store and market the products. When you earn a profit on the products you bought and sold, you pay tax on your profit.\n\nThat's fine, and the person doing that would be 100% liable as a sole proprietor for all business debts. If a customer sues that business, the person running the firm is liable.\n\nIf I invest in a firm like that, it is no longer a sole proprietorship, it is a general partnership. Both partners now share liability unless they form an LLC (which I don't have control of through your platform). If I am personally buying inventory for the firm, then it appears I am a partner, and as such can be held liable for any and all debts of the firm. If it isn't me investing in the business, but it is a loan, then the service is just a mirror of Lendingtree, and the 1099 tax documents are required along with many government regulations governing lending.\n\nI don't see how you get out of this without liability or tax documents.\n\n&gt;We have a 0% default rate\n\nIt's disingenuous to market yourself with this claim given that you're currently operating on a very small base (so you can cherry pick investment opportunities) and most of your originated debt has not been paid back yet (&gt;80%).","name":"t1_csc3icc","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-19 20:07:35","week":25}

In the past if I saw an item for $3 that could sell for $10 I would be all over it.  I think a lot of people on this subreddit would pick it up, judging by posts that say \"I grab anything I can 3x my money on.\"  For me (unless it's a retail arbitrage repeatable sale) this is not worth my time, it doesn't keep cash in my wallet and gas in my car.  It becomes much more important to focus on the $10 items that can sell for $40+.  A one-time $7 profit (before shipping/fees/packaging materials) just won't cut it, even if my ROI is through the roof.\n\n* You need to treat it like a real business.  The best part about this as a gig is obviously the flexible hours.  However, my best earnings have come on weeks that I have stuck to getting up at 7 AM and legitimately putting in 8+ hour work days.  There's a Lori Greiner quote that says *\"Entrepreneurs are willing to work 80 hours a week to avoid working 40 hours a week.\"*  It's undeniably true.\n\n* You need to constantly be expanding.  Your previous milestones don't matter.  No, offense, but who cares if you sold 400 items in the past?  You have no idea if 1 item will sell tomorrow.  The only way to increase your chances for more sales is to get more items listed on Amazon or Ebay or Craigslist or whatever you sell through.  If you have 100 items listed, your new goal immediately becomes 200.  If you have 200 items, your new goal is to have 300.

Read 10 pages per day without skipping, it will be the same as reading 3650 pages per year or 10 great educational books. You'll gain more from many great minds than you ever will in college.\n\nFocus on 5 simple daily disciplines and commit to do them everyday no matter what. Remember that these are simple, usually mundane things that are almost as easy to do as not to do, but things that over time will compound like money properly invested and bring huge success.\n\nPersonally I've found great success in improving my health. And now feel better able to focus more on my business. Make your health your number one priority. If you are married, make your relationship your second most important priority as going on your own is extremely stressful at times and you will need harmony in your relationship for this to ever work. Make your business your third priority. Take it slow and steady, one step at a time. Don't get a small business loan and blow yourself into bankruptcy without first reading and comprehending the above two books and a few more books they recommend.\n\nIf you do go bankrupt, it happens to 95% of everyone that tries this. Don't give up. IBM's Watson famously said \"If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate\"\n\nI went on my own right at the start of the dotcom bust in 2000.

But of course you can get a bunch of different ones depending on where you shop.\n\nThe yearly fee kind of kills you if you are not maxing out the grocery store expenditure.\n\nAlso, I don't see any rebate programs in your list.  You have to keep an eye out for those.  A lot of time they will have good rebates such as $10 off of a $10 purchase at walmart,... etc.  These are big savers as it's a quick $10 or $20 in your pocket depending on promotion.\n\nFor people who are not familiar with the card:  \n\nMy American Express Blue Cash Preferred card offers cash back at the rate of 6% at grocery stores (up to $6000 per year, and you can purchase gift cards for other stores if you don't normally spend $6k a year on groceries which allows you to \"cheat the system\"), 3% at gas stations and major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others), and 1% on everything else.  It also includes varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back) that vary with time.  An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).  And the best customer service of any credit card company ( http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-us-credit-card-satisfaction-study ).

{"id":"csddz0u","author":"President_Camacho","body":"The problem I see right away is the payments system. Currently, there is no universal way of aggregating charges from individuals in order to make a third party purchase. The Visa Mastercard system unites all cardholders and businesses, so payments take place according to their terms of service. You'll find that these terms are fairly restrictive. Amazon and Paypal have more flexible payments systems, but their technology only extends to the borders of their system. Consequently, any aggregation technology you develop will only work within their markets, which are vastly smaller than the overall world of Visa/MC.\n\nYou'll also find that payments companies are very suspicious of innovation or anything done non-traditionally. To them it implies a security risk. You'll see in their terms how they reserve the right to ban any transaction they don't like. Any transaction. They also have a long list of industries and uses that they refuse to support.\n\nThe system would have to act as a reseller to get around the payments issue. But major retailing websites probably won't let you represent their inventory, technology, or branding on your reselling website.\n\nMaybe there's a way to aggregate purchases using bitcoin on Overstock.com.

Frankl - how a psychologist found meaning in Nazi death camps (he was in 4 different ones and his parents, brother and pregnant wife didn't make it).

I looked at that item quite some time ago and it would be a good one to brand and sell on Amazon for someone just getting started.  You can get an order for under 100.00, throw a page up on Amazon to make it your own, FBA the item, list it at 14.99 and most likely sell 3-4 a week or more if you run Amazon ads.","name":"t1_cse2ug0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-21 22:11:58","week":25}

{"id":"cse4jid","author":"Cyhawk","body":"Flea markets are a different beast all together. Of course they're there to make a profit, but their profit margin tends to be a low lower than what you would like your profit margin to be. Many big vendors either buy in bulk off the slow boat from China or they buy rental units up for auction. remember that show Storage wars? While it was totally fake stuff like that really happens and is quite common. Most of the stuff they get is well, junk. So they sell it as junk. Lets say they paid $100 for a storage unit with 500 items in it. $1/item makes them $400. Factor in costs ($10-20 space rent, $20 gas) and you're up about $350 for about 24 hours of work. (16 for the flea market, 8 hours buying/sorting the crap). Pretty good right? That's not factoring in things that can be sold for more than $1 (tools are a good example of this) or on ebay/craigslist for a lot more that wouldn't do well at the Flea Market. That's just junk sales.\n\nNow you can find gems in there worth more, but you also have to take into account the type of people who go to Flea Markets. You have a few types of people who go to Flea Markets:\n\n* The Regulars: They don't buy much, always looking for deals on hidden gems, buy their fruits/veggies and 'need' items like clothes, rarely anything else.\n* The Hoarder: These people bring a shopping cart and buy a ton of $1 crap. These people scoff at anything over $1 but will buy a broken clock because they'll \"fix\" it later. \n* The walker: Out there for exercise mainly or social (they're similar to regulars), may buy Fruits/Veggies at the end of their walk, sometimes some higher end clothes if they spot them.\n* The young \"High life on a dime\" guys with their Girlfriends. Wearing expensive, designer clothes, flashy jewelry. They'll haggle down a $5 item to $4.75 when it's worth $20 (true story). They're cheap, nasty attitude people. Depending on the looks of their girlfriend they'll actually spend money occasionally, but don't count on it.\n* The old couple: Similar to the Walkers, but not regulars. They'll buy stuff they think looks good (nick nacks) power tools or the like. This is the only group of people with $100 in their pocket that'll actually spend it. \n* The Randoms: May or may not have money. You've never seen them before and you'll never see them again. \n* The blue collar worker: Normally their with their family to buy groceries, clothes for the kids. The men buy good tools for their job, the kids buy toys. This is basically their weekly Walmart stop. They tend to only buy from vendors they know well and can save some money. Many of these customers either can't speak any English or it's too limited to have a conversation. Good people, just really poor and trying to make the best out of it. They may spend a good amount sometimes, but only if they actually need it. (Needs vs Wants)\n\nHow many of these types of Flea Market regulars have a ton of money? Not many. Those who sell at the Flea Markets weeks on end know this, and sell to their customers and not the 'market' at large. \n\nThen you end with the 'end of day' sales. This is where you can make the most money as a buyer. Imagine if you will, you as a vendor woke up at 1:30am (or slept in your truck) to get in the car line to get a good spot. It's now 5pm. You're tired as fuck, you've been outdoors all day, you had setup in the morning, sales were slow and now you have several tons of junk to put back into your truck. Lets say you have a pair of good floor speakers you're asking $75 for ($300 on Amazon new). They weigh 50lbs each and take up a lot of space. Someone comes by when you're loading up and offers you $40. Are you going to take the $40 now, or load it up now, unload it tomorrow again and hope for more? Most of us took the $40 because fuck lifting that shit again.\n\nYeah, we're in it for a profit, just not the same profit you're looking for.\n\nEdit: Wow, gold for explaining how Flea Markets work from a vendor's perspective? Ty kind sir. ","name":"t1_cse4jid","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-21 23:08:32","week":25}

{"id":"cse53if","author":"GhostofTrundle","body":"IMO, Apple definitely has an advantage, but not in the way that most of the comments suggest. I think it's better to think in completely practical terms, as a person who listens to music. \n\n- Apple made digital music purchases mainstream, and they are still the dominant player. There's been a lot of focus on the decline in digital music purchases. But the iTunes Store is still responsible for more than 85% of all digital music sales. \n\n- Second, Apple has the greatest variety of hardware, which directly translates into the largest number of real world scenarios for music listening. Six or so years ago, when the iPhone was just one of several viable phone choices and MacBooks were considered to be luxury computers, I knew people whose only Apple product was an iPod Shuffle or Nano. And that meant they bought music from the iTunes Store. Now, those people own iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads. \n\nThis is a big deal, because Apple Is the only major manufacturer of DAPs outside of Asia. If Apple Music allows you to download playlists for offline use, and you really want a compatible DAP, you're likely to get an iPod Shuffle, Nano, or Apple Watch. In AAC format, you can get about 500 minutes of music per gigabyte. Apple doesn't continue to sell iPods because they make huge profits from them. They sell iPods because iPods fulfill people's needs for listening to music. \n\nI've mentioned this several times, and I think it offends some people. But Google doesn't really give a shit if you love music. They only started selling music when Amazon forked Android. So even if you love Android and Spotify, but you also love running or cycling and want a DAP, there's a good chance Apple Music and an iPod will fulfill your actual music needs. \n\n- So really, Apple has maintained this focus on music that has sustained their expansion internationally for 15 years. And Apple Music offers the most comprehensive platform available. If you have MP3 files ripped from CDs or obtained from any other source, iTunes Match has you covered. If you bought music from iTunes, they're available at any time. If you want to store workout playlists on your iPod or Apple Watch, it's going to be there. If you want to follow artists or discover new music, you can do that within your music app. \n\nThe only thing that's not readily available is simple integration with your car's audio system that mimics what SiriusXM can provide, and that's a complicated issue, because of the long partnership between SiriusXM and car manufacturers. I mean, CarPlay in theory sounds great, but it's not really a thing yet. ","name":"t1_cse53if","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-06-21 23:26:41","week":25}

Now with that said if you have items just laying around I think the best bet is getting them online as quick as possible. How many should you do in 1 day? All of them if you can manage it. I just finished listing all the items I picked up today which was only 10 shoes and a few things for Amazon. \n\nMy only goal no matter how worn out I am is to get everything I picked up listed on the same day. Some days are a bit harder than others.\n\nThe cool thing about doing this is everyone has their style and technique. For me I just really hate stuff sitting around, I've sold way too many items within a day of listing them so I like getting them online as quick as possible.\n\nFor the daily listing I'm normally just space out my relisting/sell similar.","name":"t1_cse5tph","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-21 23:51:06","week":25}
