I've found a number of accessories on Alibaba that would compliment my app quite nicely - but should I be concerned with patents that may exist for these products, even if they're simple products we're already accustomed to? Do I need to do my own patent research for each accessory?

{"id":"4eaq70","author":"FewThingsMatter","body":"Jeff Bezos' annual letter reveals some interesting facts about Marketplace, including the one in the title above.  Here's what else he says:\n\n&gt; We took two big swings and missed – with Auctions and zShops – before we launched Marketplace over 15 years ago. We learned from our failures and stayed stubborn on the vision, and today close to 50% of units sold on Amazon are sold by third-party sellers. Marketplace is great for customers because it adds unique selection, and it’s great for sellers – there are over 70,000 entrepreneurs with sales of more than $100,000 a year selling on Amazon, and they’ve created over 600,000 new jobs. With FBA, that flywheel spins faster because sellers’ inventory becomes Prime-eligible – Prime becomes more valuable for members, and sellers sell more.\n&gt; \n&gt; This year, we created a new program called Seller Fulfilled Prime. We invited sellers who are able to meet a high bar for shipping speed and consistency in service to be part of the Prime program and ship their own orders at Prime speed directly. Those sellers have already seen a significant bump in sales, and the program has led to hundreds of thousands of additional items that are available to Prime customers via free two-day or next-day shipping in the U.S., U.K. and Germany.\n&gt; \n&gt; We also created the Amazon Lending program to help sellers grow. Since the program launched, we’ve provided aggregate funding of over $1.5 billion to micro, small and medium businesses across the U.S., U.K. and Japan through short-term loans, with a total outstanding loan balance of about $400 million. Stephen Aarstol, surfer and owner of Tower Paddle Boards, is one beneficiary. His business has become one of the fastest-growing companies in San Diego, in part with a little help from Amazon Lending. Click-to-cash access to capital helps these small enterprises grow, benefits customers with greater selection, and benefits Amazon since our marketplace revenue grows along with the sellers’ sales. We hope to expand Amazon Lending and are now working on ways to partner with banks so they can use their expertise to take and manage the bulk of the credit risk.\n&gt; In addition to nourishing our big offerings, we work to globalize them. Our Marketplace creates opportunities for sellers anywhere to reach buyers around the world. In the past, many sellers would limit their customer base to their home country due to the practical challenges of selling internationally. To globalize Marketplace and expand the opportunities available to sellers, we built selling tools that empowered entrepreneurs in 172 countries to reach customers in 189 countries last year. These cross-border sales are now nearly a quarter of all third-party units sold on Amazon. To make this possible, we translated hundreds of millions of product listings and provided conversion services among 44 currencies. Even small and niche sellers can now tap into our global customer base and global logistics network. The end result is very different from sellers handling their own one-at-a-time, cross-border fulfillment. Plugable Technologies’ CEO, Bernie Thompson, put it this way: “It really changes the paradigm when you’re able to ship the goods in bulk to a warehouse in Europe or Japan and have those goods be fulfilled in one day or two days.”\n&gt; \n&gt; India is another example of how we globalize an offering like Marketplace through customer obsession and a passion for invention. Last year we ran a program called Amazon Chai Cart where we deployed three-wheeled mobile carts to navigate in a city’s business districts, serve tea, water and lemon juice to small business owners and teach them about selling online. In a period of four months, the team traveled 15,280 km across 31 cities, served 37,200 cups of tea and engaged with over 10,000 sellers. Through this program and other conversations with sellers, we found out there was a lot of interest in selling online, but that sellers struggled with the belief that the process was time-consuming, tedious and complex. So, we invented Amazon Tatkal, which enables small businesses to get online in less than 60 minutes. Amazon Tatkal is a specially designed studio-on-wheels offering a suite of launch services including registration, imaging and cataloguing services, as well as basic seller training mechanisms. Since its launch on February 17th, we have reached sellers in 25 cities.\n&gt; \n&gt; We’re also globalizing Fulfillment by Amazon, adapting the service to local customer needs. In India, we launched a program called Seller Flex to combine Amazon’s logistics capabilities with sellers’ selection at the local neighborhood level. Sellers set aside a part of their warehouse for storing items to be sold on Amazon, and we configure it as a fulfillment center in our network that can receive and fulfill customer orders. Our team provides guidance on warehouse layout, IT and operational infrastructure, and trains the seller on standard operating procedures to be followed onsite. We’ve now launched 25 operational Seller Flex sites across ten cities.\n\nFull memo can be found [here](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/annual-letter-jeff-bezos-says-amazon-defined-failure-good-thing/).","name":"t3_4eaq70","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-11 15:40:04","week":15}

{"id":"4eblzl","author":"tslout","body":"Hey guys. The CEO of a branding consultancy was recently on Shopify's TGIM podcast with some business naming advice. I summarized it below.\n\n**Pick which kind of name you want. Jonathan has divided the world of brands into several categories.**\n\n&gt;* Eponymous - named after their founder\n* Descriptive - ex. American Airlines\n* Acronyms - ex. BP or GE\n* Real words - ex. Slack\n* Composite names - ex. Facebook and Ray Ban\n* Invented (suggestive names) - ex. Kleenex and Pinterest\n* Associative names - ex. Amazon, Red Bull, Sirius\n* Purely abstract names - ex. Rolex and Kodak.\n\n&gt; Most names these days are invented purely because they're the most original, they're the most unique, and they're less likely to be subject for trademark infringement.\n\n**Consider what you want your name to say.**\n\n&gt; Is it about trusted, is it about performance, is it about leadership, clarity? What are those core things that you want the name to say, because names can really say one of two things. Facebook talks about a book of faces. Ray Ban talks about banning the rays. It doesn't really talk about the star component of sunglasses.\n\n**Strike a perfect balance between originality and legalities.**\n\n&gt;Take Sirius for example. Sirius is the brightest star in the galaxy or the night sky and therefore that name reflects back to what that company is, which is radio channels where you can hear the brightest stars of music and entertainment.\n\nHe also talked about really bad names, legal limitations and some other stuff.

{"id":"4elnth","author":"ProbablyUnrealistic","body":"Went I got my first job, I lived at home, and I put any money that would go to rent to loans instead. So I started paying off $1000 of my student loans per month, much more than my minimum monthly payments of $140.\n\nHowever, six months later, I got a job out of state that paid significantly more, and because I now had rent to pay, I made my monthly payments $250 instead. \n\nDue to the accumulated interest I paid off, I got a pretty big tax return and I recently paid off a decent portion of my student loans with that return, leaving me with $3700 of 3.7% rate loans to pay off.\n\nI'm wondering if I should continue to pay my loans at $250 a month, if I should pay it off entirely, or withhold my payments to redistribute my money since my rate is so low and I'm not required to make a payment for another 3 years.\n\n\nMonthly Take-Home Income:\n\n$4025\n\n\nMonthly Expenses:\n\n\nRent - $900\n\nInternet/Cable - $55\n\nElectricity - $30\n\nStudent Loans - $250\n\nPhone (service is covered by parent, but not the phone payment)- $25\n\nAmazon Prime - $11\n\nGas - $80\n\nGroceries - $150\n\nCar Insurance - $150\n\nEntertainment (eating out, movies, shows, etc) - $300\n\n\nBy default, I always put 5% of my of my payment away for a future car down payment, 5% for future vacation expenses, and 40% for my emergency fund.\n\n\nMy emergency fund, as of now is $8000, so I could easily pay off the rest of the loans with this money.\n\n\nIn terms of the \"pay the minimum payment and invest the rest\" strategy, I don't plan on investing in the market yet (mainly through Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index Funds) because 1) I want to get to at least $9000 in my emergency fund before I do so and 2) I'm not confident in the market at the moment.\n\n\nI do plan on trying to get a mortgage on a condo or a small house when my lease is up at the end of September (between 150k - 300k), since I do plan to stay in the area for several years. If I do have to move out of the area for whatever reason, then I'd be willing to rent out the place.\n\n\nWith these factors in mind, how should I approach my loans?","name":"t3_4elnth","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-13 15:55:06","week":15}

{"id":"4emc3x","author":"drekuc","body":"After combing through 3/4 of a million search results on Amazon, I've built an in-depth study to try to determine it's ranking factors.\n\nHere's the full study: http://www.ripenecommerce.com/amazon-seo-insights\n\nHere's my top take-aways:\n\n1. Sales is the largest ranking factor. Not just for the \"head term\" of a search query, but strong sales helps you rank for a really wide range of terms as well.\n\n2. For that reason, advertising on Amazon has an indirect benefit to organic ranking. Put bluntly - you can buy your way into decent organic rankings on Amazon if the conversion rate is there.\n\n3. The fulfillment type seems to matter quite a bit. You've basically got three choices:\na. Sell to Amazon as a vendor - this has the strongest correlation with ranking better.\nb. Sell the item as a seller, but let Amazon fulfill it (FBA) - this has a slightly negative correlation with ranking in search results.\nc. Sell the item as a seller, fulfill it yourself - this has negative correlation with ranking in search results (worse than FBA).\n\nIf your business is building a strategy around Amazon, I'd highly recommend at least testing a vendor relationship with Amazon. You don't have to have a contact there anymore, you can just submit an application through vendor express - https://vendorexpress.amazon.com/.\n\n4. Keep product titles below 74 characters and use most important keywords in the title. 74 characters is the break point for the Amazon's mobile app truncating the title.\n\nNote: Sadly, I wasn't able to include reviews in the study. My feeling is that they do drive SEO on Amazon, if only indirectly as something that boosts sales through a better conversion rate.\n\nIf you've got any questions on Amazon strategy, this is a great thread to ask them in.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the great feedback everyone, I'm thrilled you're finding the study useful. I have plans to follow up with more of a how-to guide to doing Amazon SEO and posting it on Moz. That should be out in a couple weeks.","name":"t3_4emc3x","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-13 18:23:57","week":15}

{"id":"4eolg1","author":"magicroot75","body":"Online shopping allows for price comparison, convenience, and variety. But it’s especially easy to impulse spend. I’d like to optimize online spending for frugality and simplicity.\n\nThe online shopping cycle generally looks like this: You need or want something→ Find the right product→Shop→ Buy. Let’s break down each step.\n\n**Identifying what you need**\n\nLet’s err on the side of simplicity with our belongings. This increases overall life satisfaction and decreases your cognitive load. Develop a system resistant to impulse. Focus on deriving lasting practical value from purchases.\n\nEliminate the near occasion of impulse buys: Download UBlock. This eliminates excessive advertisements.  Cutting impulses at their source is the best method to avoid them.  Even with an Adblocker like [UBlock](ublock.org), you’ll still get impulses to buy things.\n\n**Time conquers impulse**\n\nA potent method for eliminating impulse online purchases is to label impulse as such and wait for it to pass. Recognizing your buying impulse will help you gain emotional distance from it. For ideas that are not fleeting impulses,  have a rule written down that will govern your buying in all situations. Make it easily accessible. I like to say that before I buy anything online, it must have been written on a list through at least one night’s sleep. I then judge it by the rules: (1)  Will I use it fairly regularly? (2) I am getting the best price? (3) Will it bring either a commensurate amount of pleasure or utility for its cost? I do believe that this contemplation helps separate buying habits from emotions. **This is key to saving money**.\n\n**Finding it**\n\nYour product search has probably been repeated thousands of times. It likely has been explicitly answered online. Tap into this. Use Google to search using the methods I outlined here. Look for heavily upvoted posts on Reddit, Quora, and Stack Exchange mentioning the questions relevant to your product search.\n\nExample Search Questions: Will these headlights fit on my car? What types of pants go best with a madras shirt? What headphones are best for sprinting in the rain?\n\nMy good friend Ian had a splendid idea a few years ago to search for alternative products by typing in “vs” after a product name and allowing Google to make suggestions. Great.\n\n**Amazon as a research tool**\n\nBrowse through the 3 and 4-star reviews on Amazon. All the other reviews on Amazon are either fake or too heavily biased. Before you buy anything, identify what is is exactly you need and if there is anything out there that does this. Use Amazon’s best sellers in each category coupled with average ratings to get an idea of the overall value of that product.\n\n**Price Comparison**\n\nNow the fun part: shopping. Where you search is going to depend on what you’re looking for…\n\n**Used**\n\nPopular Item? \nEbay and Craigslist \n\nHard to find?\nEbay\n\nHeavy?\nCraigslist\n\n**New**\n\nPopular? Amazon, cross reference Google Shopping\nHard to find? Google Shopping or deeper look into vendor sites\nHeavy? Compare Offline/Brick and Mortar with Amazon/Google Shopping. Especially note shipping.\n\n\nFor cars, use autotempest.com to get a gauge of local pricing. For heavy craigslist-type items, use searchtempest.com to track an item’s value across every Craigslist in the U.S. Focus on Craiglist, Pad Mapper, and Zillow.  Use Google to find offline housing opportunities. Think about nearby university housing classifieds’ sites or Facebook groups of like-minded individuals who may be looking to rent or sell their place. Consider soliciting friends and family. They all want you to thrive and find a great place.\n\nFor other items, use Ebay Completed listings (an option on Ebays left-hand search bar) to see what others paid for the item you’re looking for. Use Amazon’s recommended items on product pages along with their “Customers ended up buying this.” Also, look for best-rated items in your product’s category. Oftentimes you’ll find a substitute product that’s better than the one you’re looking for. On Ebay, think about various ways your product may be categorized or named. Oftentimes lazy sellers won’t register all the details of a product, so you may have to rely on keywords rather than the left-bar search menu for finding the best deals.\n\nIf there’s a category of product you're into, find forums or email alerts that crowdsource deal finding for that type of product. For instance, if I’m looking for deals on clothes, I’ll keep posted on reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion. Other folks may benefit from SlickDeals or FatWallet.\n\n**Coupon codes**\n\nIf you’re buying non-Ebay/Amazon, check Google for discount codes. They can often be found through Retailmenot.com. For example, I saved an easy $10 on a foodie event in Philly last month with an Amtrak.com referral code that was publicly listed online. \n\n**Purchases**\n\nThe easiest purchase mode online is definitely Amazon Prime. Free and fast shipping to anywhere in the US. At $99/year, if you buy more than 15 items from them per year I’d say it’s worthwhile. Be sure you’re only buying from sites that start with \"https\". This indicates they have a secured connection. Buy with a cash-back credit card. My Capital One gets me 1.5% back on everything I buy. Don’t let that incentivize you to spend more, though. You still have to pay for the other 98.5%.\n\nNote that many retailers offer a generous return policy that allows us all to treat our homes like dressing rooms. Take advantage of flexible return policies to find the right size clothing and test out electronics. Just be sure you read the fine print. \nWith a patient attitude, a diligent eye, and a few of these tips, you’ll save hundreds of dollars per year online.\n\nTo see the thought patterns behind this post explore [here](http://www.theoptimizednow.com/onlineshopping/).","name":"t3_4eolg1","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-14 02:31:50","week":15}

{"id":"4eyo7q","author":"WikipediaLookerUpper","body":"Basically I have a product idea that I think will sell well. It's small, light weight, probably very easy to manufacture. It will be made of plastic. Mass production should cost no more than $1.50 per piece (shipping and everything else included).\n\nI have done my research and there is nothing like this in the market. There is no patent. The domain with the product name is available.\n\nIn short, this seems like a good product. It's not a \"must have\". It does not solve a problem that people have. It's mostly a cute little \"thing\" that users will buy simply because they've seen other people use it and they find it cute.\n\nTarget market: Affluent, young, women. Yes this is a pretty specific niche. Will an older woman use it? Absolutely. Will a guy use it? You bet your ass they will. But I foresee a majority of the buyers to be in the 20-30 yr age group, predominantly women.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Has anyone worked with Alibaba to create a new product (one that currently does not exist)? If so, how do you get your idea across without someone just manufacturing it and selling it themselves?\n2. Should I apply for a provisional patent?\n3. I should probably register the domain name and create FB, twitter, Instagram etc. accounts.\n4. How would you go about marketing the product? Send freebies to bloggers? Get on ProductHunt?\n5. Would you start by selling on Amazon? If so, do you create your own ASIN? Is this difficult?\n6. Lastly, how much would something like this end up costing? Here's my breakdown:\n  * $1.00 * 1000 (typical MOQ) = $1000 for inventory\n  * Add another $500 for shipping, customs etc.\n  * I will be making the website myself so no cost (other than time) there.\n  * Sending out freebies for bloggers: Let's say I send out 100 of them. That would cost me about $200 (mailing cost)\n\nSo shall we say $2,000 all said and done to get started? Am I missing something here?","name":"t3_4eyo7q","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-15 22:31:58","week":15}

{"id":"4ezb78","author":"DrWumbo6","body":"Hey everyone, I just turned 18 and wanted to get a credit card to build some credit score. I've had a checking account tied to a debit account at Chase for about a year, so I decided to just open a credit card with them. I applied for an Amazon Chase card and was denied due to not having credit history. I went into my local Chase today and explained the situation to them. The lady told me to apply for one of their Freedom/Freedom Unlimited cards online (Which after getting denied the first time, was my pick for reapplying). \n\nAfter submitting my application, it says they will have to take some time to review it. I have a feeling I'm going to get denied again. I know that one of my options is to open a credit card underneath my moms name and have me as an authorized user and I would be the only one using the account. Should I wait and see if I get accepted or cancel the current application? What are some other options I could consider?

{"id":"4ezeo4","author":"Haymaker33","body":"I have an idea for a super hero comic book, which I think is fresh enough to grab a modest fan base. Planning on about 25 volumes, each about 4 chapters long. Thinking about pricing the volumes at around $6 each. I've already started writing the script, which I'll then have an editor fix up, and then I'll collaborate with a penciler/inker and we'll self publish on a site that is linked to Kindle and Amazon, that handles printing and distribution. I'll mostly focus on online sales this way, but if it takes off I'll see about shelving it. My dream is to have it re-published by Valiant or some other comic company, this time in color, and eventually see about a cartoon adaptation.\n\nMy question is, before I do all this, how lucrative of a side venture is this? What kind of potential does a self published comic book series have for generating sales? I'm estimating the startup capital to be around $5k, including paying the artist and setting up a Web page, but I'm wanting to offer the artist a decent cut in the profit as well, maybe 20%. \n\nAnything I should rethink about my plan before I take off?

{"id":"d1xsdxj","author":"scots","body":"The state of Wyoming - Ironically, the state that first created the LLC back in the 1970s  -  has no residency requirement, allowing anyone anywhere to register a Wyoming based LLC.   \n\n They also offer complete privacy shield, making it extremely difficult barring court action for third parties to obtain information such as your personal name and address. \n\n\n Lastly, the state of Wyoming does not report your quarterly or annual revenue information on to the fed, leaving it up to you as the business owner to do your due diligence for year-end filings and such.  \n\n\nIn all respects- No residency, Privacy, and owner responsibility for filing, Wyoming is almost exactly like Nevada - Except Wyoming was first, and Nevada simply copied them.    \n\n\nThere are a number of law firms and service companies that will process your Wyoming LLC filing for you, using their attorney or filing agent as the Point of Contact on all filings, which if anyone digs, will be the only thing that comes up.  It is also to get a Wyoming post office box with forwarding service set up on it to push your mail forward.  \n\n \nOnce you have your incorporation set up, getting a commercial bank account is pretty easy.  Do some googling to find an online bank with excellent remote tools, mobile app, website and 800 number support.  The account is tied to your company, so your \"permanent vacation\" shouldn't matter to them.   \n\n\nOnce you have actually researched and done all of this, I strongly encourage you to put together a little $19 Udemy course clearly detailing all the information you discovered and steps you took to completion, because this question appears regularly in this sub, AmazonFBA and a few others.    \n\nThere appear to be a lot of guys who want to sip cappuccinos at a streetside cafe in Prague with a drop-dead stunner while idly looking at sales numbers on their Shopify garden gnome lawn statue store.  \n\n\n\n","name":"t1_d1xsdxj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-11 00:45:16","week":15}

{"id":"d1ykidq","author":"ntsp00","body":"Well a couple things first:\n\n1) It has more to do with saving Amazon money by processing your order at their leisure than creating less waste. Think of it like this: if everyone with Prime is getting 2-day shipping on every order *just because*, Amazon is still obligated to rush those orders out. I imagine some days are busier than others so Amazon has to have the appropriate amount of employees working those days. If you request \"no-rush\" shipping, Amazon can process your order on a slower day and make things less congested overall. I hope that makes sense. \n\n2) Amazon still ships packages via fast shipping methods once processing time is over. I don't think that would necessarily stop something from getting delivered on a Sunday. Take a look at this order from my history as an example: \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sZiblS1.png\n\nI placed it on the 7th, it's now the 11th and it still hasn't shipped even though it says it will arrive on the 14th. As you can see, nothing short of 2-day shipping will get it here by then. So the \"no-rush\" shipping is only giving Amazon more processing time, not more delivery time for the carrier. \n\nNow I can't say I've ever had a \"no-rush\" shipping order delivered on a Sunday but I'm not 100% sure. You can make sure you don't get something delivered on a Sunday by changing your shipping speed though:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/W0Xy8ux.png\n\nShipping speed shows up on the checkout page. If you want \"no-rush\" shipping, you have to manually select it each order. So you can see if 2-day was scheduled to be delivered on Sunday, I could always choose standard or \"no-rush\" to get it delivered on a different day of the week. And one last thing, \"no-rush\" shipping is only available on items shipped from Amazon (just like 2-day). \n\nHope this helps!","name":"t1_d1ykidq","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-11 18:02:49","week":15}

Acer and ASUS are fine products but not common enough that the refurbished units are easy to find, lots of other brands are in the same situation.\n\n\n\nFirst you want to look for a model that came about 3-ish years ago.\n\n\nSecond you want to look at the seller ratings for whoever is selling that model, and pick one in the highest 97+ percentages.\n\nFinding these in the ~ $200 price range is fairly common. If you are willing to go with an older model you can usually get them for $20 to $50 less.\n\n\nSource, I've been working in IT since the late 90s.","name":"t1_d1ypt77","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-11 19:58:46","week":15}

Even though they have opened the market for other people to sell, it has become a means for Amazon to discover items they can sell and beat prices. FBA is both a bane and a blessing. What is comes down to is Amazon wants prices lower for more buyer consumption, even though your profits are getting cut into. The lower your price the more percentage is taken.

No idea how to post a hat this large though.\n\n1960s kitchen scales found at thrift shop for $5, already sold on Gumtree for $50.\n\nRare and desirable photobook $8, cheapest on Amazon is $280, recent ebay sales for $200. Keeping it because I love photo books and this one is super collectable.\n\n5 other art books for $40 total, all out of print and selling for $150+ Expect them to be slow sales though and I can't do FBA so will probably just list on ebay long term and keep them for myself in the meantime?\n\nSet of four Dansk plates $8. Not exactly sure on value, at least $40, listed on Gumtree for $60 expecting lowballs.\n\nApprox 12 pairs of designer jeans and four mens shirts in a big bag for $18, all have sold listings on ebay of at least $20 some worth $50-60 expecting at least $350 from these. Listed 5 last night and one already sold so the bag has paid for itself.\n\nI almost forgot, the best find was actually last week but was an authentic 1985 home shirt from an English Premier League team. Cost me $3. Looked up previous sold listings on ebay and one sold in Feb for 250 pounds (not signed or anything, it is just one of their iconic shirts that fans love apparently).

{"id":"d1zejsk","author":"expressoshoppe","body":"I use two of the three, PayPal and Square, so I can offer some opinions. Plus, we accept cash and checks, and do sales on Amazon. \n\nFirst, I should point out that they're not really the same - PayPal is for online sales and Square is for in-person sales. Yes, you can use each for the other, but that's not their core strength. \n\nIf you sell on eBay, or if you have your own e-commerce website, PayPal is great. Customers have confidence in it and it makes your weak credibility seem safer. As another comment pointed out, for some customers, it's PayPal or pay someone else. \n\nSquare is great for in-store transactions. The free POS software is pretty good - you can have a wide variety of products in your 'catalog' and the transaction is simple to perform. An iPad with a swiper is professional enough to give your shop a little credibility to the customer. More importantly - the back end reporting that Square provides is great. Sales breakouts and sales tax reports are easy to run, and since the data is in the cloud, it's pretty easy to feel like it's safe. \n\nOh yeah - they pay you tomorrow. Everyone else takes longer (Amazon takes weeks). Faster is good. \n\nI doubt Square's marketplace is worth much to many, and I don't think many retailers use PayPal Anywhere - neither seem like very strong products. \n\nIt would be great to have a single transaction platform for everything (website, in-store, off-site, phone order), but there's no such animal - especially for free. \n\nSo, every month, reports from everyone. Square's are the easiest, Amazon and eBay the worst (don't coincidence with the calendar). PayPal is just confusing and it's hard to get a simple report. \n\nTL;DR : Square is good software and they pay fast, which is good.

TCB gives that full rate back to you, but eBates usually keeps half of it. Amazon doesn't offer cashback on anything not sold by Amazon LLC, so keep that in mind too. GoodSearch and Giving Assistant received a flat 1.5% cash back donation rate, category restriction free.

If they could get everyone that sells professionally on Ebay to use these, they would gain more brand recognition.

If they did that they wouldn't be losing anything on selling them and would increase their brand recognition.\n\nI'm guessing this is more of a pilot program though. They want to see if there's interest from sellers in using Ebay brand boxes. The problem is when you're marketing to business owners, they will always want the most bang for their buck. A random seller benefits very little from Ebay branded shipping supplies unless they get the same or less price per unit.

Is it even possible to earn enough points for a ticket to Europe by say January of next year? \n\nAlso, my income is fairly low, and officially reported is even lower(I do a lot of odd jobs to make extra money) is anyone going to ever approve me for anything even IF I had a better credit report?

I figured I'd try just to see what would happen!\n\nDue to the new credit laws(2009) I can't report my parents' income even though I live with them since I'm not 21.

So I have an entertainment budget.  If I don't buy any show tickets in January, I roll it over on the budget and leave it in the account for February.

So for example, in my monthly budget I have 1/12th of every annual subscription saved (so say Amazon prime which is $107/yr, thus every month I save $8.95).  I also have categories where I put in a flat rate amount for things like car maintenance (which includes oil changes, etc.), car tires (they are fine now but rather throw $50/month at it to avoid the hit of something I know for sure I will eventually need to pay), vacation fund. I have a goal for most of those categories, so I know generally what 4x tires will cost me so once that account hits that amount, no more cash until I need it.  This is in addition to my emergency fund (1-2 months of income).  I give myself a \"fun budget\" that is pretty modest $100/month.  I have two separate debt snowball budget items. One is my minimum I want to pay every month. The other incorporates any other \"extra\" cash I have, this way If I have to pull against it I have to make the conscious choice that I am not using that cash to pay down extra debt. The flip side being any category I have extra cash in such as groceries, gas, etc. gets added into that bonus snowball category.

If it's the rod/fishing pole then they can fuck off.  You were selling a REEL, not a fishing pole.  If it's the handle off the reel, then wtf?

It's always best, even when pristine, to be objective.  \n\nIf you want a pretty good example of this dig on Amazon and find their warehouse deals.

Or maybe even Best Buy or CompUSA back in the day, and they didn't have it in stock there in the store for you to buy it right then. \n\nThey order those computers and goods from a Giant distributor like Ingram Micro. \n\nNormally the distributors would send the item to the business or store, and then the business or store would send it to you (the customer). \n\nBut Drop Shipping is when the business or store tells their distributor to send it to you directly. \n\nThis allows for faster shipping, as even with overnight shipping, it would still be a two day wait for the customer if shipped to the business first. \n\nPlus the business is already paying to have it shipped to them, then would have to pay again to ship to the customer - so drop shipping also saves money.\n\nThis means the person selling the goods in this post is not the manufacturer nor distributor of the goods. \n\nI worked in a tiny computer repair and sales shop, and we kept zero merch on hand, and drop shipped everything to customers. \n\nHe is trying to decide if it is worth the up-front cost of purchasing all the goods and giving them to Amazon to keep at their warehouse (so they are \"fulfilled by Amazon\") so it is eligible for prime shipping, or offer it for sale on Amazon and then pay his distributor to mail the package directly to the customer (drop shipping). \n\nI do not know if it is better for him, but as an Amazon customer, I always go for Prime shipped goods unless there is no other option.

{"id":"d21xgbd","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"There are many reasons why this can work, and many reasons why it's difficult to make work.  It's probably easier if you get something that's very limited, in which case you may not have tons of competition that were able to also get it for a cheap price.  It's also easier if that super deal that you got last week doesn't become the regular price this week.  But that's something that's difficult to know in advance.\n\nWhen you get something that a lot of people were able to get, well, you're probably going to be competing with a lot of people who had exactly the same idea.  So you need to either work really fast to get them in and sold before the price drops, or you may need to wait out everyone else running out if you want to make the bigger profits.\n\nOTOH, you might just end up with the price falling out of the sky and taking a very very long time to recover, if ever.  See also \"the sale last week becomes the regular price this week\".\n\nI have probably overshared this story, but I started buying an item in late September, that I thought would be a reasonable Halloween item.  I was able to sell it for 3-4x my purchase price at Amazon.  I sold through them, thought that was it.  Noticed a few weeks later, that they continued selling on through Halloween.  I bought a bunch more of them, sent them in.  They continued selling all the way past New Years.  The distributor that I got them from clearanced them, $1 off their original price.  I bought all that I could online, and cleared out several stores and sent them in.\n\nThen they stopped selling at 4x the price.  I go looking for the reason why, and I see that the price has been cut in less than half.  Since it went clearance at retail, there were now over 90 new sellers that were not selling this item through the holidays, that each had 3, 4, up to 6 or 7.  Sales rank made a slight bump, but not enough to justify my dropping it from $20 each to $8.  I presume tons and tons of people saw it was clearance in stores saw the $20 tag on Amazon, and shipped them all in.  Now the price is at a level where I will make literally pennies per unit, instead of 150-200% profit.\n\nNow I'm stuck with 100 of these waiting for those (insert foul language here) who got them all for the clearance price to make their 20-30cents and run out, so I can sell them again at huge profits.  It's not a situation I'd like to repeat.  Although I do have confidence that since they were selling at a great rate and a great price last autumn, that they should do so again.  But I get to pay for the storage costs on the 100 of them until those guys run out.\n\nsorry for the wall of text\n","name":"t1_d21xgbd","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-14 02:28:17","week":15}

{"id":"d221p95","author":"howdoesthisworkagain","body":"Sure thing. I'm not the sweeper I used to be, but hopefully I can be a bit helpful.\n\nI used to have a separate email address I used for sweeps so that I could keep things organized. I also kept sweeping accounts on facebook, pinterest, instagram, and twitter so that I could get a few extra entries for following people. Those are good if you don't want to follow a bunch of blogger/brand accounts with your actual social media. Keep in mind with some of them, they might close your account for appearing like spam so don't follow too many people/brands too quickly and try to throw in a regular tweet/post every now and then. There's also a limit of I believe 2,000 people you can follow if you don't have people following you so it's nice to clean house on there every once in a bit. Also, it's great to use Chrome with Autofill so that you can fill out forms quickly. If you don't use Chrome, many sweepers use Roboform which accomplishes essentially the same thing.\n\nMy aim was to enter as many sweeps as I could for things that I needed/my family could use. I do know that there were many people that entered every possible sweeps that they could and sold stuff they didn't want, so that is also an option if you don't mind reselling stuff.\n\nhttp://www.online-sweepstakes.com/ has a nice \"My Sweeps\" function that allows you to save up to 500 sweeps (or more if you're a member, but I never paid for that). These are good for saving some daily sweeps so that you can enter more often. I mainly just added things to MySweeps that I was REALLY after, not the ones for something cheap like a DVD or whatever. I never entered the \"unlimited entry\" sweeps, because I always figured there were people that could bot it or people with no lives who REALLY wanted the prize and would enter for hours. That's just my preference though. \n\nThe subreddit /r/sweepstakes is great as well. I wasn't aware of it during the time I was a super-sweeper, but I found it a few weeks ago, entered a few things, and yesterday was alerted that I'd won the Pax 2 Vaporizer. I've found that the subreddit caters more to things that the typical Redditor (white male in his 20's) would enjoy and that the sweeping sites cater more to what a stay-at-home mom would like.\n\nBe sure to stay away from scams! If I've ever been suspicious of certain sweeps, I've searched online for actual winners. There was one real weird one that used to be advertised that had sweeps for really high-dollar giftcards but yet there was almost no trace on the company online. It leads to the question of where they'd get the money for hosting such expensive sweeps and obviously since there was no actual company, they were selling email addresses to spammers or something. Even though you are using a special sweeping email address, why waste your time on something like that? Also, you're probably very well aware of that stupid spam that says \"Congrats! You won a 1,000 dollar Amazon card\" but there are people that fall for this still and I've seen spam slip into my actual inbox so just be aware and never share too much info. (Sorry, you probably knew this but people like my mom fall for this crap all the time so I just wanted to be sure you were aware!)\n\nOverall though, the main key to winning is to have lots of entries and lots of different stuff that you've entered. It took me a month to win my first sweeps, a blog giveaway for some water toy that I gave to my son. Just stay patient because there are dry spells all the time. I went a few months one time without winning anything, then the next month I must have won fifteen times. This is pure luck of course, but if you are entering enough, you should win. A person over on /r/sweepstakes won a few thousand dollars in his/her first month a little while ago, you can see the \"winners' thread\" on there for more inspiration. \n\nHopefully this should help you a bit. It's probably majority stuff that you already know but just remember that the key to winning is to enter as much as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask though. :)","name":"t1_d221p95","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-14 04:07:17","week":15}

{"id":"d22bqu5","author":"MrSolutionFinder","body":"Good would be an understatement... Fucking great! would be the better way to describe it.\n\nThe backstory, I used to sell used things on eBay. I went from a garage, to public storage, to a full out warehouse. Went to work every day, shipped things, etc. I was under the impression that Amazon FBA just wouldn't work well for used things so I chugged along for a few years on eBay before I finally managed to get a lot of new things.\n\nAt that point I tried Amazon FBA, sent them the things, and basically went \"holy shit, it's like having a warehouse plus employees with the benefit of ever expanding/decreasing space so I don't pay for any space I'm not using.\" -- I then tried some used things, which is still more work than new because I have to make a listing for virtually every item I sell, being used I still provide pictures of everything, then pack and ship.\n\nHowever the costs still work out that FBA (or really any 3PL service) is more expensive than doing it myself, but cheaper than having a warehouse plus employees. I wouldn't sell things without 3PL at this point. I have extra time now, I work from home, once in a while I'll source and ship some things but Amazon does basically everything for me and sends me a check. Sure the fees are higher than eBay but I'm also getting more.\n\n3-4 years ago I didn't have time to do much because I had to show up at the warehouse daily to ship things. These days? Eh, I just came back from Vegas, I'm going to Houston in a couple weeks, bit after that I'll be in NC. 3PL let me pickup a side gig which I do basically for the shits and giggles, it's basically a paid vacation, my boss even knows I don't need the money. I spend my weeks traveling and I wish I did 3PL sooner.\n\nThe only way I could see 3PL not working is if your margins are extremely thin. If you got something that you make a few percent on and you can barely make ends meet then 3PL would put you out of business.","name":"t1_d22bqu5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-14 09:41:05","week":15}

{"id":"d22esl1","author":"tehbeaver1","body":"Just getting to this comment, apologies for the delay.\n\nI read *most* of the study, went back and read a little more just now to remember a few key points I wanted to make ...  We can go on and on about risk premiums and expected future returns for days and likely both present sound arguments, and get absolutely no where (but this, imo, is why markets are so fun).  \n\nHowever, I will just say a couple of things to respond to the claims made in that study:\n\nA lot of people laugh at me when I use data in models that goes back to 1928 ..  it's probably a bit much, but when it comes to macro I like to capture as many business cycles as possible.  Going back 200 years seems a bit extreme though.  The US economy is nothing like it was 200 years ago.  Companies like KO, PG and JNJ generate 50%+ of top line revs from overseas.  US GDP could stagnate, but if the rest of the world is growing, no problem for these multi-national mega caps.  This wasn't the case 200 years ago.  I would imagine 98% of top line growth came from within the borders given obvious reasons (as a side note: think of how easy it is for companies like FB, PCLN, AMZN and GOOG to scale compared to industries of the past -- it's insane).  \n\nFurther, regarding the yield on stocks being so low today compared to 100-200 years ago ...  this only makes sense imo due to a: the types of companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 today, and b: the environment they exist in.  In 1900, it wasn't exactly easy for corporations to return cash to shareholders or generate wealth for equity participants without distributing a dividend.  So, dividends were a plenty and most, if not all corporations distributed one. Today, corporate America can use cash to create shareholder value in many more ways ...  thus, yields have come down, but total returns haven't necessarily been affected (or, maybe just the opposite, they are affected in a positive manner).  It's just a different way for corporate America to reward it's shareholders.  As such, I believe more of our equity total returns going forward are going to be a result of increasing EPS (whether it's driven by organic growth, M&amp;A, buybacks, cost-cutting, etc..) rather than dividends paid.  \n\nAll and all a great piece, but a few glaring holes imo.

If you worked harder, you could have gotten a better job; if you were smarter, you could have gotten a better degree/GPA/internship; etc.  \n\n*I* (the individual) *can do this without any outside help*. And the more you rely on other people, the more it's implied you are making mistakes. And it's human nature to avoid being wrong.  \n\nThis idea of individual exceptionalism continues to exist, and I think, is one (of many) of the reasons why America lags behind the rest of the world in some key areas you would think are important, such as worker or consumer rights. A lot of these cultural ideas don't really hold up under scrutiny and from my personal (anecdotal) experience, people end up worse off than they might otherwise for believing such things.  \n\n-----  \n\nSorry for not having more sources, I'm open to suggestions.

{"id":"d233bfc","author":"mdchally","body":"Well, I think it's a safe assumption to say Amazon will have self serving interest and give more juice to their own vendor listings.\n\nAfter that, it makes sense FBA would be next up. Amazon's goal is to be the ultimate customer centric company in the world... that means great support, easy ordering, super fast shipping, etc. So, the more of that process they control, the more they can guarantee to customers. It's in their best interest to give Vendor and FBA priority because relying on FBM to fulfill orders won't make customers as happy as free 2 day shipping.\n\nTo say that conversion is the top factor I have seen in my vast experience of ranking well on Amazon is correct. There are obviously going to be more, smaller factors, but conversion is key. If a customer comes to Amazon and searches for widget, clicks on all the widgets on the first page, and ultimately doesn't find what they want, leaves the site and buys elsewhere, Amazon lost that sale. It's common sense they want to make the most money per visit, so stacking the odds to the products that convert the highest is the best way to do this.\n\nI'm not sure why our insights would be different either, but I can tell you from a group of about a dozen sellers responsible for close to $50mm in annual sales on Amazon, conversion rate plays the biggest role out of anything.\n\nJust last month, a friend ranked on page one for a pretty competitive keyword with a brand new product, one review, and low BSR. The main thing he was able to do? Great conversion rate (via promos). He didn't drive an insane amount of sales, it was a small amount of highly converting traffic that spiked his conversion rate.","name":"t1_d233bfc","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-14 22:43:06","week":15}

Conversions are good and an important part of their ranking algo but I don't think they're as important as you might think. I'd be curious as to what value you place on click-through-rates from search results, conversions from PPC and conversions due to rich media in listings have to do with rankings.

Each marketplace has their own clientele; it's why you get the lowballs on Craigslist, the eBayer's that buy but can't pay, and the Amazon people who return things like no tomorrow. Most, not all, people go to their favorite marketplace and purchase a product. If they compared with Google then Amazon wouldn't be the largest marketplace as typically they're on the higher end of price.\n\nNot that there's a feasible way to optimize SEO when eBay does that part in house, in the background, and doesn't let you edit much more than your description. You'd be better off focusing on what the customer prefers, such as mobile accessibility, rather than trying to jam keywords in your description.\n\nMost people, if not all, use eBay because they get you traffic in return for fees. If you're going to be getting your own traffic why in the world would you pay them fees? Starting \"from zero\" is also IMO pushing it a bit when inkFrog can auto populate your entire site with all your listings; chances are both options are going to take a similar amount of time.\n\nThe OP specifically seems to sell the same product over and over, so that's even more reason to have his own store. He can optimize once and be done, rather than optimize with eBay and keep paying them fees. IMO I would optimize what he sells, he's not selling as much product as he wants, but he also has a product that not everyone wants. Many people aren't going to install their own power sockets.

I don't mean this in a rude way because $80k is excellent, but I'm testing on a much higher amount of data than that.\n\nThe example I listed was an extreme example, for the sake of example... I said it's a \"pretty competitive keyword\" not the most competitive. If you would like a more competitive example, let's look at some black hat sellers because they are the kings of this. Take a look at any of the term 'probiotic' and have a look at the oddball on that page (there are two oddballs, but one of them is a legit big brand with a lot of people specifically buying their products regardless of ranking). His BSR sucks, his reviews are extremely low and only a 4.3 rating at that, yet he ranks well. This seller has done with in a series of competitive categories and he does it with his other companies, too, following the same pattern. This isn't about singling out a seller, though, so I'll proceed.\n\nThe way they're able to do this, depsite the metrics you swear are the most important, is because of their conversion rate. They aren't driving decent organic sales at all, but the sales they are driving are manufactured by themselves (fake orders from their network of buyer accounts), making sure their conversion rate for their target keyword is insanely high.\n\nI have seen this exact thing dozens of times in dozens of markets.\n\n\"to say it wants to provide the best service to customers isn't completely true.\" - That's the image they attempt to portray... the \"most customer centric company in the world\" is taken directly from what Amazon says about themselves.

They can control pricing and shipping via Vendor, therefore it provides the best service. They can control shipping via FBA, therefore it is second in line for service. They control nothing with FBM, therefore it ranks third in service.\n\n\"I'd be curious as to what value you place on click-through-rates from search results, conversions from PPC and conversions due to rich media in listings have to do with rankings\" - I don't have much of an opinion on them because those are essentially impossible to test on Amazon, so we can't gather legit data on them. They don't tell us CTR from search results. Obviously, we have PPC rates, but black hat has actually screwed those up completely due to click fraud. \n\n\"It's safe to say, one of us is seeing a correlation and not a causation.\" - That's absolutely something we can agree on.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm glad you disagree because that makes it easier for those of us that have tested and can see the real insights behind the data.","name":"t1_d23ef2r","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-15 03:07:56","week":15}

Help them sell and, when you get enough money, buy it from them and resell. Keep an eye out for ANY store closings and buy out their inventory and this includes any bookstores who often have these.\n\nYou might want to go to a local convention first and talk to literally all exhibitors.

They depend on people going crazy seeing \"free\" money.

You will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee of 2-3%, but it's a heck of a lot better than the 20% interest you've probably accrued. Unfortunately since you got the Amazon card issued by Chase, you can't get another Chase card (e.g. Slate) to do the transfer.

{"id":"d24au50","author":"BlueGryph","body":"I've attempted to operate an ecommerce store when I was young as well and helped several. My opinion is this: if at all possible, study up provide a service along with running a store at the beginning.\n\nAnd my reasons are these:\n\n- Ecommerce requires money up-front, service is much cheaper.\n- Providing a service forces you to learn and be really good at what you do. When operating an ecommerce, requests for a refund/damages are common and happens extremely often due to the company's fault. Believe me, you don't want to be in this situation. Better prepare to be one of the very best before even starting up a store.\n- To be really competitive in the commerce scene, you either have to have a really polished custom software or otherwise have a well-known reputation.\n- Margins from Amazon and Etsy are small until you are up well in sales. Providing a service can give you a reasonable living income providing you don't undercharge.\n\nNote that I don't discourage you from running an ecommerce store. It's however much harder in every aspect than people imagine. I suspect this is due to the illusion of a website being \"cheaper\" than a brick-and-mortar store. Rather, my point is that if your eventual goal is to run a store, you might as well study everything about what you want and help people with your knowledge.\n\nBut if you have a great product idea, I might be wrong as well.","name":"t1_d24au50","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-15 20:24:01","week":15}
{"id":"d24axdi","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"A million developers have come here to ask the same question, we give them advice, and then nothing ever comes of it. (Well, not nothing, a few tools of dubious value are out there). \n\nTake a look at Forklift, that's probably the most successful homegrown 'deal finder' web app, and I'm not sure what else I'd add to it. Everyone wants some easy automated way to find good deals, but then everyone gets on it, and then it's no longer successful. I think Forklift is a good concept because it's constantly updated with Amazon (Forklift hydra is updated with eBay stuff as well), but most apps suffer from saturation.\n\nAnother concern is the algorithm for 'good deal'. Several sites have failed at that, because there are so many variables (condition, version, and variation) that there's not an easy way to automate the process. A lot of times the textbook deal sites will list an international version 5 year old book as a \"Good deal\" because a perfect condition, domestic version, that's up to date is selling for 10 times as much on eBay. That's just a common issue with the algorithm, there are many more complex cases.\n\nIn general, the people are make successful algorithms keep them to themselves to profit off of. The only way I can see a developer making bank of of one of these apps is (like Forklift) using referral codes... because no one wants to pay money for a service like this, and the people that do, are often the ones that are too lazy to stick with it.\n\nSo anyway... take a look at the past threads. Do some searches for \"developer\" and \"App\" and \"app idea\" and I'm sure something will come up. Do some market research to see what's already out there. You have no idea what you're trying to improve upon, because you have no idea what is already built, what has succeeded, what has failed, and why it's failed. \n\nNo one here is going to be able to build out the app idea for you, because we're not developers (well, I am, and a few other people are... but mostly not). The best you're going to get are dreamers (\"I want an app that tells me exactly what to flip, where to list it, who to sell it to, how much to sell it for, how to pack it up, where to find the box to pack it in, how many bubbles of bubble wrap I should use, the most efficient direction to the cheapest postal carrier, and lastly and most importantly, the app should make an excellent lasagna).","name":"t1_d24axdi","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-15 20:26:01","week":15}

We also have our own \"benefits\" in terms of investment and retirement plans.\n\nAnd I have yet to hear of a single \"bogus\" suspension that couldn't be better explained as at least *some* fault of the seller with a little digging. If they were to happen, though, then that would be a risk taken by any seller on Amazon, not just the RAers. But we live well below our means and can weather any droughts if they were to come up.\n\nI completely disbelieve that Amazon has any intention of pushing RA out. They make a TON of money on RAers (we alone paid over $30k in fees in our first six months, and that was when we were very small time). Increasing standards to make it difficult to be a sketchy seller and to improve customer experiences isn't phasing out RA, it's just making it so RAers can't sell certain things that hurt Amazon's customers (like new electronics without full warranties). If they didn't want RA, why would they base their app around scanning barcodes? I also feel that unit limits have more of an impact on wholesale sellers than on RA sellers.\n\nWith that said, we're expanding into PL as well, so RA won't be the only source for very long, but it has done us quite well for quite some time, and I think your attitude toward it is way more negative than t needs to be.","name":"t1_d24dmrr","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-15 21:26:13","week":15}

It saves time, saves money (a lot more than you'd think), and it's just easier\n\n* An addendum to the above: Get a scale. Don't make excuses, just order a scale. You'll need it for accurate weights for printing labels at home. Too many people start flipping without a scale. It's a mistake. You're going to waste a lot of time and money if you don't get a scale. Almost any shipping scale that weighs up to 60lbs will work.\n\n* Get a label printer.

{"id":"d24xtdt","author":"jl2121","body":"&gt;your viewpoint on bogus suspensions is dangerous.\n\nSo I am curious, and not trying to incite a new argument or anything; if suspensions are handed out by automated systems due to things completely beyond the seller's control, like the words a customer uses in their message, then how could it be possible that PL or WS are safer than RA? The only way for an RA seller to be more susceptible to suspension than a WS or PL seller is for suspensions to not be random, and instead for the RA sellers to make mistakes that the WS and PL sellers don't make. Research, quality products, and excellent customer service are all that are needed to not make those mistakes.\n\nAnd you say that the money Amazon makes off of RA sellers is negligible compared to WS and PL sellers. While this may be true, it is not a *negligible* amount of money. How many RA sellers my size are there out there? Hundreds, at least? Say 200. If we paid in $30k in our first six months, then they have 200 sellers paying in $60k per year. That's $12M in fees per year collected off of just 200 sellers (I'm going to reasonably assume there are a lot more than 200). I'm reminded of Larry Bird, who, as one of the highest paid basketball players of his time, was asked why he always entered the dunk contest just to win a meager $25k. His response? \"$25,000 is *a lot of money!*\" Amazon isn't going to just throw away tens of millions of dollars just because they make hundreds of millions from a different source.\n\nAnd I've spent some time in the FBA sub. It's got some very useful information there, and that's what lead us to PL. But I'm sure that most people made the switch from RA to PL because it turned out to be less work (which we're hoping for), but we're bringing in six-figures annually doing RA (working for about 20 hours in two days out of every two week period) and I don't see a whole lot of people just walking away from that kind of income, if their operations were on par with what we're doing here.

{"id":"d24ysuk","author":"Strel0k","body":"&gt; not trying to incite a new argument or anything\n\nI haven't seen it that way at all so far. Your experience is that RA works for you and are seeing success with it. My experience is that RA has worked for me in the past and have had success with it but I have also crossed the point at which it starts breaking down.\n\n&gt; how could it be possible that PL or WS are safer than RA?\n\nBecause you're operating as a business instead of the grey area that is RA. You have commercial invoices, real relationships with your supplier and you're purchasing products that come straight from the manufacturer.\n\nIf you buy a product off the store shelf (especially clearance products) there is a very real risk that someone has opened the product, done something to it and put it back on the shelf. And if you are opening the product to check if it has been tampered with then you can't really call it new and you can't say they are quality products.\n\nIf your account is put on hold by Amazon and they demand an invoice for a product and all you have is a receipt from Target... you're finished. They are just not going to accept that receipt.\n\nFinally, good customer service doesn't help you in preventing suspensions because with FBA Amazon will automatically take care of customer service for you in the form of emails letting you know they refunded a customer. Really, you should be doing minimal if any customer service at all with FBA.\n\n&gt;  I don't see a whole lot of people just walking away from that kind of income, if their operations were on par with what we're doing here.\n\nYou'd be surprised.

If we can't say for sure that the product hasn't been opened, we don't buy it (part of the thorough research stage as well as the quality products stage). And, frankly, there's a close to equal risk that your supplier or manufacturer will supply you with tampered or mispackaged products as there is that buying something of the regular shelf at a given store will have been tampered with.\n\nThere is a legitimate point in the receipt not sufficing to the point that an invoice will suffice, however, and isn't something I had previously considered.\n\nAnd I'm surprised you're a frequent FBA seller if you say customer service plays no role. We get dozens of questions, requests, and inquiries every month from prospective or previous buyers asking for help, details, etc. No customer has ever contacted us and walked away without having had their expectations exceeded. I suppose it would be easy enough to say \"contact Amazon and work it out with them,\" but that's not how we do business. Our customers provide our living, and we make sure they are taken care of.\n\n&gt; I regularly talk to two other people that have done just that.\n\nTo be fair, I said I don't see a *whole lot of people* doing that.
