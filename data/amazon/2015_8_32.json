They were purchased at an auction and the retail value of all the items is around $1,000,000.  Most of the electronics are 5-10 years old. They include security cameras, camera lenses, DVR monitors, routers, and hard drives. Brands include Mace, Geovision, and D Link. \n\nI found a few comparable products on Amazon for REALLY high prices which was very exciting. I then shipped off a few samples from each category to Amazon FBA to test the market. Unfortunately, nothing  has been selling. A lot of the products cannot even be found on Amazon, prompting me to make my own product listings.

{"id":"3fnh5n","author":"ThePwnR4nger","body":"Cash back! Points! Zero interest on today's purchases! It's possible, that if you pay off all of your interest, you can actually profit quite a bit... IF you use the right credit card. It's important to weigh the various cash back and points options between cards to figure out which one works best for you to use daily.\n\nHere's an example:\nI have three credit cards.\n\n#1 is an Amazon credit card with a limit of $2,600. Any purchases made get me 1-2% back in points that I can use to buy things from Amazon, with 3% back from Amazon itself. This card has high utility and I can utilize the points 100% effectively, especially during Christmas where I can get free shipping and free presents for friends and family. I have had this card for 5+ years and use it for all of my daily purchases.\n\n#2 is a Best Buy credit card with a limit of $2,000. This card was first issued to me so that I would have 3 years, same as cash to pay off a washer and dryer. I have not used it for any other purchases since. The other rewards are when I reach certain purchase thresholds, I get coupons for use at Best Buy. This card was great at first, but I don't constantly need expiring coupons to encourage me to buy things that I don't need.\n\n#3 is an American Eagle credit card with a high limit of $9,200. This was one of my first cards and got me a one-time discount when I signed up for it. Its limit was initially around $2000 but increased over time and suddenly jumped one day from $3k to its current level. The rewards are coupons for clothing that expire 2 months after being used. I rarely use them, partially because they aren't allowed on some items that are already on sale, and I don't regularly buy clothes. I keep the card as a secondary, back-up or emergency card. This has actually been highly effective for me over the years, most recently when I moved across the country and had a gap between checks.\n\nI should note that I have only once paid interest on a credit card in the 7-8 years that I have had these 3 cards. Paying on time actually has netted me, I'm guessing, close to $2,000 over the years in free money.\n\nWhat cards do you use that have saved you money, and what cards do you recommend?\n","name":"t3_3fnh5n","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-03 20:56:13","week":32}

{"id":"3fo9pp","author":"Link2233","body":"Little background info on me and how I got to where I am:\n\nI'm 26 years old and first-time business owner of an E-commerce vape shop. The business started as an Ebay store selling herbal vaporizers that were purchased with $2,000 of borrowed money from a family member. The Ebay business took off pretty quickly and within a few months was generating 30k per month in revenue which enabled me to launch the website. The website got going pretty quickly as well with the majority of sales being driven through Google Adwords. Unfortunately this success was short-lived as the site was soon banned from GA for having products that “resembled and could be few confused with E-cigs”. Even though I didn't sell E-cigs at the time, I realized then there was going to be a lot of limitations with this business.\n\nSales immediately dropped on the website and because of my inexperience, decided it would be best to get some outside help. I quickly hired a social media company and separate SEO company on a monthly basis to help build the site. This unfortunately turned out to be a mistake and a huge waste of money.  During this time though, I made it a point to start learning everything I could about E-commerce &amp; SEO in addition to becoming familiar with the E-cig market. \n\nSoon after I was selling E-cig vaporizers and doing my own SEO, finally beginning to get some organic traffic. The E-cigs still took off much quicker on Ebay and required the majority of my time, preventing me from concentrating on the website. In December of 2014 everything changed – Ebay decided to ban both herbal vaporizers and E-cig products which forced me pretty much completely out of their marketplace. I quickly turned all of my time to building up the website. This included getting referral traffic and link-building, which turned out to be quite expensive trying to do it the “right” way. \n\nBy March the site was averaging 15k monthly revenue and just finished with 22k for July. By now you might be thinking this sounds more like being on the path to success rather than failure so let me start **explaining the issues:**\n\nUnlike the herbal vaporizers which are all drop-shipped, all of the E-cig products I am required to stock myself. I have been successful so far by targeting the most popular brands and newest products coming to market. Unfortunately this requires capital I do not have and I often find my money tied up in one product while losing sales on others because I can't afford to stock them. \n\nWith all of the capital being invested in inventory, it has become extremely difficult to do anything else to help grow the business. With the tight margins, it provides enough for me to live on but not much left over to invest back into business.  Because of this, I fear I might eventually get left behind and lose everything I've built so far. My main competitors are million dollar companies with huge budgets... these companies are able to stock hundreds of vape products which helps to naturally increase their growth and profit. With the popularity of E-cigs increasing, even more of these companies are entering the market and the margins on retail items continues to get worse. Even with sales increasing, it's seems like this could be difficult to sustain with my situation. If I make a wrong move on a product, I'd be stuck waiting for however long it takes them to sell in order to get my capital back. With them being banned on Ebay &amp; Amazon, there would be no secondary outlet either to move them quicker.\n\nNot being able to properly stock the store like a normal vape shop should be also negates some of the SEO traffic that has been built for the site. For example, I am ranked top 3 for a very popular “for sale” term but make absolutely nothing from the traffic. Because of this, I have not focused any more efforts to building traffic for that category page.  \n\nAt this point, I've feel like I've hit road-black for these E-cig products. These products make up the majority of the sales and am not quit sure what path to take from here. I'm currently focusing my efforts on generating organic search engine traffic for the herbal vaporizers but that will take both money and time. Additionally, I've learned achieving success getting ranked for certain terms doesn't necessarily guarantee your going to make sales. I don't want to leave my success up to chance and I certainly don't want to be completely reliant on Google. With this industry being extremely restricted for advertising, the only other options are referral traffic and social media. Referral traffic already accounts for 50% of my traffic but is also greatly limited due to my product selection while social media is currently being worked on.\n\nHere are some of the options I'm currently considering:\n\n1) Getting a small business loan that would provide enough to allow me to invest in inventory in addition to marketing. With my credit score, this option does not appear possible.\n\n2) Finding an investor. This seems like a logical route to take but not necessarily as simple. I don't have any relatives with money or any close connections. I've looked into Angel investors but have not done any outreach yet. From my understanding, these type of investors are generally looking solely for a return and not to have any involvement in the business. Ideally I would want an investment from someone who has previous experience running an E-commerce business. With the proper capital, I know this could grow this into a very successful company. However, I am not naive and realize this is still my first business. While I've made plenty of mistake so far and have learned a great deal from them, I realize there is still a potential for more to be made.  I look at an investment very similarly to how I view a loan and that is to be even more careful with it then my own money. This would put even more pressure on me to not make any mistakes. I therefore put great value on having a partner that has experience and can help to avoid  mistakes in addition to offering improvements to the way the business is currently being run. \nIn regards to finding an investor, I've considered reaching out to companies in the same niche. I know I have something with great potential here and sales to back it up. However, I assume these E-cig companies would probably be looking for a buy-out rather than partnership. Reaching out to the one's that are solely in the herbal vaporizer business is something I've considered as well.\n\n3) Investing all of my money back into the business and to continue to grow it on my own. This would be difficult to do because I still need money for stocking products. I'm confident in my ability to increase the traffic organically and the plans I have for social media. I'm not entirely confident being able to execute those plans with my current financial state. I've considered taking a short-term loan for $15,000 with a 20% interest rate which is obviously extremely high. Although this would be the quickest solution to accessing more capital, I don't think any part of the loan is ideal and as of now something I severely would like to avoid.\n\n4) Sell the business. This option has me torn and is also quite complicated. First, I'd have to find the right buyer to make this even possible. Between finding one and then actually closing on deal, I imagine this would take quite a bit of time. I also feel I would have to sell the business greatly undervalued as it's obviously going to get based priced based on net sales and not potential. I've built this business from ground up starting with virtually nothing and have been trying to do everything the right way instead of cutting corners (especially in regards to SEO). Additionally, sales could have been much higher the last few months if I were able to maintain inventory of the top-selling products which is something that wouldn't be considered into the valuation of the business. Logically, I don't think it would be smart of me to try to sell the business at this point. However, another part of me that thinks the opposite way. \n\nI have researched another niche I could be immediately ready to jump into. It is a huge market that is rather new and continuing to grow. After analyzing the competition, I am certain I could gain a huge market share relatively quickly through organic traffic. Equally important, there are no restrictions on this niche. I would be able to market through multiple paid advertising channels and be able to diversify my revenue stream. These products could also be sold through other marketplaces which would provide further diversity and potential profit. There are also drop-ship suppliers which is a plus. Overall I think this option reduces risk and offers great chance for success but simply wouldn't be possible without selling my current business.\n\nThis turned out to be much longer than expected . If you've taken the time to read this much, I greatly appreciate it and hope my points were not too scattered. I realize it is a lot to evaluate and there are no simple answers. Any advice or opinions you fellow entrepreneurs can offer in regards to my situation will be extremely valued . I want to succeed and think it's important to hear outside perspectives.  If you have any questions for me as well, let me know and I will do my best to answer them.","name":"t3_3fo9pp","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-04 00:15:03","week":32}

{"id":"3fodoa","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hello PF!  I just got a new job fairly recently and I'm not 100% sure where I should be spending my money at just yet. \n\nMy current situation:\n\nDebts:\n\n* 22k left on auto loan($550/month @3.5%) 3 years to go\n\n* 24k left on student loans ($325/month payment) Most are between 2%-4% with one loan at $4.7k @ 6.3%\n\n* 7k CC debt on one card (20% APR)\n\n* 2.5k CC Debt on another card (0% APR for another 12 months)\n\n* 4.5k CC Newegg/Amazon debt @ 0% APR for another 10 months\n\nFinancial assets:\n\n* 8k in my 401k\n\nAt my previous job I was making between 85-95k in income(salary+bonus) so this was a manageable level of debt, however that amount was starting to become uncomfortable.  Fortunately my girlfriend was also making about 60k, so between the two of us we managed alright.  Part of the reason I built up so much CC debt was that I was unemployed for about 8 months last year and I just recently moved to a new state to shorten my commute.\n\nFast forward to the past few weeks:  I recently got a new job offer that I've accepted, salary of 120k, signing bonus of 20k, and about 120k of stock with a 4 year vest.    \n\nI'll be moving to the bay area for this position which is incredibly expensive from what I can tell.  Right now I'm looking at renting a 1 bedroom for ~2500/month.  I'm not interested in commuting a long distance since I will have to focus on working to the best of my abilities, so I'm looking for a place within a 20 minute walking distance. With all of my expenses, I'm looking at about $4900/month, that includes my car, gas, insurance, student loans, rent, utilities, pets, food, and a $200/month entertainment budget.  This leaves me around $800/month to put down to my credit cards or anything else I need to pay off.  \nI'm planning on taking full advantage of the 401k match at my new job just like I did at my old job, so that will be taken care of.\n\nMy main concern is where to spend my signing bonus.  After tax it will end up being about $13,000 in cash in hand.  My main thought is to completely pay off the $7,000 in CC debt on the 20% card.  I was planning on holding on to the remainder in a savings account, ~$6,000 which gets auto-debited to make my car payments.   With a decent amount of savings, I was planning on taking the $800/month I have extra to pay off all of my 0% lines before they start collecting interest.  With the new income/salary I should be able to pay it all off before I end up paying any interest, at least that's my thought.\n\nMy second point of concern, after one year at this new company I will end up vesting ~$30k in stock (20k after taxes) and potentially a cash bonus as well anywhere from $20k-$5k.   My thought there was to pay off my student loans and automobile with that cash. With the interest rates as low as they are, I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to pay them off, or build up a small nest egg instead.  If I have a nest egg I can still keep making car payments/student loan payments for a while, but if I suddenly lose my job, having no student loans or car payments isn't going to help me as much considering my other expenses.\n\nMy last concern, I don't see myself being able to afford a decent sized house in the bay area anytime soon.  With house prices in the 1-1.5million dollar range, It will be quite a while before I can save enough cash to put a down payment on a house.  With that in mind I see myself renting for quite a while and saving up as much as I can in the meantime.  However... I've always had it as a personal dream to get a nice sports car, in particular one that costs about $60,000. Does it make sense to finance the car with that in mind?  I want to be able to save enough $$ to put on a down payment for a house in the near future, however I think I will have to wait until my compensation increases quite a bit more until I'm ready for that.  I'm pretty young still, only ~27 years old so I feel like I can wait a few more years for a nice house, but I really want to get the sports car before I end up having kids and losing my free time.  I'm not really looking to buy the 2nd car though until I've paid off my current car and I plan on keeping my current car until it kicks the bucket as it gets great mpg and is very practical.\n\nThanks PF!","name":"t3_3fodoa","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-04 00:44:19","week":32}
{"id":"3fodqz","author":"Fishering","body":"Hey again! I made a post a few days ago about the differences between Perk, CheckPoints, and Charger Pay, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/3fhje6/perk_vs_checkpoints_vs_charger_pay/). \n\n**Since that post had a lot of positivity, I am deciding to write a similar post for the differences between Receipt Hog, Receipt Pal, and Yaarlo. Each of these apps are not necessarily 'cash back' apps, but they will pay you to submit receipts. I will be weighing the pros and cons of each app, and then I will give each app a rating.**\n\n# Receipt Hog\n\n**Receipt Hog is probably the most known app that will pay you for receipts. It has been around the longest, and for sure does pay.**\n\n&gt; **Pros of Receipt Hog** \n\n* Easy to earn points\n* More ways to earn points\n* Has Paypal &amp; Amazon to cash out to.\n\n&gt; **Cons of Receipt Hog**\n\n* Submitting receipts can sometimes be a pain in the ass.\n* Do not accept receipts from *that* many places. \n* $5 minimum.\n* The hog slots is really stupid. (Instead of paying you for all receipts, some times they will give you tokens for a 'slot game'. You will more than likely lose the slot game each time you play, or you will gain 2-10 points. It really makes the app part 'qriket'.)\n\n## Receipt Hog's rating \n\nSpecification | Rating (out of 5 stars)\n|:---------------:|:----------:|\n| Minimum Cash Out| ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆|\n| Support | ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆|\n| Ease of Earning | ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆|\n| Reward Processing Speed | ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆|\n\nMinimum Cashout: $5, but if you save up more points, you will save more. I honestly hate apps/sites that give you discounts for saving up, because it gives you more stress of wanting to save, but also not wanting to save... hmm, just me.\n\nSupport: I had a few issues with receipts not crediting, they always responded and helped me out. \n\nEase of Earning: Receipts don't pay a lot on receipt hog, but there are other easy ways to earn, so that might make up for it. \n\nReward Processing Speed: Reletively quickly.. Expect your pay within 2-3 days at the most.\n\n## Overall Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆   \n\n# ReceiptPal\n\n**ReceiptPal was released shortly after ReceiptHog. There are a lot of similarities to the two, but ReceiptPal pays a set amount of points per receipt you submit (25), no matter the value/total spent on the purchase to where the receipt is to.**\n\n&gt; **Pros of ReceiptPal**\n\n* Instant cashouts.\n* Low Minimum\n* Easy to submit receipts\n* Accept receipts from anywhere! (Yes, e-receipts count)!\n\n&gt; **Cons of ReceiptPal**\n\n* You are limited to the number of receipts you can submit in a week. (20 receipts is the maximum! This could be a problem for some people). \n\n\n## ReceiptPal's Rating\n\nSpecification | Rating (out of 5 stars)\n|:---------------:|:----------:|\n| Minimum Cash Out| ★ ★ ★ ★ ★|\n| Support | ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆|\n| Ease of Earning | ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ |\n| Reward Processing Speed | ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ |\n\nMinimum cashout: $1 is the minimum. You can save up and get better deals (really better deals). The only negative to this is that you really don't get much options for cashout. It's really just amazon. No paypal.\n\nSupport: If they mess up on declining a receipt that should have been accepted, they will quickly fix it for you.. most of the time.\n\nEase of Earning: It is really easy to submit receipts. They are not picky about the picture (like receipthog is), and submitting e-receipts is a breeze!\n\nReward Processing Speed: Instant! Right to your email!\n\n## Overall rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ \n\n# Yaarlo\n\n**Yaarlo is a new app that will pay for receipts. It was released to android and iOS very recently, so I have personally never gotten paid. They have a system that seems much better than both ReceiptHog and ReceiptPal combined, since they pay you 1 cent per dollar spent on the receipt. They also have a really good referral system, so if you want to give it a go, please consider entering the code \"KJKANE968\" when you register :)**\n\n&gt; **Pros of Yaarlo**\n\n* Has lots of cashout options.\n* Pays a lot more per receipt than its competitors\n\n&gt; **Cons of Yaarlo** \n\n* Has VERY many technical errors. (Can't submit receipts, app freezes, logs you out, and can't log back in, etc...)\n* High $10/20 minimum\n* Has no support? (Their site says email support@Yaarlo.com. After writing a 2 page essay to them about the issues with their app, I get a reply saying \"Sending this email has permanently failed, because it couldn't find that email)\n* They mess up on how many points you should get ALL THE TIME. (I submitted a receipt from a grocery store worth $250. Their system says that they pay 1% cash back on all receipts. 1% of $250 is $2.50. On Yaarlo 1 point = $0.01. That receipt gave me 22 points, or $0.22. Not quite 1%. I also submitted 4 receipts at one time. Only one of them was approved. The other 3 disappeared. Seriously. They weren't listed under approved, declined, or pending. They were just gone.)\n\n## Yaarlo's Rating\n\nSpecification | Rating (out of 5 stars)\n|:---------------:|:----------:|\n| Minimum Cash Out| ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆|\n| Support |  ★ ★ ★ ★  ☆| Edit: support email is support@budflix.com (thank you /u/Superluigi6)\n| Ease of Earning | ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆|\n| Reward Processing Speed | ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆| Edit: (Just redeemed for $10 amazon, email said 5-7 days)\n\nMinimum Cash Out: $10/20.\n\nSupport: ~~Non existent (please comment if this information is incorrect).~~ Edit: Support email is support@budflix.com (thank you /u/Superluigi6)\n\nEase of Earning: Can be really stressful, hence the reasons listed above. \n\nReward Processing Speed: ~~Never cashed out yet!~~  Edit: (Just redeemed for $10 amazon, email said 5-7 days)\n\n# Overall Rating: ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ \n\n**This app has AMAZING potential. Just because I rate this app so low as of now, does not mean that it's not worth checking out. $0.22 for a receipt is still way more than anything reciepthog or ReceiptPal will pay, and for some of these reasons I will continue to work with Yaarlo.**\n\n# Conclusion \n\n**Despite the ratings of all these, I really do recommend you to use all of these. If you have one receipt from your grocery store worth $100, why not submit it to all three apps? You will get 20 points on Receipthog, 25 points on receiptPal, and $1 from Yaarlo (in theory). There's no reason to not use them all, and use more when they come out! These are great apps to mix with your cashback apps, like iBotta, or Checkout51... There's like 100+ different cashback apps at this point.. I bet if someone used them all you could actually be getting paid to go shopping.. lol.)**\n\n**If you have any questions, feel free to comment. If you want to help me out, please consider using some referral codes!**\n\n# [Receipt Hog: Please enter code sneft386 on sign up! (5 free spins)](http://receipthog.com/)\n\n# [Receipt Pal: No referral system](http://receiptpalapp.com/)\n\n# [Yaarlo: Please enter code: KJKANE968.

{"id":"3fqfjm","author":"[deleted]","body":"So, I got into the app rewards thing from my wife. She's been using Swagbucks for a few months now, and she used her earnings to pay for a lot of the Amazon stuff we've bought this year. I did some research on this stuff since I'm into easy money (who isn't), and all the youtube videos, and reddit sites made me think it was gonna be a piece of cake to just buy a few cheap phones and let em go like tiny little cash cows with little-to-no supervision. In reality, not only have I seem to have came in on the downward trend of the earnings, but the apps themselves crash or freeze ALL THE TIME. I'm always having to reset my phones, webpages, tablet, etc. People like to refer to their setups as \"farms\", if that's the case then I have the sickliest cows and chickens, and the soil ain't growing much of anything. Is there really any passive app/website that can run 24/7 without the grace of god and the planets needing to be in alignment? Are the people who're making $5-$10 a day really doing it without hacks or spending 1/3 of their day babysitting their devices? I'm a busy husband &amp; father of 3 kids and I ain't got time for that mess. If I wanted to babysit my investment, I'd buy real friggin' livestock and do it the old fashioned way. I just need someone on here to keep it 100% and tell me if I'm wasting my time or not, or give me tips on how they're doing it and which apps won't give me migraines.

So I initially started reselling vacuum parts and accessories on Amazon, but then decided to go cut out the middleman and sell direct to consumer. I've replicated the same success, disrupting other verticals turning it into a $10 million international business, fully automated without my oversight. I currently complete over 60,000 orders a month over multiple channels such as: Amazon, Ebay, Rakuten, my stores’ sites and more.\n \nFor years I struggled to operationally run my business then decided to build a software to automate the entire day-to-day process on a single platform to minimize the cost of subscribing to multiple platforms.\n \nThus Skubana was born. **It is now the software driving all of my e-commerce businesses**, enabling me to focus my time on this SAAS startup. It's an all-in-one order management, inventory, PO's, analytics, and accounting cloud software that automates and accelerates back-end operations for all sellers.\n\n**As Skubana.com is my first SAAS platform, I’m reaching out to the Entrepreneur subreddit for advice on what functionality you would like to see in a platform running your E-Commerce business and any other wisdom this subreddit has to share.**\n \nIf you want to get to know more about me, [WebRetailer](http://www.webretailer.com/lean-commerce/crucial-chad-rubin-amazon/#/) wrote a profile of me about Crucial Vacuum’s quick success and the amazing prospects Skubana offers to new entrepreneurs.\n \n*I take great pride in being an instructor for online sellers and aspiring entrepreneurs, and I feel teaching is the best way to learn.

Some of which, I couldn't pay and he didn't have a job.  He hasn't given me more than $20 since Nov of 2013 but that's a whole other battle that will be fought soon!  I lost my job earlier this year and was unable to find another for a few months.  I took a job an hour away and making 10k less a year. That lasted 3 months until a recruiter called me.. I ended up leaving that job for a new job I just started a month ago.  I feel like I can finally breathe.. lol.

{"id":"3ftlnu","author":"likingAL","body":"Hi! First of all, I love this community. I'm not ready to jump headfirst into churning (yet) but appreciate the almost scientific approach you guys have to maximizing benefits. To be honest, it's inspiring to read.\n\nI'm fairly new to credit cards in general but have strong-ish credit (740 I think currently) and have never missed a payment on the only CC I have, a Discover that gives me 1% cash back. I just had a kid, am starting grad school, and am looking to save every penny. As part of grad school, I will be traveling to Europe/Asia a few times. I will also be eating out a lot over the next 2 years. Here are the needs I have followed by my plan to meet each need. I realize this isn't a churning related question, more a CC/general question so if I should post this somewhere else, please let me know. Apologies in advance if this doesn't belong here. Thanks!\n\nFact to consider\n\n1. Our spend is fairly low. Like $200/month of groceries, $200 of eating out, $200 on Misc (Amazon mostly, diapers, etc.), $100 on gas, and big junks on tuition and rent. I don't think our spend is enough to make a CC with yearly fees worth it.\n\n2. My income will be zero while in school but I have cash scholarships, personal savings, etc that will help me not need to take out a loan, at least in the first year.\n\n3. I want to minimize the # of cards I have.\n\nNeeds\n\n1. An all purpose card with high cash back. (zero fee)\n\n2. A card for groceries/gas (zero fee)\n\n3. A card for Amazon (zero fee)\n\n4. A card for dining (zero fee)\n\n5. A card that works internationally well (chip/pin, no YF, no FTF, accepted widely)\n\nWhat I'm planning on getting\n\n1. Fidelity 2% Amex. I've looked at everything in the 2% bucket. Some others have fees. The Citi Double Cash looks good but I read an interesting blog post that showed how I can essentially turn the Fidelity 2% into 3%. Note that I already have a Fidelity account. Is there a better everyday card than this? See [here](http://milenomics.com/2014/04/the-best-cash-back-credit-card-on-earth/)\n\n2. Sally Mae. Is this card a joke? Tailor made for my family. I applied and was approved within 1 day of reading about this. Still waiting to find out if this card is too good to be true. Until then, I'm telling (fiscally responsible) friends about it and we're all scratching our heads. Am I missing something?!\n\n3. See #2\n\n4. This is the toughest one. Looks like the AARP card might be the winner (3% back on dining out) though I may wait 6 months as I'm still wondering why there isn't a card that can get me 5% of dining. Thoughts?\n\n5. Another tough one. Looks like Quicksilver is the winner? Again, I don't want a yearly fee. I've worked in finance for too long not to realize that 95% of the people paying yearly fees for CCs aren't covering the cost (vs. a similar card w/o a fee) and my excel sheets show that I would be no different. This card has a chip/pin, no fee, no FTF, AND 1.5% cash back AND it's a VISA so should work all over the world.\n\nOk. That was long. Even if just one of you could offer a helping hand before this gets downvoted for not being churning related it would be greatly appreciated. You guys are amazing! Thank you!\n\n\n","name":"t3_3ftlnu","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-05 03:33:36","week":32}

{"id":"3fxg79","author":"davedawg2000","body":"Hey /r/PF,\n\nHoping to get some advice on how to help my cousin out. He's had quite a rough upbringing (father was never really there, and mother had drug/health issues). As a consequence, he had to rely on his own hustle to support himself. In addition to a number of other significant financial blunders (maxing out and defaulting on credit cards, getting locked into a car loan he couldn't really afford with a 17% interest rate, etc.), I've come to learn that he's never filed a federal tax return since turning becoming an adult 12 years ago. I am doing whatever I can help him get back on the right track so he can start to live with a bit less stress, but I'm not entirely sure where to start with this one.\n\nOver the last decade or so, he's supported himself primarily by buying and selling used video games. He has also had sporadic employment, both above and under the table, at places like restaurants and liquor stores, but has never really held those jobs for more than a few months at a time. I'm sure he's gotten a small handful of W-2's over the years, but pretty much ignored them since he didn't really know what to do with them. \n\nHe buys his video game inventory in private party transactions via Craigslist, local flea markets, and yard sales and such. He does most of his day-to-day selling through Amazon / eBay storefronts, but does a fair amount of cash transactions through private parties and at video game conventions as well. \n\nSurprisingly, (to our knowledge) he has never been contacted by the IRS for failure to file. My suspicion is that his income has been so low (almost certainly couldn't be more than $25K or so in any given year) that he most likely would have actually been entitled to refunds had he been filing this whole time.\n\nI understand the statutes of limitation regarding how far back you can ask for unclaimed refunds and how far back the IRS can go to try and collect unpaid taxes that they are owed; however, because of a near-complete lack of record-keeping, I feel like it's impossible to determine what he's made and what he potentially would have owed (or been owed), especially in those earlier years. Thankfully, the money he's making in his online storefronts can be tracked a bit better, which might make his life easier going forward, but trying to rebuild history will prove to be near-impossible.\n\nI spoke with a friend of mine who is an Enrolled Agent with the IRS and she recommended visiting a local IRS field office to see what they might be able to do. I know that tax evasion is a serious crime, but I highly doubt they would throw him in cuffs for coming forward seeking help. While I think a visit to the IRS office is definitely solid advice and something that I plan to pursue with him, I just wanted to see if any of you might have additional suggestions or advice.\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_3fxg79","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-05 23:54:42","week":32}

{"id":"3fyn8b","author":"ralphisahomo","body":"I have about $5000 worth of Amazon gift cards, and the goal is to cash them out for either a small loss (5% or less) or even go for a profit. There are a few options:\n\n1) I can sell them online or in person for cash. However, I'm going to lose at least 10% on each card, but probably closer to 15-20%, so I don't think that's the best choice.\n\n2) I can buy expensive, commonly traded items, and try to sell them on Craigslist for a profit (or at least to break even). So far, possible items I'm thinking about are used macbook pros, macbook airs and iphones. The benefit of these are they are high-value (which means fewer total transactions), and commonly bought and sold on craigslist. Buying used is obviously more risky, but it's nearly impossible to sell new electronics without taking a 10% loss, because if someone's going to pay $2000 for a brand new laptop, they're not going to want to do business with a stranger.\n\nWhat other options do I have? I wish I could just buy gold coins... Something that's expensive, easily traded and retains its value. Besides Apple electronics, what others items fit that criteria?\n\nAlso, are there any ways that I can maximize my credit with Amazon? For example, I know that if you make purchases with an Amazon credit card you can save 5% on each transaction, but unfortunately I have gift cards, so I can't do that. Is there something else I should try to take advantage of, because of the bulk purchases I'm going to make?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.","name":"t3_3fyn8b","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-06 05:40:40","week":32}
{"id":"3fyvjn","author":"holymotherofacow","body":"Apologize for the formatting...I can't seem to get it to do what I want.\n\nI work while my wife stays at home and takes care of our two kids. My current job environment is in a very low spot and thus my income is not what it used to be. It seems I may be nearing a critical point in our finances within the next 6 months. Below is a breakdown of our expenses/allowances and what I usually make. My job depends on days worked in the field, thus more work = more days = more pay.\n\n\nI am 28 and make around 100k a year depending on how much work I get.\n\nI have $43K in my 401K and about $5k in company stock.\n\n\nStudent Loans: Already consolidated to the best we can\n\nFor me = $402 ($25k total of 3 loans)\n\nFor Her = $567 ($90K total of 3 loans)\n\nCollege Savings (529 Plan):\n\nKid #1 = $25\n\nKid #2 = $25\n\n\nAuto: Recently traded in our two cars for one (Saved $350 a month). What we wanted to do was get into a very cheap SUV but we could not get enough for our two cars as they had accidents on the record to cover what we owe. As a result we had to bury it into a higher priced vehicle to cover the % of overall owed on the new car we got. This is such a scam by the banks. Apparently they would rather give me a $50K loan with $900 payments then give me one for $20K with $300 payments if the % owed is beyond a certain point on what the car is worth. It isn’t what we wanted to do but it saved us several thousand dollars in the long run and gave us a much lower payment overall.\n\nTLDR: this is unchangeable\n\n1 Small SUV = $545\n\nInsurance = $76\n\n\nHouse:\n\nMortgage = $1,260 ($125k home with 28 years to go @ 4% - appraised at around $150K)\n\nDirecTV = $24 (HD antenna doesn’t work well in our area)\n\nInternet = $50 (20mbps with our own equipment)\n\nPower = $160 (Fluctuates between $120-$200 depending on price of Kwh)\n\nNetflix = $8 (Kids use it quite a bit and we use it instead of having more channels)\n\nAmazon Prime = $8 (we use this well worth the payment)\n\nTrash = $20\n\nPhones = $134 (On a shared plan with family)\n\nSewer = $40\n\n\nLiving Budget:\n\nWife + Kids = $1200 a month\n\nMyself = $200\n\nGym = $35 (family membership that offers daycare for the kids while we work out as well as a lot of free activities for the kids and us at a local YMCA, Usually $70 but my company pays for $35 of it.)\n\n\nI feel my wife could manage her and the kid's expenses much better. She does coupons and only buys on sale items. She eats out with the kids for convenience about once a week and we almost never hire a baby sitter (once every two months maybe).\n\n\nMedical:\n\nI have kids, they go to the doctor and/or hospital  = $145\n\n\nCredit Cards: All under 11% APR, not great but not a death wish\n\n4 Cards = $500\n\nWas actually doing well in this department until I lost my job and had to find a replacement about 2 years ago right after the birth of my second child. Pay is still good but it was near a 33% pay cut. It ballooned up to almost 32k from 16k but has since been managed down to 26k and is slowly going down.\n\n\nOverall the monthly expenses come out to near $5,400 and I want to bring it down.\nHer Credit is shot so we keep everything separate as much as we can to help keep my score up above 720. We do not buy anything extravagant. If we need something we usually get it for the home/maintenance department. The most money I have spent this year was on a single thing was hosting a best friend’s bachelor party for around $200.\n\n\nOur family vacation was a trip to a water park and camping overnight which ended up costing us around $225 with gas.\n\n\nLooking back over the years there were a few decisions that could have been made better for a more promising future. The timing of kids and the home are the major two but other than that it just seems like one thing after another sucks up our extra income. Any help, insight or advice is greatly appreciated.\n","name":"t3_3fyvjn","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-06 06:58:52","week":32}

Last year I made 24,600 before taxes. \n\nRight now:\n\n$2k in EF \n~$2,500 in an Edward Jones Investment Acct (Was gifted to me)\n$1,000 Savings Bond (Gifted to me)\n\nLet's say my income is 1600/mo for right now.\n\nMy expenses:\n\n* 100/mo Car Insurance\n* 60/mo Gas\n* 93/mo Life Insurance \n* 80/mo Water/Electric/Cable/Internet\n* 95/mo Cell Phone\n* 14/mo Netflix\n* 5/mo Spotify\n\nPlus debt payments:\n\n* 211.30/mo Car Payment (Usually pay 250)\n* 273.36/mo Lending Club Payment\n* 28/mo Minimum Citi Payment (Usually pay 150)\n* 25/mo Minimum Chase Payment (Usually pay 50)\n* 10/mo Minimum CU Credit Card Payment (Usually pay 12)\n\nWhich brings my absolute bare minimum expenses/obligations to ~995/mo (+Food/Entertainment/Misc. so let's call it 1100)\n\nSo during college I was pretty reckless with my spending which I obviously regret yada yada.\n\nMy Debts:\n\n* Amazon.com Chase CC $900 @18.24% \n* Lending Club Loan $8,000 @ 13.99% (273/mo for 36 mos.)\n* Citi TY Preferred $1,900 @ 13.99 \n* Auto Loan $5,247 @ 6.97% (211.30/mo for 72 mos.)\n\nStudents Loans in Grace Until January\n\n* SL A $3,500 @ 4.5%\n* SL B $5,005.91 @ 5.399%\n* SL C $7,389.09 @ 3.4%\n* SL D $5,545.91 @ 3.86%\n* SL E $5,500 @ 4.66%\n* SL F $2,069.53 @ 4.66%\n\nSo here are my thoughts: \n\nI am hesitant to use my savings to pay off the CC debt because I would like to keep it around in case I need to pay my mom's mortgage near the end of her life.  The average prognosis for her type of cancer is 6.5-9.5 months but she has been responding well to treatment.  Really, I want to have as much cash around as possible to pay her expenses.  I am okay with not getting this money back, obviously.  I have been at my job for 8 years, and only seen 1 person fired. Which is to say my job is very stable. I have not sought another job after graduation because I found out the day after graduation that my mom was sick and the flexibility has been a lifesaver.  \n\nBoth of my parents have/will die(d) young so I would like to keep my life insurance because it provides me with peace of mind that the situation they have left me in will never happen to my eventual children. It's 23/mo for a 50k whole-life plan and 70/mo for a 250k Return of Premium plan which will pay out 25k (All of my premium back) to me at the age of 52 if I outlive the term.\n\nI am looking at setting up a Simple IRA through work (3% match) but it's been hard to get set up so far.\n\nI would like to tackle my debt as quickly as possible, but I need some advice on where to start since my mom never really instilled financial values in me.\n\n\n","name":"t3_3g0gtd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-06 17:15:55","week":32}

In doing so, I found a very popular domain name that didn't cost thousands of dollars on GoDaddy. Imagine it being something along the lines of, \"OakleySunglasses.com\". It's a super popular name brand with one of their product lines following.\n\nSo my thought process is to open an Ecommerce store that sells this popular product and advertises for them, then links to an Amazon Affiliate account. \n\nWith some hard work, can you see this being profitable?\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_3g3kh4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-07 07:40:51","week":32}

Haven't done too much MS/churning or whatever you want to call it (besides putting everything I can on CC and paying off full balance each month) but two years ago worked my way to a companion pass which has been extremely valuable to me and my girlfriend as right now we mainly travel domestic and also live in FL so plan to visit the international hubs they serve.\n\nTwo years ago I had a lot of expenses that came up so it was the perfect time to meet the spend for the Companion Pass. I bought my car off my Dad and mainly used Amazon Payments to meet the spend... Around March of this year i booked a trip for friends to Miami and got the IHG 70k bonus which I'm using for an upcoming trip. Also have a chase freedom which I use for everyday spend and a few other cards but really have maybe opened 1 or 2 cards in the past 24 months (CSP is first choice in next round of apps).\n\nI recently started grad school (my company pays for tuition) and live in a relatively expensive apartment where rent is $1325 and spend usually $1500-$2000+ more on top of that in addition to the tuition payments mentioned, books, and monthly bills. I was excited to get back into the \"credit card game\" because of all the expenses I have, but after reading the sub for a little bit I'm not sure it matters (all my expenses) and am a little confused... I've seen a couple suggestions to just buy VGC's - load serve/Redbird - and pay the bill buying the vgc's with your serve/Redbird account. So if that is the process - am I correct in saying everyone is on the same playing field? There is no advantage to having more expenses or bills than the next \"churner\"? And if that is the case doesn't it make possibilities limitless/universal between all of us?\n\nThanks for all the good help in the sub and the wikis. Just a little confused and wanted to clear this up in my head... BTW I don't mean same playing field as in credit score, personal finance situation, ability to track data and not mess up, etc... I mean same playing field as in amount of possible spending to meet bonuses. Thanks!\n\nTLDR: MS playing field universal to everyone? Monthly expenses don't matter since they don't come into the loop of the most efficient ways to meet minimum spend?","name":"t3_3g4j5t","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-07 15:04:40","week":32}

There is indeed a formula, and I call it the: *'create a high converting project and drive traffic to said project'* formula. \n\nI consider myself a minimalist with decent design and editing skills. Other people call me a marketing guru, although most of them are family members. My backers, however, saw a trustworthy individual that placed his time and work on creating a pleasantly presented project with an attractive product and idea. I could write paragraphs and elaborate on every single word behind this past sentence, but the idea is simple enough to understand that I don't have to: you have to create a beautiful looking project, present a clear message on the problem you're solving, and offer a viable and realistic solution. So I set out to do just that.\n\n**PR Agency**\n*DO NOT HIRE A PR AGENCY.* Their interests are not in line with yours. They will dangle 'possible' and 'interested' publications at the end of every month just before it's time to renew the ridiculous $4000 monthly charge, only to find yourself paying for the same 'we're still reaching out and waiting for responses.' Do us all a favor and do this work yourself. Find various ways to pitch publications and make their work easy! Create a [Press-Kit](http://press.comfortableboxers.com/press-kit), [Press Page](http://press.comfortableboxers.com), and [Media Page](http://press.comfortableboxers.com/media). I used [Prezly](https://www.prezly.com).Don't be afraid to reach out to large outlets through their contact form. Also, check out [PressFriendly](http://pressfriendly.com).\n\n**Driving Heavy Traffic to Kickstarter**\nPR mentions will drive heavy traffic to Kickstarter and put you up there with the most popular projects on Kickstarter. I also ran a robust PPC campaign during the last 5 days to kick it up a notch. Another driver for Kickstarter traffic are [cross promotions](http://blog.kicktraq.com/kicktraq-quick-tip-the-power-of-cross-promotion/) with other projects. You promote your project to your backers, and they do the same. The same philosophy works great under regular e-commerce stores via Newsletters.\n\n**What I Missed**\nI missed out on a ton of Kickstarter traffic because I didn't get the 'Staff Pick', which means I didn't show up on their home-page. Their 'Magic' sorts Staff Picks first. I'm not exactly sure how they decide to make you a staff pick, but i've read that heavy initial traffic is a key driver.\n\n**Fulfilling Kickstarter Orders**\nYou'll need to determine item counts for each color and size to manufacture the right quantities. Kickstarter surveys are lacking in information organization and integrations, for this, I use [Backerkit](https://backerkit.com/referrals/comfortableboxers). Their platform reads all the Kickstarter backer information in a way you won't believe. It's absolutely essential when it comes to organizing shipping information, pledge levels, add-ons, shipping charges, and integrations with your fulfillment center. Without it, I would've spent at least 2 weeks organizing a large excel file. Despite my love for the platform, Kickstarter does a terrible job when it comes to managing quantities and integrating them into surveys. I really hope they acquire Backerkit in the near future. For anyone running a Kickstarter, make sure you sign up BEFORE your Kickstarter ends. I cannot stress enough how important this tool was in fulfilling 10,000 pairs of boxer briefs to 2500 customers. I even got an extra $2700 in sales in add-ons thanks to this platform.\n\n-------------------------\n\n**Life After Kickstarter** I will not stop at Kickstarter! I am continuing the business and working on new products. My goal is to become a major player in the underwear industry.\n\n**E-Commerce Store**\nThe [e-commerce store](http://comfortableboxers.com) has been witness to natural and organic traffic from google via [SEO](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=comfortable+boxer+briefs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8), my social media accounts, and now, paid Facebook marketing. I'm A/B testing a series of ads these next few weeks.\n\n**Other Sales Channels**\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign like this one, get ready for other outlets to reach out to you for product. I was featured in [Huckberry](https://huckberry.com/store/comfortable-boxers-co) thanks to this, driving additional sales that served the company's finances well and drove the brand's image to a whole other level. We have interest from others as well. We'll be expanding to Amazon and Ebay soon, although the roll-out will be completed until my integrations are ready.\n\n**Tools I Use**\n\n*E-Commerce* I use Shopify. I find their suite to be complete in every sense, with enough add-ons to merit a completely automated environment for your back-end. Their templates are beautiful and their customer service exceptional.\n\n*Accounting* I use Quickbooks Online. Straightforward! An excellent cloud-based platform with a great app for the road.\n\n*Integration* I use [Zapstitch](http://zapstitch.com). Handles all the information to and from the e-commerce platform to my accounting platform. You'll need a relatively advanced understanding of accounting to get it just right!\n\n*Customer Service Chat* I use [Intercom](http://intercom.io). I get chat requests and messages on my iPhone and can immediately respond to any questions or customer service requests at any time and place.\n\n*Referral Service* I use [SLoyalty](http://sloyalty.com). I find that their suite covers the widest range of services with the easiest execution. It works under a points-based system that tracks the customer's purchases, any referrals made by that customer, and automatic redemption of rewards with fraud protection.\n\n*Fraud Protection* I use [Riskified](http://riskified.com). I find that their fraud insurance gives me piece of mind with large and suspicious orders. Here's how it works: you submit an order to them for approval (which it pulls automatically from Shopify); if they approve the order, they charge 4.7% and assume responsibility for the whole value in case of chargebacks for unauthorized use of the credit card; if they deny the order, you're better off refunding the customer's credit card. They also offer a 0.7% service that covers ALL orders instead of manually selected orders.\n\n*PR CRM* I used [Prezly](https://www.prezly.com). They handle e-mail and press beautifully. You'll need to gather media contacts yourself. \n\n**Partners &amp; Services**\n\n*Shipping from Factory* I use [Flexport](http://flexport.com), a logistics partner with bid-based quotes and an entirely electronic management system. No need for printed paperwork or signatures! They handled everything beautifully, FOB to Door.\n\n*Shipping to Customers* I use [Fulfillrite](http://fulfillrite.com). What a great company to work with! I regularly speak to them over the phone and they're always attentive to your needs. They managed to ship out 2300 orders and 10,000 items in 2 mornings!\n\n**One More Thing**\nI have 0 equity partners and 0 employees. I handle purchasing, procurement, graphics design, video editing, marketing, social media, systems, accounting, banking, payments, sales, quotes, wholesale, and customer service. You can too if you can organize yourself. For more on this, please read [The E-Myth.](http://www.amazon.com/The-E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses/dp/0887307280). We're perfectly capable of handling increased volumes thanks to our organized and efficient information systems, part of the 'business model' we touted as being the main driver behind our amazing pricing!\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3g519b","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-07 17:35:31","week":32}

{"id":"3g610x","author":"blakmirror","body":"\n\nHi, it’s me again, Blakmirror, and most of you know me of me as the Amazon guy.  Well today, I hope you see me as the commerce guy.  I am going to open your eyes to the ecommerce marketplace and why it’s easier than over to not only succeed but to dominate in 2015.\n\n;nbsp\n\n\nThe first thing I want you to realize is that ecommerce marketplace give you opportunities to exploit them.  They do this by giving you data, search result pages (every commerce site), reviews (every commerce site), best seller rank (Amazon), Sales History of Sellers (Ebay), etc.  All these pieces of at a can be manipulated in your favor.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nStep 1: The way you present your offer on an ecommerce platform is \nStep 2: Positioning (particularly in the search result pages for product offer) \nStep 3: Of course is the launch or promotion of that product.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll these steps can be optimized and manipulated to directly affect your bottom line. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst I’m going to go into what can be done on all platforms.  Then I’ll break it down to specifics.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first step to every commerce profile is the SEO or the Search Engine Optimization position.  The main thing is people need to find your product when they type it into the marketplaces search box.  SO we use the familiar concept the “keyword” or “keywords” that will describe your product and allow it to be found. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHow do you find keywords? Top of mind analysis, the keyword for “Double A battery” is obviously “Double A Battery.”  But how are people typing that in which way is most popular.  Two ways to confirm:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n1. The search box suggestions \n2. Go to the Internet’s keeper, Google, and use their Adwords tool: Keyword Planner\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThere are also spy tools you can use simple search keyword spy tool [insert marketplace] to see if they are available for your platform. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOnce you find the keywords you’ll place them in your title or tags.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote : Put keywords in your description of the product as well.  Many people forget this and simply list features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe next step is data you can manipulate is reviews.   In this we well also say ratings count as reviews as well.  In going to start by saying, sometimes it’s ok to cheat.  The biggest companies is world fake tests, hire phoney doctors, misquote experience, and hire actors to prove to you their product is the best.  It’s ok for the little guy to do this too.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can hire someone on Fiverr to review or ask friends and family.  There’s nothing wrong with doing this. People need to know your product is good, you can’t contact them personally and vouch for your product.  The ethics here is in the product you sell, be sure you only sell high quality products. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe next demographic in sales history, maybe you can manufacture a few sales with friends and family.  Fiver also has gigs where someone will not only purchase your product but leave a review. Due to budget issues this is limited.  So you have to perform what is known to the internet marketing world as a launch.  You have to present your product to a large number of people, hopefully a targeted audience.  This can be an email list, Facebook Group post, or a Twitter post.  Focus on finding a large number of people who might be interested in what you have to offer.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow We Move to Specifics\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmazon\nMy favorite is Amazon.  This marketplace has been completely cracked.  I you haven’t read my breakdown go here, if you’ve read it before I have added some things so please review: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEbay\nWith Ebay you have to keyword stuff in the title and description of your product or offer.  Now you can manipulate Ebay’s search rankings in the same way you can with Amazon.  You do this through sales history and watchcount. Sales history no difficult but watch count is much easier to manufacture.  Just go Fiverr’s search bar type in “eBay watchers”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe in-demand categories it can still be hard to rank.  There are seller’s selling in iPhone 6 every hour and a IPhone case every two minutes.  So with this you find speed to market is also a shining factor in ecommerce, especially in terms of Ebay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOf course an excellent Ebay html description is also important in Fiver for that as well. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFlippa\nThis site is weird in that the focus is centered on seller history rather than offer specifications in the “starter sites” category.  Again, in this instance sales history is difficult to manipulate.  Flippa’s sap results much like Ebay and Amazon are manipulated through offer listing activity.  Again go to Fiverr and type in “Flippa” and look for gigs that say they’ll increase activity in your listing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nUdemy\nUdemy’s Search Result Pages (SERP) are heavily keyword and activity focused. he best way to bring your course to the top of the SERP is a Free Coupon combined with a promotion from Fiverr.  I don’t want to blow my favorite guy up so DM, for the best traffic gig.  I’ve done them all.  These combined with a course that measures up to your competition in terms of length and perceived value (price), will make you successful in some form.  You should put very good and detailed description and have your course have something extra added, for mine, I have a textbook and exclusive deals with services I mention within the course.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConclusion\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe In-Demand Product\nRealize that though these sites can be exploited.  The responsibility of finding a good offer relies on you.  In terms of physical products, see Watchcount.com or Amazon Top 100-2000, BSRs (see Amazon post for in-depth look at finding products: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/).  For Flippa, you want a good looking site that can be heavily automated. Udemy’s most in-demand courses focus on something with potential for those to earn money like coding, accounting, dropship commerce, and solo ads.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTo the Pessimistic Commenter:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQ1. Hey, why are you telling us this?\nA1. To help you guys out, since m post I have seen a shift in this forum.  You guys are less complex in terms of business ideas, you are focused on low hanging fruit (physical products) which is good for everyone.  Especially, if more people succeed.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nQ2. Doesn’t it defeat your gains saying this?\nA2. No, I don’t have the capital on hand to exploit  every niche so why not share. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nQ3. Can’t these marketplaces read this and change to close the loop? \nQ3. Yes and No. These platforms optimize through SERPs so that you are more likely to buy what returns. How can they determine what you’ll most likely buy?  The common thread amongst all these marketplaces is buyer activity.  Offers who either have had consistent or a burst of reviews, sales activity, watches etc.  It would be a disservice to themselves  and customers to end this activity — optimization because it simply works. The very basics of capitalism the cream will rise top through competition those less innovative with poor product offers or listings, or just lazy in promotion will fall to the bottom. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBlakMirror Signing Off","name":"t3_3g610x","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-07 21:58:45","week":32}

Yes and No. These platforms optimize through SERPs so that you are more likely to buy what returns. How can they determine what you’ll most likely buy?

{"id":"3g66qd","author":"blakmirror","body":"\nHi, it’s me again, Blakmirror, and most of you know me of me as the Amazon guy.  Well today, I hope you see me as the ecommerce guy.  I am going to open your eyes to the ecommerce marketplace and why it’s easier than over to not only succeed but to dominate in 2015.\n\n;nbsp\n\n\nThe first thing I want you to realize is that ecommerce marketplace give you opportunities to exploit them.  They do this by giving you data, search result pages (every commerce site), reviews (every commerce site), best seller rank (Amazon), Sales History of Sellers (Ebay), etc.  All these pieces of at a can be manipulated in your favor.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nStep 1: The way you present your offer on an ecommerce platform is \nStep 2: Positioning (particularly in the search result pages for product offer) \nStep 3: Of course is the launch or promotion of that product.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll these steps can be optimized and manipulated to directly affect your bottom line. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst I’m going to go into what can be done on all platforms.  Then I’ll break it down to specifics.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first step to every commerce profile is the SEO or the Search Engine Optimization position.  The main thing is people need to find your product when they type it into the marketplaces search box.  SO we use the familiar concept the “keyword” or “keywords” that will describe your product and allow it to be found. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHow do you find keywords? Top of mind analysis, the keyword for “Double A battery” is obviously “Double A Battery.”  But how are people typing that in which way is most popular.  Two ways to confirm:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n1. The search box suggestions \n2. Go to the Internet’s keeper, Google, and use their Adwords tool: Keyword Planner\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThere are also spy tools you can use simple search keyword spy tool [insert marketplace] to see if they are available for your platform. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOnce you find the keywords you’ll place them in your title or tags.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote : Put keywords in your description of the product as well.  Many people forget this and simply list features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe next step is data you can manipulate is reviews.   In this we well also say ratings count as reviews as well.  In going to start by saying, sometimes it’s ok to cheat.  The biggest companies is world fake tests, hire phoney doctors, misquote experience, and hire actors to prove to you their product is the best.  It’s ok for the little guy to do this too.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can hire someone on Fiverr to review or ask friends and family.  There’s nothing wrong with doing this. People need to know your product is good, you can’t contact them personally and vouch for your product.  The ethics here is in the product you sell, be sure you only sell high quality products. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe next demographic in sales history, maybe you can manufacture a few sales with friends and family.  Fiver also has gigs where someone will not only purchase your product but leave a review. Due to budget issues this is limited.  So you have to perform what is known to the internet marketing world as a launch.  You have to present your product to a large number of people, hopefully a targeted audience.  This can be an email list, Facebook Group post, or a Twitter post.  Focus on finding a large number of people who might be interested in what you have to offer.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow We Move to Specifics\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmazon\nMy favorite is Amazon.  This marketplace has been completely cracked.  I you haven’t read my breakdown go here, if you’ve read it before I have added some things so please review: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEbay\nWith Ebay you have to keyword stuff in the title and description of your product or offer.  Now you can manipulate Ebay’s search rankings in the same way you can with Amazon.  You do this through sales history and watchcount. Sales history no difficult but watch count is much easier to manufacture.  Just go Fiverr’s search bar type in “eBay watchers”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe in-demand categories it can still be hard to rank.  There are seller’s selling in iPhone 6 every hour and a IPhone case every two minutes.  So with this you find speed to market is also a shining factor in ecommerce, especially in terms of Ebay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOf course an excellent Ebay html description is also important in Fiver for that as well. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFlippa\nThis site is weird in that the focus is centered on seller history rather than offer specifications in the “starter sites” category.  Again, in this instance sales history is difficult to manipulate.  Flippa’s sap results much like Ebay and Amazon are manipulated through offer listing activity.  Again go to Fiverr and type in “Flippa” and look for gigs that say they’ll increase activity in your listing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nUdemy\nUdemy’s Search Result Pages (SERP) are heavily keyword and activity focused. he best way to bring your course to the top of the SERP is a Free Coupon combined with a promotion from Fiverr.  I don’t want to blow my favorite guy up so DM, for the best traffic gig.  I’ve done them all.  These combined with a course that measures up to your competition in terms of length and perceived value (price), will make you successful in some form.  You should put very good and detailed description and have your course have something extra added, for mine, I have a textbook and exclusive deals with services I mention within the course.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConclusion\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe In-Demand Product\nRealize that though these sites can be exploited.  The responsibility of finding a good offer relies on you.  In terms of physical products, see Watchcount.com or Amazon Top 100-2000, BSRs (see Amazon post for in-depth look at finding products: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/).  For Flippa, you want a good looking site that can be heavily automated. Udemy’s most in-demand courses focus on something with potential for those to earn money like coding, accounting, dropship commerce, and solo ads.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTo the Pessimistic Commenter:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQ1. Hey, why are you telling us this?\nA1. To help you guys out, since m post I have seen a shift in this forum.  You guys are less complex in terms of business ideas, you are focused on low hanging fruit (physical products) which is good for everyone.  Especially, if more people succeed.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nQ2. Doesn’t it defeat your gains saying this?\nA2. No, I don’t have the capital on hand to exploit  every niche so why not share. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nQ3. Can’t these marketplaces read this and change to close the loop? \nQ3. Yes and No. These platforms optimize through SERPs so that you are more likely to buy what returns. How can they determine what you’ll most likely buy?  The common thread amongst all these marketplaces is buyer activity.  Offers who either have had consistent or a burst of reviews, sales activity, watches etc.  It would be a disservice to themselves  and customers to end this activity — optimization because it simply works. The very basics of capitalism the cream will rise top through competition those less innovative with poor product offers or listings, or just lazy in promotion will fall to the bottom. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBlakMirror Signing Off\n","name":"t3_3g66qd","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-08-07 22:39:53","week":32}

Because I don't have inventory at the moment, I'd like to start selling on Amazon WITHOUT FBA to 1) get used to selling on Amazon and 2) give myself a chance to have enough items for FBA to be worth it.\n\nProfit Bandit seems like an amazing app but like we all know, you need a pro merchant account. It seems like for Android, the only option is Amazon Seller.\n\nMy question is what can Profit Bandit do that Amazon Seller can't? Are there any workarounds/good resources to help that? Is there anything that AS is inaccurate about or any important information it doesn't show? I want to make the most use of it until I have FBA but I've heard mixed things so I want to make sure that I have the most options possible.","name":"t3_3g6t1g","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-08 01:39:05","week":32}

Let me ask you all this: if one of your stocks rises over 60% in 2 weeks, do you sell in a hurry, or sell a bit and attempt to ride the rest? One of my thoughts is that this kind of move is rare, so one should take the opportunity to sell while it's hot. But what runs through my head is: what if I miss more big moves, like the NFLX's and AMZN's of the market?\n\nAnd does anyone sell quickly if a stock goes against you?  I've read how \"great\" traders cut their losses quickly, but I don't really get it (stop losses? )  If you use a stop loss and a stock starts to reverse, do you jump back in and go for the momentum?

{"id":"3gda2l","author":"[deleted]","body":"Lately, my husband and I have noticed that our Chase online banking log has gotten increasingly wonky (for lack of a better word). What has started to happen is purchases show up on our account, leading us to believe they've been subtracted from our balance. Then a few days later, when we check back in, we see that the charge has been moved from the original day to a later day, which has thrown off the account balance. (For example: purchased our baby's crib on Amazon, and it showed that the transaction was processed Thursday. Logging in this morning, it now shows it was completed on Friday, which means that we're roughly $200 shorter on Friday than we had expected, since we thought that charge had already been completed.) \n\nI know online banking solutions certainly aren't the best way to track our income and expenses, but I'm having a tough time finding a simple app that will allow us each to input when we're spending and where that leaves our account balance. We've looked at Mint in the past, but since that (from my understanding) is connected to your bank account, I'm worried that we'll have the same issue.\n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation of an app that would be better suited to assisting us in tracking our expenses and income, without relying on the Chase online banking system?

Are these prices meant to undercut competitors or make sure a profit is still made incase Amazon increases the price of an item? Do they increase prices of items?\n\nAlso, some people recommend using an amazon prime account to do this, but apparently it's against their rules and you'll get banned. Do people just.. do this anyway? I look at a lot of the ebay listings that match amazon products and it looks like there's no way they could be making any profit unless they're getting free shipping through Prime or using another sire.\n\nLastly, is using amazon to dropship a good idea in general, or should I just use another site? I wouldn't mind a free site that offers low prices for dropshipping, but that could be wishful thinking. I've checked out 365dropship along with another site that claimed to be free but wanted a $49 one-time fee.\n\n**Edit:** Also, if I don't have prime how can I even calculate shipping?

{"id":"ctpkqsb","author":"Bubbasqueeze","body":"My suggestion is go to FBA fee calculator, and input some books of various sizes and weights around the house to get an understanding of what kind of fees are associated with each book, and at each price point. Personally I find most books have between 8 and 15 dollars in fees depending on how much you are selling it for.   The smallest fee I've seen is about 6 dollars.  \n\nAfter this you must calculate shipping fees.  For myself, I know that each book will cost somewhere in between 2 and 3 dollars a book, so I just round up to 3. (I am Canadian, so my shipping should be a lot more than an Americans.)\n\nAfter that, I give \"charge\" myself .50 cents for things like labels, boxes, monthly fees from amazon.  So far, If I get a book for free, it will need to be valued about 11-15 dollars to break even.  But books aren't free.  I pay between 1.25 and 3 dollars per book.  \n\nGenerally speaking, I will say a small, lightweight book for 1.25 and sell for at least 14 dollars is worth it for me if the rank on Amazon is favorable. \n\nExperience is a great teacher, so do your research and make mistakes.  Just make sure your mistakes are 2 dollar ones, and not 20 dollar ones.

I also conclude that entry barriers are not sufficient to allow Amazon to set monopoly prices. \n\n&gt;Publishers are at risk from Amazon's monopsony (buyer) power and so sought \"agency\" pricing in an effort to raise the price of ebooks, promote retail competition, and reduce Amazon's influence as an e-retailer. (In the agency pricing model, the publisher specifies the retail price with a commission for the retailer. In a traditional, \"wholesale\" pricing model, publishers sell a book to retailers at a wholesale price and retailers set the retail price.) \n\n&gt;Although agency pricing was challenged by the Department of Justice, it may yet prevail in some form as an equilibrium pricing model for e-book sales.","name":"t1_ctq45ik","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-08-03 19:48:47","week":32}

Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. Chase groups similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Chase makes every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in its rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code that falls within that category. Therefore, purchases with that merchant will not qualify for the stated rewards offer on category purchases. Purchases submitted by you or the merchant through third-party payment accounts (e.g. PayPal), mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology (collectively, “Technology”) will not qualify in a rewards category if the Technology is not set up to process the purchase in the rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs. 1% Back: You will earn 1% Back on all other Net Purchases.

Between youtube, coursera, [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx), all the books you can get off Amazon, and the myriad of other resources you can find on the internet you can learn just about anything.  I teach myself new ML stuff from the internet all the time.  Without any CS skills at all, it would be a fairly long hill to climb.  But it is simply a matter of time and dedication. \n\nPractically achieving the goal of getting a high paying in finance, is more complicated however.  It's not that you can't learn the skills that are desired for the job outside of a university, it's that you need the university degree to convince an employer that you have those skills.  Like many high skill positions,  the people hiring for these positions often do not have those skills themselves and need some third party verification that you are qualified. \n\nThis is really only a problem for the first job you get, but it is one of the catch 22s of life that make entering a new field so difficult. My suggestion is to either join a startup that is so desperate for talent that they will pay you (probably very badly) to learn the job or to build a demonstration project of you own that you can show off.  \n\nThe three categories  I mentioned are really your end goals.  To reach those goals you need a decent foundation of stats and CS.  Once you get a little ways in each of these you will have enough base knowledge to  understand what these tools do and begin to make use of them.  \n\nAlso, yes, individuals can most definitely make neural networks.  While the leading edge of this field is very complex the basics are a neural network stunningly simple.

This took literally 60 minutes of my time this weekend.\n\n* Friday night, after drinking with some friends, I went to get on the train and saw a discount beauty store. Turns out that the small chain I normally source clearance from has an outlet they just opened, under another name. I got there right as they were marking $50 eye creams down to $3. Dropped $300 on high-rank, high-margin, discontinued items\n* Saturday morning, went to go try a new breakfast place out and stopped at a multi-family sale we saw along the way. Got BNIP Black &amp; Decker electric scissors for $5 (FBA:$91.95), and a pair each of Dior, Tory Burch, and Toms sunglasses. I was about to drop $100 on Toms sunglasses at Nordstrom, and after I cleaned them on and tried them on my husband said, \"those look really good on you,\" not knowing I intended to keep them. So, it's fate. Flipping the other 2.\n* Sunday morning, we stopped at a rummage sale and I grabbed a Game Cube with 2 stock controllers, all the cords, and 5 games for $5.\n* Sunday afternoon, while catching up on a books shipment (don't like to mix them with beauty as they are dusty and could crush things) I realized that I had a first edition Little Women in my hands, in not-terrible condition. I got it at a church sale in the boonies a few weeks back and didn't think much of it other than that it was cool. I'm going to bring it to a dealer to verify and see what my options are because I have no idea about this stuff, but from what Google shows me, it's the real deal. So that's exciting stuff.\n* I also realized that the Malcolm Gladwell set I bought for $3 a few weeks ago - which sells used for $35 on Amazon - is signed. So I'm going to bring that in, too.

{"id":"ctqk7rx","author":"Jed2Bed","body":"The bonus doesn't change the math.  Since the money is fungible - it doesn't matter where it's coming from and where it's going, and it doesn't have to be spent on the annual fee - you should think of the bonus as a free $175 ($250-first year's fee).  Would you otherwise spend $150 on this card?  If the answer is no, then as soon as the first year is up (since that one's already paid for), call them and downgrade to the no annual fee BCE, thus preserving whatever rewards you have leftover and minimizing the impact to your credit.  And, depending on the math, apply for the Sallie Mae.\n\n&gt; doesn't the 6% cashback help the BCP come out way ahead of the other cards regardless of amount of money spent in the relevant categories?\n\nNo.  As shown in [this chart](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2e7efa/i_made_a_graph_comparing_blue_cash_everyday_blue/), the Sallie Mae Mastercard, which offers 5% on groceries with no annual fee, comes out ahead if you spend less than $3,900/yr in groceries.\n\n------\n\n&gt; I got a targeted offer with a $250 signup bonus.\n\nThat's the best bonus available for this card.  If you're already looking for a credit card, I would take it.  (I got a $250 bonus for the no annual fee BCE.  Didn't have to think twice.)\n\n----\n\nNote: There is one major drawback to the Blue Cash cards.  Rewards can only be redeemed in $25 *increments.*  So if you have $26, you'll have to wait to get another $24 to get that last dollar.  Whereas the Sallie Mae (and every other rewards card) just has a $25 minimum.\n\nOn the plus side, Amex has \"Offers,\" which are basically coupons.  Some of these can be quite profitable if used correctly.  For example, I've gotten \"$20 off $20 on Amazon.com\"  Right now, Amex is running a promo for their new Express checkout that's worth ~$20 in free money.  Google for more.\n\n\nEDIT: You should check if you're \"prequalified\" for any other (better) offers from Amex here: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/tools/25330#!view-your-prequalified-offers\n\nGenerally speaking, once you get your first Amex card, they stop sending you offers, so if you've got multiple good offers (this one + 50K points for the Premier Rewards Gold, worth at least $500), and you're game for this, you should get both.  You can get 1 (revolving) credit card and 1 charge cards (can't carry balance) in one day.  I have successfully applied and been auto-approved for a BCE and PRG within 5 minutes of each other online.","name":"t1_ctqk7rx","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-04 02:44:49","week":32}

{"id":"ctqviwz","author":"brokenshoelaces","body":"I'm a software engineer, and I think a lot of coding jobs ARE going to dry up.  Not the high end jobs at places like Facebook or Google or Amazon, there's more demand there than ever.  But the shift towards permanent connectivity and the cloud has definitely reduced the demand for \"IT\" jobs like system administration.  It's also removed a lot of duplication now that platforms like the web and mobile apps can reach billions of people.\n\nIn the future, however, even some of the higher end programming jobs may become obsolete.  Instead of having an army of people hand code some system, you'll just plug some data into a deep neural network, or whatever the latest AI technology is, and have it solve your problem.  This is already starting - technology like image or speech recognition used to be done with all kinds of hand-coded algorithms by people with PhD's in different disciplines.  Now you just feed a set of data into a black box and magic happens.\n\nWe'll still need a lot of \"programmers\" for the next decade or two, but they're going to spend less and less time writing code; it'll be more just connecting different black boxes running on AWS together.  AI isn't that far from a point where simple programs will be able to be automatically generated from natural language descriptions.  What's more, the kind of problems we're using computers to solve are increasingly of the AI flavor.  The world's programmers aren't just rewriting the same software over and over (maybe a fraction are); they're leveraging progress to work on increasingly more complex things, most of which will eventually be done by an AI because the algorithms required are beyond what a human is capable of hand coding.  We even might use AI to design the AI (humans may simply not be capable of figuring out the best way to wire a NN, say, for a particular problem).\n\nIt's not obvious to me that we'll need tens of millions of people doing this job any more.  There is only so much human creativity needed (witness the hundreds of SV startups over the past five years building yet another social network, or yet another mobile app nobody needs, most of which never created any value).","name":"t1_ctqviwz","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-08-04 09:29:41","week":32}

{"id":"ctqxoj2","author":"theabhig","body":"I can't remember which site it was, but I read an article a while ago about a pretty high traffic website where they let the content creators use their own AdSense code/affiliate links. I think the site in question was 9to5mac or something similar. It's a good way to incentivise writers to write quality content, but there are risks associated as well. Just wish i could find the damn article again!\n\nYes you can put in unlimited links to Amazon.\n\nIf your affiliate links are for amazon.ca, then visitors will be directed there. The best way around this is to sign up for the main AMazon Associates programs - Canada, USA, Australia, UK, maybe a couple of other English speaking ones. And use a plugin so that it redirects to the visitors 'native' Amazon. Something like EasyAzon.  Amazon Associates doesn't automatically send users to their local version.\n\nGoogle pay out monthly, as long as your account balance is over their threshold - I know in the UK it's £60.\n\nAmazon do the same - but it's your account balance for each separate associates account for each country. So I'd set your thresholds for overseas ones much higher to minimise the % you lose in currency conversion fees.\n\nExample: I'm in the UK and have an Amazon site. My Amazon UK threshold is set to the default £100. My Amazon.com one, I've set to US$300 instead of 100 as my bank charges a fixed £15 fee for converting currency. £15 out of $100 is a lot less than £15 out of $300.\n\nHope that helps. My typing is a bit scattered - typing from phone!

With my top selling E-cig products, the majority of sales are coming through affiliates where I only net 10%. I'm already competing against million dollar companies that are competing against each other so I'm not too concerned about larger competitors filing the space as I feel that has already happened.. The only reason I am even able to compete with them in the first place is because I am getting the same pricing as them on the few products I heavily concentrate on. Because these companies are competing against each other, they have already pushed the prices down literally as low as possible.  The margins were INCREDIBLY better when I first started selling these products. \n\nI definitely agree 100% it requires significant capital to scale which is why I've considered selling it.

{"id":"ctrguil","author":"granto","body":"Hi Chad, Grant here from [EcomCrew](http://ecomcrew.com). Funny, we just signed up for a trial of Skubana last night. While we currently use Stitch, we are looking to swap as Stitch doesn't seem have custom export abilities to integrate with our 3PL shipper that uses FTP. I found Skubana through your PPC campaign and I've ran trials of SellBrite, Ordoro, OrderHive and Channel Unity. Everyone seems to have one major factor missing or is ahead on everyone else in a main area. Though I only poked around Skubana, I want to say you seem to have the features we need. The UI/UX is a little bit clunky, but not bad.\n\nThe main pain points that I see for SME ecommerce operators are:\n\n* Inventory\n* Channel management tools\n* Accounting\n\nSkubana and other ERP platforms are addressing the inventory issues for the most part. Channel management seems hit or miss because while everyone is able to correctly get accurate stock counts to prevent over/underselling and incorporating with shipping, the big issues are always when things don't go according to plan. Returns, shipping errors, etc. Those always seem to be dismissed, even though those are among the most time consuming issues. \n\nThe other issue is simply having listing tools for each channel. Ebay, for example, is a disaster of a listing platform out of the box. Every major seller uses specialized tools. Playing around with multiple ERP platforms, sure, most of them can hook into existing listings and update inventory, but it still requires the operator to have another suite just to manage or create listings and then there might be conflict, sync issues or just extra work. For what it's worth, SellBrite and Channel Unity have fairly well developed listing tools, but most other platforms just have basic or ugly listing abilities.\n\nThe main functionality I (and many owners) want is cohesive tie in to accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero). While I can certainly understand if you want to go after the mid market, where companies are large enough that there are dedicated bookkeepers, a huge portion of the smaller or developing market is going to be off-put by the lack of accounting integration. In fact, I believe there's a market for a SaaS app solely dedicated to ecommerce or Amazon accounting. \n\nSkubana seems like it has potential and you certainly aren't short of competition, so best of luck with the project. I'll be looking forward to poking around more in the platform.\n\n**Edit** Chad was nice enough to take time out of his day to give me a call directly. We spoke at length about a lot of the upcoming features and how they're already on the ball on getting them into the next release, especially accounting and listing functionality. Always a nice touch to hear directly from the boss!","name":"t1_ctrguil","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-04 21:51:00","week":32}

{"id":"ctrgxkq","author":"lejialus","body":"If you don't want to invest the time, there are various apps/sites that will give you money for advertisements/information. These obvious don't make as much as the active earning apps/sites, but nothing in life is truly free, is it? Let me list some examples in case you're interested (and for shameless self endorsement).\n\n\n* Mobile Performance Meter: These earn you 5 - 20 cents (to my knowledge, I'm at 5) per day in exchange for you becoming a walking beacon. You provide information (which is this case isn't very personal, so at the low end of the risk spectrum) in exchange for cash, simple as that. 5 dollar minimum cashout.\n\n* Link: [Non-ref](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?\nid=com.embeepay.mpm&amp;hl=en)\n\n* Panel App: Slightly higher up on the risk factor, but generally a trusted app. They use location data for \"analytics and reporting\". I doubt your location will be used for anything harmful as they have thousands of panelists. Earnings vary as I can only see how much one can earn from their \"projected year estimate\", but the estimate has been around 20-25 dollars (12,000 to 17,000 points) a year (redeeming uses less points per dollar as you pick bigger cashouts, so may vary more). So my guesstimate is about 4 cents to 7 cents a day, depending how long you wait to cash out. 1 dollar minimum cashout (1500 points), or can enter sweepstakes for less.\n\n\n* Link: [Ref](http://www.placed.com/panel/panels/711b0c40f1da/signup?rid=6cd68be750c6)/[Non-ref](https://www.placed.com/panel-app)\n\n* Media Insiders Mobile: I find this app a bit more shady, but I use it as it seems somewhat trusted. Apparently they track \"sharing, viewing, clicking, chatting, downloading and more\". It works just like the other panels, with passive earnings. HOWEVER you can earn more by using their vpn on your computer and cell phone (I don't do this because it drains battery and requires some more active input, also seems a bit shady). I would recommend just the passive earnings, but hey, whatever floats your boat man. You get 50 points week to my knowledge passively (haven't been using it long), but can earn more. Each point is one cent, and 5 dollar minimum cashout (Amazon, paypal is 25)\n\n* Link: [Non-ref](https://mediainsiders.com/)\n\n* Free Eats: Use if you have free texting. The app collaborates with advertisers to send you texts that instantly grant you 25 cents or more onto your PayPal account per text. Also wonderful is that you get an instant 1 dollar per referral which the referree also gets. The texts don't happen as often as one might like, but passive money is passive money, and no minimum cashout/no active cashout is a godsend. There is literally no effort unless you plan to refer people, and the occasional survey.\n\n* Link: [Ref](http://ftr.io/r/GTKYTX91)/[Non-ref](https://www.freeeats.com/signup)\n\n* Datacoup: You can provide your social network information as well as debit/credit information to make earnings each week. The amount you get depends on both the amount and value of data you provide. They are very open with what data gets provided for each thing you opt in for (facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc) so you you should at least check it out. I get 1.50 ish a week, I don't know how much you can make. Cash out goes to your card and minimum is 1 dollar.\n\n* Link: [Non-ref](https://datacoup.com/signup)\n\n* Screenwise Panel: Run by Google, the app tracks data (searches and app data) on select devices (up to a computer, smartphone, and pad). You get 1 to 3 dollars a week, depending on how many devices you have connected. I read somewhere \"Google tracks you anyways, why not get paid for it\" and it has stuck in my mind for a good time. Why not. Minimum cash out is 25 dollars.\n\n* Link: [Non-ref](https://www.screenwisetrends.com/)\n\n* Drizzle SMS: If you've been frequenting this subreddit recently you probably heard of this app. It's a new app that gives money for  texting and being texted. You don't get credits for unknown numbers (I was frequently texting with an unadded person regarding housing/lease). Minimum cash out is 5$, but I'm not yet sure how fast the average person might earn.\n\n* Link [Ref](https://bnc.lt/m/a0ilp4CDDl)/[Non-ref](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.grovecity.drizzlesms)\n* Other passive earning methods (that I'm not signed up for or not approved): Nielsen Mobile, Appoptrix, etc (feel like I forgot some)\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFurthermore some people might consider semi-passive video apps like PerkTV and Checkpoints, lockscreen apps like Adme/Fronto/Slidejoy, software that \"borrows\" computing power like Slicify/Gomez Peer, autosurfers like Ebesucher/Hitleap, and games like Peko and maybe perhaps Bing botting (risky if multiple accounts).

{"id":"ctrirg4","author":"Playdoughed","body":"As long as you have documentation that you instructed Amazon to make payment to the Corp's account in June and Amazon disregarded the instruction, I would argue (with an IRS agent) that the June payment was made to you as a nominee for the S Corporation.  In that case you would report the entire Form 1099 on your Schedule C and then have a negative line item for 'Nominee: [Enter name of S Corporation here] income erroneously received'.\n\nI would have your ducks in a row in your tax papers - have the correspondence between you and Amazon regarding the change and any follow up when the payment was made incorrectly.  Now, if the filing error was on your part (you just forgot to file the forms), it might be a little bit more difficult to convince an IRS agent that the June payment was made in error. \n\nLet's look at the overall tax implication in this situation.  I'm going to make up numbers and you can see what the impact is based on my numbers.  Then you can extrapolate that to your numbers.\n\nWe're going to pretend you receive $1,000 a month in royalties.  You are going to pay yourself a salary of $200 a month.  In Q1 and Q2 you would have received $6,000 of royalties to you personally (Jan - Jun payment).  In Jul you've received $1,000 to the S Corp and paid yourself a salary of $200.  According to my calculation (because I can't figure out how to do a grid) your tax will be around $950. If you end up transferring that $1,000 to June (and assuming you had paid yourself the $200 salary in June) your tax will be around $825.\n\nThis is a quick and dirty calculation but you can see how much of a difference it will make by plugging in your own numbers and taking into account your own tax situation (for example, do you have a full-time job that will max out your Social Security Taxes?)\n\n   ","name":"t1_ctrirg4","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-04 22:36:22","week":32}

{"id":"ctrwnys","author":"IsNotANovelty","body":"&gt;An all purpose card with high cash back. (zero fee)\n\nThat blog post on the Fidelity Amex being a (potentially) 3% card might just be the dumbest thing I've ever read.  It's saying you can use the [Saver's Credit](http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-Retirement-Savings-Contributions-Credit-\\(Saver%E2%80%99s-Credit\\)) to achieve this.  If you make less than $18,250, you are eligible to receive a 50% tax credit on **any** money you contribute to a retirement account.  The takeaways here:\n\n* It isn't limited to the Fidelity Amex. If you qualify for the Saver's Credit, you could take your cash back from any other card (like the Citi DoubleCash you mentioned) put it into an IRA, and get the same benefit.\n* If you are making less than $18,250, you probably shouldn't be churning or stashing too much into an IRA.\n* Full-time students (like a grad student) are ineligible for the Saver's Credit in any case.\n\nNow that we're on the same page that the Fidelity Amex is just a 2% card, it's still a decent choice for everyday spend if you want the cashback put into a Fidelity account.  Personally, between the two, I'd go with the Citi DoubleCash because I'd rather be able to do whatever I want with the cashback rather than be forced to put it in a Fidelity account.\n\nBut above both I'd get the [Discover It](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/index.html) card.  It is similar to the [Chase Freedom](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom?jp_cmp=cc/freedom/off/na/multiple) in that it is a 1% everything, 5% rotating quarterly category (gas, groceries, restaurants, online shopping all have been categories) card, but the big perk is that for your first year, all cashback is doubled.  So it becomes a 2% everything, 10% rotating quarterly category card for the first year, which is awesome, and it is still a useful card (with no FTF and no AF) once the first year ends.  You also have access to Discover Deals, which give additional cashback at various retailers (which is also doubled for the first year).  It currently doesn't have a sign-up bonus, but you can use a referral link to get $50 upon first purchase (possibly doubled? YMMV).\n\n&gt; A card for groceries/gas (zero fee)\n\n&gt;A card for Amazon (zero fee)\n\nYep, the Sallie Mae is what you want.  5% on up to $250/month groceries, $250/month gas, $750/month Amazon (or other \"bookstores\").  I have it and love it.  Though currently I'm using my Discover It for Amazon which is getting me 10% back this quarter.\n\n&gt; A card for dining (zero fee)\n\nThe Chase AARP doesn't really make sense to me.  It's not worth another hard pull with no sign-up bonus to get an extra 1% over your everyday 2% card.  So you have two options:\n\n* Is most of your dining fast food (including semi-fast like Chipotle, Panera, etc)?  If so, you might want to look into the [US Bank Cash+](https://www.usbank.com/splash/credit-cards/cash-plus/aff/index.html) card which lets you choose two 5% categories to use each quarter.  One is fast food (includes places like I mentioned above and others).  It also lets you choose one 2% category, one of which is restaurants.  I use this card as my dining card by choosing fast food as 5% every quarter and restaurants as 2% every quarter and using it every time I go out to eat.  That way I don't have to worry about whether the place is coded as fast food or not, because I'm at least getting 2%.\n\n* Otherwise, I'd just stick with your 2% everyday spend card.  If you have the Discover It, then 1 quarter you will get 5% back on dining anyway.  If you have the Chase Freedom as well, that's usually another quarter as well (though sometimes the quarters overlap).\n\nI would recommend the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred-card.aspx), which is a great travel card, gives you 2x UR points for dining (1UR point &gt; $0.01 when redeemed for travel) and comes with a 40,000 UR sign-up bonus, but it has a $95 AF (waived for the first year).\n\n&gt;A card that works internationally well (chip/pin, no YF, no FTF, accepted widely)\n\nYes, the Quicksilver will fit your needs.  Discover It has no FTF, but I'm not sure on acceptance (though I know Discover is more popular than Visa/MC in China if you will be going there).\n\nBut here is where you're killing all of us at /r/churning.  Even if you won't use the benefits of a travel card with an annual fee AT ALL, the sign-up bonus is usually worth the annual fee several times over.  For example, a great public offer available to you is the 50,000MR after $1,000 spend offer for the [American Express PRG](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/premier-rewards-gold/25330?linknav=ProspectHP-MostPopular-PRG-LearnMore).  It has a $195 annual fee which is waived the first year.  You can cancel the card after the first year if you want and never pay it.  The 50,000 MR points are worth, at a minimum, $500 if redeemed for gift cards.  Usually upwards of $1,000 if redeemed for travel.  It also has a $100 airline credit.  Fly at least once a year?  Then the effective annual fee is now $95.  Combine that with Amex offers, 2x points on gas/grocery/dining, 3x points on airfare, the annual fee pretty much pays for itself.  Or, like I said, take the $500-$1,000 in free money and cancel the card after a year before the annual fee hits.","name":"t1_ctrwnys","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-05 05:00:10","week":32}

We actually built a Bright Pearl module to link directly into BigCommerce for a particular project with Treadmill.com, but that was another story.\n\nOnce we brought in Amazon and things got a little crazy, we added Stitch to the equation: BigCommerce + Amazon -&gt; Stitch -&gt; Shipstation. \n\nNow're slowly creeping past that with 3PL, like yourself, so a custom export has to work. Ship Station doesn't have that ability out of the box, so that is immediately out of the question to use that in an app stack. At the $1MM revenue it might make sense to just write a custom API hook to export as necessary, but I hate having those vulnerable chains. Stitch and Sellbrite are pretty close and don't really do 3PL. Trade Gecko seems to have some 3PL support, Solid Commerce does exports and I believe Order Hive didn't have even multi warehouses or something major. \n\nSkubana did have a lot of options for 3PL and multi-warehouses and even warehouse shipping logic, which is the first that I've seen.

{"id":"ctsa227","author":"Percussivist","body":"First, what is the purpose of trying to minimize cards? Perhaps the benefit in keeping all doors open and not setting such a constraint (unless you've got a really well defined reason like \"I have a lethal plastic allergy induced by having more than 4 credit cards at once\") outweights the con of having a few extra cards. Remember, pros include greater category bonus optimization, improved credit score from reduction in CL utilization, etc etc.\n\nWhen I got my It card when I already had a Discover More, I was denied, and they let me reduce my More credit limit to open the It. You could keep the same number of cards by offering to close your current card to open the It.\n\nRegarding AMEX GC's. There are guides (thefrequentmiler) out there on how to buy AMEX gift cards. Basically, you go through a cashback portal that pays (recently) 2.25% for purchase of them. You pay with a 2% cashback card. You're getting way better than 4% on whatever you buy with these cards (which are generally accepted where AMEX is).\n\nI suppose the Capital One 3 bureau pull wouldn't really be of concern to someone who isn't concerned about additional approvals down the road. It won't be too bad for your credit, but having a pull on every bureau guarantees your next credit application reveals a pull.\n\nBCP is worth, to me, because there are plenty of ways to increase your spending at grocery stores. Gift Cards.\nAnd AMEX cards come with profitable opportunities that you've got to consider along with the simple annual fee/category return calculation. I've earned $315 in statement credits in the past 12 months for Twitter sync deals on my BCP alone (and authorized user card), Small Business Saturday, and AMEX offers. Lets call it about $280-300 when accounting for gift card fees. That said, I'm going to explore the Sallie Mae card for its 5x Amazon benefit! (though 5x at Amazon can come in the form of more valuable Chase UR points buying gift cards at office supply stores).\n\nFree AU cards with independent numbers that can double your opportunity when these deals come around.

For my household this will likely result in drastically reduced spending on Amazon.","name":"t1_ctsgwed","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-08-05 18:41:26","week":32}

This article discusses what cloud computing is, how it came about and is used today, and the impact that it has had on Information and Communication Technology.\nCloud computing involves three layers: infrastructure, platform, and software.  This is helpful for firms who cannot afford to implement a global scale infrastructure like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.\nA large part of the article is dedicated to discussing how cloud computing was once scarce and expensive, and now is abundant and cheap.  This is partly due to the decoupling of hardware and software.  Additionally, the fundamental shift in computing power has contributed to this as well. \nIt also raises questions and issues in cloud computing such as policies, liability, and security and privacy.

It is a thing and it can be done, but:\n\n- There are a Lot of people in this space, most products we carry we spend no less than 30-50k per order, some much higher. So if your goal is to buy white label cheaper than everyone else and sell them, you better have a lot of money to invest. The people selling on Amazon are not as small as you might think.\n\n- Amazon and eBay is where you will make the least amount of money. You are in direct competition with a million other sellers, who spend all day profiling other sellers to find their best selling products then sell them for less. You will get caught up in price wars that will make pennies on the dollar, or a loss.\n\n- When you sell on Amazon, Amazon makes the rules. \n\n- No one knows who you are. Our stores are very well branded, with thousands of hours dedicated into advertising and building a customer base. Our customers know exactly who we are and refer to us by name. That makes our brand valuable even when we are selling generics. So when the time comes I can pass the brand name to the next generation or sell it and retire,brand yourself properly and your business will have a much higher value. \n\n- Lots of manufactures will not talk to you if you just sell on market places\n\nYou can make it work on Amazon, consider creating a website on the side with a specific niche, then put promotional material in your boxes so you can pull customers off the river and into your own store where you make money. Your best bet is to really brand yourself so people know and respect you, repeat business is so very important to long term success.  \n\n","name":"t1_ctsvrtc","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-06 00:26:52","week":32}

{"id":"ctswpdt","author":"2goodeyestoo","body":"I would like to share my experiences with you at the goodwill outlet. During my thrifting career I have patronized five gwos: Columbia,  SC ; one in Delaware and the three here in Maryland. One of them I go into Maryland, I have found a brand new nickel brush shower kit sealed, nib thumper massager sport both for $4 a piece, lots of brand new toys,  nib Winter Fantasy Barbie,  crayola make your own paint, a couple of brand new vtech systems for the kids, a vintage gucci bag, lots of handheld tools for my dad for about a nickel or dime a piece I am talking about craftsman and snap on. I found a iroomba, working for $1. I have a trunk full of brand new toys that would probably sell on Amazon for $700, but I paid $40, I will send them to my nephews and nieces for Christmas. Someone claimed to have found an authentic Chanel bag a couple of months ago. As much as I love ts and the gwo I do not buy used plates, cups or dishes and I know there is soap and water.\n\nWhen people say they do not live near one, I feel bad for them because to me it is an awesome experience. Maryland has wonderful thrifts in this area, not just gwos, but others and that may be we have a lot of government workers close by. I know for a fact one of the goodwill outlets I go to have people come regularly from Virginia,  new Jersey and Pennsylvania and there are gwos in all three of those states. \nI would suggest if you want to do well at the outlets you may have to barter or trade some stuff you find with your fellow shoppers. I am not sure that you will be able to do this since, you are doing a one time visit.\n\nFor example is I found a pregnant gwo shopper a Balboa shopping cart cover nib that sells at Target for $50, she probably paid $1, no she did not have anything I wanted, but a male shopper gave me an all clad oven thermometer nib. I found one of the dealers Adobe photoshops and he has given me several nice things. I notice that when I have given some people stuff they were looking for, they were in turn able to tell another shopper to give me something I wanted: I found a pair of black leather Prada shoes and somebody convinced another shopper to give me a Karoke nib.\nI only go to one gwo here in Maryland, yes, I have seen people get into arguments over stuff or wares, but this one to me seems to get better merchandise, I think it may be they have additional space to store merchandise. This gwo normally charges per piece and not per pound, they have small grocery store scales, but not shopping cart scales.","name":"t1_ctswpdt","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-06 00:50:47","week":32}

Just because you CAN get approved, doesn’t mean you SHOULD. I occasionally take a beating for saying this, but I will stick by my guns here. If you don’t have an established credit history or you are below a 720, you should not be applying for a credit card every month.\n\nI got my first reward card (Southwest Premier) in February with an EQ of 618.  I got the US Airways card the next month with a TU of 625.  Since then, I've gotten: Club Carlson, Quicksilver, Citi AA Plat, Southwest Plus, Discover It, Amazon Store Card, Amex BRG, Wyndham, and Venture.  My real FICO scores from two days ago are EX 686, TU 695, and EQ 671---and they will all go up soon.\n\nSo, churning has been a great benefit to my credit scores, and my low scores really didn't stop me.

I would just say that churning is much harder when your credit score is lower, and you need to really do your homework.  And whatever factors caused you to have the low score in the first place need to be gone.  If your score is low because you don't have the basic ability to manage money, then don't churn.

Not the $1200, yet.\n\nAmazon is really $96/year. Dump Amazon, and keep Netflix. I know the college savings plan is a really good idea, but you can't afford your own college at the moment, and it doesn't make much sense to pay towards your children's school while you still owe $115k for your own school.

{"id":"ctty70i","author":"chadrubin","body":"Started shipping out of my apartment on the Upper West Side of NYC. Ran out of space and moved on up to East Harlem with a storage space. When I first saw the space, I never thought I would grow out of it. In just a couple months, it was bursting by the seams. Then we moved to a flex office/warehouse space in NJ. Throughout this process, I struggled to manage my inventory that I sell across all the marketplaces and shopping carts I sell on. If I sell a product on Amazon, Amazon doesn't go and tell Ebay (their competitor) to deduct inventory. \n\nI tried implementing various tools that claim to solve for this problem. Many are entry level solutions for small sellers. Their platforms are not robust enough to handle high order volumes because they are built on inferior technologies. They make a lot of claims, but when taking the demo, you'll quickly find they do very little of what they say.  In fact, some of their claims are flat-out lies, which is sadly not uncommon in the e-commerce space because it's not well-regulated so software providers can make outlandish claims.\n\nA prime example of this that they claim that you you can \"Ship\" from their solutions, which actually just means that you can \"mark\" an order as shipped, and that is absolutely pointless.  You still need a 3rd party shipping program to actually process orders. They also don't have support for 3PLs, kitting and bundling, multiple warehouses, etc.  \n\nThere are many other products out there that could be \"strung together\" to emulate the type of service I needed, but the cost and \"bulkiness\" of piecing such products together is impractical and uneconomical, not to mention it would fail to deliver the single-point system myself and many sellers like me need.\n\nI tried to build something by hiring overseas developers - HUGE mistake and thousands of dollars lost. I then sent an email in search of an enterprise developer to a bunch of friends from UMASS Amherst, where I went to college. I was introduce to DJ through a mutual friend. We did demos with every potential \"competitor\" as he couldn't believe that this problem existed.  \n\nThus, Skubana was born to fill this void -- a single-point Cloud ERP with fulfillment capabilities built for e-commerce sellers.\n\nSo our value prop remains - disruptive price, best in class solution, all-in-one, no limit to order volume, completely on the cloud, no custom development. \n","name":"t1_ctty70i","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-06 21:43:43","week":32}

It was a little overkill for our next project, so we could do without the $3K/yr licensing fees and custom code maintenance. They seemed pretty industrial though and really geared toward mid-level and manufacturing .\n\nWe use FBA for a variety of things, but mainly for direct Amazon sales. The bad thing about FBA (and I mean really bad) is that you have zero idea where you need to ship your goods for FBA. If you create a product, they could have you ship it to Virginia, California, Nevada, South Carolina, who knows where. Or worse, you could be forced to split your shipment into multiple locations. There are settings (inventory placement) to force all similar SKUs to go into one location, but then you pay a fee that is fairly high. Basically, your inventory can seriously take a cross country trip 3 times and there goes your margins. Not always, but it's not made for heavy or large items at all. Light items and you're probably ok. \n\nThe other thing about FBA is that while they are generally efficient, they don't pack as well as they can. You also are at the mercy of FBA support, which is amazing and awful at the same time. Long term storage fees are awful, so just make sure your inventory rotates every 6 months or else it will be pain day. \n\nFor your Xero goal, I can't quite answer that unfortunately. I just use Excel to dally all my numbers up. Mainly I just figure my ROAS on Adwords and then COGS separately and go from there. Obviously you don't want some big winners subsidizing small losers, but you're going to need to serious Adwords API tools to get there. \n\n","name":"t1_ctu6xo9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-07 01:25:01","week":32}

You can rack up 3 in a row, really quick.  Many times, they are glitchy surveys that only last 1-2 minutes.\n\nTake your surveys ASAP.  If you wait too long, they are replaced with a another survey and you miss out on that one's 500 pts.\n\nAlthough, it hasn't happened recently, sometimes the surveys don't credit.  So, make sure by looking at your history.  A quick e-mail to support fixes this.\n\nI give my surveys very high ratings at the end, and maybe that's why I get one every other day, if not every day.\n\nSet your survey frequency to 'as often as possible' in 'My Settings'.\n\nWalgreens/CVS seem like the best rewards: 30K pts for $25.

It can be done, but it is hard.\n\nIf you are starting at the beginning, Amazon has loads of beginner books.  If you are in college, by all means, take as many accounting classes as you can (at least 12 hours).  If you have some understanding and want more, Amazon sells college textbooks that are 1 to 2 editions out of date for only pennies.  If you have some college level understanding, then just start reading financial statement.  Then read a lot more financial statements.  Every industry has their accounting quirks.

When I sell something, I calculate my profit using finalfeecalculator.com and I transfer my profits from PayPal biweekly for eBay sales.  This website allows you to account for eBay Store and TRS discounts.  I have both but I do not factor those discounts.  Instead, the discounts and original purchase price of the item stay in my PayPal account.  This adds up and I am able to buy other stuff for myself or the occasional flip item.  I take my profit amount that was calculated and I put 50% in cash for flipping funds and 50% into personal debt or emergency fund.  For Amazon sales, I use small amounts of sales to use my debit card at thrift stores.  If I have a good week on Amazon then the same 50/50 rule is applied but I don't take out the original purchase price.  Sometimes I will put 50% into flipping, 25% into debt/saving and 25% into personal cash to use at festivals and such with the family.

{"id":"ctwwslz","author":"takeandbake","body":"I've done medical tourism, including in TJ.\n\nA decent book about medical tourism is the book \"Beauty from Afar\", it focuses on cosmetic stuff but it has good overall advice for seeking medical care outside of your home country. If you find that book on Amazon, you'll see similar recommended books which you can get from your local library or buy online.\n\nThat said, if you can find a way to afford your medical insurance in the US, I recommend doing so.  Paying for the cost of a physical exam and screening labs is negligible compared to what you'll face if you fall down some stairs and break your leg.  Health insurance is more important for the big stuff instead of the little stuff.","name":"t1_ctwwslz","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-09 17:03:21","week":32}

{"id":"ctx14x0","author":"OhKaybeee","body":"As I said,  I was unaware of Amazon prime automatically renewing it's subscription,  I had signed up for the six month free trial, that's what first overdrafts my account.  My gym told me about a one time $40 fee but didn't mention the $20 fee for the month would also be taken out. I had extra money in my account that wasn't there for bills,  which I have been paying diligently for three years and I haven't overdrafted unknowingly until I opened a savings account.  If I overdraft or run out of money in my checking account,  my debit card doesn't work anymore. My debit card kept working even though I overdrafted my account.  I always balance my checkbook.  This is a young woman who opened her first checking account at 21 and wasn't aware that this could happen.  So yeah,  stop being a dick please.

{"id":"ctx16kg","author":"bravokiloromeo","body":"I have several cards that give me a variety of rewards (I go for cash back):\n\nCapital One Quicksilver - flat 1.5% cash back, no foreign exchange fees.\n\nChase Amazon Visa - 3% back on Amazon purchases (of which I make many); can redeem points as a credit to a checking account (better than redeeming on Amazon).\n\nChase Sapphire - 2% back on restaurants.\n\nAmex Blue Cash Preferred - 6% on groceries, 3% on gas &amp; department stores; $75 annual fee is worth it since I buy so many groceries (I usually make ~$20/mo in cash back).\n\nDiscover It - got this most for the FICO reporting; the rotating 5% categories are pretty good though. \n\n\nOverall, I think something like the Quicksilver or the Discover It are going to be great, easy to obtain cards for a college-age student, and they don't have fees and offer pretty decent rewards. The Quicksilver is also one of the few no annual fee cards that has no foreign fees, which is great if you're looking to travel abroad anytime soon.
