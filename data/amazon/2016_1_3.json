I've spent the weekend calculating my finances for you all in hopes you can help me or at least point me in the right direction. I think we've done a good job saving, but I'm really am unsure exactly how well we are doing, especially for some big next steps:\n\n\n* Need a 2nd car (new job so can no longer car pool)\n* Buy a house (need more room to start a family)\n* Start having kids!\n\n#Questions\n\n* **Overall**: How well am I doing (compared to others with similar income/situation)?\n* **Car**: I need to buy a 2nd car. I'm looking at something in the range of 18-27k. (need something reliable for 1hr each way in the snow, so looking at a pre-owned RAV4) Based on the details below, should I pay cash (knowing I'm going to buy a house [see below] - or finance for 1.9-2.7%? Can I even afford a second car in this price range?\n* **House** We are looking to buy a house. We are thinking we can afford around $300,000 with 20% $60k down, taken from our savings. $300k is on the low side in eastern Massachusetts, but I don't really want to spend more. What could we really afford, low and high end?\n* **Savings?** Car ($25k) + Down Payment (60k) + Closing/Moving Expenses (20k) Could nearly deplete our savings and I'm terrified by this.\n* **Other**: Any other advice?\n\nThanks so much in advance!

{"id":"41k0io","author":"in_debt_forever","body":"Hello!\nSo I have amassed $10,700 in credit card debt with 4 credit cards. I make $754 every two weeks for a total of $1508 (after taxes). \nHere is what I pay every month...(all minimum payments except for rent/utilities)\n\n$48 for Chase card (0% introductory until 11-12-16, the 19.24% after)\n\n$25 for Amazon Store card (0% on 1 purchase until 4-12-16 / 0% on 1 purchase until 6-12-16, then 25.99%)\n\n$48 for Discover card (15.24% interest)\n\n$15 for Capital One card (19.80% interest)\n\n$409 for auto loan ($15,966 left at 4.44%)\n\nAround $520 for rent\n\nAround $60 (winter) and $80 (summer) for utilities\n\n$30 for gas and $60 to $70 on groceries a week.\n\nI have exactly $1,001 in my bank account.\n\nI finally had a wake up call, a slap in the face yesterday when one of my credit cards was declined. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I Finally realized I cannot borrow money for free and that eventually it will come bite me in the rear. I use to only have 2 credit cards with one being used and the other one as emergency. I would pay on time with the full balance, always being careful at what I spent. I finally know what it's like to have that sickly feeling in your gut... to be truly worried and disgusted. \n\nHow bad is this? Have I dug myself in too deep of a hole? \nWhere should I go from here...? Should I get a personal loan at lower interest to pay off the credit card debt? My credit score is 691 so I'm not sure what kind of rates they would give me. Any advice would be appreciated.  \n\n*edit - so I am definitely freezing/ stopping my credit card usage and toning down my grocery usage...wherever I can save. Still not sure if I should get a personal loan to get rid of the CC debt. Will sleep on it.*\n  ","name":"t3_41k0io","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-18 18:45:20","week":3}

{"id":"41k9l6","author":"traaafff","body":"Okay, so I read through the rules and wikis, so hopefully everything here is kosher. Please let me know if I missed anything! I made this plan based on what I've read and learned here, but I'm kinda nervous about the follow-through. My husband and I have a \"separate but equal\" financial arrangement. We have our personal bills we're individually responsible for and our household bills &amp; expenses that we roughly split between us based on our individual incomes. Thankfully, I don't have a huge amount of debt; however, my husband makes about twice what I do, so I'd like to be able to carry my weight a bit more by paying off this debt as soon as possible. \n\n**Monthly Income**\n\nTake-home pay - Minimum $1,612, averages around $2,200.\n\nRoyalty income - ~$50\n\n**Current Accounts**\n\n\nChecking Acct 1 - $1,760.17\n\nChecking Acct 2 - $607.50\n\nSavings - $2175.10 ($60/week automatically goes into savings)\n\n**Debt - Outstanding Balances**\n\nCredit Card 1 - $1,175.61 @ 15.65% APR\n\nCredit Card 2 - $934.01 @ 0.0% APR (ten months)\n\n\nStudent Loan 1 - $2,728.47 @ 5.75%\n\nStudent Loan 2 - $1,731.59 @ 4.25%\n\n*Student loans are consolidated into one payment through Mohela.*\n\n**Monthly Expenditures**\n\nEntertainment (Hulu, Netflix, Spotify) - $30\n\nStudent Loans - $150 (min required $70)\n\nCredit Cards - between $150-300, depending on income\n\nCell Phone - $144\n\nInternet - $45\n\nGas - $45 (we share a car, so this is total for both of us)\n\nFood/Household Items/Misc. - $400-500 (taking big steps to lower this)\n\n**More Info &amp; Game Plan**\n\nMy job is commission-structured, so my income varies and that impacts how much I pay towards what. I've been focusing on increasing my savings for this reason (you never know how good/bad a month will be). My every day spending is done on a Chase Amazon credit card paid off weekly. Also, I'm working on taking steps towards lowering our grocery expenditure. My husband and I both work 55-60 hrs a week, so unfortunately we fall into the too tired to cook trap all too often. I've been working on meal planning, keeping the kitchen stocked with staples, and utilizing the godsend that is a pressure cooker, so I expect this to drastically reduce within the coming months.\n\nThe more I read about personal finance and FI, the more I think I should sweep my savings towards debt, especially Credit Card 1. I think my biggest hesitation with this is largely psychological. I know that I don't actually have that money because it's already been spent, but it makes me nervous to throw it toward debt and be stranded with loading up my cards in the event of an emergency. I guess I'm mostly looking for reassurance that this game plan makes sense:\n\n1. Pay off Credit Card 1 now from savings account and let it sit at a zero balance, leaving ~$1000 in savings as emergency fund\n2. Pay down Credit Card 2 over next four months at $233.50 from regular checking\n3. Increase weekly savings deposit to $90/week to more quickly recoup the payment of CC1 (will be back at current savings amount in 13 weeks).\n4. Continue with $150/month payment on student loans until Credit Card 2 is paid off, then switch $150 student loan payment to $450 payments (will have paid off in ~8 months)\n5. During all of this, start working from home again on my off-days to increase my royalty pay/overall income.\n\nOn paper, it looks good to me. I'm just really anxious that I'm missing something obviously wrong with it that is going to leave me blindsided later.

Im new to investing and am curious what the thoughts of more experienced and knowledgable investors might be. \n\nExcept for FB, Ive been watching all these. I dont know much about FB's acquisitions. Oculus VR, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the 50 some others over the past years... I know of them, but Im not much other than topical information. I dont like FB as an investment because I think it will dwindle in use a la MySpace, though I dont have anything to substantiate that.  \n\nI like Amazon and Netflix because I use both frequently and want them to succeed. They both have big plans for expansion and seem like good investments at currently low prices. \n\nIt seems like Apple is losing its share of the phone market and I personally feel like its products are overvalued, but many other people would likely disagree with that. (As I type this on my iPhone.)\n\nThen the ubiquitous Google, the company so well known, their name has become a verb. They have so many projects and are involved in so many tech facets that they will almost certainly be around for a long time. \n\nI know Ive stated a lot of preferential bias for and against, which is probably not the ideal mindset for an investor. So, those of you with more knowledge, tell me what you think about these companies. Or another way to phrase the question, if you had X dollars to invest in these 5, what percent would you allocate to each (0 is of course acceptable)?\n\n\nEdit: link to article\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2016/01/17/the-5-stocks-you-should-buy-this-week-amazon-facebook-netflix-google-apple/#2715e4857a0b780550075224","name":"t3_41krep","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-18 21:16:41","week":3}

{"id":"41mown","author":"TheHorseTrader","body":"I had a lot of people ask about updates regarding the purchases I made last week detailed [here] (http://imgur.com/a/uXMfD). I am leaving for a vacation Wednesday so I wanted to post something before I left. I picked up the items today and took them back to my storage unit. I did a rough sort where I sorted the higher priced/new items to send to FBA, set aside cheap/heavy/less valuable items to go to auction, and items that need further sorting to determine value. I try to do this as soon as I get stuff in as the worst thing you can do is let it accumulate. The bigger the pile gets the less you want to deal with it. \n\nHere is a little [before and after album of my unit and the trailer/tools I used to make the job easier] (http://imgur.com/a/rXwmn)\n\nPhotos and additional information about the individual lots: \n\nLot 32 / 39 - [Pallets of misc items] (http://imgur.com/a/XlFXd) These will probably turn out better than I thought. There are a lot of new in the box items I can send to FBA that I didn't anticipate. A lot of the cheaper/heavier stuff will go to the local auction. There were some used Hubbell plugs that I'll sell on Ebay but most of the used stuff will also go to auction.\n\nLot 60 -[Ez Path items] (http://imgur.com/a/4EerC) - This lot was great. Everything brand new. The EZD22's sell for $65 on Amazon. There are 6 to a box and 20 boxes total. After FBA fees/shipping I should net ~$5400. There was also a box new 12 \nkick-in plates that retail for $135 each on Amazon which should net another ~$1200.\n\nLot 36 - [Valcom speakers] (http://imgur.com/a/inuNx) Retail for $33.50 on Amazon - $10.04 FBA fees = $23.46 - $1.31 to ship to FBA - $2.63 COGS = $19.52 profit each x 44 = $858 total profit.\n\nAppliance and mower parts: \n[1] (http://imgur.com/a/THDJV)\n[2] (http://imgur.com/a/BjFGb)\n[3] (http://imgur.com/a/xanhh)\n\nOverall, there will be some money in it but also a lot more work than the rest. I'll send the low priced items to auction and list the higher dollar items on Ebay.\n\n[Powerflex 70's] (http://imgur.com/a/OO46e) - Overall I'm really happy with these. I talked to an electrician at the company who confirmed that all the units were pulled from machines that were being upgraded. He stated that all items were working when pulled. Visually they all look great as well. I'll stick with my earlier estimate of $3,000-4000 profit on the lot.\n\n[ABB drives] (http://i.imgur.com/gnkyt7h.jpg) - They look older than I thought they were but the guy at the company confirmed that these were also working when pulled. They are pretty heavy so I may try to sell them on CL before Ebay.\n\nTotal time spent today: 8 hours to pick up items and do rough sorting.  About 120 miles driven and $11.60 in tolls. Another 45 minutes to pack and ship for FBA.\n\nSorry if the thoughts were incoherent but I'm trying to get as much stuff sent to FBA tomorrow before I leave for my trip. I'll update again next week once I finish sorting, get the stuff to auction, and listed on Ebay.

{"id":"41oaet","author":"legumocentric","body":"#**1 Million Points in 7 months**#\n\nHere's how I got to 1 million points in 7 months.  All the credit goes to everyone in this sub and /u/doctorofcredit, among others, for teaching me so much!  Beyond sign-up bonuses, I did MS a bit with Serve (still live for now!) and NW Buxx, along with gift card reselling.  I'm also lucky that my work is awesome and lets me funnel a decent amount of biz spend through my cards.  Most importantly, my wife was willing to sign up for cards and is now fully on board :).\n \nOur combined income is about 200k, and our FICOs started at 800 (A) and 825 (B) (now about 780 and 800).  \n \n#**Accounts**#\n\nHere's a list of all the cards and bank accounts that we've been approved for in the past 7ish months (in order of approval).  No other new cards prior to these in the past 2 years.  Only 1 denial so far (for the Citi Prestige) between us.\n \n| A (me) | |\n|----------------|-----|---|\n| Cards | BBVA, Sallie Mae, Discover IT, CSP, Freedom, Arrival+, AA Plat Select, AA Plat Select, Amex SPG/PRG/Platinum/Everyday/Hilton |\n| Bank Accounts | Discover, Santander extra20, Netspend (x5), Citigold |\n\n| B (wife) | |\n|:----------------|---|---|\n| Cards | BBVA, Discover IT, CSP, Amex SPG/PRG/Platinum/Everyday, Citi Premier/Prestige |\n| Bank Accounts | Discover, Santander extra20, Netspend (x4) |\n \nHere's a breakdown of our combined points and cashback.\n\n#**Points (1 million)**#\n\n| | A+ | UR | MR | TYP | SPG | Hilton | Non-A+ Cashback|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| *Earned* | 150k | 175k | 365k | 120k | 80k | 65k | 70k |\n| *Remaining* | 3k | 175k | 365k | 7k | 30k | 65k | 0 |\n| *Cards* |A+|CSP x2 (40k), Freedom (20k)|Plat x2 (100k), PRG x2 (50k), Everyday x2 (25k)|Premier (60k), Prestige (50k)| SPG personal x2 (30k)| no AF Amex (60k)| BBVA x2, Sallie Mae\n\n•\tCitigold 40k TYP pending, plus I'll be funding at least 1 savings account at 56k A+ points each.\n\n•\tExtra 15k with Amazon Freedom 5% glitch (5x on $3k instead of $1.5k; thanks to /u/drdirtysouth for the heads up!)\n\n#**Cashback ($5k+)**#\n\nThis is a very conservative estimate as it doesn't include portal cashback, and I haven't been super diligent about keeping track of/requesting missing Discover cashback.  This also includes a bit of Amazon GCs, which is like cash to me.  I've included the cashback earned for the Sallie Mae/BBVA/Arrival+ in both categories for the sake of completeness. \n\n•\tDiscover IT x2(&gt;$1k before doubling)\n\n•\tDiscover Checking x2 ($50)\n\n•\tNetspend x9 ($859)\n\n•\tSantander x2 ($240)\n\n•\tAmex Offers ($375)\n\n•\tCostco Amex ($300+)\n\n•\tSallie Mae (~$110)\n\n•\tBBVA x2 ($650+$50 pending)\n\n•\tArrival+ ($1.5k)\n\n•\tVarious other offers/deals ($800+)\n\nHere are all my airline reimbursements from CCs.\n\n•\tPlatinum x2 ($200x2)\n\n•\tPRG x2 ($100x2)\n\n•\tPrestige ($250x3; will try to triple dip)\n \n#**Redemptions**#\n\nWith both of us working plus having a toddler, redeeming all these points is tough.  That's why I was focused on cashback cards when I started.  My focus has since shifted away from cashback, but it's good to have a balance.  So far, we've only taken one trip on points, though we are going to Maui next month.  Since we can't travel often, the goal is to travel as luxuriously as possible from now on.\n\n•\tSFO-CHA for 3 via AA (Y), plus 1 night in a hotel ($1.5k)\n\n•\tMaui (next month)\n\n- 112k TYP: 4 nights at Grand Wailea\n\n- 48k SPG: 5 nights at Sheraton\n\n- 95k AA: SFO-OGG for 3 via AA (Y)\n \n#**Goals**#\n\n•\tLearning more about redemptions.\n\n•\tStaying at nicer hotels and getting status, with biz/first class flights a secondary priority.\n\n•\tAnother trip to Hawaii.\n\n•\tTrip to Disneyland/Disney World (likely the former since it's so much closer).\n\n•\tRandom trips to LA and Seattle.\n\n•\tWeekend trips in the Bay Area (e.g., the Hyatt Highlands in Carmel, especially if I can get the Diamond status match and DSUs).\n\n•\tFinding another easy method of MS now that NW Buxx has been nerfed.  I'll still use it to meet min spends if needed, but I'm not sure about using it regularly anymore.\n\n- If/when the above fails, possibly reselling more than just GCs.\n\nI'm not totally sure of what to apply for next, but here's what I've been considering.\n\n•\tChase IHG for IHG platinum, which I can hopefully use to status match to Hyatt/Hilton Diamond.  Plus we are doing the IHG index card promo.\n\n•\tChase Ink+ (It seems more useful than the CSP long-term.)\n\n•\tCiti Prestige since I have a Citigold account for the $100 reduced AF (but worried since I got rejected not too long ago).\n\n•\tCiti Exec/Plat Select (not sure if I want more AA miles)\n\n•\tCap One Venture/Arrival+ (Does it make sense to have both?  I'm not sure if the 3 pulls are worth it since we both have a lot of pulls already, and I still have my Arrival+.)\n\n•\tChase Hyatt (I was considering this for both of us but after realizing the 2 nights free is once-in-a-lifetime, I'm holding off.)\n\n#**Final Thoughts**#\n\nEveryone says you should have a plan when churning, which is ideal, but it's ok if you don't.  Just stay as flexible as you can with transferable points and cashback.  I know it's a marathon, not a race, but don't be afraid to sign-up for the cards you want.  I was approved for 13 cards in 4 months and only then got my first and only denial.  And it's possible I would have been approved eventually but I was stupid and called instead of letting it go through the system on its own.  Sorry for the long post, hopefully this is interesting and helpful to other folks.  Happy to answer any questions, and thanks again!\n\n","name":"t3_41oaet","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-01-19 12:53:28","week":3}

{"id":"41q6va","author":"sithlordofthevale","body":"Afternoon,\n\nSo recently a whole heap of bullshit has been thrown at me by PayPal and I searched through the sub and found some related problems, but it usually boiled down to \"don't forget to switch your accounts.\" I did, and PayPal isn't letting me. \n\nI have a number of bills coming out of PayPal (Amazon subscriptions, Netflix, Spotify, etc), which links to my now old bank account of USAA. Wonderful bank. I recently switched my main checking/ direct deposit over to Navy Fed, they pay military earlier, I got an auto loan approved through them, whatever, I switched banks save for keeping some savings in USAA.\n\nI switched my main accounts within PayPal after verifying the new checkings, PayPal told me it was all confirmed, easy peasy. Well, then I get hit with a message saying my ID could not be verified, for whatever reason. Really no idea. My address changed several months ago but that didn't seem to be a problem. They're asking for a picture of my ID, proof of address, and proof of social security number. Very very sketchy to me. After a few phone calls, I determine this has to happen or I won't be able to do anything with my account.\n\nEven after confirming, on the phone, that my default account would be switched and that this issue with my ID would be taken care of, it still hasn't. PayPal continues to overdraw my old account, and despite my best efforts, because my ID still is not verified, I cannot change my accounts, add money to PayPal, etc. I'm more or less locked out. And as you can imagine, the charges are killing me. Even though it's only a few bills (I switched most places to just charging my card), PayPal is repeatedly charging USAA every few days for those charges, which gives me a ~30 dollar overdraft charge. And again, I can't fix the negative balance with PayPal because my ID isn't verified. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, I'm just incredibly stressed out and it's very possible I'm about to get stationed overseas and I need my finances to be completely in order before that happens. Is there any precedent to make PayPal overturn these charges? Or my bank? What do I need to do to make that happen?","name":"t3_41q6va","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-19 20:08:35","week":3}

It helps you gain deeper understanding of where your money is going, the value you are receiving from each item purchased (i.e. did you really need that $10 headset?), average discounts from MSRP by item category, etc.  \n\n\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Go to [Order History Reports] page at https://www.amazon.com/gp/b2b/reports\n\n2. Choose [Report Type: Items]\n\n3. Set report [Start Date] and [End Date] or click on one of the Quick Set options\n\n4. Click on [Request Report] and wait for a while - it may take a few minutes before you can download the report\n\n5. Open the csv file in Excel / Google Docs and use charts, pivot tables, pivot charts, etc. to begin analyzing!\n\n\n**Some popular data attributes (per item):**\n\n* Order Date\n* Order ID\n* Title\n* Category\n* List Price Per Unit\n* Purchase Price Per Unit\n* Quantity\n\nand more (there are 35 columns in total)\n\n\n**Some ideas on what data you may get out of this:**\n\n* Spending total by item category (e.g. Apparel, Baby Product, Camera, Electronics, etc.)\n* Average discounts from MSRP by item category\n* Price history of repeatedly ordered items over time such as those you have on Subscribe &amp; Save\n* Identify money you have wasted by adding a column \"Is Used?\" with TRUE/FALSE answer then PIVOT!!\n* Average order size (e.g. \"Am I buying unnecessary things to reach $35 free shipping threshold?\")\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* You can also use free tools like *Qlik Sense Cloud* to create a dynamic dashboard to interact with your data \nhttp://www.qlik.com/products/qlik-sense/qlik-cloud","name":"t3_41sn8r","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-20 05:17:27","week":3}

I was invited to come cross-post this in /r/frugal.*\n\nI would like to add that although my plan and situation was not as dire as I feel like others may see their own, I wrote this up just to have a general idea of my process, and to inspire people to take that first step.  A lot of the strategy can apply to everyone trying to pay down debt, but there are some things that I still took liberties in that others may not be able to if they are in a worse situation (mainly eating out at restaurants.)*\n\n\nI wanted to do a write up in how I paid off my CC debt in a year, because every post I see about people paying down large portions of debt after a major job promotion or raise or change had no meaning to me.  I needed to find a way out of credit card debt that was accrued over a large period of time without having to depend on a windfall or major life change, and the majority of the success stories I found were from people already making 6 figures, or had changed jobs multiple times to triple their income.  Here's how I did it with a simple 2% cost-of-living raise and a mid-level income.\n\n**Income/COL Stats (Begin January, 2015)**\n\n**Beginning Cash:** ~$1,000 (Dec 31, 2014)\n\n**Location:** Southern California, 45 min. North of Los Angeles\n\n**Income:** $55,000 ($1,480 Take Home every 2 weeks)\n\n**Raises:** 1x 2%, effective April\n\n**Rent:** $775 (2 BR Apt, $1550 split with partner)\n\n**Gas:** $3.15 - $3.85 / gal\n\n**CC Available:** $12,400 (4 cards)\n\n**CC Debt:** $10,000 (81% Used)\n\n**Avg CC APR:** 22%\n\n**Credit Score:** 630\n\n**Car**: $455 ($250 car, $205 insurance)\n\n**Phone:** $105\n\n**Step 1 – IMMEDIATE Reduction in Monthly Costs**\n\nFirst things first, before I even came up with a plan I just went for it.  One day I picked up the phone/internet and started slashing my bills **immediately.**  Once I started this, and \"found\" some extra money, my plan started forming.\n\n**TV (Saved $130/month)**\n\nI dropped my DirecTV bill ($150+ a month) at the end of 2014.  I had to pay a couple hundred bucks for the cancellation, which was fine, as I saved that much after a month and a half of no service.  With the internet a practical necessity, and Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, I substituted $150 in cable for what is relatively $18, since I consider the free Prime shipping to far outweigh what we pay (as a household) for the service.  We also barely watch Amazon streaming, so I don't consider this paid TV for this purpose.   I also found an antenna on sale for about $40 purely so I could watch some sports.\n\n**Phone (saved $50/month)**\n\nThe first thing I did was call and change my phone plan.  I was grandfathered into unlimited data as long as I had stayed with the rate that I had been paying.  However, when I looked at my usage I found that, primarily because I'm usually connected to WiFi, I was using less than 3GB of data a month.  Switching from my old plan that was around 7 years old, I went from $105 a month to $54 a month.\n\n**Insurance (saved $50/month)**\n\nWhile I had various driving related issues on my record, my insurance for my leased civic started at around $205 a month for the year.  I was about to start shopping around, wherein I found that by switching companies I could save around $60-75 a month.  However, due to some bad history falling off, safe driver, etc, my insurance ended the year at about $154, and they've been great in helping me take care of some issues I had along the way, so I didn't feel the need to change.  I would say, though, that anyone looking to save money should shop around, as switching companies will result in a money savings the majority of the time.\n\n\n**Step 2 – Planning and Preparation**\n\n**YNAB – You Need a Budget ($65)**\n\nI spent money to buy YNAB.  It's a tool that was highly touted, and since I didn't really need some of the features of Mint, and YNAB was so user friendly (the phone app is too easy), I figured the $65 would not be really frivolous, but instead would be a valuable asset on my road to recovery.  Being able to track every dollar I spent was unnecessary sometimes, but having the underlying responsibility and commitment to myself in the background forced me to change the way I viewed my money.\n\nAlso, using the Reporting function on YNAB let me SEE my progress month after month...ok to be honest I checked it like every few days...but SEEING the progress helped keep me on track.  I watched the trend move month after month, and this is what I saw at the end: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png\n\n**Excel – Short Term Predictions**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wnpwfwX.png\n\nI created a spreadsheet in Excel that tracked all of my cards separately as well.  While YNAB does allow you to budget, it does not effectively help you plan down to the days of the month.  With payment due dates, bills, etc, I needed a way to not only TRACK my money, but to PREDICT where my accounts would be on any day.\n\nThis sheet would prove absolutely crucial, as it let me make massive payments without fear of overdrafting or any other bad news pop ups.  There were times when my checking account was as low as $20.  This didn't really matter, though, because I knew where my money would be days and weeks later with no surprises.\n\nThis taught me not to live by what was in my bank account, but only by the plan I put into place.  Years ago I would see thousands of dollars in the bank and go buy hundreds of dollars of stuff, only to have bills come around weeks later and be short on credit card payments.  This was money I didn't actually have to spend, but because I saw the numbers in the account I figured it was good to go, plus some.  This would prove to be really useful when I started using my cash back card, as seen later in this post.\n\n**Come Up with a Payoff Plan – Snowball, Avalanche**\n\nI needed to decide how I was going to tackle this debt first.  Through a series of taking care of partners, bad choices, and various life events, I went from having a 785 credit score and 9% APRs to about a 630 and maxed out 19%-25% APRs.  I messed around with unbury.me for a little bit, and determined that the course of action would be to tackle the highest APR first.  However, my plan wasn't all the way conventional.\n\nBalance, APR - $2,000, 23.99%\n\nBalance, APR - $2,200 22.90%\n\nBalance, APR - $3,586 19.99%\n\nBalance, APR - $2,200, 22.90% (Cash Rewards Card)\n\nMy goal was to pay minimum payments on all other cards except for one, and lump sum that one card until it was toast.  Rinse repeat for the other three.  This ended up being a major motivating factor by the end, because as soon as the first one was done, the idea of paying off the others changed my point of view from uphill to downhill.  The domino effect totally took over.\n\n**Create TINY Emergency Fund - $1,000 Break Glass for Disaster**\n\nFirst thing I did was change whatever money I had over to my checking account, and put $1,000 in a savings account.  This is something I did not touch for the entire year, thankfully, even after paying for car maintenance, fun times, or gift buying, or anything else that came my way.  I still tackled these events as they came up, and tried to find other areas in my budget to trim from for that month, even if that meant $100 less towards my credit cards.  I did NOT touch this emergency fund, as it was literally only for emergencies.\n\n**Zero out 401k Contributions – (Employer Profit Share, NO 401K match)**\n\nSince my employer doesn't do 401K matching, I had no incentive to keep putting money into my 401K.  If this service is available from your employer, do not stop contributing to your retirement funds.  I did it solely because there was no extra money to be gained in the short term.  If I had matching, I would have saved money elsewhere (like food, see below) and still maintained retirement contribution funding.\n\nThis isn't the right plan for everyone, but since I still get contributions to my 401k regardless, and I wanted any extra money that I could find to go towards the 20%+ APRs in the short term.\n\n**Create a Budget**\n\nI used YNAB to set up a budget to TRY to stick to.  I set a lofty goal of paying off $1,000 in credit cards every month, and worked my budget DOWN from there.  I had the complete understanding that I would probably not hit this mark, but it forced me to find out where I didn't really need to waste money.  I would barely make this work by the end, through a series of monthly ebbs and flows, but only as an average.  I hardly ever hit the $1,000 mark.\nThis would entail paying off $1,000 across all cards.  Effectively this would be about $175-200 in minimum payments, and the rest of the $800 all to one card.  I often would miss this goal.\n\n\n**Step 3 – ACTION**\n\n**How to Control Spending – Using Cash Back Rewards Cards ONLY**\n\nSince this seems like a dangerous idea to someone who obviously has had years of credit card debt, I want to make this perfectly clear: this isn't a move for everyone.  My idea was to use my cash back rewards card for all purchases, and to pay down the balance in full at the end of every month.  Since I had my excel sheet, I didn't really need to worry about having money in the bank to pay the balance, as I already knew where my money was resting, and when it would be gone to pay the balance.\n\nEven though I had the idea to pay down my highest interest first, the first thing I did was put my first big payment onto my cash rewards card to clear up room.  I opened a Capital One Quicksilver with a 1.5% cash back reward at the end of 2014, but of course after a couple months it carried a balance just like the rest of my cards.  I wanted to use a single card for my purchases to 1) help track spending, and 2) regain some cash back along the way.\n\nI made it an effort to use this card for 95% of my purchases.  I also have a Chase Freedom that has 5% cash back on rotating categories, which I would swap out to use during certain times of the year.  This was moreso a mental thing, as it let me feel like I was actually earning throughout the year, even though I was paying every dollar I had to my name to credit debt.  Additionally, I netted just around $450 in cash back rewards by Dec 2015.\n\n**How to Control Mental Stability – Won't Always Hit the Goal**\n\nAs the months started to wear on, I had to change my budget little by little.  I knew by month 3 that paying $1,000 straight to credit cards every month wouldn't work.  Luckily by being paid every 2 weeks instead of twice a month, I knew that there would be a month in the middle and end of the year that I would be paid a third check.  I used the majority of these checks to \"catch up\" on payments.\n\n**How to Control Emotional Stability – Allow yourself some joys in life**\n\nVISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW I SPENT MY FUN MONEY: https://i.imgur.com/FddeIrY.gifv\n\nKnowing that having a goal to pay this off in a single year was going to put me far away from some fun things, I focused on and took some liberties whenever something would come up.  I would do cheap happy hours with coworkers, I would still buy cheap fun things ($20-40 board games that I can play with my GF, a gadget here or there), and I would definitely allow myself to go out to dinner or go on date night with my GF a few times a month.\nUsing YNAB tracking, I realized that I STILL went to eat out more often than I should.  This, for all intents and purposes, was frivolous fun money.  There was no need to eat out as much if I had truly cared to reign it in, however food and service in Southern California is not cheap, and I was determined to enjoy myself and my friends and my GF throughout the year. \n\nIf I had been in uncontrollable debt, or anything more than what I was, I would have cut out eating out to once a month.  Luckily my situation was controllable, and I allowed myself the flexibility and peace of mind to swap certain things for the possibility by a month or two.  Ultimately, I still paid off my cards in under a year.\n\n\n**Step 4 – Watching the Weight Fall Off**\n\n**The Beginning**\n\nThe first milestone was in March, when I was able to completely pay off my first credit card.  This was a major relief, and an acknowledgement that I may actually be able to pull this off.  After this first card was down, all I thought about was the next one biting the dust, and the next, and the next.\n\nThis changed my mentality from an uphill battle to a downhill battle.  I can't stress this enough.  Once you get a taste of the first victory, you won't want to stop until you have the war won.\n\n**The Middle**\n\nMy next payoff was in June.  Again, I wasn't hitting my $1,000 mark every month.  The realization of that in the beginning allowed me to maintain some sense of self, not feel 100% beholden to the debt schedule, and when the milestones hit, they felt FUN instead of RELIEVING.  Once I hit this point I really felt like I had it all in control.\n\n**The End**\n\nBy November I made my last payment.  My last.  Payment.  $10,000 in UNDER a year.  I spent some money, I had some fun, I enjoyed myself and my friends, and I paid off the entirety of my credit debt.  Un.  Believable.\n\n\n**Step 5 – The Aftermath**\n\n2015 Chart: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png\n\nAt the end of the year as my debts started to become $0, I noticed a major influx of credit line increases and credit score increases.  In the span of that year my APRs dropped, my credit score rose by about 80 points, and my available credit was nearly doubled, all WITHOUT a phone call, an email, or any effort to do so.  The credit card companies are DIRELY missing the thousands of dollars I've been paying in interest, and they want me BACK.  They have repeatedly raised my credit limits and dropped my interest rates over the past couple of months.\n\n\n**Year Beginning/End**\n\n**Phone**\n\nJan 2015 - $105\n\nDec 2015 - $54\n\n**TV**\n\nJan 2015 - $150\n\nDec 2015 - $18\n\n**Car Insurance**\n\nJan 2015 - $205\n\nDec 2015 - $154\n\n\n**Credit Available, Credit Used**\n\nJan 2015 - $12,400 / $10,000\n\nDec 2015 - $22,900 / $0\n\n**Credit Score (Don’t have my final quarter available yet, but I assume it will increase again)**\n\nJan 2015 – 630\n\nOct 2015 – 705\n\n**Cash Back Rewards**\n\n$450\n\n\n**FINALE**\n\nIn short, I was able to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt with a $55,000 salary (2% raise) in SoCal in a year by immediately removing paid TV, changing my phone plan, and lowering car insurance.  I set aside a credit card to use for all purchases that had 1.5% cash back, which gave me some gift money for Christmas, and let me feel like I was earning throughout the year even though I was paying out every dollar I had.\n\nThroughout the year I let myself understand that some months I would only be able to afford 60-70% of my goal, but that was ok.  In the end it all worked out.\n\nI hope this helps someone who is on the fence or who often gets discouraged by stories of people with 6 figure incomes who can't control their wealth any more than we can.  IT CAN BE DONE.  And it might be easier…and \"funner\"…than you think.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nCouple things.  First off, I would not always suggest that one should cut all retirement savings in the hunt for debt resolution.  There were a couple factors that went into me making this decision, one being that my APRs on my credit cards were astronomical.  I would suggest spending some time looking into your personal situation and what your company and/or personal gains/losses would be before forming your plan.\n\nSecondly, thanks for all the positive responses!  As for the negative responses telling me \"oh yeah just pay off $10,000 in a year thaaanks\"......I get it.  It's the internet.  Understood.  Please save your breath and your fingertip typing tire tread.  I simply made this post to give a take on an Average Joes mental and physical tackling of a very common problem, and honestly to call it what it is, lifestyle.  I'm just hoping to let people know who were in my situation or in my state of mind a year ago that it's possible to get it taken care of, even in an average situation.\n\nThirdly, LOL I am not a shill for YNAB.  It just seemed to be a better fit for me than Mint.  I spent some time on PF reading and looking at people's stories before I chose it.  The main point of this for me was that it held me accountable!  Having this little app on my phone requiring me to put all my expenses in, looking at charts and budget tables every week, and seeing negatives where I overspent was like having a little gremlin on my shoulder every time my wallet came out!  It was instrumental is changing my perception of money...MY money...the money I earn!  And deserve to keep.\n\n**EDIT - Clarification on Take Home/Budgeting Clarity**\n\nPeople seem to be asking about my take home a lot, and I think it's a very valid point to hammer home.  I was bringing home $1,480 * 26 = $38,480 / $55,000 = about a 30% withholdings (taxes, health, etc).  Again, this was at the beginning of the year, and I got a COL increase of 2% a little over quarter of the way through the year.\n\n**As I mentioned in the OP, I get paid every two weeks, NOT twice a month.  This equates to 26 paychecks per year.  What I did was budget to the tune of two paychecks a month ($1,480 x 2  = $2,960) and not factor in the extra check that would come around in July and in December.**  The third paycheck on December 31 paycheck would end up not mattering in this instance, as I had already paid everything off by the beginning of December, however the third check I got in July went to car registration ($200), GF's birthday spending (Aug), some fun activities, and an extra payment dollars towards the card (I believe I put in an extra $500 out of this?  Along with the monthly.  Whatever was left over (wasn't a lot) I let sit in my account so it had more than $20 :).\n\nHad I not gotten this extra payment, I still could have spent the same in August and finished the pay-off in December, however **this wasn't extra cash.  This was a budgeting decision.**.  I decided to budget only off of $35,520, not my annual take home of $38,480.  This was primarily an emotional facet, as the money was coming to me either way, but in an effort to reel in my spending habits, and to experience some joy over the Summer, I chose to not budget for that third check in July.\n\n**EDIT - Excel Tracking Example**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wnpwfwX.png\n\nThis is a portion of how I tracked my ACTUAL cash flow in/out, regardless of budgets/budgeting software.  **The budgeting software helped me allocate, while Excel helped me track.**  I hesitate to post the full document, as I'm not sure how useful it would be to anyone else's situations, but I'd be willing to help someone get one together for themselves if it would mean getting them on the right path to debt resolution TODAY.\n\nI'll attach a screenshot of one of my Excel sections that I used to forecast my money.  I also did this in the same worksheet for all of my credit cards.\n\nAs it may be confusing to some, I'll break it down a little bit.  You'll see in it that I have a salary paid, rent and bills paid, and then future forecasted payments (in gray).  We'll have the Chase payment (this was minimum +~$5), the Cap One payment (this was THE card I was paying down at the time), plus a Quicksilver payment for a large amount.  This Quicksilver one was NOT paying down debt!  It was simply paying down the amount I had used during the month of March, as I used that card for 90%+ of my purchases to accumulate cash back rewards.  This is how I tracked not only where my money was going, but where it would be on a day-to-day basis.\n\n**This also REALLY helped me see how much money I DIDN'T HAVE!**  By March 26 I would have $3,500+ in money in my account.  Normally this would be telling myself hey, I can definitely afford to buy something worth a couple hundred bucks!  But no.......now we see by April 3, literally a week afterwards, my account would only have $193 in it.\n\nAgain, this is just an example of how I did it.  I would set it up differently depending on needs, accompanying software, and personal setup.","name":"t3_41we9l","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-20 22:11:18","week":3}

{"id":"41zzn6","author":"likelyculprit","body":"A month ago, I posted a referral notice I received from the local social network Nextdoor telling me that they'd give me and a referral each a $25 Amazon gift card if they joined the network. After digging further, there were definitely more hoops to jump through than originally expected (see below). That being said, one of my referrals completed the process and Nextdoor came through ([see here](http://i.imgur.com/N4pn2g0.png)). So, at least now I know it's legit. If anyone else feels like jumping through the hoops might be worth it, here's the [referral link](https://nextdoor.com/amazon/?r=ccjrfy). As per beermoney rules, here's the [non-referral link](http://www.nextdoor.com) but since that's the way I signed myself up, I can tell you that there's no gift card if you don't get referred...\n\n\nHere's all of the fine print from the website:\n&gt; For a neighborhood to qualify, your friend must not have an existing Nextdoor site in their neighborhood. To officially launch their site, your friend needs to sign up at least 10 neighbors who verify their addresses during the 21-day pilot period. Pilot time frames may be extended in special circumstances or upon request. Both of you and your referred friend must be verified Nextdoor members. Referrals are valid only for sign ups through your unique Nextdoor referral link or one of the invitation methods listed on the referral page. There is no limit to the number of referrals you can make and gift certificates you can earn. Gift cards will normally be emailed to you and your friend within 45 days of the launch of your referred neighborhood. If you have not received your card within this time, please contact the Nextdoor help desk. Nextdoor is not responsible for any lost or unused gift certificates. All current Nextdoor members, excluding Nextdoor employees and contractors, are eligible to participate in this referral program. This program is void where prohibited and Nextdoor may cancel or modify these terms at any time.","name":"t3_41zzn6","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-01-21 14:39:06","week":3}

{"id":"421rh6","author":"NeedsMoreWhammy","body":"Hi, I know this seems like a silly question, but is it smart to have every item in your store on sale? Or does the concept of \"if everything is on sale, nothing is\" apply? For example, when you go to Amazon, everything is at a reduced price, which makes you feel like you're getting a great deal. However, for places like JCPenney, everything is on sale but it doesn't \"feel\" like it is on sale. \n\nI have a website where I sell yarn, and me selling price for all of my rolls is based on length. So for example, all of my 160 yard rolls are $14.75, but I have them listed at $16.00 discounted to $14.75. So when you go to my site, every single item has a banner on it saying ON SALE! Which is nice, but when I do actually want to do a real sale and sell rolls for $9.99, it feels like it doesn't grab people's attention. Should I only list items on sale that I really am discounting, or is it not a big deal?\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_421rh6","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-01-21 21:08:59","week":3}

{"id":"422ph9","author":"matt314159","body":"Hey folks!  I keep an eye on /r/personalfinance regularly. Though don't often post, I do have an interesting situation I'd like feedback on.  \n\nI've been on a crusade for the past four years to pay off about $22k in credit card debt.  And I've been making excellent headway.  I paid off and closed my Amazon.com store card (serviced through synchrony) in March 2015. I received a tiny check for a slight credit balance (a couple of bucks) which zeroed out my account. \n\nHaven't heard a peep from them until today, when I got an email saying a payment had been posted on 1/20/16.  I WTF'd over to my account online to check it out, and sure enough, I see I have a credit balance of $352 and change.  The transaction was listed as \"*INTEREST CHARGE* PURCHASES REFUND\"\n\nI called up customer service and spoke with a very friendly outsourced CSR.  I asked him about the refund and he happily told me--and this is paraphrasing as closely as I can remember--\n\n&gt;\"Yes sir, ah, you see, we were going through all of our records with our computer and some customers were over-charged on their interest rate, so we have issued a credit to the affected accounts, would you like us to send you a refund check?\n\n\nI said \"sure\" and so they're sending me a refund check in the next 7-10 days.  \n\nI want to be excited for this, because it means between this and my tax refund I should be able to finish paying off the rest of my credit cards by the end of February.  \n\nBut should I be concerned at all?  I sort of worry it's an accounting error of some sort and they'll just bill me for the erroneous disbursement of the credit balance.  \n\nWould I be wise to just sit on the money for the meantime, and if so, how long should I wait? Has this happened to anybody else recently?  Thankfully this is rather low-stakes, if I had to pay it back unexpectedly I probably could but it would hurt a little since my focus has been on paying off credit cards and not building a savings cushion (read:  i'm still living paycheck-to-paycheck for about the next month or two).  But the whole situation seemed a little curious.  I'd feel more comfortable if it turned out to be a widespread thing that other people are experiencing, too, though a google search turned up nothing.  \n\nThanks!","name":"t3_422ph9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-22 00:29:17","week":3}

You could then invest in high yield savings accounts.\n* You could buy gold coins on eBay back when you could stack eBay bucks (2%), Mr. rebate (3%), and Bing cashback (10-30%).

I was working full-time at Amazon while taking 11 credit hours and decided to quit my job in order to focus on my final exams and term papers. I owe $1,200 in rent backpay and $1,000 to a credit card company I used to buy time to finish the semester before I got the Amazon job.\n\nI have gone to court to talk to my apartment's lawyer and the manager is calling the sheriff Monday.

I have a prescription that costs $80/month to fill with no healthcare, and that's going to be the roughest part.\n\nI signed up to be a geoscience major hoping to go to graduate school and study earthquakes, but I withdrew from field camp and they let me substitute a few extra classes only because I got a medical withdrawal for depression.

I live abroad &amp; make semi annual trips back to America to collect my Amazon hauls. As such, returning or replacing items is impossible.\n\nIn 2014, I purchased a HD caddy from one FBA reseller. This last month, I wanted another for a 2nd laptop. For whatever reason, where I live, they don't sell laptop HD caddies. Also, for whatever reason, the original reseller doesn't have this caddy anymore, some other FBA reseller does. Followed the link from my account history, should have been identical, right?\n\nOrdered it, packed it, got home this week, finally sat down today to perform my upgrade. It's the wrong part. A quick visual inspection appears like all is well, however, it is 5mm too thick. I made full use of Amazon chat, got a full refund without needing to return the item, but now I'm SOL for the next 6 months thanks to  FBA. I get some mild pleasure knowing the reseller is now out the cost of the item &amp; has to issue me a full refund.\n\nThis is my final time purchasing anything FBA. I will pay MORE for something shipped from and sold by Amazon.com because in the last decade I have yet to have an issue with anything sold by Amazon.

I will try to categorize everything as best I can.\n\nAbout me:\n\n- 30 yr. old male, currently living in CT, employed full time, occasional consulting work\n- Annual gross pay between $65k - $75k depending on consulting\n- Living situation is currently living at home, looking to buy a house in the next year with my girlfriend\n- Vehicle: Recently purchased Pre-owned2014 Chevy Impala with 16k miles, 18 months free oil changes, warranty to 42.5K miles or 3 years, and I have the remainder of the factory 5 year/100k powertrain warranty. I drive a lot as part of my job and I need a solid reliable vehicle, which is why I purchased the car I did.\n\nFinancial Situation:\n\n- Total in the bank right now: Just under $12k\n- Stock portfolio: Exists, not terribly happy with it ($5k total cost, current face value is about $3.5K, does pay about $45/month in dividends) currently with sharebuilder, I'm overall OK with them, but I'm apparently an idiot with stocks.\n- Credit card debt: ~$5.5k (recent, working on it). Interest rate is 10.79%, second card has a 0 balance every month, but I pay all of my bills and do all my purchases on that card (gas, cigarettes, etc.) for rewards purcahses (it's an Amazon visa by Chase)\n- Car loan remaining: $17.5k\n- Current Retirement: I am enrolled and partially vested in a pension plan for a school district, but that's about it right now. I had planned on trying to use my stock portfolio to bolster that, but I'm an idiot with stocks apparently.\n\nCurrent expenses:\n\n- Rent is $400/month\n- Car payment is $276/month minimum, I typically pay $300 even\n- Cell phone is $225, split with my dad, my end is actually only about $80/month. I pay the bill, he gives me cash\n- Credit card I am currently paying between $250-$500/month at the card with the balance hanging on it\n\nUpcoming Expenses:\n\n - This June the girlfriend hit's 30 this year, and I need to set aside for that. Between surprise party and gift, I am expecting about $2000 (that's high, intentionally)\n - On that same note, a wedding is going to be in the cards in the next 4-5 years or less (including the ring)\n - Planning on buying a house within the next 12 months\n - 1 business trip currently being planned for late Feb./Early March, no vacations this year, estimated cost is about $1k\n\nSavings (per paycheck which is bi-weekly):\n\n- $25 per paycheck into general savings account with my credit union, who I'm very happy with\n- $75 into house savings\n- $75 into company savings (short version, game company start up, 3 guys, low budget, first title should be released this year)\n- $25 into misc. savings\n- $50 into stock savings\n- $25 into vehicle maintenance (which is really car taxes at this point)\n- $50 pre-tax to my HSA\n\nTax situation:\n\n- As a fairly young guy with almost no deductions and 2 years running have fairly significant 1099 income, I get hit pretty hard. I am filed as single and 0 with no additional deductions. I will be changing that before my next pay check.\n\nMy questions:\n\n- Retirement is a big one. I have the option to do a 403B through my job, or should I go for an IRA? I would prefer to stay with Capital one 360 for convenience, any reason I shouldn't?\n- Buying a house. Honestly scares the crap out of me financially speaking. That said, in talking with the girlfriend, our budget is $175K, which given our area, is on the low side, but I'm handy, and I have the tools and the talent to do what I need to do (read: fixer uppers do not scare me, within reason). We currently have about $12.5K saved for a down payment between us (I have $11K of that). I am considering setting up $5k into a 6 month CD to try and get a little better return, knowing I need to keep $5K+ on hand for expenses, emergency funds, my tax bill, etc. Thoughts?\n- Emergency fund. I know I need one, and right now it's rolled into my house savings. How much did you keep on hand when you bought your first home? I want to keep $2K at a minimum on hand, but if that $2K is the difference between PMI and no PMI, I think it's worth it to drain it. Am I wrong? My credit union said they would give me a mortgage with 10% down and no PMI\n- You're probably going to read this and say that I have a large amount of disposable income, and I do. Right now the bulk of it is being paid to the credit card.\n- Overall, what kind of shape do you think I am in financially?\n- Is there anything else I should be doing?\n\nThanks again, I know there's a lot going on here.\n\ntl;dr - Thanks for stopping by, I appreciate it!","name":"t3_426cf5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-22 17:44:10","week":3}

{"id":"426q2b","author":"troycatalano","body":"Uber's been going around showing its financials to investors as part of its continuous fund-raising, and reports in Bloomberg yesterday and The Information last week have revealed some of that information to the public.\n\nAssuming the reports are correct, Uber grew its losses faster than its net revenues between 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015. Revenues were up 134%, to $1.161 billion, while losses grew 151%, to $1.684 billion. This was also the case between Q1 and Q2 2015, although it was reversed between Q2 and Q3 2015. (Net revenues are what the company keeps after paying fees to drivers. Gross revenues, or bookings, are much higher.)\n\nThe takeaway? Uber is still in expansion mode. The company and its investors are betting that ride-sharing is a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market, and are willing to spend billions to fuel expansion in hopes that an eventual near monopoly will reap great returns.\n\nThat's how it seems to have worked for Amazon, although as Bloomberg pointed out, Amazon lost $1.4 billion on $2.8 billion in revenue in its worst quarter ever in early 2000, and Jeff Bezos cut staff by 15% as a result.

{"id":"428qh6","author":"Jaycee1993","body":"I'm 22 years old and I have a ton of credit card debt. My wife and I are both students who rely a little too heavily on our loan overage checks and are terrible at budgeting, so when our money ran out, we started relying on credit cards. We applied for every credit card offer we received and now we have a ton of debt and our credit scores are terrible. Our total credit card debt is around $8k.\n\nWe have several cards with debt on them and I feel like I'm drowning in the monthly payments. I owe around $400/month just in monthly payments. We are very fortunate in that we don't have a huge amount of bills, but our other bills include: rent ($660/month), electric ($100/month), water ($30/month), sewer ($15/month), Time Warner ($100/month), cellphones  ($50/month), groceries (~$250/month), class payments ($470/month), and renter's insurance ($12/month).\n\nThis semester I started working full-time, and I make between $350-$450 per week depending on how many hours I'm needed a week. I'm also not receiving financial aid this semester, which is why I'm making payments on my classes. My wife only works one day a week and makes maybe $100 every 2 weeks. She will be receiving ~$4k in student loan overages.\n\nI will absolutely admit that we are awful at realizing how much money we are spending. I've tried financial trackers but haven't found one that helped much. We frequently spend money on frivolous things like eating out and ordering stuff of Amazon. I know it would help our money situation immensely if we could curb our spending habits.\n\nBottom line is, I'm looking for advice on how to control our spending and also how to get all this debt paid off and increase our credit scores. I am so overwhelmed and constantly anxious about money! Any advice at all would be much appreciated.

{"id":"42c0q0","author":"Spythe","body":"So something just interesting happened, I just sold a used book for more than a new book on Amazon. I have access to a book(from a local chain 1.25 store) that goes for a good amount. Ranges from 10 to 12 so I see about 5 bucks after fees with a 33k rank. So far I've sold about 10 at 10 dollars each.\n\nRecently I sent in about 10 new ones and a few semi new ones(came from the same 1.25 store) but had some minor shelf wear so I put them up as good or acceptable(the acceptable one had a faded back cover or small rips in the edges).\n\nAND I just sold an acceptable one for 12.99 when I have brand new ones in perfect condition at 11.99. I'm guessing this is due to Amazon random buy box when it comes to books. Once Amazon doesn't have the buy box on books it seems like its a hail mary.\n\nJust checked and my \"good\" ones have the box buy atm.

The closest \"laundromat\" (our condo association owns it) is $3.00 for a load, wash and dry, and a small walk away from the apartment.  Oh, and you can only use it before 9 PM because it wakes up the residents who live above it, and there are no quarter changers (????) so if the banks are closed and you're out of quarters, no clean clothes for you.

I also use a pet food website to order, as I've found it cheaper than local shops and Amazon. \n\n$20 per month on flea and heartworm preventative.\n\n$300 per year on the annual vet visit and vaccines. There are ways to make this cheaper, but I pay more for the convenience of visiting the Vet down the block rather than a clinic outside the city.\n\n$300 per month for the dog walker, and $60 per day for pet sitting when we go on vacation. \n\nSome years we only see the Vet for vaccines and routine tests. Some years he has small injuries or issues that require a vet and cost about $150. Last year he had an acute illness and went to the emergency vet overnight to the tune of $1500. Insurance can help, and there are lots of options to look into. \n\nOne cost I did not anticipate at the start was having to redo some of his vaccines. We got our dog from a rescue and they had already vaccinated him before we adopted him. This was meant to be something our adoption fee paid for, in theory. Our vet looked at records and felt the doses of the vaccines were given too far apart to be effective, and he had to be vaccinated again. I thought the first visit would be almost free, but it wound up costing about $500. So the rainy day vet bill fund should be established before you get the pet.

{"id":"cz2ip6d","author":"Lyrrad0","body":"I used Norbert's Gambit last year to convert a lot of CAD to USD.  If you have a TD Waterhouse account with your TD Canada Trust account, it would be a decent option, though it will take more than a week or so to do it without incurring the much higher fees of phone trades.  When I did it, I bought the USD ETF, then I had to wait three days for it to settle, then call in to journal them to my USD brokerage account, then sell and wait another three business days.  You'd then move the funds to your TDCT USD Chequing account, and call TD Cross-Border banking to wire it to your TD Bank Checking account (or use the Visa transfer service online).\n\nThe fees incurred would be about $10 (in each currency) for each trade plus the buy/ask spread.  I think I ended up paying about 0.2% plus the trade cost.  By contrast, the Borderless account exchange rate costs about 2%, so this could result in a savings of about $160 on $10000.\n\nI don't recommend trying to time the exchange rate.  If you need USD, just purchase it when it's needed. (If we knew for sure what direction the exchange rate would go in the future, we could make a lot of money.)\n\nMy advice would be as follows:\n\n1. If you're only converting $10K, just find an OK rate at a local currency exchange place or your bank.  Norbert's gambit will take a while to execute, possibly only save $150 or so, and your time would probably be better spent planning your relocation.  Opening a brokerage account for one or two transactions probably isn't a good use of time.  (Also, if they figure out you're moving to the US, they may close your TDW account. EDIT: after you leave the country)\n2. If you plan on moving USD from Canada to USD or vice-versa, use the TD Cross-border banking services to move it for free.\n3. If you need to convert USD to CAD in the future, and you're in Canada, you can use your TD Bank debit card to withdraw from TDCT ABMs.  You'd get the exact exchange rate and not pay any fees.  If you get the Premier account and maintain a $2500 balance, you can withdraw from any ATM worldwide with all fees reimbursed and no forex charge.\n4. Consider getting a Canadian credit card with a low forex fee.  That way you can spend your CAD in the US without incurring these costs.  I know the Chase Amazon.ca credit card is good for this, but there may be others.\n5. Figure out how you can build your credit in the US.  If you already have an Amex you can probably do a Global Card Transfer to get a US one.  Some banks (like RBC, or TD Bank), may be able to offer you a card based on your Canadian credit history.  If these don't work, some retailers like Target or Macy's offer credit products based on your Canadian info, and you may be able to later change it to your US SSN. \n6. Figure out how your TFSA and RRSP are taxed where you are going in the US.  For example, California may tax certain distributions from RRSPs, and the IRS may not consider a TFSA a retirement account and thus it could be taxable there.","name":"t1_cz2ip6d","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-18 09:05:58","week":3}

{"id":"cz2odkf","author":"ekcunni","body":"&gt;I'm happy there's protections in place but to have no ability for staff to override the fraudulent transaction was beyond stupid to me. Banks typically text you if they suspect a fraudulent transaction. I've had all of these cleared up in under 5 minutes, to verify I wanted the transaction to proceed. But PayPal? At least at that point in time, apparently not.\n\nI have a feeling the rep explained it badly. It's more likely that they aren't permitted to do anything with it until a fraud investigation has taken place/that rep doesn't have the authority to change it. That's no different than if you try to get something at a store that needs manager approval. \n\nI agree it's bad customer service and they should have transferred you to a fraud specialist or something to get it resolved, but as you said, it was a known high-risk scenario. They were covering their butts. (And that individual employee probably covering their job.)\n\nI don't work for PayPal, I don't have any vested interest in promoting PayPal, I just don't completely get the hatred directed toward them. \n\nThis Christmas, I had my first bad experience with Amazon. I wanted to buy a particular item for my brother, and I noticed people saying on the manufacturer's site that there were issues with delays in shipping it. So I checked to see if Amazon had it, because I figured I wouldn't run into the shipping delays.\n\nI found the item, verified it was sold by and ships from Amazon and in stock (it had the \"eligible for 2 day shipping\" tag even though I didn't choose that) purchased it, and didn't think anything of it. Several days later, I hadn't gotten a shipping notification, so I live chatted with them. They assured me there had just been a delay in packaging, the holidays are busy, but it's still scheduled to arrive at the tail end of the shipping window they'd provided when I ordered. Okay, cool, no worries, I get that it's a busy time.\n\nThe last day of the original shipping window arrived and I hadn't gotten a shipping notification, so I livechatted again. This time, they told me sorry, the item is sold out; they can try to get more but they have no idea when it will be in, and didn't seem interested in assisting at all. \n\nAt that point, I was kind of irritated, because I'd specifically checked to make sure it was in stock, sold by Amazon, etc. and I had specifically livechatted several days before with a rep who told me everything was all good. I also hadn't gotten an email about my order being delayed or out of stock, which is another thing Amazon has previously done. \n\nI ended up canceling the order and was able to get it online from Sharper Image, though I paid a little more for quicker shipping because now I had less time. Meanwhile, an item I had ordered with the original item shipped, which is fine, and then I got an email saying THAT item was out of stock and couldn't be shipped, sorry, and I could cancel the order. \n\nIf that had been my first experience with Amazon, I'd have walked away with the impression that they're disorganized and have poor customer service that isn't interested in resolving an issue. \n\nThere are times when I feel like people have the equivalent of my Amazon experience with PayPal, and then hold a grudge forever. (Not saying you, just saying that's my impression on some of the issues I've heard people talk about.)","name":"t1_cz2odkf","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-18 14:51:20","week":3}

{"id":"cz2pux3","author":"kmully","body":"1. Re: labeling -- you're right, depends on volume. If you send in 300 units/month, that's $60 in labeling fees from Amazon right there (plus the potential for it to take longer to hit \"live\" inventory). $60 will get you a Zebra 2844 and some labels. Then it comes down to time and lost inventory. I think it decreases the odds your inventory is lost on check-in, especially if you don't do the pack list, but that's just me. It only takes me max 15 seconds to grab and item, add to the shipping plan, and print the label, especially if you're doing multiples. Makes sense to me to save that $60/month (+/- depending on how many items you send in).\n\n2.

He worked with diamonds,  I started there and expanded to the other precious gems and eventually vendors that made jewelry mountings so I could sell complete items instead of just loose stone.  \n\nMetals side came from a lot of research and networking.  I worked with stocks a lot,  all the way since back in freshman year of college and I became fairly good at it.  Wanted to expand into commodities or currency trading.  The latter seemed really complex and had a lot of geopolitical aspects to it that I didn't care for (as much as I love geopolitics,  I didn't want to delve in to make money).  Through my research I realized I could try and get in down stream.. Did a lot of networking and eventually found connections in East Africa.  Took a lot of risks and time but I established myself in mining there.  \n\nWatches.  I love luxury watches.  I don't know much about the retail end though.  I know that luxury brands aren't going to allow you to be a distributor/vendor unless you're a luxury brand store yourself.  Or a very well known brand within you're community that makes a certain annual revenue.  They won't want just anyone represent them.  The margins and volume are low.  Cheaper watches ($100-$3,000) have better margins and volume.  You can also just buy and sell them (mostly) without any sort of needed contract.  I have an acquaintance that went from owning a pawn shop to a small jewelry store.  He found a niche of buying watches in the $100-$1,000 range for low prices in bulk or random good deals and selling them. He's not a company per say,  but he's a successful business in terms of providing a nice lifestyle for himself.  \n\nI'm fairly young so I have a lot of really close friends that want to start behind entrepreneurs.  The one,  I think most important,  piece of advice I give them (which seems no one talks about) is that they need to establish what type of business they want to be.  What I mean by that is their end game. Are they trying to make a nice personal business that will give them a nice lifestyle,  have several employees,  heck maybe even pull in a million a year.  Or are they trying to create something that will change a industry,  be innovative,  get bought out or make it big,  become a multimillion dollar company.  There's a huge difference between these two things,  scalability being one.  You can't just say you want to start something and hope it gets big,  that's not how it works,  and that definitely not going to convince any real investors.  If you have some capital and just want to play it same but also be a business owner,  open a franchise from a sector your familiar with.  \n\nI know a lot of successful business people from family and friends.  Dry cleaning plant business that make  $300k a year (one location,  trying to expand),  small tech companies (some that are almost dead others that are getting $2mil deals from Amazon),  franchise (up to 6 locations),  and even traditional white color work like physician,  lawyer,  engineering,  consultants who want to start their own thing.  While they all make well over the average person,  and life very comfortable lives,  they all took different levels of risk.  The ones that are aiming to make companies worth 100s of millions and one day IPO or be bought out, they took the biggest risks.  They made no money for the longest.  They were more passionate about the end result than the money. And,  even if it takes a few tries, they make it to at minimum were the other guys will max out at.\n\nAs for large money to start.  It doesn't. You can start with a $1,000 flipping $10 cassio watches.

You just need to be someone who can be self taught. And also work your ass off. While everyone partied I'd be learning.  Not that I didn't have a social life,  it's vital to being a normal adult and a successful Networked,  I just choose what was worth my time,  and getting shit faced every weekend wasn't my thing,  I also didn't own any til you of gaming system/pc because I knew that's not only being unproductive but also antisocial. I got about 3-5hrs of sleep a night for almost 5 years.  Now I get to sleep whenever I want. \n\nSo. Work hard.  Master the art of mastery. Be self taught.  Network.  Listen to others.  Be confident.  Take (calculated)  risks, especially when you're younger and don't have a wife or kids and have your life and other career opportunities ahead.. Don't play video games.  Be social in the right ways,  learn to network.  Be kind and friendly to everyone.  Find your passion,  the money will come.  If not,  you're at least happy.  \n\nEdit.

{"id":"cz42ih4","author":"flashheatmvp3","body":"That best buy gcu is the best deal honestly. Something to take advantage of is the preorder system which almost always offers a bonus $10 gift card in points for pre-ordering a new game, meaning you get the game for $60 - 20 % - $10GC =$38. And this is before the points you get from just having a best buy reward zone number, pretty sure you get double points on video game items, making you about a third of the way to to a $5 reward certificate. \n\nNow as for the selling part, a combination of best buy and Craigslist can lead you to glory. New games frequently stay at $40 trade in value for a couple weeks, meaning with your bonus you can get $44. That's right once you get in a system of pre-ordering and beating games quickly you can actually earn $5 in profit of best buy gift cards for buying and playing their game. \n\nOf course that's not always the case though. I recommend as soon as you get anywhere near being done with a game or think you'd rather trade it in to put towards a different one put a Craigslist ad out there for above what you can get trade in. It's amazing how many uninformed consumers are out there who don't know the proper market value of games. The best part of this though is there is no commitment, the Craigslist post is free and you can always negotiate. If you don't get a bite or the price starts getting somewhere near what you could get at best buy or Amazon, just take the trade in money. Not worth holding onto it and the game potentially going on sale and losing a ton of value, just make it easier on yourself for what will only be a couple dollars difference. \n\nOther than always just do a price check before buying, pretty frequently it's cheaper to just price March amazon to best buy, even with their 20% discount. You still get those points though which add up quickly from buying and trading in. ","name":"t1_cz42ih4","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-19 17:51:35","week":3}

{"id":"cz4574m","author":"callmebunko","body":"It would be nice to have more information.  Is that $215 from Christmas shopping or was it your last car repair bill?  In other words, do you use the card for emergencies only?  Also, with your salary and the way you word your post, can I assume you are not about to pay it all off this month?  Another question, do you live alone on that salary?  Do you live with a relative or SO?\n\nHonestly, with your salary and if you are living alone, I would do everything I could to keep the card for an emergency, but I'd probably put it in a wallet, put the wallet in a small bag, put the bag in a larger bag, put that in a strongbox, and put that in a safe.  I'm exaggerating of course, but you get what I mean - I would do everything I could to avoid using it because even $25 a month is a lot to pay when you only earn $1,000 a month, and the interest is usurious.  Seriously, at one time only loan sharks got that kind of interest, and I'm not joking.\n\nAnd it's way too easy to put something that is really not necessary on a credit card.  Even necessary things add up.  You put something on it in the beginning of the month, and forget you did that by the end of the month and add something else.  Not good.\n\nI cut up my credit cards 30 years ago and the only annoyance for me has been trying to rent a car.  It was nearly impossible to rent a car without planning for it weeks ahead of time and gathering everything the rental car company wanted before accepting my debit card.  So two years ago I got an Amazon card (through CHASE).\n\nThere's some other advice in this thread, including putting the card on auto-pay and paying off the card every month like a responsible person.  But, if you are making $12k a year and not living with your parents, then that advice is really out of touch with your reality.  I can't say been there done that, but I can say been close done that.\n\nGood Luck.","name":"t1_cz4574m","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-19 18:55:46","week":3}

Additionally one of the features doesn't work that well, but it is passable as a product and you still have an average of 4-stars for reviews. \n\nI know that if I fix these issues, make it out of a much better plastic, and add say a new feature, or improve the poor working feature I can capture at least 10% of your market share ($30,000).

A couple of years ago, I spent $1,500 on Lego in a 3 hour span because I could. Repeated the process with clothes the next day. Bought a truck that week as well. Granted the truck was planned, but I spent more than I should have. I cannot control it when manic. Meds help, but do not stop it. \n\nSo, what we have done is this: no online accounts have cards tied to them except Amazon. My wife needs to log into Amazon for us to make a purchase. No \"one-click\" purchasing here. The cards I used to carry are locked in her gun safe so I cannot get to them. I can get them if I anticipate a large purchase. I have one Amex card I carry. It has spending limits that trigger an email alert. My wife gets CC'd on these so she can nip it in the bud. I carry cash. I have a debit card, but have to call the bank for any purchases over $500.

It sucks, but you can get through it.  \n\nThen look after your immediate future - check unemployment status, cancel any extra bills that you can (like cable) and just try to lower any and all bills you have (like don't go out to eat, eat cheaper meals like pasta or rice and beans more often).  The less you spend each month the longer you can last until the next job comes.\n\nAfter that - update the resume and start apply.  Figure out why you were fired (lack skills, massive layoff) and if it was your fault, use this downtime to try to fix the issue (learn/sharpen your skills, work on your people skills, etc).\n\nOnce you are squared away with the job hunt - it's time to go back to your finances.  Figure out what sort of eFund you will need to put in place once you get your next job.  This is the exact reason why we need eFunds - shit happens.  \n\nAnother thing I like to do (and plan to due starting in 2 weeks) is use the extra time in your day to focus on simplifying your life - sell/donate stuff you don't need (like old games, dvds, clothes that don't fit), cancel bills you don't take full advantage of (do you really need cable, Netflix, Hulu and AmazonPrime?), clean out your pantry by actually cooking the stuff in it, clean out those overfilled 'misc' drawers, etc.  ","name":"t1_cz552py","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-20 14:15:23","week":3}

I think it was through one of your affiliates. \n\nNothing against your pitch or content, I just overcommited myself. I was working on content and design and got overwhelmed with information (free and otherwise) on both topics - maybe even from the same affiliates that pitched your course! I was getting other email autoresponder series / pitches daily. Looking back, I made it through about half your series. Had I stayed the course, I would have bought your book (you priced it as an impulse buy), simply due to the value in your series. Also, somehow the remaining course emails were not \"marked as important\" by Gmail (even though the first few were) and I lost track. I'm embarrassed to say that have spent $19 on other over-hyped products that underdelivered. Seeing the value you put into your book makes purchasing a no-brainer. \n\nI also wanted to say that you did good work on the rollout. Before reading this post I expected you to have higher sales based on how seamless and professional everything looked to me. Very polished and clear - exactly what I expect from someone that promises to teach me graphic / web design.

{"id":"cz5jjxx","author":"npinguy","body":"&gt; Well, you would lose.\n\nOkay, then let's put some money down on it.\n\n1. At what rate? Bird attack loss rate can be factored into the cost. Bird repellent can be incorporated into other drones. Plus there is technological solutions to evading them.\n2. Airplanes fly in very predictable patterns, generally very high. Drones just need to stay below those levels, and give airports a wide birth\n3. This has nothing to do with Amazon drone delivery. Terrorists could ALREADY fly drones with explosives. There could be a drone with explosives outside your window RIGHT NOW.\n4. Technological problem. Cheap consumer drones don't have any of this. You bet expensive delivery drones will have statistics on all these things, and plenty of conservative algorithms to ensure they don't come close to going out of range or battery dying\n5. Umm. Yes they can? The same kind of touch screen pad that Fedex already has. Plus most deliveries don't require signatures, people just leave the packages.\n6. What's a safe area? If you watch the last Amazon drone video, part of the program involves setting up a landing area in your back yard. Seems pretty safe to me.\n7. Why do they need to?\n8. Cats and dogs attack mailmen too. Maybe people who are expecting drone deliveries won't leave their pets in the back yard.\n\nLook, technological change doesn't enter the world as-is and succeeds. It changes the world and human behaviours in unexpected ways when the tradeoffs become worth it.  Remember what Henry Ford said: If I asked my customers what they want, they'd say a faster horse.  \n\nThe government will certainly regulate the shit out of drones, and Amazon (and other companies) will have to spend a lot of effort, time, money, and innovation on making sure that all these problems are addressed. But none of them are insurmountable. The rest will come from humans changing their behaviour to fit a new paradigm - not leaving pets with back yard access to the drone delivery area, placing more faith in leaving packages out in the open while they are not present, etc. \n\nAnd I would gladly bet that within 10 years drone delivery is a part of everyone's daily routine.

The shipping and processing techniques are also extremely optimized; moreso than most could do themselves.\n\n&gt; About optimization I don't necessarily see what you are saying. \n\nThey offer discount contracts to large volume shippers. Because you're shipping a large amount of packages, you make them more money. Because they make that money in one location (your pickup point), they're willing to offer you steeper discounts for your business. If you allow your discounts to be used by everyone that logs into your service, they no longer have the ability to make the same amount of money at *one* pickup point. Now it could be a thousand pickup points. \n\nIn this way, they've lost the increased ROI from having one pickup point. They likely wouldn't offer you a discount in the first place.\n\n&gt; Ebay does that with USPS I believe. If you sign up the discount transfers to you. Maybe not in Full but it does.\n\nUSPS is the exception, not the rule. Everybody with an official address in the US is visited by the USPS—it's how you get your mail. The reason why this is possible is because USPS has free pickup. The discount doesn't actually *transfer* to you; you're just paying a portion of it for eBay. That's why it only applies to eBay labels.","name":"t1_cz5pacr","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-20 22:35:44","week":3}

If Amazon goes into a slide and the housing market crashes in Seattle, will you be able to get by on just one persons income?  After you put money down, and pay for closing costs, will you still have an emergency fund?  \n\nIf your income is solid, $750k is doable, especially considering that 11k per month is after $3k monthly IRA contributions. \n   \n$750k for a new house isn't going to get you a house in a great seattle neighborhood. Consider location over amenities. Resale value and appreciation is going to be based on being in a good neighborhood with good schools. Paying extra for a new house means that value isn't going to be there for the next buyer.   \n   \nAlso, with a new house (especially in Seattle) you have to be careful about quality. There are tons of tear downs that are being replaced by shoddy, quick work.  The contemporary boxes going up are very cheap to make, and will not hold value well, like the modern homes from the 80s you see around.   Even some of the early 2000's modern homes are looking dated in a bad way.   (You didn't talk about the style, I was just throwing that out there).\n\nMaintenence is expensive in Seattle. Water issues are everywhere, especially in older homes with basements.   \n  \nOverall, I think taking out a jumbo loan of $637.5 (assuming 15% down on $750k) is a big monthly expense, but you can make it work. If you like eating out a lot and driving nice cars and travelling, it will be tight.   \n  \nIt might be worth saving for another 6 months to get 20% down. Inventory is rediculously low in the Seattle area right now, and maybe it will get better. Or maybe it will be worse.

{"id":"cz5x9um","author":"WhiteBoythatCantJump","body":"Yeah I had no idea what was going to happen with NFLX so I didn't trade it.  It's large-cap and lots of info from sell-side following it, and international growth is tough.  Honestly I would have been bearish on the European expansion being where it was and those initiations always hitting margins with any consumer-oriented business (look at $LULU in 2013) and the stock taking a hit, but this is hindsight so who knows how I would've felt last week.  I believe we are in a bear market and that MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX accounted for almost all the positive earnings last year in the Nasdaq due to a flight of safety, so I am short all of these on valuation/macro event-driven strategy ideas mentally. In reality I'm just short AMZN, but not because I think it's a bubble.\n\nAAPL is tough because it's such a huge company, so it's getting a size discount in the market and it's not really growing and getting hit because sales in china were supposed to boost it and look at china. It's a good proxy for retail and I like the idea of being short it, but the valuation is much more reasonable compared to an AMZN or an MSFT so I don't see the short thesis playing out **as well** as the other 4 horsemen I mentioned earlier.  I think we've been in a bear market for over a year now and money is finally leaving the major US safety momo stocks and heading into gold.\n\nYou have to look at the PE and growth of the industry and decide what to do.  I have no conclusions with AAPL - but i like IBM at 8x earnings with low earnings growth expectations - why pay 15x for expected earnings growth when I can pay 8x for flat earnings/earnings decline expectations that I think should stabilize/grow?\n\nUA is a short because the mid-summer valuation, which was more mid-cap and less informationally efficient, when I shorted assumed ~20% operating margins and doubling of revenue from international expansion For comparison, NKE has a ~14% operating margin). It was at 80x earnings, so it just wasn't feasible and the market was kidding itself.   I predicted UA would be downgraded along with a general retail failure because of a strengthening dollar not incorporated into estimates earlier in the year, and look at how much bank I made.\n\nOn the flip side buying something like a DKS right now at like 9x earnings, where department stores are being hurt and the growth isn't expected so no bank is coming out to say it's going to be a buy, but the sell-side/market obviously isn't thinking that the company will do ok this quarter despite the warmest weather in history (judging by the ridiculously low 15x earnings), makes just as much sense. I'm long one of the cheapest, short-term earnings beats, and short one of the most expensive expected earnings misssers in the space, and my net is something like 25% positive, or like 35% alpha on the trade, just YTD.","name":"t1_cz5x9um","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-01-21 01:51:30","week":3}

{"id":"cz60daw","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"First rule of sales: The value of something is what you can convince someone to buy it from you for.  How much you can get in return on any purchase depends on how much effort / time you're willing to put into it.  If you want easy work, it's going to cost you profit compared to putting in the time to find someone who you can convince to buy it for the price you want, and the effort of doing so.\n\nThis means it's probably not easy work to make a profit off most of the stuff in the store.  If that were the case, you'd have people in here just load the entire store into a trailer and take it home.\n\nAmazon is probably the easiest (and most costly to you) way of selling stuff.  Then ebay, then everything else after that.  As such, you'll shed more profit when going through amazon, than through ebay, than through all the startup apps, craigslist, etc.\n\nBooks at my local Salvation Army are $0.05 to $0.20 depending on the day, and Goodwill are $2 for hardcover and $0.50 for softcover, with some specially priced ones.  If I saw books from $4 to $7, I'd probably just move onto some other section, although I would hope that if they are pushing books at that price, that they are a much higher quality / better selection than my locals.  \n\nSo, you might have some luck poking around in there, because if they DO have a better quality/selection, some of those books could command a much higher price.  I've rarely found anything at my local thrift stores that is saleable for more than $5 or $10 at most.  In fact, almost all of my saleable books came from a dumpster dive at a storage facility (easiest $200 i've ever made, and i'm still occasionally selling units from that find, although it's just the cheap ones now, 3 months later)\n\n","name":"t1_cz60daw","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-21 03:13:16","week":3}

Next week we have AAPL and AMZN. If these two guys blow it out of the water then I think that could turn this thing around. \n\nChina is pumping $60 billion into their markets. They announced today. I'm not sure how this could play out for us. It could either be great and we continue our march upward (which would suck because I sold off some long positions for a loss today) or China was the catalyst that started our sell off and we continue downwards.

{"id":"cz64obn","author":"mmass10","body":"Some areas on Amazon are saturated, sure. Those are products which are hard to differentiate. For example, garlic press - hard to differentiate the function / utility of the product. You can only really stamp your logo on it, add something to bundle it/create more value, maybe tweak the way it looks but other than that there isn't much. \n\nThat being said when I started I used a set of criteria rather than just searching like a madman. Hopefully this will help you:\n\n1) Look for a niche where I can sell multiple complimentary products (creating a brand) not just 1 product. When you create a brand of complimentary products it becomes easier to get sales when rolling out product 2, 3, 4 etc. \n\n2) Sell unisex if possible for mass appeal (not necessarily required, but I like this approach)\n\n3) Look for fragmented markets where there may be 1 or 2 leaders but the rest are not doing a good job at marketing, branding, packaging, etc\n\n4) Products that are replenishable (supplements, lotions, oils, skin, hair, beauty, etc)\n\n5) Avoid seasonal\n\n6) Find something you can differentiate (garlic press above can't be differentiated), however stretch mark cream can be differentiated if you use different ingredients, come up with a new application process (lotion + a light that helps advance the therapy) etc. Think outside the box.\n\n7) Doesn't require certifications, special requirements, etc (baby has some of these)\n\n8) Avoid products with high rate of return - clothes, shoes, etc\n\n\nThese are just some ideas. Hopefully they help.\n\nAnother tip might be to check out popular categories on amazon (sports &amp; outdoors, health and personal care, beauty) and drill down on the sidebar to subcategories and see if there are areas where you think you can add value\n\nFor example beauty &gt; skin &gt; face &gt; list of subcategories.

And if anyone is arguing that... boy, are they on the wrong sub.  \n\nI think what people are objecting to is the lack of empathy.  Most of us realize it's a bad idea and realize it's hurting them in the long run, but we can understand *why* they did it and don't feel the need to judge.  And I think the judgement is what people are objecting to, especially since the original post is by a woman who is stuck in poverty through no fault of her own and trying to drag her way out, only to be judged by people who have no idea what her situation is.\n\nNo one is disagreeing that ~~poor people~~ people in general make stupid decisions sometimes.  We're just pointing out that there are some very valid reasons they make bad decisions and so it's not reasonable to judge them too harshly for it.\n\nAlso, in the case of the friends buying video games, people are making a lot of assumptions.  I think everyone is seeing the latest console and new release games when there are much cheaper options.  A refurbed Xbox 360 is $70 on Amazon,  Fable 3 is $10.  So it's not necessarily a huge outlay.\n\nBut [this](http://killermartinis.kinja.com/why-i-make-terrible-decisions-or-poverty-thoughts-1450123558) person does the best job of explaining it:\n\n&gt;I make a lot of poor financial decisions. None of them matter, in the long term. I will never not be poor, so what does it matter if I don't pay a thing and a half this week instead of just one thing? It's not like the sacrifice will result in improved circumstances; the thing holding me back isn't that I blow five bucks at Wendy's. It's that now that I have proven that I am a Poor Person that is all that I am or ever will be. It is not worth it to me to live a bleak life devoid of small pleasures so that one day I can make a single large purchase. I will never have large pleasures to hold on to. There's a certain pull to live what bits of life you can while there's money in your pocket, because no matter how responsible you are you will be broke in three days anyway. When you never have enough money it ceases to have meaning. I imagine having a lot of it is the same thing.\n\nThe whole post is great.  Depressing, but great.  The author isn't trying to argue that she never makes bad decisions.  She admits she does.  But she also explains *why* she does.  Judging her for those decisions when even she knows their lousy just comes off as kicking her when she's down and I think that's the source of the pushback you're getting.\n","name":"t1_cz6cq6i","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-21 11:14:18","week":3}

{"id":"cz6epea","author":"kevinstonge","body":"Hivemind circlejerk? maybe, but it's a bit of a strawman argument against buying F.\n\nHow many times on this subreddit I've seen the phrase \"past performance does not indicate future performance\" only to have a traditionally flat stock compared to AMZN based on past performance. I own AMZN, but I don't expect it's meteoric rise to continue forever.\n\nI'll be honest, I do secretly expect F to make a big leap up IF they do partner with Google or Apple. I know this is a gamble, but this is far from a risky gamble - I stand to lose very little (F could fall further, but how much? 50%?? why?) It's likely to stay flat if the \"status quo\" persists. It's paying a high dividend (higher than the bonds I sold a few days ago). And it has a small chance to be a moonshot in the self-driving era.\n\nWhen you say Ford has underperformed for more than a decade, do you mean the company or the stock? If you mean the company, what metrics for comparison are you using because F looks like it's pretty competitive in terms of number of vehicles sold. I'm honestly not sure what is driving investors away from the stock (partly why I posted here to discuss it). I've been digging through numbers and news on Ford and I can't see any significant weakness here going forward. The global economic status is surely a potential threat to sales, but I have no clue how to price that into F and I'm not trying to \"time the market\". I simply see F being very low with a very high dividend and I want to buy more.","name":"t1_cz6epea","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-21 13:17:36","week":3}

My husband and I are the only ones in the US with our unusual, very long, surname. \n\nI wanted to use my username instead of my real name for ebay, but considering PayPal doesn't allow those sorts of shenanigans it would be useless. I haven't looked into a PO box because we mostly sell through Amazon and Craigslist. \n\nThe only other thing that might work for anonymity is setting up a Doing Business As (DBA) corporation, which isn't difficult.

If you get a larger package, the clerks just put a slip in your box to come back during business hours to claim it. \n\nBe aware that ebay has strict cleanliness policies on used clothing sales.  I read up on it (also a female, and also considered this). \n\nThe common way around the 'people that want these items prefer them unwashed' was that women sold a picture with themselves wearing the item (with or without their faces showing) and then included the item itself for free. \n\nSince you aren't technically selling them clothing, it makes it harder for them to get a refund later claiming inaccurate item description. Of course, Ebay sides with the customer 99% of the time, so this method is more to make the buyer THINK they won't win a claim. \n\nFYI, all this info is at least 6 years old, and I haven't looked at fetish item guidelines since. \n\nAnd though some redditors may claim we are paranoid for thinking about this kind of stuff, stalking is real.

It's difficult to imagine Walmart expanding outside of its blue collar customer base. It's certainly possible, but it'd be a very difficult road.

It's certainly a possibility. \n\nIF on the other hand, you think in 20 years, Amazon will control 20% of retail in North America, then Amazon is a pretty crappy deal. That's also a possibility too.\n\nIf you really want to know why Amazon is valued the way it is, it's because people with a lot of money, spend tons of money doing tons of market research/analysis and they believe more in the former theory than the latter theory. And those details are what you're really asking. But no one here has that info for you. \n\nWhich is why the simplistic answer to your question would be, Amazon is worth more than Walmart because in 20 years, it'll be 10x the size of Walmart. Completely BS numbers, but that's the type of size difference motivating investors. Amazon has theoretically p chance of being a monopoly for nearly ALL retail.

{"id":"cz7o97t","author":"Zig9","body":"Ok, so I wrote the thing in R a year ago, and then didn't touch it after because my work schedule went crazy. \n\nIt's pretty basic. TDA isn't nice enough to return JSON like Yahoo did, or even XML. They send you an octet stream and vague instructions on how to decode it. The upside being that that stream will contain a lot more info than Yahoo will give you. I can do stuff like pull bars for every minute of trading for a month.\n\nThe octet stream isn't human readable, but if you're curious it looks like this:\n\n&gt;[13483] ae 14 41 3f ae 14 41 3f ad ac 41 3f ad ac 41 91 1e b8 00 00 01 52 66 7c c9 00 ff ff\nattr(,\"Content-Type\")\n                           \n&gt;\"application/octet-stream\" \n\nOnly much much longer.\n\nI wrote a handful of functions in R to peel the the octet stream apart and make an R dataFrame, then later a CSV from the dataFrame. My goal was to do technical analysis, so I bought a big book of tech indicators and started coding them. I intentionally avoided using QuantMod (an R package made for finance) because I was trying to learn how the indicators worked under the hood, and because it doesn't play nicely with TDA. \n\nSeems that there's currently a bug in my code that breaks the part where I decode the octet stream, if the symbol is less than four characters long (so F is breaking). \n\nHere's what I got from requesting AMZN, daily for a month. The stuff at the top is debug stuff I threw in to try to hunt down the symbol length error before giving up and deciding to grab a different symbol:\n\n&gt;[1] \"Symbol count is\" \"1\"              \n&gt;[1] \"symbolLength\" \"4\"           \n&gt;[1] \"symbolLengthOffset\" \"0\"                 \n&gt;[1] \"Symbol\" \"AMZN\"  \n&gt;[1] \"errorCode\" \"0\"        \n&gt;[1] \"barCount\" \"21\"      \n&gt;$Symbol\n&gt; [1] AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN AMZN\nLevels: AMZN\n\n&gt;$Open\n [1] 668.50 666.83 666.50 663.35 665.56 678.00 691.89 686.08 656.29 646.86 622.00 621.80 619.66 612.48 625.25 620.88 580.25 571.87 577.09 564.73 573.58\n\n&gt;$Close\n [1] 664.51 663.15 663.70 662.79 675.20 693.97 689.07 675.89 636.99 633.79 632.65 607.94 607.05 617.74 617.89 581.81 593.00 570.18 574.48 571.77 575.02\n\n&gt;$High\n [1] 669.900 668.490 666.597 664.680 675.500 696.440 695.490 687.750 657.715 646.910 639.790 630.000 624.140 619.850 625.990 620.880 602.250 584.620 584.000 578.450 588.810\n\n&gt;$Low\n [1] 658.930 659.260 656.630 660.600 665.500 677.889 686.375 675.890 627.510 627.650 620.310 605.210 606.000 598.570 612.242 579.160 569.880 565.300 566.450 547.180 568.220\n\n&gt;$Volume\n [1] 1190616960 1187667948 1188294482 1177075558 1192437888 1197395530 1191726702 1192291976 1203026708 1197316388 1196116874 1200153883 1196661885 1195170931 1194788431 1200837715 1200312716\n[18] 1201083402 1194974344 1201344436 1195261368\n\n&gt;$Timestamp\n [1] \"2015-12-21 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2015-12-22 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2015-12-23 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2015-12-24 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2015-12-28 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2015-12-29 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2015-12-30 05:00:00 GMT\"\n [8] \"2015-12-31 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-04 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-05 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-06 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-07 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-08 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-11 05:00:00 GMT\"\n[15] \"2016-01-12 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-13 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-14 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-15 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-19 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-20 05:00:00 GMT\" \"2016-01-21 05:00:00 GMT\"\n\nI suck ass at R and only used it because finance people say it's cool.

The \"goods\" being sold are very complex - the contract of sale is going to describe them in particularity. In other words, the contract is going to define pretty clearly what it is, exactly, that is being sold. This is central to this agreement - you don't want your purchaser to come to you in a year saying \"this is not what I paid for!\" \n2. Similarly, you are going to have a long list of representations and warranties - as well as disclaimers and disclosures. This will further protect you and define what is and is not being sold, and what the circumstances of sale are. This is also central to making sure that a year from now you aren't facing an angry purchaser with a smiling lawyer next to him.\n3. Having an attorney means that there is some insurance to this deal - if you were grossly misguided, this is why your attorney will have malpractice insurance.

{"id":"cz7tnmq","author":"cbnsca","body":"&gt;A good friend of mine are working on revolutionary new business idea where we will buy cheap but good quality product from China and then resell in the US for a profit. Innovative, right?\n\nHa. Good one. \n\n&gt; The thing is... with us just getting started, we don't know how much of each we'll need. The MOQ for many of these products is 300 pieces, which at $10 a pop is not a small chunk of change. If we even only offered a few different styles, we're still talking $10k for the initial order.\n\nI am a strong believer in two things:\n\n1. Minimum Viable Product: Find out what is the best selling color  or style and get that.\n2. Unfair advantages: Makes significant improvements that have a better product than my competition. If I can't bring value to the marketplace I don't bother entering that business. I only enter the business if I can have an unfair advantage over my competition.\n\n&gt;  Another option would be to negotiate the MOQ with our supplier and offer to pay more for less quantity. Curious if there's any other creative ways of going about this that I'm not thinking about?\n\nYes, I always use my \"company policy.\" I never start by saying, \"hi, Im the founder of xyz co.\" I start with, \"I am the product sourcing specialist at xyz co.\" \n\nWhen they say MOQ is 300 I say, \"We always sample for quality, that is our company policy.\" 10 Units to start, air shipping. Then, 100 units after that because it is company policy that we don't order over 100 units during our initial order. If they can't respect that, they can fuck off, I'll get that deal somewhere else from a more cooperative company. \n\nMOQ on Alibaba or DHGate doesn't mean anything. \n\nOne tip: some clothing materials and textiles on are restricted on Amazon, meaning there is a process to go through to get them on there. It means the process of getting your listing up will take a bit longer...up to a couple of weeks. \n","name":"t1_cz7tnmq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-22 16:34:30","week":3}

{"id":"cz7ws9d","author":"redcards","body":"Obligatory...\n\nFirst, a note on free cash flow. AMZN generated $5.4bn in \"FCF\" TTM, and at the same time net cash on the balance sheet is +$2.bn. The company doesn't pay dividends, nor do the buyback stock (sharecount is +3% YoY), so where is all the free cash going if not to the balance sheet or back to debt/shareholders? Right back out of the Company's (Bezos'?) wallet to fund capital leases. The Company does loosely account for this though, and they've provided an adj. FCF number of $670m. However, once we factor in $2b TTM SBC, and the financing in the amount of $1.3bn/year, we can assume AMZN is actually generating negative FCF on a $28bn invested capital base and $290bn market cap.\n\nI know this board as a hard on for talking about AMZN's P&amp;L, and I am going to spend sometime talking about that, but before we do we have to understand the nature of their capital and financial leases.\n\nToday, AMZN has just under $3bn in capital &amp; financial leases for 2016 on their balance sheet. However, we need to break that number down to determine what % can be capitalized as with server/storage leasing and buildings/land for the rest of the Company's operations. The difference matters because servers and storage leases can be capitalized at 3x or 4x, while buildings and land are higher at 7x or 8x. So as recent as 2010, forward lease commitments were $450m. We can assume that this was mostly all non-AWS, and if we double that, given the revenue growth from 2010-2015 at the retail business, we can back out about $1bn in leases for land/buildings and capitalize it at 8x. The other $2bn of leases we'll capitalize at 3x because servers burn out quickly (regardless of what some \"computer experts\" on here will argue). So combined, the debt from leasing that AMZN is carrying is about $14bn. Plus $8bn in financial debt = $22bn in debt. Contrast that against $3bn in net ST assets and $12bn in equity. They are, effectively, a debt issuing, equity printing machine rather than a cash generative, shareholder friendly business...\n\nOk, now that we've figured that out we can talk about the P&amp;L as we'll be referencing our invested capital base in that discussion. Specifically, lets talk about AWS. Quarterly margins were 25%, but lets back out some SBC expense, and even with that you get 15-20% margins which are not bad. This argument is not that AWS is doing a bad job at generating profit. However, consider the capital base necessary to generate those margins - $20bn in net PPE - which is massive. AAPL, which is in manufacturing and does 2x more revenue than AMZN, only has $21bn in PPE. Okay, so lets consider something more \"utility\" like such as Con-Ed (NYSE: ED). ED is on track to generate $13bn revenue and $2.5bn EBIT, 18% margins, with $29bn PPE - sounds a lot like AWS numbers, no? However, ED is only $19bn market cap. Obviously AMZN is growing much faster than ED, so lets consider another example using the largest US utility by market cap - Duke Energy, (NYSE: DUK), $50bn market cap. DUK generates $25bn revenue and $5.5bn in EBIT, about 20-25% margins. Keep in mind, this is with $72bn PPE. The take away here is that $72bn PPE is A LOT of capital!. If AWS were to grow into their $100bn+ valuation, they would need to scale their capital base more efficiently or else AWS is going to have to get a $150bn PPE at some point. Which could be very interesting considering the largest PPE balance in the US is BRK with $140bn.\n\nSo the conclusion. This is not an argument that AWS is not growing its cash flow and profit. This is an argument that AWS's capital base is growing just as quick, probably faster, and not scaling anywhere near the levels most tech companies scale at under those capital inputs. AMZN's invested capital dynamic is more like a utility and less like a tech company.\n\nTl;dr - they don't have the money to do what you think they can do.

Many of the affiliate programs out there link to sub-par or at least unknown sites which can scare people off.\n\n2.  Amazon oftentimes has the best price.  Many savvy shoppers will find the item that they want and then see the best place online that they can get it.  Even if you get that affiliate click, if they then turn around and buy it elsewhere there goes your commission.\n\n3.  Amazon has a HUGE amount of items, and many of your sells will be from customers buying things not even related to your niche.  Remember, you get commission for every item they purchase for 24 hours, not just ones related to your site.\n\n4.  You can actually get over 6% commission if you sell enough items.

Potentially more utilization, more efficient utilization if one thinks price signals get more cars when/where they're needed/faster pickup time, less cruising. Questionable how much shows up in statistics. \n\nBut if it does, it would be more comp per hour for the labor/capital invested by the driver, with minimal tech investment.\n\nSimilar applies to Amazon cloud...they do all the investment, productivity gain if any is from the companies that need fewer IT employees, use all the apps that run off the cloud. To get a useful answer to whether tech investment is increasing a company's productivity, you have to look at the investment in all the SaaS and IaaS products they use, the tech investment underlying their whole value chain. \n\nSo I'm not sure how useful that study of IT intensity is in determining how much tech benefits the productivity of the economy as a whole.

{"id":"cz83o4k","author":"bg_20","body":"That's kind of difficult to give an answer to in general, so I would preface this with \"sometimes\" as the short answer.\n\nIf there was a situation where you have an arrangement with someone, that you met on GCX, and traded with through GCX, then by all means confirm that on your profile. Now, if you and your trading partner want to make that a regular thing, and don't want to make posts on GCX and just want to stick with trading with each other (say, if you're getting Amazon gift cards from /r/beermoney and have a consistent amount coming in), then you can just keep going over PM, and you don't have to post a thread on GCX with a comment.\n\n**But**, if you're making a flair request and the mods ask for proof, or if the mods just happen to notice these confirmations, invoke Rule 3 and ask to see proof of the trades to make sure they're genuine and the rep isn't being faked, then you obviously should be able to provide proof.\n\nFinally, the only other issue is if you are making trades that break the rules of GCX, but then confirming them on GCXRep. We had some users who were trading thousands of dollars of gift cards that were unverified per Rule 5. They were doing it all over PM, which is fine - we can't control that, and frankly, we don't want to. But then they were confirming these trades on GCXRep. When other people starting noticing these trades, and no moderator approval per Rule 5, and no reddit posts about them, we got multiple reports about it, and rightfully so. Even though these users knew what they were doing, you can't just do something that goes against GCX's rules in private, but then try to get the benefit of the rep for it. If you want to use GCX, follow the rules. If you want to branch out and do your own thing, by all means go ahead - but don't post about it on your rep profile, if it wouldn't have been allowed on GCX.\n\nWe don't have any desire to interfere with people who have something good going in private. We're not looking to rain on anyone's parade, and we're not sticklers. But if they're going beyond GCX's rules, then it should stay in private. They know the risks, they can do what they want. Just keep it out of GCX entirely at that point, and don't encourage other people to do the same thing, because they might not be able to handle it. That's been our policy so far, and it's worked out pretty well.\n\nIf you or anyone reading this has any thoughts on any of this, please do share them!","name":"t1_cz83o4k","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2016-01-22 20:29:19","week":3}

My parents were frugal so while most of my friends spent all of their money I always made sure to sacrifice a little bit so that I could always save at least something. I have also always been debt averse. I have never carried a long term balance on my credit cards and haven’t paid any interest on them for several years. My parents handed off a car to me and I was doing a double payment to get it paid off very quickly. I drove it for several years without a payment and only traded it in when it started to have some serious issues. I got a great deal on my truck because gas was very high at the time. I put a lot down and then paid off the loan in less than 2 years. So far I have had it for 8 or 9 years and I hope to get another 10 out of it because I can't get anything comparable without spending a lot more than I did for it. I did have another vehicle in there but that was a $700 Bronco that I bought for recreational purposes and I ended up selling it because I didn’t want to put the money into it. It was never a commuter vehicle and my truck now serves as both.\n\nWhen I was 20 or 21 I opened a ROTH IRA after a friend suggested I keep no more than a few months worth of expenses in cash. I maxed that out every year and still put money in the bank. The company I work for eventually offered an unmatched 401k and I started to put 6% of my pay into that as well. When the recession hit I foolishly stopped contributing to the rIRA but continued to collect cash. As things started to recover and I realized I shouldn't have stopped contributing I immediately maxed my rIRA for the previous year and the current year(it was between Jan and April) and opened a taxable brokerage account to put the rest of my cash in the market. I didn't get in at the bottom of the market but I still did pretty good and got a big boost from that.\n\nAnother thing that has helped me immensely is that I have also always had roommates so my living expenses are very low. When I moved out of my parent's house I moved in with a couple of friends and was only paying $350/month. I saved up and bought a house with 2 other friends and we have been living together ever since.\n\nI haven't done everything right though. We bought the house at the peak of the market and it is currently worth a little more than half of what we paid for it so that sucks. The roommates are currently getting ready to move so I will be taking over full payment soon so my expenses will be going up a lot.  I am fine with it thought because I am really looking forward to living alone for a while. I may end up taking on 1 roommate eventually though. Earlier this year I took out enough money to pay off the second mortgage when they leave so my expenses don't explode too much. It has been sitting there only collecting 1% but there was a lot of talk about the market being due for a correction and I knew I would need it in the short term and I didn't want to get caught having to pull it out after. I got that one right at least.\n\nI don't recall exactly which mutual funds I originally invested in for my rIRA. I know I had a big chunk in the Fidelity Balanced fund which is a 60/40 stock/bond split IIRC. My 401k was in their Aggressive fund. When I opened my taxable brokerage account I started conservative with a tax free muni bond fund. Eventually I moved over to index funds. My taxable account is all in US stock index funds now. rIRA is in total market/US bond/foreign/REIT funds which I rebalance myself. My 401k is just a target date fund because my available funds aren't all that great. And as I said before I have good chunk in savings which I plan to put into the house when my roommates leave. I’ll probably start aggressively paying down the first mortgage after that so that I can at least get my mortgage balance down to the market value.\n\nMy current savings plan isn’t anything special. I actually prefer the hands on approach over automatic investments for the most part. I don’t particularly care to follow a budget. For me budgeting is to figure out if you can afford something not a plan that must be followed. What I do is pay off all of my bills every pay day and immediately move the rest over into either my rIRA or my taxable account. I put everything on credit cards for cash back rewards and keep no more than $500 in my checking account and $2-3000 in my savings account for cash emergencies. One of my credit cards gets me 2% on all of my purchases when used to fund my rIRA so that has been my main card for years. Recently I got a CC that pays 5% on groceries, bookstores(Amazon), and gas which is a pretty sweet card.\n\nMy suggestion for you is to start learning about investing. I like to suggest All About Asset Allocation by Richard Ferri as a good intro book. If you aren’t much of a reader consider it time spent investing in your future.  Just buy it and read 1 chapter a day until you are done with it. You will get a lot out of it. Research 401ks and IRAs so you understand the details of how they work. If your company offers a 401k with a match start contributing everything you can up until they stop matching. Not taking advantage of that match is saying no to a raise. Open an IRA (traditional or ROTH) and put what you can into that. Saving 20% is great but you can probably do more. Work on finding ways that help you save. If that means budgeting and automatic contributions then do it. Just remember that to save money you have to not spend it. Look for ways to cut costs. Get rid of cable, research cheap cell phone plans, eat out less often, etc. Eventually all of your purchases should start with a cost to benefit analysis.\n\nI don't have a high income like some but I've always followed \"save early, save often\" to get where I am. You can't got back in time to start saving earlier but you can always start saving aggressively right now. Try to add at least $100k to your net worth over the next 10 year.","name":"t1_cz8bxko","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-22 23:46:37","week":3}

{"id":"cz8ja84","author":"[deleted]","body":"OP is completely accurate why I'm finished with risking my money in mutual funds, index funds, or any other types of funds where you pay someone a fee for them to thoughtlessly park your hard earned money. These funds are invented for people who are lazy and clueless about what they're doing. The smartest guys are the managers who make a percentage off the hundreds of billions under management. This adds up to hundreds of millions in compensation regardless whether they make money for you or not. The only thing they promise is that you will outperform 50% of stocks but also under perform 50% of stocks, just by its nature of being the average. Keep in mind the average return of all stocks is not the same as the average return of all investors so there will be a lot of losers who will tell you it is impossible to beat the market.\n\nThere are people who will tell you the market is gambling and therefore you should just invest in the overall market because at least you have positive expectation, but have you ever wondered how some of your wishlist stocks would've done this past year? Just as an example, some popular technology stocks have done very well, TSLA(8%), FB(34%), MSFT(20%), GOOG(44%), AMZN(117%), NFLX(134%), whereas other very recognizable companies have done well too, DIS(11%), NKE(30%), V(18%), MA(13%), GE(23%), KO(2%). The point is opportunity is out there and you are only holding yourself back by being stuck in these blood sucking funds. You will have to tolerate a fair amount of volatility, but that is an unavoidable fact of life.\n\nRemember these funds are invented primarily for morons that can't even read or do simple arithmetic, let alone analyze a company's financial prospects. Index funds have no reactive ability and you have no control over holdings, so by default will not incorporate the latest financial news and information. \n\nLearn the proper value investing techniques. Practice trading. Unless you're still living in the stone ages or somehow cripplingly tech-challenged, there is absolutely no reason not to believe in yourself. Be serious about yours and your family's financial future. Investing is not supposed to be fun. Educate yourself and proceed rationally, not in the pursuit of the rush. Don't bet on a whim, because that is a guarantee road to poverty.\n\n","name":"t1_cz8ja84","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-23 03:22:30","week":3}

{"id":"cz90ic4","author":"theta_tard","body":"I'm most comfortable as a seller.  The early calls were because they were covered, and in the early week the market was down pretty nicely, so they quickly dropped and I pocketed the premium.  The puts were because by Wednesday it felt like we were stagnating a bit - volatility was coming down and everything seemed a bit oversold, but I wasn't ready to call 'bottom' so selling puts (at that point still pretty far OTM) seemed like the best way to play and hedge at the same time.  Also, with the put, I have some money freeing up where I would actually be totally okay entering SPY at $177 this coming week - long term I liked that valuation.  But there was some speculation that the market probably wasn't going to continue downward.\n\nThe AMZN put was actually briefly ITM, which scared me, but I wanted to cash in on the volatility and it worked out okay.  The buys at the end of the week are basically synthetic longs - I was calling bottom and want more delta/leverage on the way up - kept them deep ITM because when they were basically all intrinsic value and only a buck or two theta, so I figured even if I have to hold them for a month or three I shouldn't get scalped too badly.  Also, with all my naked puts, I was tapped out of margin - with a lot of them expiring this weekend I should be back in the game Monday, though.\n\nMy broker doesn't show delta/vega, but my expectation is that my delta was extremely high - higher than I'm comfortable with.  Like I said, a lot of this feels like luck - if the market had turned back downwards Friday I could have had a couple of big losses at this point.","name":"t1_cz90ic4","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-01-23 17:18:13","week":3}

{"id":"cz96o6y","author":"redcards","body":"Just out of curiosity, really for the fun of it, can all of those who are parroting the \"future profits come later because they reinvest revenue back into the company\" line do a brief explanation of just *how exactly* that phenomenon works when you flow it through the financial statements? \n\nLets just do a brief example - again, just for the fun of it. \n\nI have AMZN's most recent financial statements in front of me and I'm looking at their P&amp;L (income statement). I personally disagree with looking at P&amp;L for a Company's profitability and prefer to look at the cash flow statement, but everyone talks about AMZN's P&amp;L for some reason so we will analyze this statement to see if it makes sense.\n\nFor FY14 they generated $88.9bn in revenues and incurred $88.8bn in operating expenses. These operating expenses include cost of sales, fulfillment, cost of technology, etc But they are operating expenses, not R&amp;D and *not* reinvestments back into the company for growth. \n\nYou may argue that \"cost of technology\" is their R&amp;D, and that this is where the growth is being reinvested into. I disagree with this because in the Company's annual report they report this figure to be \"cost of AWS and Amazon Prime/Video Content. I disagree with this because we know that all AWS growth expenses are accounted for in off-balance sheet arrangements the Company has because the growth is so extensive that people would claw their eyes out if they really saw what they were spending on it. So I suspect that this account is for Prime Video Content, again, just an expense. \n\nAfter operating expenses we have interest payments and income taxes left, neither of which are growth investment accounts. \n\nSo after we subtract operating expenses, interest payments and income taxes we are left with AMZN's negative profitability. \n\nHowever, and this is whats important, the reason for this lack of profitability IS NOT because revenue is being flowed into growth investments as people like to claim. It is not being reinvested back into the business, the business is not profitable because AMZN incurs huge losses on themselves in order to give customers a good deal. \n\nIf we want to look at where AMZN is reinvesting back into growth we need to look at their cash flow statement and we can see that AMZN spends approximately $5bn in capital expenditures, and another $5bn in capital expenditures related to growing their AWS operations. When you factor these expenses into their cash, they have negative cash profitability as well. \n\nThe only reason AMZN is able to fund their growth investments is not because they generate so much revenue, its because they raise tons of cash through issuing massive amounts of debt and equity, and the equity part dilutes YOU, the SHAREHOLDER. \n\nSo again, that was just for fun. But even doing it for fun we can see that AMZN\"s lack of profitability is not a result of revenue being flowed back into the business, its because the Company just sucks at being profitable.

{"id":"cza14ee","author":"Badgerisbest","body":"People often think of the startup investment as a 1 in 10 thing. 1 pops, 3 meh/OK 6 failures or no return on investment. Some have tried to become much more rigorous in their investment philosophy as their vc experience has matured. The ones who actually know what they are doing successfully increase the success rate of investments to something. More like 1 huge pop, 2 respectable slower growing companies, 2 Meh of which maybe one fails a long time from now. \n\nI work around the Chicago scene, not directly investing but since I'm at a financial firm I'm often around startup people and around VCs though networking. I'm meeting companies asking for deals and those seeking deals all the time and asking how I can help. We use the connections to help build our own businesses in different financial areas than VC, because follow the money or sit yourself helpfully next to it and we do well too. If I was given $5 million or even $1 million there would have been some I really want to invest in. \n\n* lack of capital. You invest but maybe you don't have enough partners. \n\n* not supporting your investment enough. Something people have great ideas but they really don't have a lot of experience in business. A lot of them need extra help, which can push them to the next level.\n\n* the best deals are the most hyper competitive deals. The serious Chicago companies have the most competitive vc process, where they can turn investors away rather than constantly begging people. If you are not bringing big money and a support network a smart founder is not going to dilute equity he could give to someone else. \n\n* misaligned deals. Founders don't offer enough equity or too much. Both result in lack of cash and trouble later. They could be too conservative in handing it out or if they keep aggressively diluting investors then people get annoyed and don't want to invest any more. VCs can be too greedy. This can mean that other investors have trouble getting a decent deal and just  decide to not invest at all. It has to be just right. \n\n* hyper competition. You really have to have a product or way to make money that won't be vultured in 10 months. This isn't like Snapchat or Facebook anymore where you can amass 20 million users and grow and then figure it how to make money. People want results and money fast now, and then you have competing startups nipping at your heals. \n\n* lack of eyes and ears everywhere. I now know most of Chicago very well. I network with these people often and every time I tell people what I do I get told of a new project. I don't know what's happening in Austin or San Francisco until it gets big because I don't have time really. Read builtinchicago.com builtinaustin builtinLA ect. \n\n* behemoths like Uber, Facebook, or Amazon that have the user base advantage. I've seen maybe two or three startups come up with something original and then Uber just adds it to their app 6 months later and effectively kills it. Why should you get carpools or food deliveries when there are half the drivers? Maybe Uber eats isn't always the best quality or whatever but still. Hard to run and covert business like that. This is one reason why b2b is better because business decisions makers weigh options seriously. \n\n\n* San Francisco money/money way bigger than your projects. Chicago has an innovative startup/business that they've worked with years of sweat and planning with respectable growth? Finally seeks some investment to grow because they've proved traction. San Francisco shits out a facey app and nice website along with 10 million more dollars and tries to come into your market with Facebook and Google adds. See Shurpa vs Doorman. Who does it better? Who cares, advertising grows the user base faster. \n\n* being greedy and going for a sky high valuation instead of something reasonable. \n\n* not having an exit plan if you want to exit. Think of Braintree. Bought by PayPal, because they created something good in payments that a big company wanted to buy. If you want to exit your company, you sure as hell have to have something a business vertical or industry will want. This can be helped by being really strong in B2B rather than B2C\n\n* other investors or people can't understand the founders idea or value even if it's really really strong potential if they pull it off. That's part of salesman ship and should be helped along by investors or support networks. I watched a guy demonstrate how his company could avoid antibiotics from becoming useless b/c they were resistant to bacteria and was amazed but 1/2 the room didn't get it. He was touring and presenting to a lot of People, sometimes you can get better investment from people in industry or out of industry depending on how different your product or service is. \n\n* delusional Founders. Some guys and gals just can't cut it and they need to be told to get out. Maybe they are awful bosses. Maybe they need a partner who can nail public speaking. Maybe they lie a lot. This can make them so desperate it can lead to bad incentives or actions. \n\n","name":"t1_cza14ee","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-24 16:10:02","week":3}

{"id":"cza9uyq","author":"MervGoldstein","body":"I started SB in late Sept/Early October and so far my lifetime SB is around 43,000. My highest daily SB was about 1100. By far I've had the best luck on surveys and typically only do a few web searches and misc. offers to close in on a gift card (ie 480 SB and trying to quickly get a $5 Amazon card). \n\nOccasionally a few times a week I'd get lucky and hit a few 300/400 SB surveys which helps greatly. \n\nInitially, I was really focused, getting my daily goal every day for a few months and earning about 300 SB daily, with some average days as high as 800. All the goal bonuses add up, so it is helpful too. \n\nI think my best month so far netted me $130 in Amazon cards. But, I was working frequently with it to help with Christmas money. \n\nAfter the holidays, I'm much more lax and stopped focusing so much on meeting my goal every day. A month of daily goals is like 300 extra SB, which is nice, but lately I miss a few days here and there but still manage high earning days occasionally. So instead of $120 a month, January was a bit less and around $75 at this point. \n\nOh, and since most folks including myself strictly go for the Amazon cards, take advantage of the 1 discounted card you get each month...You can get 1 $25 Amazon card for 2200 SW, which saves you 300 SB. I typically start saving at the end of the month, roll my monthly bonuses into it and grab it at the beginning of the following month.\n\nThough lately, the surveys just haven't been quite as plentiful and disqualifications are getting ridiculous.
