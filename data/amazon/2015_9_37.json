{"id":"3jxruv","author":"pspman317","body":"So I got bored today so I decided to count up how much beermoney I've earned since the start of the year. Looking at the approximate total I got after doing the math is not bad for something that requires little to no effort. Although for now I have taken a break from beermoney and am mostly using passive ways. So after going back to various sites and apps trying to get the numbers to add up this is what I got. As of now I've earned $209.51 in paypal from various sites and apps. As of for Bing Rewards I've earned $70 on my main account which I did all my searches legitly with no bots. At one time I did have 5 accounts, but I don't have the numbers for them, only my main account is left. As of for $wagbucks I made $171 Amazon Gift Cards and cashed out to paypal a few times with them also. With DataCoup I've made $8.59 so far. With Media Insiders Mobile I've made $20. Google Opinion Rewards has made me $15.67 so far. I've made $60 worth of Amazon Gift Cards using Perk TV. Google Screenwise has made me $57. After adding up all the paypal money I've made a total of $218.30. And Amazon Gift Cards came to a total of $321. So I've made approximately $539.30 worth of beermoney so far. That's not too bad with the numbers I've gathered. I pretty sure the number is a little higher if I had the numbers from the other bing accounts. I also didn't included ReceiptPal. So I would say I've made at least $600 with the numbers I couldn't gather. As of for my set up when I ran beermoney I used 3 moto gs and my personal moto g along with a kindle and my laptop. Looking back on my beermoney journey is crazy after doing the math. I remember the days when all I did was Bing and $wagbucks, but thanks to this place I learned about so many other ways to earn beermoney. All this money was made with little to no effort and this subreddit has definitely helped.

{"id":"3k4z0k","author":"ajosefox","body":"So, I’m green and looking for some strategic advice. I did a bit of an AoR a couple weeks back and personally applied/was approved for the PRG, Platinum, CSP and Preferred cards. My wife applied/was approved for a CSP and a Freedom card. We don’t really have any immediate travel plans, just looking rack up the most points with the least cards and HPs. There are a couple of more cards I’d like to get, though and am hoping for some feedback on a plan for the two of us. \n\nFirst off, I’d really like to take advantage of the 30K SPG offer before it expires. With both the business and personal cards we could net 120K between the two of us. Second, since I’ve also got the Preferred card and the CitiGold checking I think the Prestige may be a good one to add in a couple months. I could use it to fund a CitiGold savings before downgrading the CitiGold checking to a regular checking. Finally, and the highest priority is getting a SW CP next year.  \n\nNow, with all that said I guess what I’m really wondering is how badly I’d be hurting our chances of getting the SW RR cards for the CP by applying for the SPG and Prestige cards. My thought is that the two of us could get personal and business SPG cards. Then in a few months I’d apply for the Prestige and have her apply for the two SW CCs. That sound like a mistake? Skip the SPG all together? Only one of us apply? Any thoughts are appreciated.  \n\nOur Income: ~$150K.  \n\nMyself:  \n\n1. FICO - 732, Transunion - 746, Equifax - 742\n2. My cards - Too many. Ten currently open (closed some cards in the past before I knew any better). AAoA 3yrs. 3mo. Most recent: Chase 8/15, CU CC 6/15, Amazon Store 3/15, Rent Inquiry 4/14. PRG, Platinum, Citi will be showing up soon.\n\n\nMy Wife:\n\n1. FICO - ???, Transunion - 756, Equifax - 759\n2. Her cards - Amex 8/13, CB/JCREW 3/11, Chase 1/09, Discover 9/08, CU CC 6/15. New CSP and Freedom aren’t showing up yet.  \n\nA bit more about our scores: I’m guessing her’s is going to increase with the additional cards. She’d only had five prior to the new CSP and Freedom. Mine I’m sure will drop. However, I’ve recently written a goodwill letter to remove an old (2009) late payment and was added to three older 1986-ish cards from my folks. So, I hope that’ll offset things a tiny bit.  \n\nApologies if this was more fitting for What Card Wednesday. I already know which cards I’d like. So, I wasn’t sure if it was more appropriate to post there or in it’s own thread.\n","name":"t3_3k4z0k","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-09-08 22:22:15","week":37}

{"id":"3k7ax0","author":"jl2121","body":"Hello from Amazon,\n\nWe are offering a promotional credit of up to $5,000 on Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) Pick &amp; Pack fees for sellers who opt in to the promotion and provide accurate box content information for each box they send to Amazon fulfillment centers from now until December 31, 2015.\n\nBy providing us with the contents of your boxes, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to make your products available for sale. Starting early next year, all FBA sellers will be required to provide this information for each box they send to Amazon. Once this requirement goes into effect, boxes with missing or inaccurate information may be subject to additional fees.\n\nTake advantage of this promotion now to get a head start on adjusting to the new requirement and also earn an FBA Pick &amp; Pack fee credit of up to $5,000.  \n\nHow it works:\n\nOpt in to the promotion in the Inbound Settings section of your FBA settings. The registration window opens today and closes on November 16, 2015.\n\nOnce registered, you will be required to provide accurate box contents for each shipment you send to an Amazon fulfillment center.\n\nDuring the promotional period, you will be eligible for a $0.04 Pick &amp; Pack credit for each unit you send to an Amazon fulfillment center with accurate box content information. You will earn that credit when you make a sale of any product through FBA.  You can earn a maximum of $5,000 in total credits during the promotional period.  The promotional period will end on December 31, 2015, and credits will no longer be available even if you had not earned the maximum of $5,000 by that time.\n\nAll credits you have earned will automatically be paid to you in January 2016.\n\nPlease note that this promotion does not apply to units fulfilled through the FBA Small and Light program.\nFor additional information, please see our promotion help page.\nProviding box contents to Amazon:\n\nYou will be able to provide us with the contents of your boxes (including expiration dates, if applicable) using any of the following methods:\n\nDownloading a template that you can fill out and upload to Seller Central\n\nUploading an XML file via Amazon Marketplace Web Services (MWS)\nApplying a 2D barcode with box content information to each box\nFor less than truckload (LTL) and full truckload (FTL) shipments, box labels printed from Seller Central are now unique for each box.  This allows you to match the contents of each box with the appropriate box number.  Please note that you will no longer be able to copy a single box label and apply it to multiple boxes, since each label is unique.  This change applies to all sellers, regardless of whether you participate in the promotion.    \n\nRegistration closes on November 16, 2015. If you have any additional feedback or questions, feel free to contact us at promo-box-contents@amazon.com\n\nThank you for selling on Amazon.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Fulfillment by Amazon team","name":"t3_3k7ax0","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-09 08:04:41","week":37}

Pre-orders for Rock Band 4 are sold out @ bestbuy.com.  And the Amazon ranking for the Band in a Box bundle is holding strong in the top 30.  \n\nThis is going to be a big win for Madcatz.  There is still plenty of time to hop on before the train leaves the station.  They are a small company with a product that is most likely going to be a success, and will have a big impact on their bottom line.  \n\nTake a look at the share price from a few years ago when the Rock Band games were in full swing if you want an idea of the potential here.  I'm not saying it will hit 2.00 / share.  But as MCZ is now the publisher of the game, they will be making significantly more on this product than they had in the past.  \n\nThe rest of the products they make are pretty subpar.  But really don't mean much compared to the potential of RB4.  \n\nAnyhow, to those of you that hopped on board last time, congrats.

I was looking around online to see if anyone else was doing this and I found nothing, only people selling bulk cases of canned dog and cat food.

{"id":"3ka8dt","author":"Bender1012","body":"It's common knowledge that most cards that are churnable have a certain timetable before you can get the signup bonus again. Chase 24 months, Citi 18 months, Amex never, etc. \n\nHowever, has anyone tried bypassing this by trying for a different bonus on the same card? For example, Chase United 50K after getting the 30K. Amex Blue Cash $200 after getting the $100. Plenty of others. The hope would be that these specific bonuses are unique in their database and thus when you get that card again, you technically haven't received \"that\" bonus before. \n\nThe most promising example I have would be the Citi ThankYou Preferred, which I got several months ago with a $150 Amazon GC signup bonus. That signup bonus is fundamentally different from the normal 20K TY Points bonus so I could see it being tracked differently.

{"id":"3kap2w","author":"WhiteWolfofUtah","body":"So I have an Amazon CC that I've used for bigger purchases, but also to just help boost my credit. What I've been doing is when I do the purchase I would purchase it with the CC, and then pay it off as soon as it showed up on my statement. I later found out that it's better to wait until it actually shows up as the minimum balance, as that will help your credit score more.\n\nSo what I decided to do was apply for a CC through Goldenwest (my credit union) and just use it strictly for emergencies, and to pay my car payment each month to get into that practice. I was approved and everything, and this is my first time really reading through a credit report. Most of it made sense, but if I'm reading it correctly, it had some things listed as negative that don't really make sense, so I was wanting someone to explain them to me! \n\n(Just as an FYI, I have looked through the FAQs and couldn't find my answers there, and I did do some browsing on Google but couldn't really find anything)\n\nOne other thing to note is that I completed these papers online, and parts of the text have been cut off so I'm not sure exactly what it says, but I'll give everything that's listed. Anyways, here goes! :\n\nIt has my credit score listed as: 0702, which I take to mean that my credit score is 702? If so, yay :D Then after a few more things, it has a section for key factors that adversely affected my credit score, which are:\n\n- 14 - Length of time accounts have been establis (This is where it cuts off. I assume that's the length of time that accounts have been established. Does that mean that accounts haven't been open long enough to really be a positive thing yet?)\n- 12 - Length of time revolving accounts have bee (This is where this one cuts off, I really don't know what a revolving account is...)\n- 15 - Lack of recent bank/national revolving info\n- 08 - Too many inquiries last 12 months\n\nI understand what the last one means, but other than that I was wondering if someone could shed some light on what each of the others mean, and what the numbers mean too..

{"id":"3kbzzd","author":"Vexxicus","body":"Hey guys,\n\nI had never heard of the Sallie Mae credit card until I saw it mentioned in the \"can I live without credit?\" post.  Most of my purchases are Gas, Groceries, and especially Amazon.  Currently, I have the Amazon Chase card, and the Amazon store card.  I got the chase card because that was before getting 5% back on Amazon Store Card, once I saw that, I got it.  I purchase everything on Amazon, including a lot for work and get reimbursed and we keep the rewards.  This year I've spent a few thousand and have gotten hundreds in rewards, but it would be nice to be able to apply those rewards to other purchases, or let them add up for a rainy day, as opposed to getting a credit every month - which is also nice because its kind of like getting cash..\n\nI'm wondering if opening up this other credit card would hurt my credit score in a way that it wouldn't be worth being able to apply the rewards to other purchases / more reward points.\n\nI'm 23, I started at 18 with a credit card from my bank but close it since I was stupid and thought I should since I got the Amazon chase card.  So now I have an Amazon chase card, amazon store card, car loan, and student loans.  My current credit score if I remember is ~740-750.  I do want to get a house in the next 5 years or so, probably sooner. I know if I get it, I'll leave the other cards active and might it help since I don't have many accounts open?\n\nShould I get the Sallie Mae card?\n\nThanks for any info guys! \n\nEdit: I just want to note I've never missed a payment or had any bad mark on any of my accounts either.","name":"t3_3kbzzd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-10 03:42:08","week":37}

{"id":"3kcq1l","author":"NotDaPolice","body":"Hello, I've had 5 credit cards and I am down to just 2 left. When my 3rd card closed my credit score dropped from 759 to 752. Is it probably/mostly due to losing the age on the account or could it also have to do with available credit?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n  2006 opened a Chase/Amazon card. Still used for everything and paid off monthly.\n\n &amp;nbsp;  \n\n  2006 opened a Citi bank card. This card had fees and no rewards so I closed it once getting my foot in the credit door in 2008.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n  2008 opened a FNB card. I believe this was a Jeep card that the terms and rewards program changed due to the Chrysler bankruptcy. After losing all of my points I had accumulated towards Jeep parts I hated this card. I left it in my closet just to have the account but it eventually closed in 2012.  \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n  2010 opened a Sears card. I got a sweet discount on a nice TV and some socket sets. Sears closed down everywhere near me and they closed the account due to inactivity in June 2016.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n  2010 opened a JC Penney card. I got a sweet deal on a suit and some dress clothes.  There aren't really any of these stores left around me so I'm guessing this account will close soon too.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n  Apparently every card I use I cause them financial stress except Amazon.

{"id":"3key8a","author":"Always_Excited","body":"I had this $500 secured credit card with PNC for almost two years. I also rode along my mother's car loan.  Earlier this year I applied for PNC cash builder and was denied, but was approved for target credit card (5% at target), sallie mae (5% at Amazon), and Amazon credit card (I did this one before learning about sallie). I was initially given 300 limit for target but they upped it to 800 after five months. Amazon and sallie both gave me 3100 limit.\n\nI recently applied for pnc cash builder again and got denied again. They really don't like the loan amount vs my income. Anyway, now that I have some real credit rolling, can I go ahead and terminate the secured credit card? It charges $3 monthly and I don't see a reason to use it now that I have cards that give me rewards. I would like pnc cash builder because that's the checking account branch I use, but I don't see the car loan going away in less than two years. I suppose there's citi double cash card but I doubt I'll qualify now that I had so many hard checks this year. The secured card is the oldest credit line I have so my credit score will probably take a hit when I get rid of it.

{"id":"3khc5m","author":"bridgesro","body":"Last month I launched a business called breezybuy, selling template websites for Amazon sellers who need approval from Amazon to sell in certain restricted product categories. I'm a member of the biggest Amazon seller Facebook groups, so I thought I had a good idea of what people wanted. I came up with the idea on August 6th and launched the business the next day, spending only $20 to do so.\n\nI thought I hit something good based on the initial feedback I was receiving, but I wasn't converting those interactions to sales. The next week after my launch weekend, my grandmother died, and I wasn't able to work on or promote the business for that week. So I used that time to assess what I was doing wrong and what I could fix to increase conversions.\n\nWith each set of changes to my site and copy, I learned more about what people wanted from my business - something that I wasn't offering. The majority of my orders were people who wanted help starting a new business or product and who didn't know where to get started or where overwhelmed by everything involved in bringing their business online.\n\nThere was a bigger market demand that I wasn't equipped to provide. I decided to change that.\n\nSo on Sunday, I'll be launching [pagestr](http://pagestr.com) to help people start a business by working through their idea with them, setting up their website for them, and providing them with business and technical support beyond the initial launch.\n\nIf you'd like to read the full story of how I went from my 2-day launch to my new idea, check out my post on [medium](https://medium.com/@robertbridgesme/how-i-started-a-business-in-two-days-and-learned-what-people-actually-wanted-3f952f24ea9a).\n\nAnd a big thank you to this subreddit: it was just over a year ago that I lost my full-time job and started the entrepreneurship path. I've been providing for my family with my side-businesses and only part-time jobs since then - I gained the confidence to do so from the support and encouragement I received here when I posted my story the day I was let go.

I'm at about 650 ish credit score and I'd like to be at 750.\n\nI have about $32k in student loans that I'm paying back on time every month and reflects good on my credit\nI just financed a car for $24k. like 2 weeks ago. 5.09% interest which is not great but it's not bad. I can live with it.\nI paid off my previous car this year but I did miss some payments during the finance term and I'm wondering if there's anyway I get this removed from my credit report. Like as an act of good will or something.\nI have a private student loan that I been avoiding. but I'm pretty sure it's affecting my credit score badly. Like I graduated college in 2011 and I have just not been picking up their calls which is dumb I know.\nI have an upcoming court date with BoA about a CC that was closed a long time ago so I'm not sure it still shows up on my credit report but I think the firm representing them keeps pulling up my credit and that might be affecting it badly.\n\nI think there's 2 other misc things on my credit that are fairly cheap to pay and have removed from my credit report I hope. 1 is Early Termination FEE from verizon and I forget what the other one was but the 2 are about $400 together so easy enough to take care off.\nI only have 1 line of Credit and that's with Amazon. It's a very high interest rate card but I only use it with the special financing option which doesn't charge interest. IF paid off in a year ($500+) or 6 months ($150)\nNo savings.

{"id":"3kk7ot","author":"MattCloughFilm","body":"Hi everyone, hope you don't mind me posting this here. I know Kevin and Rohan are very active members of this sub, and because I've been seeing more and more questions about subscription boxes while lurking here, I thought this might be of interest/ potentially helpful. I've got several years' experience in digital marketing, with a particular focus on SEO, content marketing and copywriting, so if anyone has any general questions, fire away!\n\n\nAlso, this my first attempt at formatting a post like this, apologies if I mess anything up or cock up any of the links, let me know any mistakes in the comments and I'll correct them. Alternatively, I've linked to the original post at the bottom if you want more info on what I'm talking about. \n\n\n# Introduction\n\n\nThe age of the internet has seen the rise of countless new industries and business models and the fall of many more. It’s had a seismic impact on the way we interact with businesses and consume what they have to offer.\n\n\nOne model which has been hit square between the eyes by the unencumbered choice that the web offers us is subscription-based shopping magazines. Although it’s easy to lose sight of the number of people who have yet to embrace online shopping – [50 million](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/02/353288711/why-4-4-billion-people-still-dont-have-internet-access) in the US still don’t make regular use of the internet – as those people dwindle, the number still going through these subscription-based catalogues and ordering over the phone will become ever smaller.\n\n\nAlthough that’s certainly a worry for businesses working on to this model [such as Argos](http://internetretailing.net/2014/04/multichannel-drives-sales-but-dents-profits-at-argos/), the internet is a benevolent entity and it giveth as well as taking away. From the ashes of this crumbling mega-industry has sprung a tangentially-related model that is taking entrepreneurial corners of the internet by storm; the “subscription box” industry.\n\n\nThe premise is simple. A company, such as Graze or Dollar Shave Club, will send you a box of goods on a regular basis designed to help solve a problem while charging a subscription fee to do so. Graze’s offer to customers is that they’ll help them eat more healthily for less. Dollar Shave Club offers an escape from the exorbitant markups found in mainstream shaving and the hassle of going to buy it.\n\n\nGiven Amazon alone [were estimated](http://export-x.com/2014/08/14/many-products-amazon-sell-2/) to be selling over 150 million products to the UK and US markets last year, one might wonder how viable a monthly subscription service is.\n\n\nHowever, it’s impossible to underestimate the role that ease and greasing the wheels plays in the success of subscription box companies. Sure, you could go back to Amazon and repeat order, but the chances are one month you’ll forget, and who wants to go the effort of physically clicking a mouse and typing a password? God forbid. With subscription boxes, it’s one transaction and then out of sight, out of mind.\n\n\nAmazon [even added](http://www.reallysmartguy.com/2010/01/amazon-does-recurring-orders.html) a function to “subscribe” to products in an effort to play the subscription boxers at their own game.\n\n\nHowever, with thousands of would-be Richard Bransons trying their hand at the model, branding and marketing has come to the fore. It’s no longer enough to simply solve a problem. Obvious human needs and wants – such as the desire to eat better without trawling through aisle after aisle at the supermarket – are easily identified and have become saturated quickly. At the very least, you need to do so with some panache in order to stand out.\n\n\nThe subscription box companies now making waves are finding their audiences by speaking to them on a deeper, more emotional level.\n\n\n# Wet Shave Club\n\n\n[Wet Shave Club](http://www.wetshaveclub.com/) first came to my attention when browsing Reddit’s Entrepreneur subsection. Ordinarily a fantastic place for entrepreneurs and “wantrepreneurs” alike to gather and discuss business tactics, ideas and motivations, the Subreddit is a must-visit for any aspiring startup founder.\n\n\nOccasionally a post comes along and eclipses everything else. That’s exactly what [Wet Shave Club co-owner Rohan Gilkes’ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/) (currently the third most upvoted in the Subreddit’s history) did.\n\n\nFor those of you too lazy to click or unable to tear yourself away from my beautiful words, in the post Gilkes went above and beyond, breaking down everything from originally acquiring the domain to costs to marketing.\n\n\nI’ve already covered the [underdog effect](http://curveballcontent.com/underdog-effect) in marketing, and that can be readily applied to Wet Shave Club. They came up against a major competitor in the form of Dollar Shave Club, [who generated](http://www.pymnts.com/exclusive-series/2015/how-the-dollar-shave-club-reinvented-retail/#.VeB7YvlViko) $65 million in revenue last year from their [1.5 million customers](http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/dollar-shave-guys/) and [have earned $150 million](http://recode.net/2015/06/21/dollar-shave-club-raises-75-million-investment-to-own-mens-lives-inside-the-bathroom/) in equity over two funding rounds.\n\n\nGilkes and fellow-founder Kevin Pereira needed to find their branding differentiator.\n\n\n# Branding\n\n\nThankfully, they didn’t need to look too hard. In fact, their stand-out feature was already present in the domain name before Gilkes and Pereira had even heard of the business.\n\n\nWhether you think of wet shaving as a [symptom of the rise of hipsterdom](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/14nby5/congratulations_youre_all_a_bunch_of_hipsters/), as demonstrative of a desire to grapple with a Fight Club-style perceived loss of masculinity in modern society or simply a cool thing to do, there’s no denying that it’s back in a big way - [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-GB#q=wet+shave&amp;geo=US&amp;date=1/2009+80m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc/GMT-1&amp;tz=Etc/GMT-1).\n\n\nWhile Dollar Shave Club’s messaging is skewed toward solving the aforementioned problems that men encounter when it comes to buying shaving gear, Wet Shave Club offer a more aspirational, lifestyle-oriented approach. “We wanted to have more of the old school shaving type vibe and be a premium service,” explains Pereira. “We charge more for our subscription [than Dollar Shave Club]… because our brand’s about quality.”\n\n\nIt’s not about saving yourself a quick buck and a drive to the shop; it’s about detaching from the digital mainframe for five minutes a day to shave in the same way generations \n\nbefore us have done. It’s an acknowledgement that sometimes the old ways are better – and more satisfying – than the new. As Pereira concisely puts it, Wet Shave Club’s brand is a personification of “old school simplicity.”\n\n\nIt’s the same line of reasoning that means that no matter how many futuristic new flavour-infused whiskeys hit the market, there’ll always been a huge audience for the classic No. 7 whiskey from Jack Daniels, who show deference to the past in just about everything, from their [marketing campaigns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQokYC2-b2A) to the very design of their bottles and labels.\n\n\nThe reason that this style of branding is so effective is because it goes further than simply using the age of the company as social proof. It speaks to a history of tradition and makes an attractive commodity out of heritage.\n\n\nWet Shave Club even go so far as to say “Est. 1972” on their boxes. Although Pereira states that this was originally an oversight due to his and Gilkes’ unshakeable belief in agile, rapid business, it fits perfectly.\n\n\nGilkes and Pereira have embraced this style of heritage branding and made it ubiquitous across the full range of Wet Shave Company’s properties, including their website, social presence, packaging and blog content.\n\n\n## Website\n\n\nReminders of Wet Shave Club’s branding are sprinkled into the design of their website amidst the subscription forms and social proof. The images promote simplicity and the rustic nature of the act of wet shaving through the use of wooden backdrops and sepia tones, while the colour scheme of black and red subliminally enhances the masculinity angle.\n\n\n## Social\n\n\nAs with any product which aims to leverage an aspirational lifestyle, social media is the perfect place to set out exactly who your target customer is. [Wet Shave Club’s Instagram](https://instagram.com/wetshaveclub/) feed adheres to the [time-honoured ratios of social sharing](https://blog.bufferapp.com/self-promotion-in-social-media) by giving preference to lifestyle shots and keeping product-focused photos to a select few.\n\n\nOnce again, heritage, tradition and manliness are three common themes across the posts.\n\n\n## Packaging\n\n\n[Image](http://i2.wp.com/curveballcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wet-shave-box.png?resize=618%2C349)\n\n\nThe boxes themselves are another fine example of how Wet Shave Club uses branding to differentiate themselves. The simple label design boasts various features evocative of times gone by, including a ribbon banner, a single-colour palette and similar details reminiscent of an age before digital printing.\n\n\nThe theme continues inside the box, where the products are packed in sawdust-style shavings that hark back to saloon bar floors in the old West.\n\n\n## Blog content\n\n\nMuch like their social channels, Wet Shave Club make excellent use of their blog as an area not to just espouse the virtues of their products and services, but to sync with their target demographic’s lifestyle goals.\n\n\nThey’ve even gone so far as to name their blog section “The Manliest” as a way of tapping into the sense of unbridled manliness that comes with a wet shaving kit “just like grandpa used to use,” as Pereira describes it.\n\n\n## Women’s range\n\n\nWhile heritage marketing is a force of nature when it comes to branding, it does have some limitations. One of those is that, in terms of public perception, it’s solidly the domain of male-oriented products.\n\n\nThis meant that Wet Shave Club faced a big challenge when it came to launching their women’s range.\n\n\nHowever, despite bracing for a need for an abrupt about-face, the company found that, save for a few tweaks with the packaging, the product (obviously) and blogger outreach (which Pereira lists as the marketing tactic that has delivered the best ROI), the nostalgic factor is still just as persuasive when it comes to a female audience.\n\n\nThanks for reading, full post (with extra images etc.) can be found [here](http://curveballcontent.com/branding-wet-shave-club).","name":"t3_3kk7ot","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-11 18:44:10","week":37}

{"id":"3km5cp","author":"robble_c","body":"I had this incredibly frustrating experience last weekend, and since I've altered my own listing process as a result, I figured I'd share with you guys. At the same time, it's cathartic to rant. \n\n\nWhat happened: I came into a few sealed Wii Party U bundles when I purchased a large Nintendo lot from a guy a while back. I realized that the option that would net the most profit would be to open the bundles, FBA the Wii Party U game as new (it's factory sealed inside the factory sealed bundle box) and FBA the Wii Remote Plus as used. \n\n\nAt the same time, I had a massive surplus of AA batteries floating around my warehouse -- I figured, hey, the remote is already flawless, let's throw some batteries in there and include that in the listing too. Since we're listing it as Like New, we already want to get a higher price than the Acceptable / Good listings, so maybe batteries included will give us an additional leg up. Of course, I included this in the condition description. \n\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong. About a week after they sold through, I logged into Amazon Seller Central -- the buyer of one of the remotes had left a 3-star, Neutral feedback for me. They stated that the item was \"clearly used\" and not \"Like New\" as was described. \n\n\nI immediately did the following two things:\n\n1) My item sold for $29.99. I looked up the lowest possible, crappiest condition Wii Remote Plus on the website at the time, which was about $23 (not even FBA -- MF). I immediately refunded the buyer the difference in price, and even threw a couple bucks extra in for a total of $8.50 partial refund. \n\n2) I messaged the buyer, extremely apologetically, and politely asked them to share with me the details of the wear -- I was (genuinely) concerned that something had happened to the item between leaving my warehouse, arriving at Amazon, and arriving at their home. I am NOT opted in to commingled inventory, for the record. \n\nThe buyer stated that it was clearly used because, first, it had batteries, and that would only happen if someone had played with it . They also said there were finger smudges on a few of the buttons, indicating it had been heavily used. \n\n\n\nI apologized again, and suggested that maybe I had accidentally mixed it up with another remote of the same type while I was packing (impossible, but what else can I say, that he's an insane idiot?). I proposed a few changes to my packing process that I will use in the future to prevent any possible mix-ups from happening. I also gave the spiel about how important feedback is, and if he was satisfied with my resolution of the case, I would appreciate it greatly if he would remove his feedback (Amazon doesn't allow buyers to edit). \n\n\n\nThat was five days ago and I never heard back from him. His Neutral feedback is one of only four feedbacks I've received on Amazon (170+ transactions) -- so now, when people see me in the listings, they see (75% Positive) instead of (100% Positive). I have noticed a significant drop in sales since this happened, even though four boxes of new and varied inventory has arrived at Amazon's warehouse in the interim. \n\n\nI know the general rule is to list a product one condition below what it actually is, but I thought I was safe with something literally straight out of a sealed box. I guess I was wrong -- I'll never list something as Like New again. ","name":"t3_3km5cp","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-12 03:04:55","week":37}

In June of this year I noticed that my Cabella's credit card had a fraudulent charge for an Amazon Prime membership ($99.00) which I did not order. I filed a complaint and sent my paperwork in to which they \"never received\". I sent in a second fraudulent statement claim and even called to ask if they received it three weeks later. The customer service rep said that they did. I asked about the protocol, and they said they would contact Amazon and proceed from there. I have heard nothing since August. Yesterday,  I got a letter saying that they closed the case due to my negligence to fill out the form. Then I check my credit score on Credit Karma and find that my credit score went from 683 to a 611 because they closed my account and then opened a new one. So, that is two negative actions on my credit score, Which I did not authorize. I called today to ask for a supervisor and was on hold for two hours and eventually gave up. \n\nI am going to contact the Better Business Bureau. Aside from that is there anything I can do? They just screwed me out of getting a decent loan for a new car which I gravely need. I'm so pissed.

{"id":"3kquih","author":"III-V","body":"Hi there,\n\nHopefully short backstory: I'm an electronics repair technician. I have several years experience fixing a wide variety of devices, from televisions to mobile phones. I met a great mentor that helped me develop the right mindset, taught me skills that separate me from most in my field, and now I've gotten cocky enough to start my own business.\n\nRight now, I'm looking to focus on mail-in board-level electronics repair, such as repairing water damaged devices, data recovery on mobile phones/tablets, and \"light\" soldering jobs like replacing charging ports on Android phones. I'd like to do B2B and B2C sales, but I think I'd prefer B2B in the long run. My focus is on iPhones and flagship Android devices, given their massive volume and sizable value. I am confident that I can gather market share -- very few repair businesses have this expertise, and there are a large number of consumers and businesses that could benefit from my services.\n\n***Here's my issue:*** I'm going to be basically running this out of my apartment (I've been taking care to list my second address line as #XYZ, not Apt XYZ, to make this less immediately obvious). Despite this, I will be taking my operation very seriously -- my second bedroom will be an organized, highly efficient supply and work room. I don't have the funds to have a physical shop at the moment, although I'd like to transition to that at some point. In the mean time, I need to convince people that I'm a legitimate, skilled, honest business -- not some guy that will sodomize your device and tell you that you're SOL. I am fully capable of fixing even the most hopeless devices, and I can be trusted with getting their data back -- but I need my audience to believe me.\n\n**How I plan to address this:**\n\nI plan to mirror my \"mentor's\" online marketing strategy, but going a bit more aggressive in that regard (he doesn't need to -- he has heavy foot traffic). Like him, I'll be doing video repair guides, and lots of blogging on relevant content. This has earned him over 10k subscribers, and I believe 6 figures in revenue from conversions, simply because he freely gives sound business advice and what are basically trade secrets away.\n\nI recognize that they only way people will send me their pricey electronics is if I have a clean, professional site, with well-documented evidence that I am capable of those repairs (e.g. photos, videos of work I've done). I'm going to have this material ready right away, before I officially launch my site. I have a high quality video camera, good lighting, good audio.\n\nAs an extension to his successful model, I plan on hitting social media hard. I plan on advertising on Reddit to target communities (not spamming -- the paid advertising seems very affordable, even with my limited budget). Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, Yelp, and Twitter are all platforms I plan on targeting. I plan on listing my services on Ebay and Amazon. I'll post in local online classifieds. I'll cold call, email, and make physical walk-ins to local, relevant businesses (once I've established myself a bit).\n\nMy services will be very high margin -- the part costs are low, but the labor involved is lengthy. Shipping will be the killer, and I'll have to secure small business discounts ASAP. I have a good idea of what other successful businesses in the mail-in board-repair industry charge for their services, and although I haven't quite tacked down what I'm going to charge for mine, I plan to undercut them slightly to try to get some initial volume (but not enough to portray a lack of quality on my part).\n\nI have a clear vision, and will stop at nothing to make sure my business succeeds. I'd just like to make sure I've got the right marketing strategy for my core business, since that will be critical to my success. I'd be eternally grateful for your advice.\n\nSorry if this is too long -- I understand that you business owners are often very busy people.","name":"t3_3kquih","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-13 05:53:58","week":37}

There is a user rank feature, so your referral and earn bonuses go up by 5% every rank. There is cash and points. 1 point = $0.01. Cash is for Paypal/Checks and converting to points, and points are for redeeming other prizes.\n\n\nIn the Earn &gt; Offers tab, you will find some easy offers such as Research Study 11751 and RewardTV. Complete those for an easy grand total of 90 points, or $0.90 to get started.\n\n\nThe way I earn points is to do the daily surveys to earn some quick cash each day ($0.50-$1.10 per survey). Qualification can be a pain, though. Coin offers (special offers) are usually good and they pay out pretty well. 2 coins = 1 point. You can download iPhone/iPad apps too and even get paid for simply opening them on your device. Points will be credited within 5-30 minutes, usually earlier.\n\n\nDownload offers can be good but risky, antiviruses usually detect them as viruses and they don't pay out that often (for me at least) but if you are going to do them then use Sandboxie, a program that allows you to run programs without them harming your computer, and allows for the user to clear the contents of the sandbox to eliminate the program(s).\n\n\nRewards1 has a very unique reward system, allowing users to custom request items from many different vendors across the web. Just give them the URL in a form, and your reward will be sent to you in a few days. Items can be sent to your house on request. You can also request common gift cards/game codes/game gold, even donate to charities, and cash out in PayPal/Check. The minimum payout is $5, or 500 points. Rookie and Junior ranks have 0-3 day processing times for rewards, and Seniors+ have 0-1 day processing time. The minimum referral bonus is 30%, and the maximum is 55%.\n\n\nIf you'd be so kind as to use my [rewards1 referral](http://www.rewards1.com/ldZagg) then I'd really appreciate it. When you sign up under my link, you start with a lot of bonuses (which I will not disclose). Best of luck getting cool rewards.\\\n\n___________\n\nBONUSES:\n\n**Cashout mininum of $5, NO NEED OF A VERIFIED PAYPAL!**\n\n**Jackpots (win multiple points by betting), daily giveaways in cash/points, and more!**\n\n**Play games such as Solitaire and Battleship for a chance at 20+ points.**\n\n**Prizes in cashing out from gift cards such as Amazon, Steam,  real money such as paypal, game gold such as WoW, and custom request prizes!**\n\n**EASY SURVEYS TO DO THAT PAYOUT $0.75-$1.25!**\n_______\n\n**TAKING ANY QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS.

{"id":"3ksacq","author":"Loftybid","body":"Loftybid.com\n\nLoftybid is a free multiplayer bidding game in early-development. The point is to complete offers, and use your earnings competing in auctions against other players. These auctions work similarly to penny auctions, except the prize is the collective amount spent in bids on that auction.\n\nThis is test week #4. The event will be today (Sept 13th) at 9pm Eastern time (8pm Central). All you have to do is show up and start bidding. It will last for 1 hour, and when it ends, the players that earn the most during gameplay win money via PayPal. The leaders will be displayed in real time. This week the prizes are as follows:\n\n1: $5\n\n2: $3\n\n3: $2\n\nThis week there are some minor changes to the gameplay, making it more fair for everyone participating. Unlike last week, the winners of this event will be determined by whoever actually earns the most/wins the most in auctions, instead of who ends up with the highest account balance. We've also implemented mechanics preventing players with high account balances from sweeping up all the low-value auctions. Now if you have over $10, you can only bid on auctions that are at least half your balance. \n\nEveryone will be given $3 to bid with right before the event starts. So if you don't want to participate in offers, you don't have to, just show up and bid. Doing offers may improve your odds of winning, however. \n\nNotes: 15 people must participate during the testing hour for prizes to be awarded. You may have an Amazon gift card instead of PayPal payment upon request. If you sign in with Facebook and place in the top 3, you must message the Loftybid facebook page with your PayPal email or choice of an Amazon gift card. If you sign up locally and want an Amazon gift card, please email Loftybid@gmail.com using the email you signed up with. \nNotes: 15 people must participate during the testing hour for prizes to be awarded.

The main one is that if you don't know about the maximum until you have hit it and can't make another payment, and as a result you cannot pay the full statement balance, then you will incur interest. However, if you always pay your current balance this shouldn't ever happen (or you can be careful to make sure your first payment each period is at least your statement balance for that period). That's probably an edge case thing, but I thought I'd mention it.\n\nAlso it may take a couple days for the charges and then payment to hit your card.

{"id":"cut58cc","author":"no_talent_ass_clown","body":"After having read a bit about poverty and lower-income choices, I can address some of these.\n\nThe money orders happen when they don't have a bank account. Banks will close your account when you have overdrawn it too often or don't have the money to get yourself out of the hole after having been charged $105 in fees because you couldn't make it to the bank to deposit a check before the cutoff that day. Other banks won't allow you to open an account if your credit is poor. \n\nThe single-serve products might be because they don't have the cash to buy in bulk. Or maybe that's what they get from the food pantry, or what someone else bought them, or what the rest of the $5 gift card would cover. Or because they work themselves to the bone and don't have the energy to cook from scratch that day/week/month.\n\nThe expensive cell phones might be on a plan that they can't get themselves out of for another year. I read about it all the time on /r/personalfinance and it's not just the lower-income folks. Personally, I use the $30 pre-paid plan from T-mobile but not everyone can get by with just 100 minutes a month, especially people who need to call about jobs, bills and childcare. Being poor takes a lot of time on the phone.\n\nTV is, dollar for dollar, the cheapest form of entertainment, especially for a family, and it's one of the safest in a bad neighborhood. It's also an inexpensive form of childcare. Lastly, it's something people get handed down frequently (I inherited my last TV from an uncle) when someone else gets a newer one.\n\nThe whole packages of chicken rotting away in the fridge can be from someone buying it close to the pull date and then being required to work extra at their job one night and the bus being late the next so they don't get a chance to cook it before it went bad. Or maybe they were just worn out when they got home.\n\nCheap cars are expensive to maintain. Cheap clothes wear out or fall apart in the washing machine. But when you're poor, all you can afford is the cheap stuff (like cheap housing). There's a book called, \"Nickel and Dimed\" about this very subject that's available at Amazon. It was popular about 10 years ago; quite informative.\n\n","name":"t1_cut58cc","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-07 06:09:34","week":37}

{"id":"cuu4338","author":"DPool34","body":"From my experience, it all depends on the Walmart employee you're talking to. I use Walmart's price match at least a few times a month. Every single time I've tried to use it, I was initially told that they don't do it, or \"that was just for the holidays,\" or \"we used to do it, but people took advantage,\" or \"we do it on electronics only.\" \n\nI never get the same excuse twice. I'm persistent though, so I end up getting it. I just keep going to different employees or to customer service until someone finally knows what's up. \n\nI literally had to go through 4 people a couple weeks ago when I wanted to price match cologne that was cheaper on Amazon --it was half the price, in fact. So I really didn't ming spending the extra 15 minutes to find someone who would match it for the $20+ I saved in the transaction. \n\nThis is just one of those classic differences between Walmart and Target, because *anytime* I try to price match at Target, I immediately get the item matched with no hassle. I blame it on Walmart management for poor training/education. \n\n**TL;DR: Walmart does price match Amazon, you just have to find the employee who knows that they do.**","name":"t1_cuu4338","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-08 06:11:00","week":37}

An Amazon affiliate-based review site is a good example. The work load on them tends to be front-loaded but then they run with very little effort. \n\nAmazon publishing (through KDP) is a similar thing, once the book is out there it can act as a steady revenue stream with little effort, but again it requires a lot of work up front. \n\nApps are a tricky one and TBH not ideal due to the very competitive and fickle nature of the user base. I know a couple of people who do app work and they spend all their time trying to come up with the next big idea and, as soon as one is launched they have to get the next one started. However, one area that does make money is (web) app development for companies. I know some guys who specialise in news apps for mid sized companies, ideally for their staff to keep up on things happening. Rather than taking a fixed fee they take a monthly fee over a fixed term. App launches in the first couple of months but they get paid for the next 2 years. \n\nDropshipping: More effort than it is worth and having known several people who tried it, they all got out pretty fast.

{"id":"cuuxey2","author":"TamponShotgun","body":"&gt; Interesting because GIECO paid us \"Fair Market Value\" on our car, basically just prices on the exact same car from dealers around us. And since dealers always overprice cars we got good value (almost what we paid for it two years earlier).\n\nGeico is pretty cool with their coverages. I had renter's insurance through them and one day my upstairs neighbor's toilet overflowed (nothing disgusting, it was the tank that kept filling up and didn't stop). It came through my vents and soaked my bed and ruined some of my books and a couple USB drives and stuff. They sent an adjuster to look at the water-damaged stuff, he took some pictures, left me with a form to fill out and list all the damaged stuff (which I got using Amazon and pricing everything as a used purchase), then he cut me a check for the full value of the stuff minus the deductible. It was a pretty painless experience.\n\nThe only other time I've had to make a claim was when some chick in a parking lot scraped the side of my car when I was driving through.

I like it more than some other survey sites for the following reasons: \n\n* It's hosted by Amazon, giving it a little corporate security.\n* You can get actual dollars rather than just gift cards, mturk does its stuff through amazon payments, so again, corporate security for your bank info.\n* If you're good at it, you can earn lots of $/hr. \n* There is a large community of people who turk, and there are many chrome extensions and scripts the community has made to make it easier for you to do surveys and such as quickly as possible.\n\nNow I will delve into some of the things that aren't great about mturk:\n\n* The Terms of Service that Amazon made mostly protect Amazon...generally not you, and not the requesters.\n* Sometimes requesters will post HITs that are not worth your time, or will reject your work out of hand - turkers have made chrome extensions to battle this, but they aren't 100% effective, probably only 90%.\n* It takes 2 weeks + a couple days to actually get any money when you first join, this is Amazon's effort to prevent people from botting/using multiple accounts and protect themselves.\n* Sometimes, there just aren't a lot of HITs that are worth doing, usually there's a few bucks worth a day, but if you're seriously hurting for cash, mturk can be unreliable sometimes.\n* Sometimes requesters will take a long time to approve your work.\n* Some HITs have qualifications that are prohibitive for new users, some HITs have qualifications that some turkers will NEVER get.\n* You need to declare the income on your taxes.\n\n**TL;DR: Look into Amazon Mechanical Turk /r/mturk**","name":"t1_cuv7d9f","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-09 05:02:33","week":37}

The difference being that these companies have profitable business backing up their venture whereas Netflix is \"boom or bust\"  \n\nIt's coming down to a bet on Netflix Originals being as profitable as HBO originals.  Netflix is sprinkling their OC with Disney offerings and likely some other features releases but they want to be the next TWC.  I'm becoming very bearish on Netflix outlook as time progresses.

Netflix on the other hand has decent content, but it's not current enough. The shows Netflix produces are top notch compared to everything else out there.

Hulu plus with no commercials for $11.99 and Netflix for $7.99 and there's more content then you can ever watch. I look at it like a giant DVR that's already filled up with the commercials erased. One thing I would bet on is that cable and satellite companies are going downhill from here. Cable might have a fix if they would switch to streaming instead of a DVR.

Once you are flagged, forget it.\n\n* Don't vote your own reviews: Comment them to say thanks or support your customers when something is wrong, but don't vote massively. Amazon will detect it, and reviewers don't like to write a 2 stars review and get 5 negative votes, so they will report your behavior.\n\n* Sell through FBA: Not many, but several customers will try to blackmail you by saying \"the box was empty\", returning to you \"empty boxes\", delays even when is not true, etc.\n\n* Don't hire SEO, optimize services, etc, from Indian companies: This is not racist, but it comes from experience, in general they are selling \"price\", not \"quality\". They say they have a lot of automatic updated tools for social, Google, Amazon, professional people, they read TOS, PR1,2,3... **rubbish**. I spent about $1000 in 5 different Indian companies this year (8 months), and I'm tired of them. It took me double of money and time to repair the damage they did.

Here are two options that I use personally.\n\n* **Amex Blue Preferred** - 6% supermarkets, 3% gas stations; 3% at select U.S. department stores, and 1% everything else ($75 annual fee). Amazing if you have a family and buy a ton of groceries or drive a lot. Plus Amex has arguably the best costumer service, extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty, and free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at tons of online retail stores through ShopRunner.com. NOTE: With the AMEX BCP you can buy gift cards from your grocery store for gas stations, Amazon, etc so that you get 6% at all these places.\n\n* **Barclaycard arrival+** - 2.2% credit back on everything ($89 annual fee) but only redeemable for any travel related purchases. The nice thing is you get the cash back credit through the barclaycard website itself where your statement is, so you don't have to the whole \"redeeming points\" through the travel companies like most travel cards. Free monthly FICO score, 40000 Miles if you spend $3000 in the first 90 days, and no foreign transaction fees. Chip + PIN support is nice too.","name":"t1_cuvmhh7","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-09 16:50:36","week":37}

{"id":"cuvt660","author":"nick2253","body":"There is no one *best* cash back card.  Honestly, it highly depends on what you spend money on, and how willing you are to put up with lots of cards.\n\nGenerally speaking, the best you can do in a particular category is 5%, though some broad categories are 3%.  The best all-around you can do is 2%.\n\nWith this in mind, let's work backwards:  For 2% cash back on everything, the best cards are the Citi Double Cash and the Fidelity Amex cards.\n\nFor 3% cash back on broad categories like restaurants, it depends on the card.  The Chase AARP card is 3% on all restaurants.  There are some other cards that have 3% on travel sub-categories.\n\nFor 5% cash back on specific categories, there are a number of options.  There's the rotating category cards: Chase Freedom, Discover, US Bank Cash+, and Citi Dividend Platinum.  Then there are specific category 5% cards, like Sallie Mae Barclaycard (groceries, gas, Amazon) and the PenFed Platinum Cash Rewards (gas).\n\nUltimately, getting the *most* cash back will likely require multiple credit cards.

I always have doubts when they release the s versions, if there will be enough people willing to upgrade to something that is only marginally better and most importantly doesn't have a new design. Having said that they have somehow always managed it in the past. Although this time the jump in sales from iPhone 5s to 6 were huge, can they convince the same number of people to switch from other phones (as well as all the upgrades from the iPhone 5s)? Or get a whole load of new customers by opening up new markets (not really anywhere as big as China this time)?

{"id":"cuw0s5d","author":"ronindavid","body":"Can you? Yes. But the real question is would your life be better and, more importantly, would it be more secure. Then the answer is no.\n\nAs more and more of the economy shifts away from brick-and-mortar stores in favor of sites like Amazon. This forces you to pay using electronic payments.\n\nSo far, the most secure is credit card. Never, let me repeat, NEVER use your Visa Checkcard to make payments online. If your credit card gets hacked, you lose your credit until the bank fixes it. If your check card gets hacked, you lose your money (savings will still be fine). There is a huge difference!\n\nBut like everything else, this convenience comes at a cost. Get your credit card from the same bank you use so you can easily pay it off every month. If you cannot do this, don't get a credit card. You need to learn from your bank exactly what they'll cover in the event it get's hacked/stolen. Get paperwork on it. Imagine your going to court and you need proof the bank is responsible. Monitor your credit card! There's NO excuse anymore. Cellphones can tell you your balance (use VPN if using someone else's wifi).

It was always very long and took about the same amount of time to write. \n\nI find at least with the 3 or so posts a week I've been doing lately that I generally feel more accomplished. I get the \"reward\" feeling of completing something more often - before I'd work 2 or 3 or even 4 days straight for the same reward. It was kind of grueling. \n\nI also like that the shorter posts aren't as long. Even if someone isn't interested they can simply move on and read the next one. It also boosts traffic to the site because people visit the site more often to view the new posts. \n\nOne thing I could do is take less time with the \"narrative\" aspect and only discuss it when it's most interesting.

{"id":"cuwfqq8","author":"jinxlover13","body":"I would say it depends on how often you change your child, the efficiency of your washer/ dryer, and if you require special diapers. I spent $400 on my diaper stash (40 pocket diapers, 2 large wet bags, 5 small wet bags for daycare, 100 inserts.) She uses only cloth diapers now, except for 1 disposable at night (so a box of 64 lasts us roughly two months at a cost of $25/box) We spent $400  for the cloth setup plus $150 for the sposies for the first year for a total of $550 for diapering. Now, I change her (she's 14 months) about 6-8 times a day because she (nor i) doesn't like to be dirty. At 8 changes a day, a box of diapers would last me 8 days, or 46 boxes of diapers a year. That's $1,150 dollars a year at her current rate (and newborn  rate she used 14-20 diapers a day, so $1800, roughly) for diapers, versus the $550 I actually spent. My water bill went up maybe 4 dollars a month ($48/yr) and my electric averaged about $10/month more ($120) All in our first year cost a little over $700 to CD, a savings of $450. My daughter is allergic to some sort of chemical in the disposable diapers and will actually get a nasty skin rash (looks like a burn) if she wears them often, so when I put her in a disposable at night I have to cover her bottom in barrier cream, and use 7th generation diapers.\n\n As for time, I wash diapers every 4 days and it takes about 2.5 hrs to run a quick cycle, a deep cycle with an extra spin, and to dry the inserts. I hang the covers to dry overnight. I stuff 36 diapers in about 20-30 minutes while watching tv, so my total weekly time on diapers is about 6 hours, much of it spent doing other things. Next (this) year, because we don't have to purchase anything, our diapering will cost us $300 in increased utilities if the rate stays the same, and I expect to potty train her around 2 years old, since CDed kids train earlier. So all in all, I expect to spend about $1000 to CD for two years versus $2300 for two years in disposable- which, because sposies wick away moisture and the child doesn't notice the wetness or have discomfort, would likely be 3 years at a final cost of $3450. The savings would only increase with each additional child we have. For us, it's definitely a great price difference, and pocket diapers offer very little inconvenience and hassle, since they are so similar to disposable.\n\nthat being said, I wouldn't risk making my own. I'd want to make sure that they are super absorbent and I don't trust myself to know what I'm doing. Plus, you can get diapers for around $4 a pop on Amazon.","name":"t1_cuwfqq8","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-10 06:14:21","week":37}

Don't worry about spending a bunch of money \"cute\" brand new clothes, your relatives and friends will send you ton's of this. Seriously people love to shop for babies. You should stick to thrift stores only. \n\nCreate a registry on Amazon, there's a 15% completion discount on anything left on your registry with 6 weeks til your due date. It's only a one time discount so purchase everything you need at once. I'm not sure if amazon operates in Thailand so you may need to adjust the due date you enter into amazon, so that you can get the discount. \n\nSimilarly sign up for Target's registry. They gave us a little gift with a few things. They also gave us a few 20% coupons which can be useful. \n\nMany of the items we bought for the baby are too big to ship; car seat, crib, bassinet, stroller ect. So it's really clothes and blankets you can stock up on. You may also want to get some children's books and parenting books as well. Again visit GoodWill for these.\n\nCongrats and good luck! If it's your first, realize every relative and friend will come out of the woodwork to give you gifts. I had a great aunt who I haven't seen in 15 years send us a handmade blanket. Many people will ask you after the baby what you want, so don't feel like you need to have everything before the kid, you'll actually want to save some gift ideas for them. \n\nRemember everyone will give you advice, but the best advice is to just be calm and patient.","name":"t1_cuwnzoo","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-10 14:31:09","week":37}

{"id":"cuwp4n1","author":"left4james","body":"Long time lurker and comic book geek here. I don't have any experience owning a comic store but it has been a dream of mine for quite some time. Maybe one day I'll get the guts to do it like OP and just go for it.\n\nI actually prefer shopping at B&amp;M comic stores over online, although I do both pretty regularly. My preference comes from the fact that it can sometimes take up to 2 weeks to get the newest issues in the mail, if not longer. \n\nAlso, if you buy from eBay/Amazon for older back issues, it's a crap shoot on the actual grading and quality being accurate to what is in the description. Sure you can go through more reputable comic dealer sites but then you pay a premium for that. Might as well buy from a local shop at that point that has fair pricing on their back issues. \n\nPlus there's perks to going to an actual store -- like going outside, talking to other like-minded people about comics, physically touching/reading the comics before you buy them, finding about local comic events in your area, etc.  \n\nHere are a couple of shops in my local area that I always have great experiences with: [Dragon's Lair](http://dlair.net/austin/) and [Austin Books and Comics](http://www.austinbooks.com/). In the end, I believe it always comes down to reliable and friendly customer service.

The biggest issue brands have is with trust. They are all trying to get customer endorsements - go on Tripadvisor and you get all the 'your cousin has been here' stuff. That's way more trustworthy than 'Kanye loves these slacks'. \n\nI *know* Kanye is getting aid to say that, so I don't trust the message in the same way. But if the pants look good I might buy them anyway. \n\nI don't *know* my friend is getting paid for it in your model, and when I find out, I am mad pissed off and will never trust the company being endorsed (or the friend) again. \n\nThe revenue split is interesting, but it's a bit \"pyramid scheme\" - it makes me instantly think there might be something dodgy going on. Anything that requires me to recruit is off-putting (except possibly charity stuff). \n\nHonestly I also think there's something there, but I think you need a radical rethink about motivation and transparency. Maybe something that allows you to share things you actually use - although Amazon lets you do that. \"How do you ensure trust?\" is the key issue. Without it, I think you'll struggle for uptake.

{"id":"cuwukpy","author":"walloon5","body":"I'm not big on horror games nor amusement rides, but VR is so immersive that it seems to take those genres in particular and really amp them up.\n\nI think VR will do well, but the price point and games have to line up. Eg, price point under $200, and the PC gaming titles that are compatible. \n\nShould be doable, I've considered Facebook (FB) stock over the issue. \n\nOne of the things about tech and tech stocks is there's always this huge enthusiasm for technology in our civilization, going back to the Railroads. People would buy buy buy railroad stocks and they wouldn't necessarily take a close look at the company's value, nor how they'd scheme to pay themselves. So railroad stock I'm not so sure that it was such a good deal. And that's how I feel about tech companies sometimes. They're popular, and in downturns like now, they seem like such standout deals, but I wonder if they're really actually overpriced and if there isn't a little bit of the madness of crowds (Fanboys etc) keeping their stock prices levitating. It's insulting when you see Bezos talk about drone delivery when you know he's not going to do it but it's a /wink and a /nod to those in the know to get Amazon fans frothing. \n\nI think technology gets used like that too. The VR part of Facebook (Oculus in Facebook Seattle) is so cool, and Facebook and Zuckerburg suck so much. They have this vast marketshare, they are like 1/7th of the world's people signed up, they are the Internet to much of the world because they have Facebook ISP tie ins to cell phones in third world countries - to a lot of the world's people Facebook is the Internet. And for sure, Facebook's social metadata and conversations are being mined by Orwellian police states globally or else they would not be allowed into many of these countries. So basically I really dislike Facebook. But things like the Oculus VR give them a bit of a halo.

{"id":"cuwv7ge","author":"socalstartup","body":"HookEmTexx.  Thank you for your comments.  Your point is well taken.  I do however want to better clarify our product and value proposition.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDue to the nature of our box contents (DVDs and primary full-sized, handmade treats), costs are pretty high.  Yes, older DVDs can go for $5 at Wal-Mart but you are very limited in selection (we checked).  In reality, if you want to provide a breadth of critically-acclaimed classic movies, as is our concept, you will find yourself paying up to $10-$12/DVD for many of the lesser-known, though still great films that we want our customer to experience.  It is not easy to sign an agreement with a DVD distributor and, even if you do, the margins are still razor thin unless you have Amazon purchasing power.  The artisan shops that we have partnered with typically retail their handmade snacks for $6-$8/each, which puts our snack costs somewhere between $10-$15 per subscription box buying wholesale.  Throw in a quality bonus item based on one of the movies (such as the handmade soap replica from Fight Club as seen in our first box) add in packaging costs, shipping and processing fees and it is hard to make money even at our $40 price point.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe do understand your doubts.  The top criticisms across the board go something like this: “Hey, awesome product but the box is not worth $40”.  It is an experience box that is being targeted for a young couple that enjoys sitting down to watch great movies together while trying out fun, handmade movie-themed snacks.  With all the crappy movies out there it is hard to know what to watch, and even if you do, it is sometimes quite difficult to find certain movies (even on Amazon, iTunes, etc.).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nOne last point – I haven’t even touched on our theme and movie cards.  We sift through interviews, articles, and behind-the-scenes videos and put together information based on the month’s theme (i.e. featured director, actor, era) and each movie (including time-stamped trivia).  Since our product is completely new to the market, we have had some trouble really conveying how great Movie Night Box is.  However, those that have tried it out had nothing but positive things to say so we are hoping for slow but steady success.

Let's say some regular person bought $280 in stock and 15 years later it was worth $1200 - mirroring the returns of Cuban's Mavericks purchase at the small scale. Nobody is going to look to that person for financial advice.\n\nThe scale and novelty make it seem special when it's not. In fact, while that is a great return, it is actually far lower than what you'd have gotten from popular stocks like AMZN or AAPL over the same time period. If we're to base on isolated data points, anyone who held either of those over that time period is a better investor than Cuban, but you'd never hear that in the news.\n\nAlso, when you're dealing with huge scales, you can take lots of bets and then highlight just the successes. The failures won't impact your lifestyle - in the end you're still rich. Take Trump, who people think is a business genius even though his worth has increased slower than the S&amp;P 500.

I did the same thing ;)\n\nYou could probably consolidate your master categories a bit, to save a little bit on vertical space. My master categories are:\n\n* Debt (now defunct!)\n\n* Misc (for projects I do for a group with money that isn't really \"mine\")\n\n* Savings (Emergency fund, saving for a new laptop or phone, etc)\n\n* Giving (Basically just tithing)\n\n* Monthly bills (everything I pay monthly- rent, electric, Netflix, cell phone, Dropbox, etc. If it repeats monthly, it goes here.)\n\n* Rolling expenses (gas, groceries, cat stuff, household stuff- categories for things that are necessary, but more unpredictable in both timing and amount)\n\n* Rainy Day Funds (Doctor, Car registration/inspection, car maintenance, gift, clothes, Misc \"non-fun\" expenses, stuff I generally want to have a fund for, but it doesn't come up regularly.)\n\n* Fun stuff (apps, books, music, yarn, Misc \"fun\" stuff, video games, etc)\n\nFor my bills, I put an average monthly amount in the description. For rainy day funds, I put a \"cap\". So I put $50 in my car maintenance fund, but I cap it at $600 so I'm not just endlessly hoarding money in that category. Not that that's really been a problem yet, but it felt like a productive thing to do :)\n\nAlso for my electric bill, which is usually way higher in the summer than the winter (because Texas), I put in $70/month, no matter what my actual bill is. In the winter I build up extra money in the category, then in the summer I draw on that extra. So I'm still \"paying\" the same amount year-round. Since I moved last year I think I need to adjust the amount I put in every month because my fund there has gotten way too big since I apparently use less electricity at this place. (Even though it's bigger? I dunno, but I like it.) I did the same thing with various subscriptions (Graze, Amazon Prime, Patreon) where I added up how much they all are and worked out how much I need to put to that fund every month to account for the monthly &amp; yearly fees. \n\nEveryone does their categories &amp; master categories differently. I consolidated mine, but if your categories work for you, then keep on rocking it. The key is to find what works for you, so that you can understand and use the system. I rearranged my categories plenty of times before I found what works for me. \n\nHow much longer do you have on your trial?","name":"t1_cux96xh","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-11 00:16:19","week":37}

{"id":"cuxdt64","author":"floor-pi","body":"Revenue isn't the main metric used to describe performance of a business. It's not even a 'metric', in terms of financial analysis. Revenue means revenue, and it adds to the overall picture of a business's health, growth, and runnings. You're suggesting the use of net margin as a superior metric, but a net margin of 90% is not good if the most revenue your business model can achieve is $10 a month. Or going further and using both, a revenue of $1m in a year and a net margin of 50% may seem good, but it might not be good if you have deferred tax payments, or if your  competitor has the same net margin but a far healthier gross margin. You can't just take one thing in isolation.\n\n\nIt's important to know a company's changes in revenue because it indicates success, indicates the effects of internal changes, changes in the market, changes in the industry, changes in the economy, etc etc.\n\n\nI do agree that people can sometimes hide an unprofitable business model behind an ostensibly healthy revenue figure. Especially on subreddits like this (it's one thing for Amazon to have zero net profit while they reinvest in operations, but the same can't be said for zero net profit for your subscription box company). But anybody who cares wont just want to know revenue. In fact anybody who cares will go far beyond figures and ratios from an Income Statement.","name":"t1_cuxdt64","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-11 02:36:30","week":37}
{"id":"cuxe7xs","author":"oniofchaos","body":"That's a more pleasant number to see :)\n\nI think you can get that down even further though. I saw another comment of yours where you were buying chicken at something like $3.30/lb. In SD I buy frozen chicken breasts from Costco for $2.29/lb and can pick up unfrozen ones usually for $1.89-$1.99/lb on sale at the grocery.\n\nI definitely sympathize with seeing increased premiums for what feels like no difference in benefit. A key thing to remember about Obamacare is that it is illegal to have a maximum payout amount. Not sure if this is from Obamacare or just what plans offer, but most seem to have a maximum out of pocket amount, usually around $6-7k. This means that if you have catastrophic medical issues, you will only be out of pocket $6k (for example). While this is not easy to swallow, it's not bankrupting like a $100k bill.\n\nThe penalty is in effect for 2015 income taxes. Not sure how many months you would be hit for since you won't have been in the country the entire year. Next year's income taxes are when you'd get bit hard, and I wouldn't be surprised if the penalty increased.\n\nWhether it's worth it for one person is mostly dependent on what you eat besides chicken and eggs, and what the cost of those are at Costco vs the grocery. One example for me is onions, which is something I use when cooking chicken. Costco sells onions for about half the price of the non-sale grocery amount. Onions last a while so we can go through them in time. We also like brussel sprouts, and Costco has them for about $1/lb cheaper, but unless we eat them constantly we can't eat them fast enough and some go bad. Some other good things I've noticed are olives, coffee, peanut butter, vitamins, soap/shampoo (limited brands), breads, batteries, lightbulbs, olive oil, and chicken stock. I don't have price comparisons for these but I'm pretty sure just about all of them are equal/much cheaper than at the grocery/Amazon, and the quality is generally fantastic.\n\nCostco offers a full refund on their membership fees if you're not happy, and Costco's customer service is awesome so I presume they would go through with that.

Anyone in particular? student or car?\n\nIn order of priority: \n\n0) NO NEW DEBT... nothing goes on a credit card unless you'll be paying it off in full by the end of the month, I don't care if you break a phone and need to replace it (get a $175 Motorola instead of a $700 iPhone/Samsung... do whatever it takes to keep from adding more debt) \n\n1) Pay the minimums on ALL the loans/debts (if you can't to that you MUST eliminate some of the debt, probably by selling the car)\n\n2) Make sure you have an emergency fund... if not start putting some money in a savings account that you WILL NOT TOUCH. Again, an emergency fund is not \"I need an new iPhone.\" It should cover basic needs, like you needing to have money for food and rent while you look for a new job in the event you get laid off/fired/company goes bankrupt.\n\n3) Pay whatever you need to to make sure you pay down the Amazon credit before the free interest period expires  (say you have 5 months left before the 0% interest expires and still owe $1000, then $1000/5= $200/month)\n\n4) If your company offers a match for the 401k contribute up to the match... match is basically doubling your investment, but before putting any more than your match into the 401k, take a look at your debts\n\n5) Look at your debts, identify anyones that have interest rates higher than about 5%, paying those off take priority over further investments. Identify the one with the highest interest rate, and put any extra money you have towards paying that down quicker. Once that debt is completely paid off, then find the next highest interest rate.\n\n6) Once you have paid off all your high interest rate loans and only have debt with interest less than 5%, then you can worry about investing, maxing out your 401k, opening a Roth IRA, etc. But it sounds like you're a few years away from that.\n\n7) Once you get back on track with that and have some extra money that you can throw extra money at your retirement and still have a little left over, then you can start having some fun again... but one thing at a time.","name":"t1_cuy5f5o","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-11 19:53:38","week":37}

{"id":"cuy7u2q","author":"JimmyTheCatWith3Legs","body":"Sales is definitely a double-edged sword.  You can be amazing at your job and have an amazing month, get a nice commission check, work with nice and easy customers, make \"easy\" money.  \n\nThe other side of the sword is the \"down months\".  It's a grind.  You're under a quota.  You **have** to sell X amount of product (in your case, cars).  I'm not sure how your dealership runs, but in most cases there will be a board somewhere with sales reps and little X's or numbers showing their sold volume.\n\nThere are a lot of meetings, a lot of long days, a lot of pressure coming down from management.  If you're having a bad month, it usually trickles to the next month.  After that bad month, you've got strain from your boss and you've got your own financial strain because you've had a few bad months.  Then desperation kicks in.  Your customers see it and usually that scares them away because in their eyes you just want a \"quick easy sale\" which usually it doesn't happen like that.\n\nCar salesmen may make decent money but there's also a stigma that goes with car salesmen (along with any other types of sales, really).  You'll be hungry for sales.  They train you to be an attack dog pouncing on any prey that walks on the lot.  Then you're not only forced to make the sale, you're forced to sell the extra products (warranties, add-on accessories, higher price when you're being haggled down by your customer; in your case.)  Sure, you can get the car off of the lot because that's what the person came in for; *but can you sell the extended warranty and better speaker system while not dropping the price of the car?*  because otherwise you're not a salesman, you're a clerk, and a robot can clerk.  Think Amazon.com; which even they \"recommend\" products to go together.\n\nYou'll have to sit down for \"phone block\" hours or make phone calls during your down-time.   Which doesn't sound so bad, but if you've got a list of \"potential buyers\" and you're calling them week-after-week, they start to hate you for pestering them.\n\nHours are weird because the average person is buying a car in the afternoon/evening or on the weekends because they work M-F 9-5, but that's not a problem if you don't mind giving up your weekends or evenings.  Vacation time is also usually a problem because one week off of sales hurts your numbers tremendously and you have to play \"catch up\" because you're only working 75% of the month.\n\nAround my area, most dealerships will take anybody and train them in sales.  You do have to be tactical in sales, but it's hard.  If that's what you want to do and you look at it as a promotion, then I'd go to the dealership down the road who will hire you as a salesperson.\n\nI got to the point where I was awesome at my job but then realized that some people are salespeople for their entire lives and that's absolutely the person I do not want to be.

What earnings multiple would it deserve? Is Twitter worried about Google's algo changes? Probably not.\n\nTo a lesser extent, large, established websites with multiple sources of traffic, strong, whitehat backlinks and loyal followings are less worried about Google's mood than someone who owns a small affiliate site.\n\nI try and avoid affiliate sites, especially ones that rely on PBNs to rank as these are short term plays and won't stand the test of time. I have bought one, but that was at 10x and I've made my money back already.\n\nThe idea that 'so much can change' is rather vague. \n\nWhen it comes to Google, there is a real chance that they will slap anybody who is using 'blackhat' or 'greyhat' method. My solution to this is to keep up with latest blackhat and greyhat techniques so I know how to spot these techniques, and avoid them when I'm looking to buy a site.\n\nWith regards to affiliate programs, I don't have any sites that rely on clickbank or similar. I'm mainly familiar with Amazon Affiliates, and while there might be changes, I doubt the changes will be too sudden or too large that you don't have time to respond.\n\nThat being said, if I saw your site was using PBNs or other blackhat seo methods (not saying that you did, but its pretty common), then I'd probably have stayed away at 22x.\n\n","name":"t1_cuyttwq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-12 10:31:00","week":37}

You're gonna want extra controllers, let's say two. Of course a headset. Rechargeable battery packs for the controllers because in the long term it's cheaper than batteries. By the time you're done that console has cost you over $2,000.\n\n\nNow, you also have to consider that that $1,500 PC is super high end and you could do mostly the same stuff with an $800 PC you built yourself (I'm assuming OP didn't build the PC himself). In the last 4 years I've spent maybe $250 on games and peripherals for my laptop that was a gift. I have close to 150 games (about a third of which are AAA titles), a nice set of headphones, a controller, a mouse. I can also use my PC on the TV or a monitor, I can use it for Netflix, Amazon instant video, Spotify, YouTube, and productivity. As opposed to the $2,000 game and Netflix machine the is a console. Also, after 6 years you drop in a new $200 graphics card because it's slowing down a little bit. Maybe a new processor. So if you do it the most economical way with hand building your PC right now you're at $1,250-$1,500. A little less than the console. You can still play every brand new game at the highest rates of performance without starting from scratch.

You would have to test every single disc to ensure it reads properly (even ones that aren't scratched, as they can sometimes have bad presses).

My computer takes at 2 minutes per disc for CD's and at least 5 minutes per disc for DVD's (I haven't done many Blu-Rays yet).  Assuming every disc takes 2 minutes, this puts you at 620 hours (about 26 days if you work 24/7 at it), not factoring in the selling part.\n\nWhile you may not consider an hourly wage yet, in order to do better than working at McDonald's, you'd have to break $8k in sales off this lot (assuming it's all CD's, if it's mainly DVD's or Blu-Rays, this will go MUCH higher).
