I currently use the Southwest card but feel the rewards aren't really as good as they used to be.\n\nOur combined income is currently ~$75k annually but it's going to jump to ~$85k this month. I have one year left of school then we'll probably jump to &gt;~$200k combined.\n\nWe have basically no savings aside from her 403b which she maxes monthly. However, with my earning potential starting next year going up I'm not too worried about getting to the 6 month reserve quite yet. We're definitely going to build up savings from her income this year but nothing substantial.\n\nFor the next year I'd like to help build up her credit score, mine is currently in excess of 700, while at the same time getting a good card. I thought Amazon because we 1) spend a lot on gifts at Christmas 2) I have Prime with free shipping 3) We can get a lot more use of out Amazon with extra incentive to buy household items, things we'd get at Target or other department stores.\n\nThe Amazon card is 3% cash back on Amazon purchases, 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and drugstores (not sure if this is only Rx or just like anything at CVS), and 1% back on all other purchases with no annual limit. \n\nThe thought is that we'd make enough to subsidize our Christmas spending largely with points at the end of the year. \n\nPersonally I've never carried CC debt unless it was to finance a 0% interest item (laptop once, currently engagement ring). I put everything monthly on my Southwest card then pay it off each month. I'm think about getting the Amazon card for both of us to share, then using it for all shared expenses (eating out, gas, households, on trips, etc.) and continuing to pay it each month.\n\nAny thoughts on if this seems like a sound plan for the next year?\n\nTL;DR Sorry if that seems kind of like I'm trying to pander the card, if you guys have better suggestion let me know please.","14":"Hi, my name is Heremeow and I'm addicted to thrifting and flipping. At night I get anxious about what I'm going to find on the hunt the next day. When at the store, I get really bummed when I don't find anything good and really happy for the rest of the day when I do find a \"treasure.\" At night when the stores are closed I research new things to flip and ebay selling tactics. I sell on Ebay, Etsy and Amazon self-fulfilled. It's seriously all I think about and I'm constantly checking my phone for sale alerts and bids. It is making me money but I'm wondering if my obsession is a bad thing. My house is not cluttered at all. I have a small shelf where I keep what I sell and that's it so I'm not hoarding the merchandise. I just wish I didn't go to bed all anxious about what I'm going to find the next day.

I know nothing about this is ideal but I need help.\n\nI'm 24 years old! I don't have a high school diploma or GED, I'm having a child in less than a week, and I currently live with my girlfriend and her family. I have two jobs and I roughly pull in 1300$ a month, and I have 500$ saved currently but will be going to my car payment. My monthly fees excluding car payment which I'll discuss below are:\n\n30$ Phone bill\n20$ Credit Card Bill(only 100$ left)\n80$ Gas\n90$ Cigarettes(I'm not even going to pretend like I'm quitting given my stressful situation.)\n200$ Rent for my current situation.\n\nMom covers my car insurance, and my car payment is normally 200$ a month that I pay.\n\nI'm about 1,200$ behind on my car payment but I do have payment plan with them to pay it back. 400$ March 24th, 400$ April 7th, Skip a pay for another 400$, and 200$(other 200 from my mother) on the 15th of April. Here's what it comes to and there's just no way around it. Living here isn't working out, it isn't good for our relationship and it isn't good for my self-esteem. I'm leaving, a buddy of mine couple hours away has offered me a room for 400$ a month flat including utilities in Asheville, NC, 0$ to move in just 1st month rent, unfurnished. I have no potential jobs lined up.\n\nBasically I'm trying to come up with a budget that will allow me to move by May. I understand I'll be leaving my child and I've processed that a million times. My girlfriend and I have talked about it multiple times and agree it's what's best because, the ice is getting thin for me in this house due to my relationship with her family. So, I've got no where else to go. I have to eat out constantly because, well we've just run into too many bad situations with dishes etc. \n\nI'm in the process of trying to get my GED, I've been out of school since the 8th grade that's 12 years. I've got a Kaplan study book, and I've been working on it and it's definitely apart of my plan. My father offered to pay for the test on the condition that I finish the book which I'm almost done with so I was hoping to take an attempt mid April.\nI was looking into the local community college in Asheville but, obviously my GED is my 1st step.  \n\nMoving wise, I'm looking at around:\n\n30$ in gas for the 1st trip of my stuff.\n90$ for round a trip bus ticket for the rest of my clothes and to avoid an extra 800 miles on my car.\n200$ish? For a bed. I've seen 75$ Twin and one of those frame\/box springs for 66$ on Amazon.\n400$ for 1st months rent.\n200-300$ish until to live until I get a job?\n\nRoughly looks like I need 1000$. Anything I'm missing? Any tips or tricks to avoid any of this? Like maybe holding off on the bed for awhile? Any general life advice about my GED &amp; future plans would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\n\n\n ","19":"Hello guys!  Have a couple amazon cards for trade.

I would like to hear an interesting counter-point that says that day trading is good. Long read below\n\nWhereas speculation usually can lead to short-term loss over a period of months for the uninformed investor, day trading can accelerate said loss.  Akin to investing into a casino, day trading can allow one to earn double their value within minutes.  However, losing can cause one to become bankrupt without the ability to earn rewards points and sleep in a deluxe hotel, eating away at a comfortable buffet. \nBelow is an equation that shows how day trading works\n\nDay +\/-$= $A(R)+$B(R)+$C(R)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nThe amount of money that an individual makes per day in day trading (Day +\/- $) is the result of adding up all of the trades that the individual has made per day (A,B,C\u2026.), with the percentage of return from pulling out (R).  For example, with the first trade of the day (A(R)), an individual invested $10,000.  \n\nWhen pulling out, said individual broke even, meaning that the resulting equation is ($10,000(1)).  In another example, when investing that same $10,000 into a second stock, the individual gained $1,000; and therefore, the individual would have ($10,000(1.1)) for his second investment.  In the third investment, the individual lost $1,000; and therefore, the individual would have ($10,000(0.9)) for his third investment. \n\nTo consider the profit or loss one can have as a day trader, an example story can be used.  The example day trader (named Norm in the example) sets a goal to earn an average of $500 per trading day; and from the 260 trading days per year (in a non leap-year), Norm expects to make a pre-tax-and-expenses income of $130,000 per year. Through a set of twenty trades (at an average profit of $25 per trade), Norm aims to make his $500. \n\nFor each trades Norm makes, the day trade brokerage charges a commission fee of $10, meaning that Norm must make a profit of $700 per day to earn his $500.  Per trade, Norm must average $35 in profit; and since the trading day on the New York Stock Exchange runs for a period of 6.5 hours, Norm must make one-trade every twenty minutes.  Per trade, Norm invests 3,500 shares into a company with the expectation that an increase of one cent per share will lead to his goal of $35-profit-per-trade.\n\nOn November 28, 2014, Facebook opened at 9:30 a.m. at $77.69.  Norm invested 3,500 shares, $271,915 in economic value, into the company. At 9:55, the stock dropped to $77.30, meaning that had Norm pulled out, he would have lost $1,375, with $1,365 from the initial loss of Facebook\u2019s stock, along with the $10 in commission for trading with the online day-trader.   Moving on from his first loss of the day, Norm must now make $2,075 over the next nineteen trades to reach his goal, averaging $109.21 per trade. Next, at 10:00 a.m., Norm invests 3,500 shares into Pioneer Natural Resources at $177.65 per share, $621,775 in economic value. At 10:30 a.m., Pioneer Natural Resources share price is at $176.82; and if Norm pulls out, Norm loses $2,915.  Here, to make up for the losses he has so far incurred, Norm must now average $200.28 over the next eighteen trades. \n\nFinally, Norm at 10:30 a.m. puts 3,500 shares into Boeing, whose share price is $135.14 per share, with a market value of $472,990. At 11:00 a.m., Norm pulls his Boeing stock out at $135.02 per share, meaning that Norm lost $430 in thirty minutes by investing into a purported blue-chip company such as Boeing.  Here, Norm quits for the day, having lost $4,720 in ninety minutes. In this example, Norm invested his money into stocks regardless if the stock was speculative, resourceful, or of blue-chip criteria. In the short-term, any stock can lose money, regardless of their fundamentals, popularity, or external factors. \n\nThe risk of day trading for the average individual can be seen through the dot-com bubble.  Through a combination of innovative technology with speculative stocks, a new generation of day traders was created. Many of these day-traders were entrepreneurial at heart, looking to leave their jobs in search of making money without having an employer guiding them. Many of these day traders, they were of an older America, ones in their forties-through-sixties. \n\nWhile some of these individuals grew up in the Great Depression, few of these entrepreneurs believed that effects similar to the Stock Market Crash of 1929 would never happen to them. To these entrepreneurial day-traders, the development of the computer was the revolutionary technology that leveled out the playing field for the average individual. \n\nHowever, what separates the average individual from Goldman Sachs, as an example, is both experience and technology. The average American that quit their jobs to become a day trader during the dot-com era rarely had any experience in the investment field, only becoming aware of investment when said investment had rapidly entered the television and internet market. \n\nThese aspiring trades had little \u2013 if any \u2013 knowledge on basic concepts, such as a balance sheet, income statement, or the ability to understand the company itself that they were investing into. Many of these amateur day traders learned their business knowledge from CNBC, CNNfn, and Bloomberg.  In these cases, nearly every analysts, interviewee, and expert in the field of business and investment had been overly optimistic about the market when interviewed by financial news networks, echoing many others that believed that the growth was infinite. \n\nBy being heavily influenced by the men and women of media, the average day trader would buy stocks on the words of others.  Consequently, these stocks that were purchased often were speculative and emerging, such as Amazon and eBay. Because these stocks were considered popular, networks such as CNBC would encourage individuals to buy stocks into these companies; and thus a cycle was created where the unenlightened individual would invest into speculation.  \n\nThis is comparable to the knowledge and experience that companies, such as Morgan Stanley, possess. With these large firms, hundreds of employees are hired for the sole purpose of researching stocks.  Whether these stocks involve old-fashioned long-and-short, futures, and\/or derivatives, individuals are paid to research specifics.  With hundreds of employees employing research for the company, large firms have an advantage that day traders do not:  the numbers-and-knowledge game. \n\nEven if a day trader had decades of knowledge in the business market behind them, unless the day trader possesses technology that possesses the capability of trading almost-instantaneously, said day trader will have a tough time competing with today\u2019s firms.  Through the development of fiber optic cables from Spread Networks, many firms, such as Goldman Sachs, have been able to trade at a faster rate, meaning that within milliseconds of a trade, said firm can possess shares at a better price. \n\nThis millisecond-trade is comparable to the average day trader, who usually views stock quotes up to a fifteen minute delay, along with purchasing stocks that that seconds of processing; for while the Internet is comparatively faster today than it was in 1999,  the process of hitting the \u201cSubmit\u201d button, transmitting the information to the online brokerage firm, and then submitting the order, takes seconds. Thus, while an individual day trader may have been able to purchase a stock at $74.50, the large firm at the same time could have purchased stock at $74.45 per share. \n\n Even before-and-during the dot-com bubble, the technological advantage still remained with large firms.  By limiting access of viewing real-time quotes before the mid-1990\u2019s, firms could earn extra commission by waiting until the price of a share rose slightly (usually by a couple of pennies) before transacting the deal. After investigations from both the Department of Justice and SEC put a kibosh to these schemes, day trading grew, thanks in large part to day trading firms introducing real-time quotes for their customers, thereby giving the impression of fair game.  \n\nHowever, by taking advantage of the technology of the internet, day trading firms could handle the traders of the late-1990\u2019s who often trades dozens of times per day, thereby giving these firms a large amount of commission from the same individual.  Regardless of time period, the large firm possesses a technological advantage due to possessing the money needed to produce said resources.\n\nWith the amalgamation of these two factors, an individual who attempted to day trade in the 1990\u2019s usually lost money.  In Chicago, for example, a waiter was given a $200,000 inheritance.  With no experience in the investment market, the waiter entered the day trading business, losing the entire inheritance.  In California, reflective of the spirit of prospective day traders, a bank employee quit, having borrowed $40,000 on credit cards.  In short time, said former banker lost his borrowed money, in addition to his job.  In Boston, an elderly man lost $250,000 of his wife\u2019s savings in a few hours through day trading. The stress of losing money in day trading led to Mark Orrin Barton killing thirteen (including himself, his wife, and two children) individuals, mostly at two Atlanta, Georgia day trading firms .  \n\nThe tragedy of these case studies, apart from the even more tragic-and-unnecessary loss of life in the Barton example, is that each of these individuals were of the middle-class variety, having saved their life savings through years of hard work.  While it may have been possible that each individual realized the risk of day trading, these hard-working citizens probably did not realize the possibility that within hours, their entire investment could be wiped out through both commissions and fluctuation of the market. More so is the fact that the day trader\u2019s reliance on analysts in the media market would cost a fortune in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble bursting. \n\t \nLooking at the analysis of day trading, speculation only benefits the elite, with the term \u201celite\u201d used to describe the largest investment firms in the world.  These firms have the fiscal resources to obtain both the physical and technology needed to succeeed in the highly speculative world of day trading.  The employment of hundreds of physical individuals for the sole purpose of research specific stocks is an indicator of the firms willingness to limit risk.  With the ability to purchase cables that will speed up the purchasing of stock, these firms possess an advantage that the average day trader does not. \t\n","43":"[H] Amazon + Paypal [W] Steam wallet code","44":"[H] $42.14 American Eagle [W] Papa John's, Wal-mart, Amazon","45":"[H] $10 Amazon GC [W] $9.63 Paypal","46":"I think this stock is way overrated and will be facing 30-40% cut in its stock price over the next 4-6 months.

(15 year mortgage)\n* Our student loan debt is over **$60,000**\n * $15,500 @ 6.8%\n * $11,700 @ 6%\n * $10,900 @ 5.25%\n * $13,500 @ 4.5%\n * $9,000 @ 3.4%\n * We also contribute $70\/month to a parent plus loan my wife's parents are paying on.\n * That brings our total monthly student loan payment to **$861**\n* Our monthly expenses beyond our mortgage and student loan payments total **$1,850**. That is bare bones with no savings, spending money, etc.\n* We also have an **$869** balance on a 0%\/18mo credit card.\n* We also owe my parents **$450**, though we don't make payments on this debt every month.\n* Both of us have government jobs and are not required to contribute to our retirement plans.\n* We have **$1,500** in an emergency fund and are expecting about $1000 in tax refunds.\n\nAfter we got YNAB going, I decided to take another look at mint.com to see our complete financial situation. It lists our net worth as -$53,000. Buying a car seems impossible right now -- all the $900 beaters on Craigslist terrify me, and the thought of a car loan seems like digging in the wrong direction.\n\nBeyond this, we one day want my wife to stay home once we have children. I have no idea how that could be possible, even if we sold our house and rented a one bedroom apartment.\n\nDo you have any advice? What would you do in our situation?\n\nEDIT: Some have asked me to list the expenses that make up the $1,850 after mortgage\/student loans\n\n(I used estimates for some of these, but it should add up to around $1,850)\n\n* Church tithe (currently 10% of the gross): $633\n* Water: $39.10\n* Electricity: $90\n* Natural gas: $165 (this is based on our first couple of months here...should be less in the summer)\n* Car insurance: $68.58 (should go down\/up based on what kind of car we get)\n* Groceries: $440\n* Fuel (cars): $200\n* Personal care (haircuts, etc.): $50\n* Amazon Prime: $8.25\n* Credit card bill: $80\n* Cell bill: $110\n* Internet: $40\n\nEDIT 2:\nReally interesting that everyone assumed I am Mormon. Actually currently attending a Presbyterian church. I don't tithe so I can go to heaven, or so that God will bless me. I tithe mainly to support my local church whose mission and purpose I believe in. Some of you have given me things to think about, and I may talk to the elders at my church about lowering my tithe percentage while we claw our way out of debt.

I benefited from a post someone put up a month or so back, so I thought I would return the favor. Basically, if you create an account on [VidFall.com](http:\/\/vidfall.com\/) (non-ref) a very specific way from a new account, they give you 50,000 points. They have a contests section, where you can use points to buy entries to contests. They offer $1 codes for 10,000 Rewards points. If you put all 10k into a contest, you are guaranteed to win. If you have never been to [vidfall.com](http:\/\/vidfall.com\/) before, use your phone to do this with the WIFI off. They track by IP. \n\nStep 1: Go to [VidFall.com](http:\/\/vidfall.com\/) and click the \u201cReduce Price\u201d button on any deal.\n\nStep 2: At the end of the first video, a popup appears that says \u201cCongratulations, sign up today and earn 50K Rewards points. (Sign up here)\n\nStep 3: Click on the \u201cContests\u201d link in their header. Scroll through until you find a contest for a $1 code that has 100 of 100 entries remaining. Spend all 100 entries on the code. \n\nStep 4: Wait for them to send you an email. You\u2019ll receive it at the end of the contest (typically 24 to 48 hours). It will say you won. Respond back to claim the reward. Very important - use an email you actually check so you don\u2019t miss the email. If you don\u2019t respond in 5 days, you are disqualified. \n\nStep 5: Repeat until you run out of points. Sell your amazon codes on \/r\/giftcardexchange or use them. \n\nGood luck guys.

Plus in general I need to start on a new path towards good credit. \n\nI've done some preliminary research and I think I need to try and attempt debt validation and pay for delete for my current debt. Most of the debt is old so if they aren't willing to do pay for delete I will probably just let the statute of limitations run out rather than pay. \n\nFor debt validation I was going to follow the advice found [here](http:\/\/www.creditinfocenter.com\/rebuild\/debt-validation-workflow-large.shtml). From what I've read the strategy is to dispute the item with the Credit Bureau the same day that you send a debt validation letter to the collection agency.\n\nFirst Question: I was going to definitely send the collection agency my debt validation request in writing via certified mail with return receipt requested. Do I send the credit bureau a certified letter too? Or should I just contact them over email or through their websites? \n\nSecond Question: My total debt of $3,500 is a total of 7 different accounts and 5 different collection agencies. Should I start the debt validation and then possible pay for delete for all of these all at once? Or is it better to do it one at a time? Will the credit bureaus freak out if I dispute all of the accounts at once? \n\nThe other strategy I have for raising my credit score is to get a secured credit card. I'm a little scared to apply for one though. I recently applied for one of those Amazon.com store cards or whatever they are called. It's the card where it's not a real credit card and can only be used on Amazon and I got denied for that. Plus the inquiry from the Amazon card application knocked my score down a little bit.\n\nThird Question: Can a person in my position with 7 open collection accounts and a bad credit score even get a secured credit card? \n\nMy goal right now is to just get my score up to 600 so I can rent an apartment without a co-signer. I don't care about paying the debt off so if debt validation and pay for delete doesn't pan out I'll just wait out the statue of limitations on the debt. \n\nFourth Question: What other things can a person in my position of bad credit score and 7 open accounts in collection do to raise my credit score? \n\nAt this point I'm afraid to apply for anything. I was hoping the Amazon card would get approved but now I'm scared I won't get approved for anything until I get this debt deleted from my report either via pay for delete or through debt death from statute of limitations. \n\nI'm open to any ideas of things I could do like secured credit cards or other options that could raise my score. I have cash to invest but at this point I don't even know if I can get a cell phone in my name approved or anything like that and I only want to invest in things that will actively raise my credit score. \n","106":"[H] $5.50 Amazon GC [W] $5 PayPal","107":"[H] Amazon, Walmart GC [W] Google Wallet 90%","108":"[H] $65 Amazon GC (Canada) [W] $55 Paypal, SquareCash, e-transfer or any other cash-like item","109":"[H] $50 Amazon Gift Card [W] BTC","110":"[H] willing to trade $15-$20 paypal for $10 playstation store \/playstation plus or Amazon code","111":"[H] 2x $25 Amazon GC [W] 90% PayPal","112":"[H] willing to trade $15-$20 paypal for $10 playstation store \/playstation plus or Amazon code","113":"[H] $50 Amazon Gift Card [W] BTC","114":"Hi!

I have some money saved from my niche sites that make me over a $1k a month and I am in the process of selling one of my niche sites for $14,000. I have decided that I am going to put some of this money towards starting a new private label business on Amazon through their FBA program.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI have also decided to not go the route of buying a $4,000 course and I am going to figure everything out on my own. That means that I am going to use only free information on the internet and learn by doing and making mistakes. I know a lot of people want to get into this business but don't have the extra money to spend a ton of money on a course and have to pay for all of their initial inventory.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI will act as a test dummy for all of you and try to make some money on Amazon with only free information. I will be updating everyone as I go along. I posted the [introduction post](http:\/\/www.passionintopaychecks.com\/follow-along-as-i-try-to-make-money-with-amazon-fba-introduction) last night on my website and you can read what I said below. I have cut out some of the fluff and only kept the most important parts of the article.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThank you for reading and I hope this is something that will be of interest. The next update will be out soon!&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**What Can You Expect from me and this Case Study?**&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am going to be documenting all of my progress as I try and get a product up onto Amazon. I have not taken any paid courses about private labeling products or any type of course related to what I am going to be doing. I have found everything online for free and that is where I have gotten all of my information at this point. My plan is to absorb all of the information I can for free and figure everything else out on my own all while posting everything I find here for all of you.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAs I go through the process of getting my first product on Amazon and selling, I will be explaining every step for you guys to learn from and follow. I would rather save $3,500 and use that for my inventory and on learning by doing then on a course. By not following the course and doing things on my own I will act as a crash course dummy. I will be a test dummy for all of you that want to get started selling on Amazon but don\u2019t have enough money to buy the course AND all of your inventory.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy plan is to update you all very regularly as I go through the process of finding a product, finding a supplier and getting it on Amazon. It is not going to be that simple and there are a lot more details that go into private labeling a product and selling it but I will cover it all as I go through it myself.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**How Will I Be Updating the Case Study?**&amp;nbsp;\n\nI will be posting new updates very frequently on the site and I will show you every step of the way from beginning to the end. I will make use of videos a lot in this case study because I will be able to show you exactly what I am talking about visually instead of trying to explain everything through writing. I am going to be making videos for the niche research process, product selection, supplier selection and many other parts of the process that I feel are important.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI might even do some webinars to help answer questions that people may have or start a Facebook group for people that are looking to start selling on Amazon but don\u2019t want to spend a ton of money on learning from a course. Instead, we can all learn together as a group and help each other out when possible. I am also open to suggestions that any of you may have so let me know!&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**I Have Already Started\u2026.but I Will Catch You All Up**&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have already settled on a product that I am going to be selling but that is as far as I have gotten. I still am in the process of finding a good supplier that will do everything that I need.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe good news is that I will still have videos and updates covering the part that I have already completed. I will go through the whole process and explain every step. There will be a couple of updates to this case study that will come out here in the next week or two that will catch you all up to the point where I am at currently, which is looking for a supplier.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nEven though I am already a little ahead, I am still going to be updating the case study from the very beginning of the process and explaining each step of the way. The next couple of updates will be coming out at a quick rate so that I can catch you all up to where I am currently at as quick as possible.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Will I be Sharing my Exact Product?**&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am not sure yet. I don\u2019t want to risk sharing my product and niche and then have people either a) try to sabotage my project or b) bring in extra competition that there wouldn\u2019t be otherwise.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut I do see the benefit of sharing my product so I can use that as my example in everything I do in this case study. I am pretty torn on this decision and I am still deciding, I would love to hear what you all think about this. So please let me know in the comments below.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Will This be Free?**&amp;nbsp;\n\nYES.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis whole case study is 100% free and I am not going to sell you anything. I am doing this because I want to document my progress as well as help people succeed on Amazon who don\u2019t have the extra money to spend on courses.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI think I have a pretty good grasp on what I need to do to be successful on Amazon but I will be constantly learning and everything that I learn will be shared here, with you.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Conclusion** &amp;nbsp;\n\nI hope this post wasn't too long and that you are all interested in following my journey. All of the updates will be posted here - [my site](http:\/\/www.passionintopaychecks.com) but I will also be posting the updates here as much possible.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThank you again for reading!\n\n**Edit**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[See all of the updates here](http:\/\/www.passionintopaychecks.com\/my-amazon-fba-journey\/)\n","128":"[H]$25 Amazon, [W] Paypal @ 90%","129":"This April marks my 1 year anniversary of getting onto this crazy ride. Here are some musings and data-points which will hopefully be on some benefit to newbies.\n\nBefore April 2014, I had only 1 credit card, a Capital One platinum that was approved for $300 credit limit. I am an immigrant, and didn't have an SSN until 2013. This is a story of how I hacked my credit score to my advantage with very little effort.\n\nMy current snapshot:\nTU Score: 720\nEX Score: 739\n\nCurrent cards in order of application:\n1. Capital One Platinum MasterCard\n\n2. DiscoverIT\n\n3. CapitalOne QuickSilver\n\n4. BarclayCard Arrival+ MasterCard\n\n5. Chase Ink Plus\n\n6. United MileagePlus Explorer personal\n\n7. Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select\n\n8. Club Carlson Premiere Personal\n\n9. United MileagePlus Explorer business\n\n10. AmEx Platinum personal\n\n11. British Airways Visa Card\n\n12. USAirways Dividend miles mastercard\n\nI used Amazon payments for a good 6 months before it closed. \nI used AmEx Serve until this month, when I switched to the RedBird.\n\nI managed to scale my credit score only by making weekly payments on all my outstanding balances. I carry a balance only on my Ink plus, because i cashed in and prepaid some business expenses.\n\nI now have available credit limit of over $50000, up from $300 I had 13 months ago.\n\nMy approximate point balances:\n\n1. 100000 MR\n\n2. 90000 UR\n\n3. 80000 United Miles\n\n4. 120000 AA + UA miles (after conversion)\n\n5. 60000 club carlson points\n\n6. 50000 Avios\n\nFree RT trips and stays I scored:\n\n1. ORD to SFO\n\n2. ORD to LAS\n\n3. ORD to DEN\n\n4. MDW to CLT\n\n5. 3 nights stay in CLT, NC\n\n6. 2 nights stay in SFO\n\n7. 2 x MDW to SFO\n\n8. ORD to MSP\n\nI am now planning on flying my parents out from BOM India to ORD, 2 round trip tickets ORD to SEA and PDX (using stopovers) and an Amtrak trip + Caribbean cruise in July using my chase UR.\n\nSome data-points:\n\n1. AmEx airline credit $200 (03\/2015) for 4 x southwest giftcards was a success.\n\n2. Buying RedCard on dummy info and registering with real credentials (02\/2015) worked.\n\n3. MS on RedBird using an Amex card counts towards minimum spend.\n\nI might be forgetting something and will update as and when I remember more.

I know this valuation seems high at 20x-27x, but the links I've built are real solid high quality authority links obtained through outreach\/negotiations and the website was designed and built by me, no CMS, just html\/javascript\/css.\n\nWhat if I included 2 other similar affiliate websites that are currently not earnings any money, but are completed and fully functional with articles, just without back-links and love?\n\nDo you think I could fetch 11k-15k for these websites? Is there a way I can sell the website without revealing it to the public?\nI know there are brokers for middle\/high end website transactions, is there one for small websites that don't want to submit themselves to the onslaught of Flippa?

This is what I use for most spending \u2013 mostly my groceries, eating out, going out, and beer money\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my monthly debit \u201cliabilities\u201d are around $2400.00. So I have $1,000.00 extra that for the last year has been going toward credit card debts. Now I find myself with little in savings (500), and around 500 in checking. That amount in savings will grow.\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n\u2022\tI do not have any retirement savings started.\n\n\u2022\tI want to buy a house.\n\n\u2022\tMy credit has gone from below 650 to above 750. I just watch the TransUnion and Equifax per Credit Karma.\n\n\n\n\nMy main goal is to buy a house, I have nothing in savings for a downpayment but I would be a first-time home buyer. I think I could save 15,000 by March 2016 if I continued my current \u201cpath\u201d. (staying in an apt)\n\n\nMy car will be paid off in 2017. My student loans will be paid off in 2018.

Should I put my realistic higher income (which has gone up yearly) and possibly get a higher card limit or put it low, so I know I won\u2019t get an increase? I don\u2019t need a higher limit for spending, but would it help or hurt my credit?

The post office offers free shipping boxes, but the flat rate is really high - $9+.\n\nSo far I have just been saving boxes and as much packing material as possible from Amazon.

Firstly I would like to thank this subreddit for its great peeps who continue to inspire and motivate me, and many others, daily. \n\nI used to be one of those people who had a tonne of ideas in their head but never did anything about it, but lately I have been inspired to at least try building something. \n\nMy wife has been going through a tough time, plagued by physical illness which has been making things so difficult for her. I am in the UK but the NHS has been pretty crap at helping her so I want to  her to go private. That costs money. A lot of money. Hence the inspiration! \n\nI thought it would be best to start small, so I figured I would give a niche review\/affilate site a go. I read, researched and absorbed - but I actually took the final step to build it too (which never usually happens...). I finally did it! \n\nThe next step I am going to take is to start a web dev consultancy in my spare time (10 hours a week commute time). Exciting! :)\n\nIf you are someone who is sitting there with a tonne of ideas but never does something, just pick ANYTHING and do it. It is so liberating. Start small and build to your dreams. I often get too distracted with the complex and overlook the simple. The simplest thing to do is just take that first step.\n\nSo, i figured I would give a little back :)\n\n**Finding the niche:**\n\n   People always find this the hardest part, and I did but it is as easy as just picking a topic and drilling down, deeper and deeper. Iv'e found the best tool for this initially is google keywordplanner. Once you have a niche idea, check out your competition by typing in \"yournichehere blog\" and putting there site info into spyfu.com. You can see the kind of pages that are popular and keywords they are using and paying for.\n\n**Building the site:**\n\n   I used wordpress to build the site, it's super easy to use and can be customised to suit your needs. I found that the three most important things that have come up in my research for building an affilate niche site are: speed, making the monies and (obviously) affilating\/advertising!\n\t\n**Useful plugins to complete your mission:**\n\n1. Jetpack - your first step is to install the Jetpack plugin, it's so useful! It's essentially an all in one package - but make sure you only activate the bits you NEED.\n2. EWWW Image Optimizer - This plugin is friggin awesome. As it says, it optimises your images so your pages load quicker!\n3. PopupAlly - This allows you to get lots of emails from potential customers and users of your site! This is super important! Imagine the wonders you could accomplish with a huuuuuuge email list!?\n4. UpdraftPlus - Backup\/Restore - This plugin can be set up to automatically backup your whole wordpress site should anything bad happen! I have mine set up to send the backups to an email, but you can set it up to send it to dropbox too :)\n5. Wordfence Security - Now, the first reason you will want this is obvious... security. But... one of the main reasons you will want this plugin is speed. SPEED?! Yes. Speed. Enable Wordfence Falcon Engine caching and see the AMAZING speed difference! (gtmetrics.com is awesome for this :))\n6. Wordpress SEO by Yoast - SEO is still pretty important for people to find your website and your content. This plugin makes it easier to do some basic SEO on your site. If you are a Noob like me, check out this quick start guide: http:\/\/onlinemediamasters.com\/yoast-wordpress-seo-tutorial\/ .\n7. WP Slimstat - This plugin provides you with simple stats on who is doing and viewing what on your site, pretty essential for you to see what is working and what isn't!\n[If you want to have an affilate shop\/store....]\n8. WooCommerce + WooZone - Both these addons can be used to import (woozone) and create (woocommerce) an affilate shop for your site, which can work well in some cases.\n9. CloudFlare Plugin- this CDN speeds up your site a lot and adds some basic security! Cool! (you have to sign up on their website to link it to the plugin) but yay, it's free!\n\t\t\n**Ads?**\n\n1. Amazon associates - The Amazon associates program is pretty awesome, sign up and you can use their link builder to link to specific products from your site and get some commision! 5-7% I believe! \n2. VigLink\/Adsense - I got banned from adsense years ago so am using VigLink, it is pretty awesome. Converts some words into affilate links automatically and can also re-affilate your affilate links!\n3. RevenueHits - I know a lot of people have had good success with this, it is pretty easy to use and incorporate into your site.\n\n**Traffic?**\n\n1. Social Media: Social media is super important to get yourself noticed and drive traffic to your site. You installed the Jetpack plugin right? Well set up Publisize to auto post on social media for you whenever you have a new post published - do this sooner rather than later because you can't go back and share old published posts... grrr.\n2. Links (the back linking kind): Backlinks are links that link back to your awesome affilate site. A good way to use these to drive traffic to your website is to write content for blogging platforms and link back to your website. These free blogging platforms like blogger\/wordpress will have higher ranks on google by default so will get the attention of your audience quicker!\n\n**Hosting?**\n\nI personally used and like tsohost. It has an easy 1 click install for wordpress and it's pretty darn cheap!\n\n**Final Words**\n\nSome of the best advice you are going to get for building affilate sites is from these blogs:\n\n1. http:\/\/www.quicksprout.com\/\n2. http:\/\/www.nichepursuits.com\/\n3. https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/\n\nThe rest my friend, is on you. Get up and do!\n\n*I am by no means an expert, in fact I am a Noob. I just started my affilate site so... if any experts see this and wouldn't mind throwing me some advice please hola at me. Likewise if there are any Noobs noobier than me then please hola also :)*\n\nMuch love,\nHAY","170":"About 6 months ago, I started a website. I knew literally nothing about what I was doing.

Is that slight difference in screen pixels really worth double the money, just to be outdated in a few months again?\n\nMovie Tickets: The cinemas are expensive. I\u2019m not saying you should stay away from the theaters entirely, but look for deals. On Ibotta there are movie ticket rebates. If you are a student, make sure you find out what days you can buy discounted tickets. If you go see a movie in the daytime\/afternoon, the tickets are usually around half of their normal price. Another alternative is value cinemas, which are cinemas that sell value tickets for movies that have hit cinemas a few months ago. With this you still get the cinema experience, but you are paying only $2.50 (price in my town) on a Friday night .\n\nCDs &amp; DVDs: A collection of some classics is understandable, but why pay for a mountain of movies you will only watch once or twice. Try a streaming service like Amazon Prime. For music if you use Amazon Prime, you\u2019ll also get Amazon\u2019s streaming music service for the same price. Are you a student? Find out how to get Amazon Prime free for six months here.\n\nEmail Addresses: A scary number of people are still paying monthly dues to have a personal email address. The bulk of them being through AOL, even though AOL is free now. Why do they still charge you? Because you didn\u2019t tell them to stop.\n\n4k Televisions: 4k TV\u2019s are beautiful in the store, playing their ultra hd content on a constant loop. Here\u2019s the trick, there is almost no content yet to watch in ultra hd. There are a hand full of movies(that you\u2019ll have to buy). Cable tv doesn\u2019t yet have ultra hd stations, streaming services don\u2019t yet have ultra hd streaming. Your 4k tv just set you back $4000 and you are still watching normal 720p and 1080p content. Just wait a little while, by the time there is content to watch, those televisions will cost half of what they do now. And you\u2019ll actually be able to use them!\n\nYour dryer: In most homes the clothing dryer is the most costly appliance to run. This is easy to avoid. You just have to hang your laundry. The savings are so significant that we actually wrote an entire article about it, Money Saving Benefits of Hanging Your Laundry Indoors.\n\nYour Old Desktop: Do you have an old desktop in your home that you don\u2019t even use? Turn it off and unplug it. An average full desktop will cost you $9.53 a month to power. Over a year that is probably more than the current value of the desktop. Just donate it, be a good person, save on your energy bill, and get a tax break.\n\nPaper Towels: We don\u2019t buy paper towels anymore, period. Most all paper towel jobs can be done by a sponge, or a reusable rag, For everything else, like getting grease from food, or cleaning screens use a coffee filter.\n\nOnce you make one of these changes in your life, don\u2019t squander the money on more things you do not need.

Service: \n\n-Book Cover Design\n-Book Trailers\n-Branding Materials \n\n2.) I'm a self-published writer with a modicum of success (do about 1k a month on 2 books and have hit Amazon best-seller lists.) and through that I've made a lot of contacts with other more succesful authors. While I was doing this I interned with another agency and I left to start my own design agency when I realized I could be making so much more independently if I leveraged my contacts and reputation as an author. \n\n3.) I've been on my own since December. \n\n4.) Right now my plan is to SEO optimize my site, ramp up social media, and continue work on my books (I've gotten really behind on writing because of design)  and building good will with my various contacts. I also am considering going back to school to take some more formal design classes to up my skill set and network. I've worked with some small publishers, but I'd love to possibly up my game and go for some bigger fish. \n\nLooking way ahead I'd love to possibly get into coordinating custom photoshoots for super high-end covers for indies. There are many authors who want this service, but there just aren't that many people doing it. But it would be a significant cost investment on their end and on my end.\n\n5.) I've had a great time working on everything from covers for dragon fantasy western novels to gay romance novellas. My favorite part is how I get to do a new project almost every couple of days. I love the pace. My most negative experience is trying to deal with Blurb and third-party printers, especially with hard-covers, which to be honest has been a bit of a nightmare. \n\n6.) I would tell myself to quit working for the other agency earlier and make it a clean break. As it is she fired me because she claimed I was violating a non-compete by linking work I had done with her that won an award to my pen-name instead of my real-name. (She had agreed that I could run my own business and work for her, but ultimately the position was just untenable. I should've gone all or nothing.)  And now I won't be able to use her as a reference on my resume, even though I think for the most part I did good work for her.  \n\nOkay now my question: \n\nHere is my pricing structure, and I feel like it's overly involved and not optimized to make me money: http:\/\/sfrostcovers.com\/book-covers\/\n\n Right now my two highest selling options are my Beautifully Branded Option and the Superbly Series-ous option. Most of my clients I say do the Superbly Series-ous. Right now my prices are mid-upper compared to many other designers in my same skill-set, so I don't think I'm ready to increase prices. That said I am worried that my Superbly Series-ous may be cannabalizing my other prices too much, but on the other hand it's not all that much work as long as I do them all at once and I don't want to price myself out of my client base.","192":"Type | Rate\n---|---\nBarnes &amp; Noble | 50%\nBurger King | 60%\nAmazon | 75%\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2ue6s3\/ugoodtimeshaxor_gcx_rep_profile\/","193":"Just got another round of Amazon gift cards in.

Paid in full every month, usage averages 10-15%. CreditKarma puts my score in the low 700s.\n\nI got impatient with the secured CCs, I find no use for them since they have no rewards and CapitalOne has a $39 yearly fee that's coming up in a month (yes, I can have it waived this year, but they're still holding several hundred $ hostage, so no point anyway). \n\nSo I applied and was approved for Discover It, CapitalOne Quicksilver, and graduated my BofA into a Cash Rewards. I wanted to keep BofA mainly as it is my oldest card.\n\nThe thing is, I live in a remote area and I shop off of Amazon all the time. It's convenient and cheaper than a lot of stores around here. So I thought I might as well see what's up with the Amazon Chase and SallieMae MasterCard. I didn't get the Chase and I'm still waiting on SM, but I don't see it happening as none of my three new cards have shown on my credit record yet. (I say three though in reality BofA is a graduated card, so it's actually two).\n\nIf I don't get approved for SM, is it worth reapplying once Discover, QS and BofA kick in - so in a month or two - or should I wait longer? I don't really care for the hard pulls on my record as I am not planning on taking out loans, buying a house or anything major really and after I get a card I can use on amazon, I don't think I'll be opening new credit cards for years. Plus, in my mind, the cashback on amazon and the responsible use of one more card (either Chase or SM) would outweigh the negative effect of hard pulls and actually work in my favor in the long run. \n\nAm I wrong in assuming that?

I may not participate much, but I'm always out there lurking over your shoulder.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I hope this can be helpful for some of you to see my thought process behind the page design...and hopefully some of you experts out there will give me solid pointers.\n\n**Who Am I? What Am I Doing Here?**\n\n**ONE**\n\nI'm the owner (and only employee...and when I say only employee, I mean that I run this company on nights and weekends when I'm not working my day job...and recruit friends for help at every opportunity) of a niche extreme pogo stick company, and we're in the process of launching our newest pogo stick, the V4. This will be our first update in several years, and I've put everything into it. The design began a year ago, and the tooling and new inventory cost has been pretty tremendous. \n\n\n**TWO**\n\nI need your opinion and input on my web page wire frame and layout. \n\n**THREE**\n\nI need your help in turning my layout into an amazing design...and then I need implementing the design on the site...and then I can use some help in marketing it. I was going to head over to [r\/forhire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/forhire), but I figured a bunch of you guys probably run companies or services that I can hire instead! \n\n**Website Critique**\n\nWe're about 6 weeks away from launching the V4, so it's time to get the web page up and ready to start taking pre-orders.\n\nVideo for reference: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/NnOTwc0H0fw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NnOTwc0H0fw)\n\nI need help in figuring out exactly what needs to be on the page in order to convince customers (most of which have never even seen our pogo stick in person) that they're worth  $400. I've spent a good amount of time laying out what I think is necessary to have on the page. I've also created a wireframe for the graphics. \n\n[Wireframe design is here](http:\/\/imgur.com\/I2BcmAq)\n\nI could really use some input from you. How can I improve this page to sell more pogo sticks? This page will be responsible for probably 80% of my company's sales for the next 2 years. It's worth it to me to create an amazing page. I'm open to any crazy ideas you've got. Keep in mind, this company is made up of me working nights and weekends...some things will be over my head or too costly to implement right now.\n\n**NEEDS TO ADDRESS**\n\n**How do you sell a $400 pogo stick sight unseen?** Most of our customers have never seen our pogo stick in person. They've only seen it on things like \"Shark Tank\", YouTube videos, or social media. All they have to base their review on is the research they do prior to purchase. From that point, they simply cross their fingers until they open the box and see how good the pogo stick really is. Is there any way I can relieve some purchase decision stress here?\n\n**Are you going to break your neck?** This is a pretty significant concern and a difficult line to walk. We want to display the breathtaking stuff that our sticks can do so that kids see the amazing potential...but a large portion of our sales are presents from parents to kids. The last thing a mom wants to do is buy her kid a potential torture device. Our pogo sticks are pretty safe for most people because they only give as much as you put into them. You're not going to get on it and fly 6 feet in the air because it takes a lot of practice to develop the balance necessary to start bouncing high. Most people only jump about 6-12\" high at first. Most kids won't be able to go higher than a few feet until they get heavy and strong enough to really push it. So is it dangerous? It can be. The plan here is to show a video compilation of kids getting onto it and bouncing for the first time. This should help concerned mothers to see that their kids won't accidentally jump onto the roof of their house. \n\n**Why pay $399 for the V4 when the V3 will cost $319?** Because I say so! The V4 holds 14\" of additional air volume. It may not sound like much, but this extra air changes everything. It's a softer, smoother, easier bounce. It's easier to learn on. It's easier to do tricks on. It's easier to bounce 4' high without putting in lots of effort. You can bounce for longer periods of time without getting tired. Kids who don't weight enough to use the V3 can still use the V4. Guys who want to bounce high can go a lot higher. It has less parts, is lighter, and because of that it's more durable.  I'm 100% convinced that it's worth the extra money, but how do I convince people of that through a web page?\n\n**Is it even worth $400?** Honestly, it just comes down to how much you use it. Some people will use it several times per week and some will have it sit in their garage collecting dust. It's an amazing workout and a fun way to go about it. The things are built like a tank and come with a 1-year warranty on parts, so you don't need to continue spending money on it once you have it in your hands. We make them in the US (Southern California) and bounce test every single one prior to boxing and shipping. \n\n**Am you going to get ripped off?** 100% of our sales are made online, so this is important to address. Yes, we're selling a really legitimate product, and I provide the best customer service that I possibly can...I treat everyone exactly how I'd like to be treated if I were in their shoes.  Because of that, our Amazon reviews are pretty awesome to reach through. However, Amazon takes $60 out of our sale and pockets it, so the last thing I want to do is link out to Amazon and have people purchase there. How do I convince people they're not going to get ripped off?\n\n**PAGE BREAKDOWN**\n\nThe page is laid out as a series of screens - organized by order of importance - each of which is devoted to a particular subject. The first page introduces the V4, displays a video, and then compares the two different V4 models - the V4 and the V4 Pro. Anyone who lands on this page after clicking a link will know exactly they're looking at right away.\n\nAfter the first screen is a little section divider with a quote from one of our team riders. \n\nThe next screen compares the V4 to the V3 and will have a video discussing who the V4 would benefit and who the cheaper V3 will benefit....and so on.\n\nI feel that each of the screens relates to questions that I'm frequently asked or concerns that I hear from people on a constant basis. \n\n**R\/FORHIRE**\n\nI need help and am willing to pay for help. Shoot me an email if you think you can help out.\n\n**Design**\n\nI did the graphics myself to start it off, but I'm looking for someone to take my graphics and make the page amazing. If you run a web design service I'll be looking for someone in the next couple of days.\n\n**Dev**\nSince I don't know much about code and want to make sure this page is very mobile friendly, I also need someone who can implement the design properly into my Wordpress theme. \n\n**Marketing\/PR**\n\nFinally, if you can help me get the word out, I could use some help in that arena.

First, the announcements.\n\n###Announcements\n\n#####Say hello to your new moderators!\n\nWe're very happy to announce that four new moderators have joined the GCX Mod Team! In no particular order (well, alphabetical order), \/u\/BKLCL, \/u\/dive-n-dash, \/u\/GamerBryan, and \/u\/Katzuhiki have all accepted invitations to moderate GCX! All four of these guys have been helping out with enforcing the rules of the subreddit, and have demonstrated the trustworthiness, patience, and willingness that it takes to help moderate this great community. Say hello to them in the comments below!\n\nOne of the main reasons the mod team has grown is because [the community here has grown too](http:\/\/redditmetrics.com\/r\/giftcardexchange) (see that spike? That was [Christmas!](http:\/\/redd.it\/2qbj04)), and there is quite a bit of work for the mod team to handle behind the scenes. This will allow for faster turnaround times to messages in the modmail, and overall better, more effective moderating.\n\n---\n\n#####Introducing the new Flair Request Form - for faster flair requests!\n\nGoing along the same theme of making the mod team more effective, one of our biggest weaknesses has been flair requests. (We're going through the remaining ones and are almost caught up!) The reason for this is because reddit's modmail is just terrible, and sorting out flair requests from the other messages we get throughout the day is nearly impossible, despite our efforts to organize it.\n\nSo, after testing the form and spreadsheet with a few individials, we're happy to introduce [the GCX Flair Request Form](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1jdM5A557vPIJBsEHoxtd4WXwuwuWWqMLXwdZ8A4dtdA\/viewform)! (Previously, we actually had flair requests sent to the modmail for \/r\/GCXRep instead of \/r\/giftcardexchange using the links in that wiki, but even that's not cutting it anymore.) We apologize if some of the instructions seem odd, such as answering in terms of month as a plain integer, but it helps us keep our requests [uniform and more organized](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JdZmYem.png)! The content of the wiki and the \/r\/GCXFlair Flair Guide have been updated to include the link to the form for easy reference. \n\n\n---\n\n#####GCXFlair Mods wanted!\n\nWe get a lot of offers from people asking if they can help moderate GCX, or if not, just help pitch in somehow, and we appreciate every single one of them! We're not looking for more moderators for GCX at this time, because the process of picking out who can moderate a place this crazy, where thousands of dollars of gift cards are traded daily is pretty extensive.\n\nBut, we would love more help with flair requests! If you'd be interested in helping with flair requests and want to be involved with that process, **[use this link](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1ufbMz8q5koZGqgUoIYExMriMHPwgTZGST4KYn8ywrm8\/viewform?usp=send_form)** to contact the moderators of GCX for this topic. The more the merrier! The ultimate decision for flair requests will still be left to the mods of GCX for safety purposes. This would be a tremendous help to the community as a whole, and this has the potential to turn into a position as a GCX mod down the line.\n\n---\n\n#####GCXRep Gatekeepers wanted!\n\nWe also need some help with \/r\/GCXRep. Sometimes scammers make a bunch of trading alts and fake trades with each other to build up rep to trick people into trading with them based on that fake rep. We recently tried restricting \/r\/GCXRep to catch this and manually approve each post, but the workload was too much and we had to go back, even though it was effective.\n\nIf we had some \"gatekeepers\" to help look through the recent (or even not so recent) submissions of \/r\/GCXRep and make sure that no one is faking any trades or anything of that nature, and to report any suspicious activity to the mods of GCX, we'd appreciate that. \n\nYou would be permitted to comment on other people's profiles when appropriate, which is an exception to the rules of GCXRep, and you would have a \"GCXRep Gatekeeper\" flair on GCXRep so you can distinguish yourself a bit when you comment on someone else's profile. (If someone can come up with a better\/cooler name than \"Gatekeeper,\" don't hold back! Suggest it in the comments of this post.)\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd want to help out with, **[use this link](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1pmsnFT8Z9byT8OxLCR1n2D3RHTAW6N1N4TWkUK2wt-U\/viewform?usp=send_form)** to contact the moderators of GCX for this topic.\n\n###Town Hall: Housekeeping Notes and Feedback Requests\n\n#####R.I.P. Kindle Trick\n\nJust a heads up, the Kindle Trick no longer works on Amazon, and has been removed from the GCX FAQ. From now on, if you want to trade Amazon balance, you'll need at least the value of a Prime membership in your gift card balance - and, of course, moderator approval, as per Rule 4.\n\n---\n\n#####New Rules\n\nThe new rules seem to be working very well, the only downside being that it's more work for the mods and sometimes we don't get back to you guys as fast as anyone would like to. For the most part, everyone has been really patient and understanding, and we appreciate that a lot. With the addition of more mods and a new subreddit for faster turnaround with messages, efficiency should be a lot better, but we wanted some feedback from the community on how the new rules are working for you so far.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for tweaking them, or for how to phrase any of them more effectively, particularly Rules 2, 4, and 5, which are the most commonly violated, please let us know in the comments, or message the modmail if you'd like to speak in private. We are very welcoming of constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement! *Please note that if you trade with someone who is breaking a rule, such as offering more than $100 in gift cards at a time, YOU are also subject to disciplinary action. We need the community to be somewhat self-policing.*\n\n---\n\n#####Restricting submissions to \/r\/GCXRep\n\nGoing along the lines of the Gatekeepers, we wanted to gauge the community's thoughts on taking it a step further making GCXRep a place for approved submitters only. As previously mentioned, we actually tried this out for a bit, and it cut down on fake trade confirmations a ton, but it was difficult to keep up with adding people as approved submitters, so we made it public again, where anyone can submit a post.\n\n*Assuming that this is something that the mod team could keep up with* (and that's for us mods to worry about, not you), would you be willing to have \/r\/GCXRep restricted to approved submitters to cut down on scammers making fake trades, or would you find getting one-time approval to submit a GCX Rep Profile too cumbersome? Restricting it would not stop anyone from making comments, only from making posts (GCX Rep Profiles). This is a preliminary idea at this point, which is why we wanted some community input.\n\n---\n\n#####Encouraging transparency in GCXRep trade confirmations\n\nAs we mentioned in February's town hall, putting trade amounts (note: just *amounts*, not *rates*) in the confirmations would be beneficial. Instead of just saying \"Amazon vs Paypal\", we will encourage people to say \"$50 Amazon for paypal\" or \"Amazon for $25 paypal\". The idea behind this is to make it easier to spot users who are doing a large number of small trades, then 'cashing in' that rep to scam someone of a large amount. Those who include trade amounts from now on would be more a little more likely to be granted the next level of flair upon requesting it, and those who wish to keep trade amounts private will still be allowed to do so, but they might need a few more trades or something to be granted the next level of flair. We wanted to know the community's thoughts on this idea, which is also fairly preliminary at this point.\n\n___\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to chime in on the comments below, or message us using the modmail link in the sidebar.

I haven't felt this free since I was 18 (I'm 29). Why? Maybe because I've been in debt since starting college!! I had no idea how much it weighed me down. If you are thinking about getting out of debt I recommend reading:\n\n- Total Money Makeover (or other Dave Ramsey books)\n- Your Money or Your Life\n- Early Retirement Extreme (this is extreme but it serves a good purpose in reminding you how little you really need, materially, to be happy)\n\n6 months ago I was spending more than I made every month with a wannabe urban hipster lifestyle. I realized that I could never have the lifestyle of some of my friends because they have wealthy parents or whatever, and I've been independent my whole adult life, and I stupidly took out a lot of student loans. This may seem irrelevant to you, but it was an important shift of mindset for me. Stop comparing your life to others, you will never make progress. I just started to think about how I can improve my own life, and it started with taking a square look at my finances, no matter how ugly it may seem. \n\nThis became my life mission, to get rid of the debt that made me feel trapped into working certain high paying jobs, and prevented me from thinking about living a different kind of life than the standard middle class employment job grind. I started to dream about being debt free and maybe even financially independent one day, or at least more free than I was then, and all the choices I would have. \n\nI moved to an area considering very \"uncool\" by materialistic idiots who believe that where you live actually makes you cool or not. I sold all my shit, including video games I accumulated over years, including from Japan (little tear T_T). I spent weekends mailing books I sold on Amazon or eBay. One time I sold a book that went out of print, I discovered, for $100. Even though at that time I upped my rate to $70\/hr, I still scrimped, saved, and sold. I sold about half my wardrobe. I cancelled my Internet, and phone bill. I was employed earning a lawyer salary and I had no freaking phone number and I rode the bus to work. I ate for free at work, so I'd eat as much as I could and then eat as little as I could when I got home. I ate all the food I had before buying more food. At that time I really thought this was extreme, but around 4-5 months into it, I got used to it and realized how easy it is, and how lucky I am to be able to pay off my debts. If you want to cancel your phone plan, by the way, you can. You can use free apps to make phone calls when work related stuff *demands* you call them, for whatever stupid reason. Yes I also cancelled Netflix. The only stuff I had left was my bed, my bookselves, some books, half the wardrobe I had, and my musical instruments. And a skateboard (this was my weekend entertainment for the first 2 months into frugal living). \n\nToday I am debt free, making more than twice the income I was making 6 months ago, and spending less than I was spending then every month. The high risk nature of my work is still there, that hasn't changed. Job changes are frequent, but that comes with the ability to earn a high pay. But I feel way more safe with my financial profile finally straightened out.\n\nIf you are thinking about doing this lifestyle, freaking do it. You will be so much happier. You don't need that expensive materialistic crap that everyone works their whole life for (or paying the credit card debt after they bought crap they couldn't afford). It's shallow, wasteful, and at best it's just making you broke. You can NEVER keep up with the Joneses, so just stop. It's insanity. If you are sufficiently motivated and intelligent, you can improve your earning, get out of debt, and bring peace to your mind, and to your life. If I can do it, you can do it too. You have **no idea** what a burden debt is until it's gone. You just got used to it, but it's a huge burden.\n\nOne last thing. **Yes it's fucking hard**. At first anyway. I was riding the bus two hours **each way** to work. Walking everywhere. Sold everything. I was living in a way that seemed extremely frugal compared to my roommates who probably make a quarter, or less, than I make per year. Not to mention my wannabe middle class debtor coworkers, who are deep into their 40's with no intention of ever living modestly (imagine parking lots full of brand new BMW's, etc). Can you imagine rolling up to work after riding buses for 2 hours, and your coworkers wondering why in the world you don't own a car (and they got there after a 15 minute drive)? Meanwhile I would ask for rate increases at every chance I got, and I always got it. Anyway, yeah at first it's hard to wean yourself off of the materialistic teet you have become addicted to. When you are inside the **machine**, the suburban drive-to-work and drive-back-to-my-mortgaged-home lifestyle, riding the bus and pinching every penny so you can escape your debt and work towards a dream of freedom can be really hard. You will be around nearly 100% drunks, homeless, and poor who literally can not drive because they can't get the credit, or they have restrictions, etc. Why? When you're earning a lawyer's salary shouldn't you \"reward yourself\"?? Oh yes, the Devil will tempt you back into debt. It's a modest dream, of freedom. But it's so worth it. If, by whatever tiny chance you are reading this and you are considering getting out of debt, I implore you to read those books and change your life. It'll be really hard for a while. But then when you realize what you get in exchange, **it's also ridiculously easy**. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my good mood and good fortunes with all of you, who like me have to work for a living. It actually took me a couple weeks of being debt free before I finally felt the joy from being debt free. I imagine it'll keep increasing over time. Getting out of debt and being debt free is a sort of slow happiness that happens over time. Kinda like the opposite of buying shit you can't afford. \n\n\nedit: Sorry to have upset many of you. I was hoping to inspire more than anything. I wasn't given anything in life, in fact all my friends and peers always seemed to have a better home situation than I did. That said, I still feel incredibly fortunate. But I did absolutely work many years for this, and I'm not sorry I make a lot of money. Actually I make more than $70\/hr, I make an equivalent to $100 an hour now. ","273":"Want Amazon Gift Cards, will take smaller values in quantities.

I have commented on this sub quite a bit and the company I own has been in business for 3 years and we are pretty successful but my goal is to achieve sustainability and I am not sure if I am on the right path.  A little back story is below and it focuses on how I grew my business.  My apologies if it sounds like a rant at certain points.\n\nI started my business just over 3 years ago.  I had started a previous business and I was familiar with the market.  I took out a small loan and bought up about 80K in excess inventory.  This inventory was mostly power tools.  I found a small warehouse and hired a distant family member.  The items I bought were tools.  I opened an Ebay account and an Amazon account and started selling tools.  At the same time, I found a way to spend 10-20K a month at a big box retailer and I was then reselling their items on Ebay and Amazon at 10-20% margins.  I bought a work van and started driving to every single big box retailer in central Florida looking for a small selection of items that were on sale.  My first year in business, this is most of what we did.  I would hunt very specific items that would go on sale at certain times. \n\nNear the end of the first year, I started reaching out to some US brands and looking to import products.  I would just check out other big Ebay sellers and reverse the math.  I found a small brand here in the US and and bought 10 units of a product from him.  After those sold I then tried buying 100 units of his product.  He seemed confused that I wanted that many units and refused to sell to me.  His product was unique but not patented (think of a project like wooden sunglasses - niche product).  This is when I decided to go to China to find this product.\n\nBy this point I still had just 1 other employee who pretty much just packed items for me all day.  I tried teaching him other tasks but when I set an email up for him and saw him type it as jaredatourbusiness.com I thought it would be best to keep him working in the warehouse.  We were doing anywhere from 50-100 orders a day at this point just selling closeouts and goods from retail stores.  We were decently profitable as expenses were low (under 250 per day to run the business including what I was taking out).\n\nI found a supplier in China who manufactured the niche product I had sold before.  My product needed to be a special color and the MOQ was 1,000 units.  This means I would need to drop over 20k on this product.  I had no data or forecasting, I just went for it.  I found out that 1,000 units of this item would take up about half of a 20ft container from China.  By this point I had been bringing some small items in from China by air (memory cards, aluminum wallets, some small fashion accessories) and I thought I would just fill the rest of the container with random items.  I was not sure how all the logistics in China worked so I asked the factory making my niche product if they would source other items for me.  They said Yes.  To fill the first container, I just found random items on Ebay that I thought would work.  It took me about 2 months to go this because I had no idea what the hell I was doing.  I paid for all of the products and 35 days later a container showed up at our warehouse.  Me and my 1 other employee unloaded the container - we didn't even have a dock so it was a real pain in the ass.\n\nI started selling stuff in this container on Ebay and Amazon and it was selling good.  My container had about 10 different products in totally different niches.  At this point in time, I would carry about 100-150K in inventory at any given time and we would have about 150-200 SKUs at any time.  I was still buying some cheap items in the US, still going to big box stores, and at the same time importing from China.  That niche product I brought up earlier?  Cost me about 21.00 and sold for 55-65.  I made about 10-20 on each unit I sold and we were moving about 5-10 units total each day.  I liked the idea of having a sustainable product of my own brand where others were not controlling my price or telling me where I could or could not sell it.\n\nEven with this single product that was somewhat a success, I was still focused on keeping the day to day going.  To do this, I was spending my time on things that were making money right away but not creating any long term value for my business.  I was so caught up in the day to day that this product I have that could be a gold mine had the shittiest packaging and QC possible.  I did get around to trademarking the brand and purchasing a URL for the product.  At the end of our 1st year we did 1.5M in sales with right around 70K in net profit.  This was after I paid myself (2,500 a month).\n\nI could have mentioned this at the beginning but I was running this business out in a very rural area (Closest Best Buy was 45 minutes away.  Think about the movie Sweet Home Alabama).  I decided my distant family member employee had hit his peak and I fired him and came up with a plan to move the business 80 miles away to a city with a bigger population.  My thought was that I would have a much better employee pool to scale the business.  My old warehouse was 1,500 sq ft, no dock, and only 900 a month.  The new warehouse I found was 6000 sq ft, with 2 docks and cost 2,700 a month.  I interviewed a couple people and had 2 new employees lined up for my move.  In one weekend I rented a couple semi trailers and moved all of our inventory to our new warehouse.  I did not even have pallet racking - just a ton of inventory sitting in the middle of a 6,000 sq ft warehouse.  We operated like this for 4-5 months until I bought 5-6K in racking for part of the warehouse.  We still didn't have a forklift so all the items went up by hand.  Shortly after I purchased a forklift for 4K.\n\nAt this point I am about 18 months into my business and we are on pace to do 2.5M in our second year.  I am still purchasing products from Big Box stores, still purchasing random items in the states, and also trying to step up my ordering from China.  We were also approved to be on Ebay's daily deals.  At the time, this was HUGE for us.  There were only 40-50 sellers on Ebay's deals and they only had about 100 total items a week.  Compare that to now where there are over 200 sellers on the deals and thousands of deals each week.\n\nI was bringing in a container every 3-4 months.  Each one with about 50-130K in inventory.  These prodcuts were random - Balloons, shoe racks, wallets, gloves, scarves, kitchen items, ect.  I was purposely bringing in items that would work on Ebay's deals.  Msot of our sales on Amazon came from the big box items and other US items with low margins.  With the way Ebay's deals were setup, we could move 2-3K units of an item in a week.  Business was good - we didn't even have a way to keep track of inventory but it didn't seem to matter at the time.  We would print out an excel sheet each day and put tally marks next to the name of the item and then reconcile inventory at the end of the day.  This was not very productive but it did not matter because we were selling so much stuff we could not stay caught up.  With me and just 2 other people we would do 1,000+ items some days.  \n\nAs the close of our 2nd year of business approached I had 4 other employees working for me and planned to bring in a manager.  I found one from corporate and offered her 50K salary plus incentives.  She must have thought salary means she can come in whenever since she should up at noon on a Monday after only 1 week.  She was fired and over the next couple weeks, another employee had a breakdown, and another one went to jail.  I was now down to me and 2 other employees.  We were so busy though so I did't care.  I flew a friend in town for a couple weeks to help me out while I hired in new employees.  We finished the year with 2.5M in sales and about 160K in profit.  I had a made a mistake earlier in the year that resulted in a 50K loss so I knew we should have had over 200K in profit.  This is still a low Net but I was happy it had improved over the previous year.\n\nGoing in to year 3 (beginning of 2014), everything looked good.  I had 6 employees (1 in the office and the rest in the warehouse).  By this point we are doing 100K+ a month on Ebay, 100K+ a month on Amazon, and another 100K+ on Nomorerack and other small daily deal sites.  I kept adding deal sites - Groupon, Livingsocial, Tanga, Daily Steals, 1sale, Mobstub, ect.  2014 is were I made some decisions that cost us money.  I researched popular US brands in Australia and realized there was a market for me to move products there.  I put a plan in place to open an AU business.  I was also doing 100% of the sales, listings, and buying for my company at this time.  It took me about 6 months to get all the paperwork in order in AU and to open a bank account and get a registered agent.  It also cost me over 4K.  As of today, we have not done a single sale in AU because I have not found the time to tackle the project.  I also decided to launch a channel management software in 2014.  I signed into a 6 month contract at 2,700 a month and I never got it off the ground so I cancelled it after the initial 6 months.  Throughout 2014, our sales are still good and increasing (ended the year with 4.5M in revenue and over 300K in profit).  The issue is the business is not becoming sustainable.  A couple of the US brands I have sold, started to block unauthorized distributors on Amazon (not for any violations - just because).  There were SKUs on Amazon that accounted for 50K+ per month in revenue just for a single SKU and we could no longer sell them.  Our deal sites like Nomorerack and Ebay became much more competitive and our accepted deals began to shrink.  So even though our business is growing via profit and revenue, it is also losing parts.\n\nOther ventures I tried in 2014 include building a website for a single product supplement - It cost about 2K for the project but it flopped - mostly because I could not put the time and resources into it as I was stuck in the day to day.  I have been on the phone with affiliate marketers lately about launching a single product supplement site based on a rebill model.  I have talked to marketers about remarketing campaigns, and I have talked to affiliates about giving our branded products away on Amazon to increase rank.\n\nI felt like I needed to explain most of the story above so I could put the following into context correctly:\n\nI feel like we do a lot of things but we do not do 1 thing the best.  Even though I have a decent size company that is profitable, it does not feel sustainable and I find myself wondering which project I should focus on.  I have expenses and fell like I find myself working on keeping us busy week to week instead of building something for the long term.  Since we have so many products in so many categories I find us half assing some things like product photography.  Smaller guys come in and can beat us at our own game - For example, we sold some navigation units pretty good for about a year but some smaller guys came in and sold them way better than we were.  The reason being, they were just 1 tiny part of our business.  The same thing has happened with other categories we sell in.\n\nI am basically wondering, how do I focus on a smaller niche that we could kill it in when I have all these other components that take a lot of time?  Everything we have done for the last 3 years, has been pretty behind pace.  For example, we just launched a website 2 weeks ago.  We were a 4.5M a year ecommerce company WITHOUT a website.  We have ran some ads on the site and done about 60 sales over 2 weeks but we are at break even and the site just has a bunch of random crap on it.  I realized that any customer that comes to our site will most likely never come back and that is disappointing.  \n\nSometimes I wish my business was in a hyper focused niche that I could give me full attention to.  I have multiple brands that we own and they all do good in different ways but none of them have a website or top notch packaging or marketing because the time never seems to be there and I feel like I cannot slow down other parts of my business to create that time.  Every new idea I get seems like the best idea at the time but they end up unfinished or not reaching maximum potential because another idea comes a long or day to day work piles up.  The reason I gave the background of my business is so you guys can see how it has grown and how it is profitable but also understand that it is not very sustainable because we are not the best at anything.  \n\nEvery day I get some sort of new pitch on a way to make profit.  We literally got on so many deal sites, I had to stop submitting to some because we do not have enough processes in place to run items on 15-20 deal sites.  I now have 8 employees and hired in a manager a couple months ago with the goal being, she can run all of my day to day and all I will do is source products from China and work on side projects that I can hyper focus on like getting 1 of our brands into retail or marketing the import application I had created.  Even with a manager taking over a lot of my daily duties, I still find myself buried with all kinds of other shit so now the plan is to bring in 2 more employees to take over some more of my duties.  My point is, I would like to work on something in my business that I can build on and I don't think adding a million deal sites to our portfolio is something to build on.  The main reason being those sites are not going to be around forever.  The money is good now, but I want to think about the future.  I am tired of only having time to put half the work into a project.  When I see you guys on here with a hyper focused niche like Sunglasses, or speakers, or a single product, or subscription box, I wish that I had my business at a point where we could do something similar.\n\n","289":"I will also accept Amazon GC, if you have rep here I will send first no problem.\n\nThis is my first trade.\n\n[My GCX Rep](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2z02gt\/uroomgnome_gcx_rep_profile\/)","290":"[H] $5 Amazon [W] $4 PayPal","291":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/30ax3a\/uromm22_gcx_rep_profile\/\n\nSteam keys and\/or 15$ Xbox GC for any amount of Amazon, very negotiable.

Let me first start off by describing my situation.\n29 year old, network administrator. Only make about $42k\/year before taxes, deductions, etc.\nFortunately, I do generally get a good chunk of overtime here and there, but it isn't always guaranteed or available.  In my little free time, I will also do computer repairs on the side, which only nets me $100 every few months at best. I really should push this harder.\n\nNow, about 3 weeks ago, a guy hit me in my car, which is not paid off.... But has been in the shop for the past three weeks. They estimated damages in at $9500, where the value of the car (if it was perfect condition) is about $13.5k, and they still told me I won't have the car back for another three weeks.\n\nMy issue being, is my bills are about as minimal as I can possibly get them, I keep my credit cards paid off every month, and have my reoccurring debits come out of my credit card and reap the rewards.\n\nMy monthly bills look similar to this:  \nStudent Loan 01 - 3.25% int - about 63,000$ due - $165 mo minimum ( paying interest only )  \nStudent Loan 02 - 4.00% int - about 3200$ due - $26 mo minimum  \nStudent Loan 03 - 6.50% int - about 11,000$ due - $88 mo minimum  \nCar Loan - 1.9% int - about 10,200$ due - 218 mo   \nInsurance is billed every 6 months which includes auto, motorcycle, and renter's insurance and is about $800 (or $133 mo)  \n\nOther bills that do not have interest are:  \nTime Warner Cable $65 (need to drop this down and get into a slower speed as I dont do any online gaming anymore)  \nGym $30  \nNetflix $8  \nAmazon Prime $8  \nElectric\/Gas\/Utilities $90 (I don't pay water, rent, or trash)  \nPay off the credit card, which usually is about $200 give or take, from the months gas, groceries, supplements (as I am also currently trying to train to do a Men's Novice Physique Competition at the end of August)  \n  \nSo typically, my monthly minimums put me around 1,031$.  \nHowever, from a previous marriage I do have about 7 different collections on my credit report, which are about $9100 in total. I have already settled and paid off a few other ones.  \n  \nMy question for pf is, what is the best decision to make investment-wise with my money?  \nI should also mention I have about 10,000 in the bank, and its through a local credit union that yields 3.04% interest, as well as have around $1400 in an online stock-trading account that is tied up in mutual funds. I already am in a matching 5% for 5%.  \n  \nWith the amount of damage done to my car, I am honestly not comfortable keeping it, as I am quite concerned I am going to run into a lot more problems with it down the road.  \nI guess my questions are:  \nShould I consider getting another new car? I do travel about 30% for work.  \nIs it worth my time to pay off the collection debts? Most of them will fall off between 2017-2018, (from being reported on the credit report) Or would I be better off investing this money into either paying down previous debts or going into new investments?  \nShould I also consider going back to school? I have somewhere around 170-180 credit hours between two different Associate's degree programs. (Yes, I have two Associate's degrees, and I now realize the mistakes from that decision) I am not sure if going back for a Bachelor's will really make a big enough impact on my career to make it worthwhile. I have been with this company for 2.5 years now, and this is my first Network Admin position.  \nI have also been kicking around the idea of purchasing a house, or maybe even a duplex, living in half and renting out the other half. Not sure if that is a great fit, but I would entertain the idea of maybe managing some properties down the road.  \n  \nI have seen other people around the interwebs asking for handouts, help, and gofundme accounts, but I have never been a beggar, and I have always earned what I own, and kept good care of it. (Coming from growing up in a poor situation and parents on welfare and disability) The cards have really been stacked against me but I don't let that stop me from going where I want, I just wish I wasn't rapidly approaching 30 and feeling like people at the age of 20 are in a better financial situation than myself.   \n  \nThanks for reading, and thank you for any advice or guidance you may be able to provide me.

I know nothing about this is ideal but I need help.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; I'm 24 years old! I don't have a high school diploma or GED, I'm having a child in less than a week, and I currently live with my girlfriend and her family. I have two jobs and I roughly pull in 1300$ a month, and I have 500$ saved currently but will be going to my car payment. My monthly fees excluding car payment which I'll discuss below are:  \n&gt;   \n&gt; 30$ Phone bill\n\n&gt; 20$ Credit Card Bill(only 100$ left)\n\n&gt; 80$ Gas\n\n&gt; 90$ Cigarettes(I'm not even going to pretend like I'm quitting given my stressful situation.)\n\n&gt; 200$ Rent for my current situation.\n&gt;   \n&gt; Mom covers my car insurance, and my car payment is normally 200$ a month that I pay.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; I'm about 1,200$ behind on my car payment but I do have payment plan with them to pay it back. 400$ March 24th, 400$ April 7th, Skip a pay for another 400$, and 200$(other 200 from my mother) on the 15th of April. Here's what it comes to and there's just no way around it. Living here isn't working out, it isn't good for our relationship and it isn't good for my self-esteem. I'm leaving, a buddy of mine couple hours away has offered me a room for 400$ a month flat including utilities in Asheville, NC, 0$ to move in just 1st month rent, unfurnished. I have no potential jobs lined up.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Basically I'm trying to come up with a budget that will allow me to move by May. I understand I'll be leaving my child and I've processed that a million times. My girlfriend and I have talked about it multiple times and agree it's what's best because, the ice is getting thin for me in this house due to my relationship with her family. So, I've got no where else to go. I have to eat out constantly because, well we've just run into too many bad situations with dishes etc.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; I'm in the process of trying to get my GED, I've been out of school since the 8th grade that's 12 years. I've got a Kaplan study book, and I've been working on it and it's definitely apart of my plan. My father offered to pay for the test on the condition that I finish the book which I'm almost done with so I was hoping to take an attempt mid April.  \n&gt; I was looking into the local community college in Asheville but, obviously my GED is my 1st step.    \n&gt;   \n&gt; Moving wise, I'm looking at around:  \n&gt;   \n&gt; 30$ in gas for the 1st trip of my stuff.\n\n&gt; 90$ for round a trip bus ticket for the rest of my clothes and to avoid an extra 800 miles on my car.\n\n&gt; 200$ish? For a bed. I've seen 75$ Twin and one of those frame\/box springs for 66$ on Amazon.\n\n&gt; 400$ for 1st months rent.\n\n&gt; 200-300$ish until to live until I get a job?\n&gt;   \n&gt; Roughly looks like I need 1000$. Anything I'm missing? Any tips or tricks to avoid any of this? Like maybe holding off on the bed for awhile?

If you let it exercise and then sell the stock you are paying $22.00 in fees.\n\nIf you sell the option you also just realize the profit.  If you go through purchasing the stock you have to have enough capital on hand to actually buy the stock.

If I'm eating a restaurant I use the restaurant card and if I'm buying groceries I use the grocery card, otherwise I use my uncategorized spend card. Every quarter, I make sure to update my cards to factor in quarterly bonuses, so this coming quarter, I'll add my Sallie Mae card back into my wallet (used Chase Freedom for 5x UR points this past quarter) and remove my Huntington Voice Card (3% restaurants -&gt; Chase Freedom 5x UR points).

Make your meals in bulk (you'll want to have at least 2 different kinds of meals available for variety; you don't want to fall off the wagon because you were constantly eating the same thing everyday, cut back on froo-froo coffee, eat out less.

I pay $21\/month for car insurance and $37\/month for homeowners. Also, if you own your property, check what value your county has it assessed at and challenge it if it's higher than market.

I have a few questions... Some of them are probably a bit more straightforward than others. Ok, let's start!\n\nI see everyone talking about scanning things while they're shopping. What apps are you using for this? Is it quicker and easier than a google search or an Ebay search (of sold listings, of course, asking prices are worthless, selling prices are not.)\n\nAlso, spring cleaning is about to start up and consequently, garage sales as well. How important are garage sales in flipping? Is it literally the type of thing flippers go crazy for, or is the general public getting more savvy with their prices and pricing more accordingly making great buys more and more scarce?\n\nLet's say I have $100 to start out, would you recommend buying small things and opening up a lot of ebay or Amazon listings or buying something larger that I may sit on for a little while? I know this one is going to receive many responses, some generic telling me only I can decide that, just looking to pick the brains of those more experienced in flipping than myself.\n\nMostly what I've flipped is random stuff. I've bought one year subscriptions to antivirus from Newegg while on sale for $5 and sold them to friends and relatives for $20 installed and I've bought a turntable for $80 when I recognized it and knew the value and sold it for $200 and many other things like that, but they are all spur of the moment things that I knew were a sure way to make a bit of money. I want to get into it now as a way to supplement me while I'm at school. I currently am a programming student and work at my college repairing PCs and resetting passwords basically. I've also thought of refurbing PCs but the thrift stores and Goodwill's in my area don't accept them so there is no steady source of cheap laptops, even broken ones. When people do want to sell their laptops they often want to ask so much that I can find them online for somewhere cheaper.\n\nSorry... at this point I'm rambling :\/ Stopping now.","385":"Then just do as another commentor suggested. Find something cheap to sell, sell a lot of them, and let the feedback come in. It's not sneaky at all, gets you genuine feedback, and if you're lucky maybe you can make a buck or two while doing it.\n\nIt should be noted I'm not an Amazon Seller, just looking to get into flipping myself. But I have been a salesman for quite a while (Cell phones and cars for a while) and I was never dishonest about any products I sold. I may not have sold as many phones or cars as the other sales people, but when my customers came back in they asked for me, and they rarely came back in pissed off about anything. Just try to do things right, asking for advice on how to purposely mislead people and putting \"Yes, I'm a terrible person\" in the body of your post isn't exactly the right way to start out.

Prop shops and hedge funds like Jane Street and Two Sigma hire many CS guys from Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  They can absolutely be paid high sums.  $400k+ is a bit tougher for pure, non-quant developers though.  $150-300k isn't too hard if you're hard working and in the field for a couple years.  If you're looking pure development, it's not unusual for prop shops to pay $130kish base with equal or more bonus equaling out to around the $200-300k range after bonus with just two year's experience.\n\nGenerally, the closer you work to the money, the more you get.  If you're really looking for the money, some pure HFT prop shops can definitely bring developers into the $400k range.  I'm going to have to say though, that HFT has become insanely competitive, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to make serious money without being extra creative and expanding though.  To make it even more difficult, these same shops generally look for \"hybrids\" that know development down the the bare core (kernel tuning, zero-copy networking, market micro-structure\/regulations, basic math\/data manipulation, expert-level C\/C++\/Java).  Getting by without advanced knowledge of that stuff can still probably net you a good 150-200k though.

I got one response with good info so I figured I'd try earlier today to get some more responses! I have a few other questions but I will wait on them so as not to clutter the thread anymore...\nI'm looking to get into flipping but am having a bit of trouble figuring out where to start I suppose. I have a few questions... Some of them are probably a bit more straightforward than others. Ok, let's start!\nI see everyone talking about scanning things while they're shopping. What apps are you using for this? Is it quicker and easier than a google search or an Ebay search (of sold listings, of course, asking prices are worthless, selling prices are not.)\nAlso, spring cleaning is about to start up and consequently, garage sales as well. How important are garage sales in flipping? Is it literally the type of thing flippers go crazy for, or is the general public getting more savvy with their prices and pricing more accordingly making great buys more and more scarce?\nLet's say I have $100 to start out, would you recommend buying small things and opening up a lot of ebay or Amazon listings or buying something larger that I may sit on for a little while? I know this one is going to receive many responses, some generic telling me only I can decide that, just looking to pick the brains of those more experienced in flipping than myself.\nMostly what I've flipped is random stuff. I've bought one year subscriptions to antivirus from Newegg while on sale for $5 and sold them to friends and relatives for $20 installed and I've bought a turntable for $80 when I recognized it and knew the value and sold it for $200 and many other things like that, but they are all spur of the moment things that I knew were a sure way to make a bit of money. I want to get into it now as a way to supplement me while I'm at school. I currently am a programming student and work at my college repairing PCs and resetting passwords basically. I've also thought of refurbing PCs but the thrift stores and Goodwill's in my area don't accept them so there is no steady source of cheap laptops, even broken ones. When people do want to sell their laptops they often want to ask so much that I can find them online for somewhere cheaper.\nSorry... at this point I'm rambling :\/ Stopping now.","417":"Not that I'd do it, but in the hypothetical situation of a 200% interest rate and amazingly high rewards on the credit card, I'd do a balance transfer to offset the interest if I got in trouble.

I made my first Amazon listing last night and will be listing a couple of things on eBay tonight, so hopefully I will have a first sale to share sometime soon!","479":"Can you clarify the circumstances around reaching no. 4 in the store: when that occurred, what was the period, what was the pricing at the time? I ask because I also publish via Amazon and have for several years, and know the sheer amount of sales required to break into even the top 100 of a country's storefront, let alone top 5, is massive. It strikes me that, even with a 35c royalty on a 99c ebook, you'd have done financially quite well off the back of that, at least for a short time, which although not enough to sustain you for an extended length of time if you dropped out of the charts quite quickly, I would have thought you'd mention given the nature of this thread. \n\nYou also mention making the book free for some time. I also have experience with this, and know that before Kindle Unlimited was introduced, along with some algorithm changes made on Amazon, free books got *huge* amounts of downloads. How many of the 30k downloads in the title were unpaid?\n\nEDIT: Further question, linked to the last. Going by Goodreads, the book was originally released as a serial of 5 parts. Do those books' downloads factor into the &gt;30,000, and if so, by how much?\n\nEDIT AGAIN: [NovelRank tracking](http:\/\/www.novelrank.com\/asin\/B00G12TLRY) indicates since July 2014, the book hasn't ranked above several thousand in any of the Amazon storefronts listed, except .de, which even then peaked at position 732. The start of this tracking seems to coincide with the second half\/end of an extended free promotion, as seen in the 1y price history on [eReaderIQ](http:\/\/www.ereaderiq.com\/dp\/B00G12TLRY\/black-book\/), which you indicate elsewhere is when sales began to then pick up. I suppose my question is therefore, was the no. 4 chart position at some point outside of NovelRank's tracking period (which is possible, given it says the tracking is now inactive)? Or was the no. 4 chart position actually in a subcategory rather than overall, or at the time when the book was free (making the thread title's implication just a little misleading)?\n\n**FINAL EDIT**: Sleuthed into OP's post history, which is currently a tonne of promotion for this book. Another user noted [the book had also been posted numerous times in the past by other users](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AMA\/comments\/300p6z\/i_wrote_a_scifi_horror_book_in_my_spare_time_that\/cpo9ajy), which OP confessed were his own accounts. One of those threads is [this one](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IAmA\/comments\/29whg5\/when_amazon_priced_my_scifi_novel_as_free_reddit\/), which shows the book hit no. 4 overall in the **free** charts. It's still an impressive achievement, but the title implies something very different to the reality, and that's important to be aware of. ","480":"&gt;Can you offer a source for the third party bill service? \n\nQuite a while ago I was told (on flyertalk) that billpay for many prepaid cards including bluebird\/redbird\/serve was done by a service from a company call mycheckfree. I don't have a link to where I was told that nor do I consider some random person from flyertalk a good source. \n\nThat being said the best evidence I have of the amex prepaid cards using a 3rd party bill pay service is from my own discover card account. Unlike other card issuers discover lists more information about the source of bill payments. This is a screen shot from my discover account with a lot of identifying information cut out. \n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/E0LIcCm \n\nThe most interesting thing is that payments from redbird and serve appear to be becoming from wells fargo. (I don't have a wells fargo account.) Payments from my credit union don't seem to have an institution listed when they are pushed. \n\nI billpayed $1500 a month for 9 months from my soft-serve without any issues. I got my redbird in October and so far I have push $30K though the account with only a small amount used for target purchases. Upwards of 85% of the money moving though my redbird account is going back to the card it was loaded on. \n\nI'm my opinion many people were so well trained to avoid the \"closed loop\" transactions from Amazon Payments that they feel this is necessary with other MS avenues.  In the worse cases this causes people to do things (like deposit crazy amounts of cash) that actually cause them problems. \n\nThat being said I feel people should do what they are comfortable with and I'm prepared to eat my words when my redbird get shutdown.

As I said, I have experience with free promotions via Amazon, both before and after Kindle Unlimited and the earlier KDP Select program. Reaching the top 5 of the free chart is definitely an achievement, so well done. My issue came from the omission in this thread's title, which implies something I think you'd agree is quite different to the reality.

As it stands, my mint budget has me with around a $1,300 or so surplus each month.\n\nETA:  I disagree with the poster below me regarding Amazon Prime.  That's a nominal expense and gets you a lot of services\/perks.  Also, the cell bill seems reasonable if it's for two phones.

Everything is pretty much industry standard. For example hypothetically at Microsoft a college hire typically starts at 90-100. A SDE2 makes around 110 to 150. A Sr SDE makes 130-175. A Principal Developer makes 160-200+. You usually ask for the next level when you interview. So by moving say from Microsoft as a Senior SDE to Google, you'll be asking around the range of a Principal or usually around 200 as a Staff Engineer. If you are a Principal moving from Microsoft to Amazon you'll be looking for a Director level position where they won't even match your base but will give you tons of Amazon stocks.\n","489":"I have a semi-decent computer that I upgraded with a solid state hard drive ($95.00) and a extra 19\" LCD monitor ($28.00 Ebay, delivered).

","491":"How'd you get the Amazon cards?","492":"On and off since about 1999 or 2000. I started off selling my own textbooks during College on Ebay and Half.com. I was amazed at the cash that I could make sellling them there vs at the school bookstore. \n\nSo I started buying other people's textbooks at school for slightly more than the bookstore wanted and flipping those. From there, I bought other local college kids textbooks (there are a bunch of colleges in the metro area) off of Craigslist and flipped those. Then I incorporated a business, contacted booksellers, sold that way too. It was a nice little side business while I worked a commission sales job where the paychecks were good but unreliable.\n\nAt some point, I got a new corp cube job (instead of an unstructured sales job) and my free time went down, so I canned the textbooks. A couple years later, that corporation I was working for imploded during the recession, leaving me unemployed along with 2000 of my former coworkers all trying to get the same 15 jobs, so I sold all of the extra stuff in my house to keep cash coming in. 9 months later, I got a new job and stopped again.\n\nA little over a year ago, my wife's maternity leave for our second child was almost over and she was miserable with the thought of going back to her job that she disliked, so I started looking for a way to make some cash in case she decided to jump ship. I stumbled into FBA and did pretty well last year on a part time basis. \n\nIve got a very good corporate cube monkey job, so flipping for me is only part time at the moment, but Im really ramping it up right now. Thankfully my wife got a new job and is happier, so her quitting isnt on the table anymore. Really, this just ends up being a nice side business and a means towards financial independence, saving for my kids college, paying off my house, vacations, etc.\n\nI'm in Richmond, Va and I flip pretty much anything I can make a profit with on Amazon. Mostly its been toys, grocery, electronics, and health\/beauty products. ","493":"I don't know if this counts but I recently joined both Bing Rewards and Swagbucks. Since we cut the cord to save money and went to streaming,  I can use Bing to pay for my Hulu each month and if a put a few hours a week into Swagbucks I should be able to earn enough to pay for my Amazon Prime each year, Netflix or maybe both. \n\nThat would save me nearly $300 on top of what I'm already saving by cutting the cord.","494":"Amazon now has the product in stock.  So far, I've made about 3k off their stock, and I'm sticking with them for a while. ","495":"Delivery drones are an incredibility bad idea.

Amazon doesnt play directly with it, but I list through inventory lab, so all of my labels print on the Dymo when I list there.\n\nI think that you have to use a work around for any label printer (Dymo, Zebra, etc) on Amazon (hopefully someone will correct me if Im wrong). There are a couple of software packages that do it. Inventory lab definitely does and I think that ListLabelShip does as well, but Ive never used it.\n\nAs far as the mac and Ebay pieces, hopefully someone else can help you there. I dont have a mac and Im not currently selling on Ebay, so Im not able to help there.\n\nLong story short, listing using my Dymo and IL has drastically sped up my process when listing and brought the cost down (no more ink cartridges, not wasting spots on 30 up sheets anymore), so I would definitely recommend getting one if you are listing a lot of stuff for FBA. ","497":"What does \"Ono\" mean? And beyond that, you're not likely to get $10 for a $10 voucher. If someone has $10 they could just spend it without ever trading with you. The incentive to trade is usually a discount, it's up to you to decide what that should be. I'm not trying to tell you how to make your trade, just letting you know why you probably won't get many bites. \n\nFor example Amazon giftcards sell for 90% of their value on here regularly.

Use it to pay for things you need anyway.\n\nOnce you have one for a few months to a year, and used it regularly and responsibly, low-limit Discover and Visa cards should be easy to get. $1000-$2,500 limits. Once a solid payment pattern is established, they'll start offering to raise your limit. \n\nIt'll take a year or so to get to that point, but theoretically won't cost anything and will certainly improve your score more than a single $300 short term loan that's taken and paid off in a matter of days to avoid fees.","516":"Well, Chase has no reason to cut off MS'ers.

I don't actually work *for* the FAA, but my company receives delegation to approve changes to aircraft, and we have a profit motive to get these changes done in a timely manner. And sometimes, we get the ass-end of the stick like Amazon.\n\nThe problem with Amazon's UAS platforms is a) concrete rules don't exist for UAS's yet, so the FAA is using [provisional rules](https:\/\/www.faa.gov\/regulations_policies\/rulemaking\/media\/021515_sUAS_Summary.pdf) that are subject to change at their discretion, and b) the size and scale of package delivery UASs are such that they are considered hazardous not only to full-scale aircraft, but also to people on the ground. Having looked at the provisional rules, it looks like no airworthiness approval via the usual channels are required, but there are a couple of other reasons why approval took so long:\n\n1. If someone in the FAA gets scared by your proposal, their typical response is to circulate your technical data internally as much as possible. This causes more people in the organization to get scared. Eventually, upper-level FAA managers will think your data needs more scrutiny. Then the Directorate(s) catch wind of your project, and your project quickly moves up the 'spook ladder'. Suddenly a project that you thought was simple and straightforward has turned into a protracted nightmare and bleeding money out of you every week because the FAA either doesn't respond, or sends you 30-page Issue Papers, or something equally ridiculous. In Amazon's case, UAS platforms are already a hot item and probably hit the Directorates' desks immediately.\n\n2. A major step in certification is called Type Inspection Authorization (TIA). For airplanes, this means an FAA Flight Test Pilot will fly your airplane and test things like controllability, performance, takeoff\/landing behavior, etc. The problem is **no one in the FAA knows how to fly UASs**, so a TIA would be impossible. This is why the provisional rules are so restrictive and requires VLOS.\n\n3. The FAA is simultaneously allowing some self-regulation (like they do with the [hobbyist RC community](http:\/\/rgl.faa.gov\/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library\/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf\/0\/1ACFC3F689769A56862569E70077C9CC?OpenDocument) and [Light-Sport Aircraft](https:\/\/www.faa.gov\/aircraft\/gen_av\/light_sport\/media\/LSA_Cert_8July2013.pdf)), while being completely incompetent about the capabilities of the technology, which is the second reason why the provisional rules are so restrictive. They have no interest in hiring experts that understand the auto-pilot software, or to assess the risks involved in a hypothetical UAS accident.","526":"Ppl pay that premium for FBA because they know Amazon handles the customer service.

I max them every day. Then, in my VM, I do the other daily tasks and whatever other small tasks to reach my 2nd level bonus for the day. That's at least $1.\n\nI also use Bing Rewards and bookmark my other sites with the Bing Search results. But that's only like $5 a month.\n\nIn my VM I use MXWRK and TrafficMicro in Firefox. That's $1-2 a day.\n\nSo right now, my minimum for the day is $2. That's $60 each month. Realistically, my daily goals for Swagbucks are slightly more than $1, and I make slightly more than $1 for MXWRK and TrafficMicro. With a little extra on Swagbucks my daily minimum from 3 services is $3. Now, you need to be working in front of your VM, or else you'll miss the MXWRK and TrafficMicro taks, but many people can handle that. Plus, they pay to PayPal every day.  I sell the Amazon codes I get from Swagbucks on \/giftcardexchange, so I lose 10%, but that's still around $85 each month just from these 3 services, and if you don't want to lose that $10 you can get a PayPal payment for larger amounts.\n\nThen I use InstaGC because you can cash out at low amounts to Amazon codes, but also you can use direct deposit to cash out any amount greater than $5. I just do low-reward clicks for this one. Every little bit helps and it really takes no attention.\n\nI use Tellwut for my main poll site. The points come easily as there are many user-submitted and advertiser-promoted questions. I can easily get 2 $10 Amazon codes each month without trying, just taking a break.\n\nThen I use InstantCashSweepstakes as well. It has a low cash-out, but payments are also low. However, if you stick with it it does pay better, and you can get paid directly to PayPal. So that's another few bucks a month.\n\nSo it's fairly easy to get $100-150 each month.

Since there are only two days left for your options to expire, your position is facing a high gamma risk. If you're still bullish on AAPL, you should immediately roll out your spread to May on a credit, which will give you some time. It is a bit hard to collect a credit when rolling spreads. It's a lot easier with single options. \n\nAlso, next time when you're short an option and you're not feeling comfortable about it within 7-10 days to expiration date, try to roll it to the next month or close it.\n\nAlso you should stop paying attention to what everyone says about the market.

Plus you can use them as your advertising platform, FB has the most well developed ad system, you can also try adwords but that is unlikely to produce positive results. Also a personal website would be helpful, you can just use it to showcase what you are selling.  I think amazon usually uses Iframes. Also sign up for their affiliate program so that if some goes to amazon though on of your links you'll get a commission on whatever they buy in that session. \n\nReviews are extremely important on Amazon, when you make a sale try hard to get the buyer to write a review as long as its 4 star+.

Other options are pricing I've seen people make a listing that said I think that category is quite large and it would take a lot to get a promote listing this way.  t is very overpriced just so that they turn up on the first page if someone sorts it by price from high to low.  They have no intention of actually selling said item but its used to pull the person in so that then they see the reasonably priced 'related items.'\n\nOther than that just basic SEO, is your item green say so, what material is it, what style is it etc, the more descriptive the better. \n\nAlso sell some items though fulfillment by amazon if you are not already these are prime eligible, and they will receive a better placement and again these can be used to show related items.","598":"I said it took 5 years to get to where I was.

Order a case of tp and when you are close to running out, check when you last ordered it and set your subscription frequency to that length of time, whether every 2 months or 6. The neat thing about subscribe and save is that they send you an email before your next shipment so you can review what you need or dont need and it lets you skip items. Really user friendly. \n\nAnother cool trick I have is I subscribe to motor oil for every 4 months. This reminds me it is time for an oil change. You just have to order a filter and you are ready for an oil change. Obviously you have to do it yourself, but I think most people in this sub already do that. I also get a fuel filter sent once per year as well as a cabin air filter for every oil change for my fiance's car since she has bad allergies. \n\nThe key is to do your research before a shipment happens. Amazon is *not* always the best price, even after the discounts. I always check the prices locally before a shipment is sent out as well as for coupons and rebates. If you use camelcamelcamel, you can see how quickly and often prices change on Amazon.\n\nAdvance Auto is is offering a $5.00 gift card right now on 5 qts. Mobil oil with a Mobil oil filter. Dig a little deeper, and find that Mobil themselves have a $15.00 rebate going on right now as well for the same package. A $50 oil change now costs $30.00 for the best syn-oil out there. So in this case, I skip the oil delivery from Amazon, but pick it up locally.\n\n","616":"I've been casually selling on Amazon (textbooks, toys, games) for years and never include a packing slip. \n\nWe both have order summaries and receipts on the website, why kill a tree?

Access to eBay and Amazon may take a day or two after you send your first click to their site (tracking IDs are limited). Aside from that, the 1% of merchants you don't have access to, are generally concentrated in the fashion vertical. Affiliate programs in fashion are pretty strict on who they let in, because of brand concerns. You can check to see which merchants you have access to by checking VigLink's merchant explorer.

I just use it when my purchase is of one of those categories. Chase cash back is 100 points per dollar, just like the Bankamericard(travel redeptio only). Now the Bankamericard doesn't \"discount\" the ticket, it applies a statement credit to offset the cost of the ticket. It sounds like it's the same thing but you still need to available credit to make the full ticket purchase. Anyway, chase let's you redeem points in the form of a check, direct deposit(chase account only), online purchase, or Amazon purchase. So you can still offset your net spend by any of these as well. So the 5% will generate more per dollar it may just be slower. Also when they have categories like Best Buy you can get 5% Cashback up to $5000 very quick.","631":"$10\/month was a typo, my bad, had my mind on other things. I'd say that average is $5\/month ended up making a little over $30 in 7 months. That was all on Amazon, 4% commission ($500+ worth of goods sold). \n\nTraffic spiked at the beginning because that is when I actually put time into it. I bought or created other websites and so stopped putting time into BackpackHammocks. That is why you see the drop in traffic. No paid advertising, just a lot of google traffic.

I can't sell a cashmere sweater right now to save my life, but I put up a pair of shorts that was coated in goo that I didn't even bother cleaning off and started a frenzied bidding war.\n* Just to learn Amazon's seller system, yesterday I posted about 20 old books and video games I had lying around the house for sale.

As opposed to having to split up your items into separate shipments and send them to the correct warehouse yourself. It's usually cheaper to send in one big box with their discounted shipping and pay the 30 cents an item then it is to send 3-4 smaller boxes to the correct locations.\n\n","646":"To give you another tip disregarding the tithing thing... (All I'll say is I disagree with the amount your paying).\n\nYou could lower your cell phone bill quite a bit by going with someone like Republic Wireless. We pay $60\/month for 2 people with unlimited data, texting, and talk. There are other carriers like this if you don't like their coverage.\n\n$50\/month on Personal Care seems a little high. Maybe go a little longer between haircuts.\n\nYou could drop Amazon Prime if you're only using it for entertainment.\n\nGroceries and Fuel could probably both be improved by driving less eating cheaper.\n\nObviously the biggest hit is the tithing. And I'm trying not to get into the whole church thing so you can just ignore this part if you want, but I think there are legitimate ways that you can decrease that. If you're Mormon, there is doctrine supporting doing either 10% on your net, or even 10% on anything left over after all of your debt obligations. You could also push paying tithing off. It's costing you more than 10% due to the savings on interest you could get by applying it to your student loans.","647":"I was really excited about the \"Used Book Superstore\" that opened near me.  After I bought a fairly new used book there, I was disgusted after checking Amazon and finding that they had it new paperback for cheaper than the used paperback I had just bought!\n\nIt is not as cheap as a library, but I am a big fan of Kindle.  Better prices than used books most of the time (unless you get bargain bin $1 books) and it is super convenient.  ","648":"I've sold almost 4500 games on Amazon.

We've sold 4500 and have 2000 more games\/systems in stock, so testing everything is not feasible. We power on systems and play them for 5 minutes.\n\nWe've only had ~5 returns for scratched discs, and those were ones we probably shouldn't have sent. The judgement call is usually on the price of the game... $5-10 maybe too-scratched game gets listed. $50-100 will probably get tested and maybe not listed.","649":"MTurk can be used in a variety of ways, including distributing surveys.  However, there's also HITs for things like: audio transcription, website testing, psychology games\/studies, image scanning, etc.\n\nI talked to an Amazon engineer when it was first getting off the ground and he mentioned one of the things it could be used for.  Computers aren't very good at recognizing objects in pictures.  Humans are very good at this.  So let's say a plane crashes in the desert and we're trying to locate the crash site.  We can take satellite images and have the computer scan them for things that look like airplane crashes, but the computer isn't very good at this.  So you take those same images and have turkers scan them, which they are able to more quickly and accurately than the computer.","650":"After 4 years of Amazon Student Prime discounts you have to supply them with your current class schedule \/ transcripts to prove that you're still a student. Sorry dude.","651":"Lots of scary stories because there is no need to vent about all the good buyers out there.  You will eventually run into a bad buyer if you sell long enough, but the good far outweighs the bad or eBay wouldn't even exist anymore.  Also, for many of the \"bad buyer\" stories out there, there is often something the seller could have done differently-maybe they didn't list measurements or maybe they didn't pack the item sufficiently, etc.  For me, it's a very small percentage of buyers who cause me any trouble at all.  \n\nAs far as ranking, that's going to depend on the item you are selling.  There is no one size fits all.  Furniture might to better on Craigslist unless it's a Danish mid century modern piece, for example, in which case it may be worth listing on Etsy, or even eBay as a local pick up.  However, a video game might do better on Amazon or eBay, though you may want to check both to see which place brings a higher price.  ","652":"Awesome stuff dude.

You can get most of those appliances on Amazon or Walmart for nothing. Asian Markets sell the best rice cookers for the lowest prices.\n\nIf you've got a slow cooker, you can make refried beans. JUst soak some pinto beans for a few hours in a large bowl, and transfer them to a crockpot. If you have an electric pressure cooker, it's even faster. Add an onion, some green chili, and salt and anything you think would be tasty. Soon, you'll have ten cans or more worth of beans for under three dollars. Not bad.\n\nIf you want pork, you can get a cheap cut of pork and throw it in a slow cooker with some broth, a can of root beer, some chili powder and some cayenne pepper, and a hint of cinnamon. Toss a chopped onion in there so you can a rich flavor, but don't be surprised in the onions dissolve. It's the work of the gods. Take it out when it's falling apart, and tear at it with a fork and stuff it in some tupperware. Bam. Tacos for a few days. Or burritos. OR sandwiches.\n\nA whole chicken was once a luxury, but not anymore. Head over to WalMart and grab the smallest chickens there. They usually run less then 8 bucks a piece. Freeze em. When you're ready, clean them out accordingly, and put it in a roasting pan in the oven at 350 for two hours (maybe more,  just check the meat occasionally). Be sure to baste the chicken with melted butter mixed with sage and thyme. If you want, you can make a crude breading by basting the chicken and putting a small amount of flour on the chicken after it's been cooking for about 30 mins. It's delicious.\n\nIf you want spices, don't waste your money at the grocery store. Local Co-OPs often sell bulk spices by weight. It's cheaper and sometimes of higher quality. Mexican Grocers and carnicerias usually have Mexican spices for cheap, same with any ethnic food store really. Be sure to check out every ethnic store in your area. Some people get put off going into those places, but don't worry, they're happy to have your business.\n\nMost importantly, be willing to experiment. Sticking to recipes won't get you anywhere.

But even then it is people that are not thinking about how to compete in the business world by offering value to customers, providing benefits to attract people, designing management systems that maximize the ability of employees to benefit customers etc. they seek to control things there is no sense trying to control by writing asinine legal documents.\n\nCertainly whatever business person allowed these lawyers to again paint Amazon in such a poor light made a bad business decision.

But my guess is the problem is they are not paying attention to how to do better, but instead thinking as lawyers do about how to seek control through documents.\n\nLegal documents are necessary.  Smart businesses have the function of preparing legal opinions and documents as directed by business people.  When the lawyers see a potential legal risk, they provide details on the risk and alternatives to allow the business to do what it wants but with options for how to adjust that in light of legal risks.  Many however, invert the process and have lawyers telling everyone else what should be done.\n\nThis type of decision seems to me to be exactly what you get when lawyers tell business what to do.\n\nI can't imagine sensible managers seeking to control the careers of temp workers in a warehouse.

This way you're building your credit AND staying stocked up on what you need without lifting a finger! \n\nMy other bit of advice is to not close your account and if you're able to get more than one go for it. The longer you have them the better your average age of accounts look. If you're able to get 3 now, and you buy a car later and you finance it, your average age of accounts will reflect 3 years of 3 cards and a car vs 3 years of 1 card and a car. \n\nI had to explain this to my fiance.

This happened within days of Periscope going live, as the NYC explosion was first reported by Periscope users, and would only become more commonplace if the fad caught on. Eventually the networks may end up paying for citizen reporters to get the best footage. \n\n*Auctions* Set up a site that mixes Craigslist, ebay and Periscope; users can auction off their belongings live to the highest bidders. \n\n*Internet TV* There are already a dozen MCNs dominating Youtube, and it wouldn't be much of a leap for something similar to happen with live streams.

I told them to shove it up their asses. Now it seems like it's getting worse.\"* I can promise you that this is simply confirmation bias. The person your father talked to is an entry-level salesperson at Yelp. If the company allowed the thousands of salespeople they have (some of which could have been working there for just days or weeks) that type of power over their site to manipulate a business's page in an effort to strong-arm a sale the company would be dealing with gross misconduct by their employees on a daily basis. Your father's business was just one of 150 different businesses that salesperson was going to call that day. They are not going to \"put you on their radar\" for calling them and telling them to shove it up their ass. And even if they took offense to it they simply have zero power to the content that's displayed on your fathers Yelp page. \n\nSource: I was a Yelp salesperson for a year as one of my first jobs after graduating college. The worst thing I ever witnessed a salesperson do was attempting to sell a plumber ads under the more broad keyword \"contractor\" but making the plumber believe they were going to get highly target ads for \"plumbing\". The deal was halted by the account manager and the salesperson was given a warning and told they would be fired if that was attempted again and the managers gave a speech to the entire office telling every salesperson they would be fired for attempting to do this. I can promise you salespeople have ZERO power over anything on the Yelp site. ","735":"I think your product looks great, and video marketing is clearly the way to go.

Some can be cashed out at only the $1 mark! e.g. Walmart, Amazon\n\n-- Direct deposit! This is relatively new. One thing I used to not like, is that there's no PayPal. But now you can link your bank account, and it only takes about 2 business days for your cash-out to get there. This is done in increments of $5, with $5 being the minimum to process.\n\n-- Live chat &amp; the \"what's crediting\" box. There's a small box where users are constantly chatting, so you can ask a quick question if you need to, or take a break and just say hello. If you ask a question that's too noobish though, they're just going to link you to the guides. The \"what's crediting\" box is right beneath the chat box, so you can see in real-time what offers are successfully being completed.\n\n**Cons:** \n\n-- There are some very uptight\/strict mods, so you have to be extremely careful what you put in chat. No swearing, not even in acronyms. No getting too involved in an OT discussion they don't like. No complaining about how an offer isn't very good (you can say if one isn't working though). No mentioning other paid-to sites. - You'll get the shit slapped out of you for that one. No trying to chat with others outside of the site. - That will get you chat-banned immediately. \n\n-- For trial (CC) offers, as well as offers worth more than a certain amount (somewhere around $2), the points will go into \"frozen,\" and you can't access them for 2 weeks. At least you get paid more for those than other sites, pretty consistently.\n\n-- You have to be very careful to not break any rules, as they are ban-happy.\n\n-- You don't have as many passive things to do, as you do in SB. The encrave videos are worth half here, so really aren't worth your time.\n\n--------\n\nMmm.

We are by no means trying to make more work for ourselves, and we put off implementing those two rules as long as possible, but they are both, unfortunately, very necessary, not useless.\n\nAmazon balance is often traded because the people who acquired it got it from a really sketchy source and were so uncomfortable with trading it to someone unredeemed and running the risk of it not being valid, that they wanted to redeem it to their account to make sure it works. Like goodtimeshaxor mentioned, flipping isn't the safest thing to do here either, since you don't know who you got it from and it just introduces a lot more variables into the situation. When things go wrong there, it gets very ugly.\n\nThe limit that requires approval to trade $100 and up at a time was implemented for two main reasons. People offering that much tend to be heavily targeted by scammers, or just fall victim to people who have built up a little bit of reputation and are willing to \"cash out\" (get banned for scamming) for a high value trade, so we like to start a conversation with them and make sure they know how to trade safely. Second, we want to make sure that the cards they are offering are not from a suspicious source, and that they can prove this, so that they are safe to trade on the subreddit.\n\nIt's great that you specifically know the risks, but there is a very high percentage of people who contact us and it's clear that they do not know the risks. The subreddit is growing at a fine rate, and if it happens to drive some people away, that's a fair tradeoff from our perspective to make it safer.\n\nIdeally, everyone would be on the same page, trading legitimately acquired gift cards that aren't going to cause problems after a trade is done. But we've seen too many situations where that was not the case, so we had to implement these rules.\n\nWe appreciate the honest feedback though.

It had good reviews so figured I would try it. If it doesn't work out I'll send it back.","829":"Or Amazon - Acceptable\/Good condition","830":"Amazon board games don't have a used option so collectible = used.","831":"Amazon told me I could not sell Vitamin D.  Perhaps it already happened.","832":"It really depends on the type of product(s) you're selling. Are your products a high-end, high-quality product, is it in a niche market, are you a competitive product that is affordable. Things like that will make a difference on where to sell.\n\nFor instance, if you're making an affordable product, you should be selling on eBay and Amazon, because your product will be competitive there and gain traction. You should be selling it to other businesses, because they'll be room for them to mark up your products, and make their own money.\n\nIf your product is more of a high-end product, eBay and Amazon are still options. You just have to market the quality nature of your product instead. You can still sell to other businesses, but you'll want to seek out businesses that are small\/independent, in big cities, usually. Depends on the product you're selling though. Etsy may be an option, as quality is a major selling point there.\n\nAny advertising path you take is going to have varying results, and there's no guaranteed \"right place\" to advertise. Some people have good results with google adwords, others with facebook, while some have no luck at all. It's really about knowing who will buy your product, and trying to target ads so they fall upon the right eyes.\n\nMake sure what you're selling is appealing to people. Because that alone makes so much of a difference in getting sales, and more importantly, getting return customers.","833":"I used to do the HuluPlus thing, but there's just wasn't enough on there for me to care about (I don't watch television shows, which is where Hulu shines, I guess) and I'd have to turn my VPN off every single time I wanted to watch something.\n\nNow I use my Bing Rewards for the Amazon giftcards and save them up to buy anime Blu-rays. I can't justify spending $40-60 on a Blu-ray, especially on something as devoid of special features as anime releases are, but I like that I can save up a few months of Rewards and support the shows I enjoy.","834":"Here's the one I'm using (I only use Amazon Affiliates and Adsense).
