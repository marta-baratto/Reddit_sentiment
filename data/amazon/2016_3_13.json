Our core business is to sell textiles to the companies that sell to the big box retailers. So our products are in pretty every single big retailers in the US you can think of. We have about 70 people in the US, 90 people in China, and about 6 people in India/Pakistan.\n\nAdvantages: Since we are supplying big volumes to the retailers, we have big advantages when it comes to the raw material. We can pool them together and do custom orders/packagings/labels etc to fit individual buyers. We are the one stop shop - product development, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, custom OEM, QC, and shipping the products either straight to Amazon warehouse, or customer's warehouse.\n\nWe are quite new at Amazon, and we don't want to sell directly on Amazon because A&gt; that competes with our existing customers and B&gt; it's not our core business and we are not good at Amazon rankings, key words, campaigns etc. Where would be a good start to look for the potential buyers?\n","name":"t3_4c881c","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-28 03:39:50","week":13}

Take it from someone who has regularly created content since 2014, attended travel conferences, and worked with travel brands. It’s a long journey, full of optimizing content for mobile, finding the right plugins, and explaining to your friends that this really is a job.\n\n**Wait, a job? I thought you said travel blogs don’t make money?**\n\nThey don’t. Not early on, anyway. Simply starting a travel blog and creating content will not put a dime in your pocket. In fact, it will almost certainly cost you money. Hosting your website, designing logos, fixing technical problems, advertising content – all of this adds up.\n\n**So millions of people start blogs… to lose money?**\n\nWelcome to the dark side, my friend. Muhahaha…. hahahaha ….HAHAHAHA!! Sorry. I get a bit excited when I burst people’s bubbles about blogging. Don’t be mistaken, if you want to make money from a travel blog, it’s going to be a lot harder than you think. We travel bloggers are to blame for this: we share pictures of the beach, and tag it: “#TodaysOffice #WishYouWereHere #DigitalNomad”. Then we act surprised when friends think our job is easy.\n\n\n**There’s that word again, “job”.**\n\nA successful travel blogger has a job, though definitely not in the traditional sense of a 9 – 5 job. As much as travel blogging is touted as an escape from the working grind, most business-minded bloggers work much more than 40 hours a week. Especially for the first couple of years.\n\n**Business-minded blogger, what’s that?**\n\nThat my friend, is the difference between a blog as a personal diary and a blog as a source of income. That’s not a rip on personal storytelling. Personal posts can be powerful narratives, and my own blog focuses on them heavily. It is rather an acknowledgement that sharing travel posts that are only about your trip and what you did can be overly self-indulgent and offer little value to the readers.\n\n**Those blogs are the worst.**\n\nThey’re like grandma bringing out a photo album and showing pictures of a bridge game with her friends. You don’t want to see grandma sitting across from chain-smoking Janice. You want to hear cool stories from the olden days. Everyone has interesting stories to tell, but sometimes we get confused about what your audience wants to hear.\n\n**That won’t happen to me. I’ll tell the best stories and lots of people will read them. But I’m still wondering, how will these stories make me money?**\n\nWell, they won’t. They might make you a few dollars from Google Adsense, if you want your site advertising cab rides in Baltimore. But payouts are minuscule, and with the rise of pop-up blockers, I do not recommended this way of monetizing a new travel blog.\n\n**But my last post was really good and it sort of went viral! Where’s my money?**\n\nRunning your own travel blog isn’t like writing for a travel website. You don’t pay yourself per article. What you do, over time, is create an established blog that can be used as a way to monetize through other means. For example, my travel blog uses affiliate advertising.\n\n**What’s that?**\n\nAffiliate advertising is when you link to another site that is selling something, and if a purchase is made you get a small % for sending the traffic. Amazon Affiliates is a popular option for beginners. Note that affiliate networks will require your travel blog to be an established site with thousands of views monthly before considering your application.\n\n**What sort of affiliate ads do you use?**\n\nI link to products that I recommend for travellers, such as recommended books or travel gifts. I also use affiliate ads to Hostelworld, the site where I book my hostels when I travel.\n\n**So I don’t need good content, I need affiliate ads?**\n\nNO! You should try to create a site with a foundation of good content that provides value to readers. Once that’s established, you can use affiliate links to send your readers to relevant products and services.\n\nMost of all, a blog should never hide the fact that is uses affiliate links, and you should never promote products that you don’t genuinely recommend. Don’t ever try to trick your readers – you should be grateful they’re on your site, not the other way around.\n\n**How else can I make money with a travel blog?**\n\nThe same way any business makes money: by offering useful products or services. This year I created an Ebook called The Truth About Travel. It’s my best advice for overcoming fears of solo travel, and it’s a product. I also offer services, by selling my written and video content to travel brands and other clients.\n\nJust remember, no one wants to buy a book or pay for a review or get a blog post from a travel blogger with nothing but a site full of affiliate ads. It all comes back to quality content.\n\n**This all sounds like a lot of work.**\n\nAlmost sounds like a job, doesn’t it?\n\n**Okay, okay, you got me. But at least you’re doing what you love, right? To write and to travel, it must be a dream!**\n\nThere are aspects of being a travel blogger that are very nice, and there’s an excellent community of travel bloggers out there supporting each other down this crazy path. Just don’t underestimate the work and the grit that will be needed.\n\nRunning a travel blog takes countless hours of work. It takes staring rejection in the face. It takes learning about a variety of skill sets that have nothing to do with travel or writing. That’s right Hemingway, you’re going to have to learn a thing or two about SEO and Google Analytics.\n\n**So is travel blogging worth it? You sound like you’re trying to talk me out of it.**\n\nIf you understand how competitive it will be, how much you will have to learn, and if you can stomach the fact that your travel blog could get negative comments (or worse – no comments!) then I say do it. But if you are coming into this with an idealized view, or if you don’t really, really, really like writing about travel, then you are only setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\n\n**But what about all the money travel bloggers make off product placement? I follow this one travel blogger on instagram…**\n\nDoes she have 800,000 followers? That’s not a travel blogger, that’s an instagram model who likes to use the #travel tag.\n\n**What’s wrong with that? If I build a big audience I want to make money however I can.**\n\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with advertising. I’d be a hypocrite if I said that there was. But the deeper you get into internet marketing, you start to see that it’s a dirty game. There are fake weight-loss pills out there just looking for people with big audiences and blogs to promote their products on. Would you stand in a picture holding their product if they named the right price? How about a banner ad on top of your blog? Do you want your audience to buy something that you know deep down they don’t need? These are the questions you need to be willing to ask yourself if you get big enough, with a travel blog, or anywhere on the internet.\n\n**Aww, man. I just want to write a travel blog, not sell out.**\n\nMe too, friend. Me too.","name":"t3_4caamq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-28 16:13:00","week":13}
{"id":"4caon4","author":"pf_lurker_","body":"About a year ago I was promoted from 90K to 140K annually with bonus potential from 5-20% annually.\n\nI never came from money so my focus was to pay off debts and build emergency savings. I have been able to pay off my student loan debt, my wifes student loan debt, and build emergency savings. We also had my first child about 18 months ago.\n\nWe are at a point where I feel like we are following the PF bible (pay off debts, emergency fund, max retirements) for the most part (I could put a little more towards ROTH) but wanted your input on what you would do. The variables are listed below.\n\nMy wife (teacher) and I net around $130,000 annually. This is after taxes, her pension contributions, my 401K contributions (10%/company max match of 5%). \n\nAdditional post tax investments:\n$200 a month to a 529 for my son\n$250 towards a back door Roth due to income limits (put as traditional, move to Roth through ED Jones)\n$150 Whole Life for my wife at Mass Mutual (was in place before we met)\n\nAdditional expenses:\nMortgage/Taxes/Insurance - roughly $1500 a month. Just refinanced to a 15 year at 3%. Remaining loan $168K on a $210K appraised home\nDaycare - roughly $1000 a month\nUtilities - roughly $300 a month\nCell Phone - roughly $135 a month\nGroceries - roughly $700 a month\nInsurance (auto) - roughly $75 a month\nGas - roughly $300 a month\nGym - roughly $25 a month\nLife Insurance - $20 a month for 250K coverage (supplemental coverage on top of work provided coverage)\n\"Fun\" Money - we allocate about $1000 a month for clothes, Amazon, movies, out to eat, etc. This is our catch all for all those additional purchases made \n\nOutstanding Debt - I have $8,000 left on my 2012 car that we put $1000 to each month at roughly 2% interest\n\nThis leaves us roughly $3,500 each month we are putting into a savings account. I would like to use this money differently if possible. Right now, have a balance of roughly 45K in that account (emergency fund) Factors to think of:\n\n1) Home - we would love to build a new home in a few years to be the \"forever home\" \n2) Kid #2 - likely looking at a second kiddo in 2017. Would roughly double daycare and 529 expenses. \n\nI appreciate anyones thoughts. I love PF and have learned a ton from the community as a lurker so thought I would get input directly. You are welcome to beat me up for the following:\n1) Why am I not maxing the Roth?\n2) How are we spending $1,000 on \"fun\" each month?\n3) Terrible throwaway username\n4) Why am I not investing in land/PLASTICS/or something else (my point of reaching out) ","name":"t3_4caon4","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-28 17:45:17","week":13}

The first one was refunded and returned and showed up back in my inventory. The second one was delivered but doesn't show up in my inventory. I give it some time. I re-sold the first one. The second one never shows up in my inventory still so I create a case with Amazon.\n\nThis is what they say:\n\n&gt;After thoroughly investigating this shipment and available inventory (please see images attached) we are accounting missing units from the following unexpected additional units received:\n\n&gt;[widget] +1\n\n&gt;As per Amazon's Policies:\n\n&gt;\" ... For both Unexpected item found and Additional quantities encountered, if your or your distributor ships extra unexpected units not mentioned in the shipment, we may receive these as substitutions. Amazon may count the substitutions against any claim for expected units that weren’t received. Amazon will not reimburse for units used as substitutions.\n\n&gt;This information can be found here, under \"Receiving Problems\", 3rd title, \"Note\":\n\n&gt;https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200336250/ref=ag_200336250_cont_200875520?referral=A2A637FDMJCX8Z_A22E6AYURJ82OH\n\n&gt;When building or modifying a shipment in the Shipment Creation Workflow, it is very important to enter the correct quantity of units you are shipping to Amazon for each Merchant SKU.

{"id":"4ce570","author":"guppy221","body":"I want to introduce you faggots to a different $CMG. No, not the e-coli infested piece of crap on the NYSE. I'm talking about [Computer Modelling Group](http://www.cmgl.ca), listed on the TSX.\n\nCMG is a nice, clean (aka no e-coli induced death) long stock that has really nice potential. Lets start with the business itself:\n\n* CMG provides reservoir simulation software to large E&amp;P companies and integrated oil companies. This includes black oil, unconventional reservoir, thermal reservoir, advanced process, and production system simulations.\n* They specialize in heavy oil simulations, and all the top 20 Canadian heavy oil producers use CMG software.\n* Their software suite is unparalleled with few competitors, the major competition comes from the big engineering companies like Baker Hughs' JewelSuite or Schlumberger's uncreatively named simulation software. \n* CMG has a fast growing client list of 580 clients in 61 countries - most of them pay perpetuities to the company to use their software, in addition to software support.\n\nOnto the financial statements, this is where everyone starts to become super excited:\n\n* Year over year revenue growth over the past 3 years is 12%, and it did not slow down in 2015\n* It maintains 50% operating margins and ~30% profit margins \n* Zero debt (its not a cash intensive business so it doesn't need to go into debt to grow)\n* A small (but not too shitty) 3% dividend.\n\nAnd onto the bad parts:\n\n* its priced like a growth stock, which means its stupidly overpriced. At a EV/EBITDA of 17 and P/E of 29, this stock is bloody expensive\n* illiquid as fuck. On a good day you'll see 60,000 shares traded of this stock\n* growth is limited by the fact everyone in heavy oil is bleeding from the asshole (supposedly, 2015 had record revenues for CMG)\n* a buyout is unlikely. Not only is CMG relatively expensive, it is also the big guy in the its own specialized field\n\nMy two cents:\n\n* CMG should be fairly valued right now, with plenty of room to grow. If you faggots are willing to buy into overpriced shit like TSLA or AMZN, then a YOLO on CMG shouldn't be a stretch.\n* Its got good potential for a sustained rise if we see market euphoria around oil prices\n\n\nThis ain't your regular biotech yolo (in fact some may not consider it a yolo) - this is yet another oil pick because that's all I know how to research.\n\nAdios!

{"id":"4cmq6e","author":"25sittinon25cents","body":"I just quickly wrote this type up for a job listing I will be posting soon.  I have yet to double and triple check it, and I'll probably make a million changes to it before actually putting up listings, but I just realized I don't really know where to go to find the best candidates (I'm only familiar with Craigslist, Monster really).  \n\nWhat I am looking for, is someone who will be loyal and stay long term with the company, and can help me with big influential decisions as well as handle major accounts.  I need someone who in time I can rely on to handle tasks that I generally wouldn't trust to anyone but myself.  At the moment I have one assistant who simply handles administrative stuff, shipping, invoicing, basic tasks, but I often find myself overwhelmed with opportunities for growth here and there and can't handle them all myself\n\nBeginning of Job listing Draft:\n\nAbout us:\n\nIn a nutshell, we are an Import and Distribution company that sells to wholesalers, retailers and e-businesses around the country.  We have offices in China that source all kinds of products (Housewares, Kitchen accessories, Pet Items, Gadgets, and more), send us the info and samples, where we evaluate each product based off our knowledge of the market and our client base.  For those items that we choose to go ahead with, we then order mass quantities directly from the factories in China, and do everything from promoting the product and creating the packaging which is a very important aspect of making the product marketable, to discussing price points, working with buyers on ways to get the products into the market and ultimately making it a million dollar item.  \n\nAside from finding ways to always boost sales and bring more products in the market, we are always looking to expand the company horizontally.  This includes getting our products on TV by teaming up with the HSN network, working with many popular e-commerce businesses like Groupon on special promotions and deals to build our brand name and analyzing where to spend our promotional budget through the endless amount of advertising avenues available.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\nWe are looking for an energetic, ambitious, and thought provoking individual who is willing to learn the ins and outs of the industry, and in time, be able to contribute to the growth of the company in a multitude of ways.  The candidate does not necessarily have to have any background knowledge in the market, but they should possess the ability to understand the items, understand the positive and negative feedback received for existing items in our line, and apply that knowledge to the consideration of future items that will be added to our product line (this will be discussed in group meetings, so that ideas can be shared).  The individual will also be seeking out new accounts to sell to, such as major supermarket chains, wholesalers, and even e-businesses similar to current partners of ours like LivingSocial, Amazon, Wayfair etc. \n\n\nEdit: I have yet to complete the \"About you\" section, but I think I've provided enough info for you guys to understand what I need.

I just finished a 18month Computing &amp; Networking Administration course at a community college this past October. My student loans don't kickin until May. I was 90 days late paying on my Amazon StoreCard Credit Card. I checked my credit score last week on Transunion its 547 and on Experian its 560. I just paid the entire card balance of $500 off 2 days ago so I don't know when or if my credit score will boost since my student loans are $15,000. I work fast-food part-time and my work hours fluctuates due to company needs. Last year I made roughly $4000 total(well taxable income). Lately my work hours have doubled so I'm getting $390-500 bi-weekly compared to last year where $270 was my biggest check. Now I sell things(dropshipping) on eBay and webforums and for the past few months I've been making anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 a month profit. I would like to put down anywhere from $2000-$3500 on the car. I know for sure that my dad is not cosigning and my mom has fucked up credit and I have no one else that will cosign. The car is a BMW for $13,000 so I will need a $9k-10k loan. As of yesterday I have been on the job for a year. I have no ways to prove my income besides W-2 forums or my last paycheck stubs from work; so I'm guessing they wont take my ebay sales into consideration. My question is, is there anyway in hell they will approve me and what can I expect my interest and car insurance to be.

{"id":"4cqggw","author":"magicroot75","body":"**Get Organized**\n\nI’m not a naturally organized person. Here are a few ways I try to become consciously more organized. The following thoughts are focused on creating a life, especially in your home, that is free of unnecessary complexity. This is about more than interior design. It’s about cultivating a mindset of simplicity and efficiency. I won’t make an argument here for the advantageousness of this pursuit because I hope you who are reading a blog called The Optimized Now already value such things.\n\n**Disown**\n\nThe difficulty of organizing your possessions is directly correlated to the quantity and size of the items you own. In order to move towards a more organized life, you must disown your non-essentials. Disowning things is more than a physical act of throwing them away. It’s a commitment to be emotionally detached from your stuff. This will free you to live in an uncluttered environment. From contemporary studies in social anthropology and psychology, to the verses of the Bible and other religious texts, you’ll find unabashed agreement that things don’t make us happy.\n\nMake this a habit: every laundry cycle, examine the clothes you haven’t worn during that cycle. Do you need them? If there’s anything you don’t think you’d ever be caught dead wearing again: give it away immediately. If you think you might someday want to wear it again use this test: Have I worn it in the past 3 months? If the answer is no and it’s not a family heirloom, holiday outfit, or sports gear, give it away. No matter how much you paid for it, it’s not worth anything to you taking up precious closet space. Constantly think about the clothing you can give away or trash. Be radical about this. Challenge yourself to simplify down the bare essentials. You’ll quickly become less attached to your stuff.\n\nThis closet cleansing practice has double value: it frees up physical space in your closet AND it creates a little bit of fear the next time you are about to buy clothing. You won’t want to buy something just to end up throwing it out.\n\n**Buy Less**\n\nDon’t buy things on impulse that cost more than a few bucks. Always sleep on a purchase and reflect on the true necessity or value of a piece of clothing or any other item. Let purchases sit as ideas on shopping lists or your Amazon Cart for at least one night before you buy. Retailers use fancy deep learning computer algorithms that can beat Chess Grandmasters, don’t believe you won’t succumb. Give yourself a chance to reduce your clutter by creating some temporal and emotional distance between your purchase desires and your wallet. You’ll end up with more intelligent purchases and less stuff to organize. Ask yourself: is this an essential item? Be radically honest with yourself. Assess your purchases based on your actual past behavior. Here’s an example (pardon all the guy’s examples): You see a cool new Allen Iverson jersey at the thrift shop. It’s actually really nice and fits well. You think about how cool you’d look reppin’ the home team and even imagine turning heads\non the streets as you sport your sweet new jersey. The colors just pop really nicely. It’s got an old school vintage feel and even has the stitched numbers so you look like you paid a lot of money for it. It’s only $3.50, why not buy it? Seems like a pretty good investment, right? Nope. After emotionally detaching yourself from this daydream, you ask your friend, who happened to accompany you to the store, what he thinks about the item. “Well,” he advises, clearing his throat in preparation for difficult words, “you never really wear jerseys and they’re hardly ever appropriate attire. That one you bought a couple years ago you’ve worn maybe two times. I just don’t think it’s worth it.” He’s right. It’s not.\n\n**Where to put everything**\n\nI’ve been trying to get everything in its right place in my bedroom. It’s tough. It’s so easy to throw things in random spots. I’ve found a few principles really useful for maintaining an organized space. This has mainly come from observing the arrangement of hotel rooms. I figure hotels have spent millions of dollars on behavioral research to optimize for efficiency and comfort, which is pretty much all I want from my home.\n\n**If something isn’t physically used at least daily, it is a storage item.**\n\nPlace it in storage. Storage should be out of sight. You don’t need items hanging around that you don’t need. They create extra cognitive options when looking for items. For instance, let’s say you have on your bathroom sink rubbing alcohol, hand lotion, chapstick, paper towels, soap, bandaids, facial cream, and contact lens solution. If all you need each day is your solution &amp; soap, you’ve now created all these unnecessary physical and cognitive obstructions to your routine. Store the stuff you don’t use. If it’s probably not going to be used in the next 6 months and isn’t a first aid item, ditch it. You can always buy more if you really need to. Don’t fall into that mental trap of saving everything “just in case”. That’s a recipe for clutter.\n\nThat being said, storage can often be a way to prevent the need for constant trips to the store. For instance, I like to keep three sets of backstock soap, deodorant, Advil, sunscreen, mouthwash, toothpaste, dishwashing tabs, and a few other household items. This prevents frequent runs to the store and helps me always have what I need. Consider having a backstock of your commonly used items.\n\n**Travel Pack**\n\nHaving kits is a great way to save time, be prepared, and prevent organizational chaos. My primary kit I have ready to go at all times is a travel kit. It has my essentials for overnight stays: contact lens solution, deodorant, toothbrush, earplugs, etc. This makes traveling simple and, more importantly, returning from travel is easy because I don’t have to replace all my items to their original spot.\n\n**Think carefully about placement.**\n\nYou may not think about it, but wandering across your room 15 times back and forth does take time. It makes physical objects you’re trying to get more cognitively burdensome. Avoid random placement of objects in your room. Think about where something is generally used and place it near there. Soap goes as physically close to the faucet as possible. The trashcan goes as physically close to the sink as possible. Another trashcan may go as close to your writing hand as possible at your desk. Learn to think like an engineer. Everything’s placement should be thoughtful. This will make simple tasks easier and hopefully give you more pride in your living space. A few more examples: Pots go near the stove. Baking items near the oven. Handtowels near sinks. Drinking glasses near the faucet. Knives close to the cutting board. Notepads near writing areas. Sleep gear near bed. Socks in drawer near floor. Shirts at shoulder level. The more you need something, the more accessible it should\nbe. This will cut down on unnecessary moves and prevent you from worrying about where things need to go and where they are. It will allow items to serve as physical reminders for the tasks you use them for. For instance, by placing notepads on your desk, you’ve also created an implicit reminder to be thinking creatively and be future-oriented. By placing floss visibly near a faucet you’ve created a reminder to floss.\n\nConsider placing items in groups that make sense. All your shower storage items go in one place. All the first aid items in a bag or an area that you can quickly access but out of the way. All non-daily medicines in a place together. Just think how annoyed you get searching around for things when they are illogically spread out in different places in your room or house.\n\n**Inbox and Outbox**\n\nInevitably and frequently things will need to move to and from rooms. There is a cataclysmic danger these moving items clutter up this newly beautifully organized space we just discussed. This need not be the case. Items on the move should be thoughtfully arranged and designated their own places. Create a physical inbox and an outbox. The inbox will be a labeled or unlabeled space where you place everything that needs to be dealt with. It will go near your thinking space: probably your desk. This inbox might contain mail, documents you need to sign, a check, a gift, a painting, or whatever. If you need to think about what to do with it, it goes into your inbox. That is the physical and cognitive space where all incoming items go. I have two. One is for miscellaneous items, the other for clothing that needs to be folded/organized/tried on/etc…\n\nThe same goes for outgoing items. Items leaving your bedroom or home go near your door. Whether they are going to your kitchen, your car, or Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, it doesn’t matter. This will be the cognitive and physical space for everything in that room that you want to go somewhere else. You won’t be searching around for it. You won’t forget that it has to go. It’ll be right there at the door waiting for you to assess its priority and carry it with you on the way out. With these inboxing and outboxing techniques, you’ll quickly learn that what used to be many individual tasks of moving items can often be consolidated and brought out together. This is a benefit I refer to as batching.\n\n**Work and organize in batches**\n\nI have a bad habit of breaking tasks into small, repetitive steps. Let me give an example. When chopping 5 onions I used to chop an onion on my kitchen counter, walk out of the kitchen and throw away the scraps into the trashcan, pull out the 2nd onion and do it all over again. No matter how optimized the cutting board and knife, it’s still hopelessly inefficient. Now I go like this: I pull out a big metal bowl. I pull out 5 onions. I chop off 5 onion roots. I peel 5 onions. I place ALL the peels in the bowl and dump it. 20% of the time and effort with a simple tweak. Develop the habit of batching tasks like this. When folding laundry, don’t fold a shirt, put it away, and then start folding the next shirt. Fold everything, then put it all away in batches based on which items are going where. This is an especially helpful technique in the kitchen, where repetitive tasks are common. Batch processing will save you massive time.\n\n**Note on Aesthetics**\n\nI do believe in style and I think it’s healthy and good to have some things you don’t need in your space but do like having there. This is fine, as long as your art is not hindering your space constraints or creating clutter, I think it’s great. Art should be intentionally placed and additive to the positive psychological environment you’ve created in your home.\n\nConsider creating a home with thoughtfully placed possessions. Considering being conscious and thoughtful about the things you choose to call your own. Your life will be simpler and you’re mind will be free to focus more on the things you love.\n\n[Found originally on blog here](http://www.theoptimizednow.com/organize/) ","name":"t3_4cqggw","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-31 17:17:52","week":13}

My understanding is that it identifies the product and that you are the seller of the product. It needs to cover the original barcode and if you place the labels directly on the item/box it needs to be removable like [these] (http://www.amazon.com/Avery-Removable-White-Labels-Count/dp/B00004Z65P/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459125472&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Avery+Removable+1+x+2+5%2F8+Inch+White+ID+Labels+750+Count+%286460%29). These labels can be used with a laser or inkjet printer. Many hard core FBAs buy thermal printers as they find it faster/easier.

The poly bags would be for used items without packaging, unsealed items, if you aren't using removable labels, etc. Keep in mind that items to Amazon are going to a (dirty) warehouse.

{"id":"d1fxgx3","author":"BobbyTrosclair","body":"During the recent Amazon hold on restricted ASINs (thankfully, over for now), I took a break from sourcing and listing and waited to see what would happen. \n\nI realized that another change could happen in Amazon's policies that could impact my ability to sell, or I could get suspended, or who knows what, so I spent the week researching other platforms, as well as new sourcing ideas, some of which are working out really well. \n\nI'd always heard of Half.com but never even visited their site. It's essentially eBay's attempt to copy Amazon, and combines elements of both. You can list by tagging onto an existing listing (like Amazon), and not have to write a whole new description and photo, which speeds up listing. If you already have an eBay account, it mirrors your existing account and is easy to register on (took a couple of minutes). Like Amazon, the buyer pays upfront and Half tells you when the $ has been cleared and its safe to ship. They send you the accumulated funds every 2 weeks, like Amazon. Prices are less, and they focus on books, DVDs, games, and such, not the wide range of stuff you can find on eBay. Prices are generally lower than Amazon. \n\nAs an experiment, I listed about 20 titles that had been restricted on Amazon, as well as a box of books that I had been dragging my feet on selling on Amazon. 1 was a scholarly text that was going for about $75 on Amazon, but in a weird printing error, about half the pages were upside down. Others were books that were going for a good amount ($20 - $40 range), but had different cover art than the listing on Amazon, or had some listing error by the person who originally created the page that could make a problem, like posting a picture of the wrong book entirely, or listing a paperback-only title as a hardback. In all those cases, I could include a photo of the cover art on my copy, or make a good description of the printing error, or send Seller Support a request to make the listing correct, but I always seem to put those kinds of books off to list until later - the money is good but not worth the time spent to correct potential problems. Those are the kinds of books that can get you negative feedback, no matter how carefully you describe the condition, by someone who didn't read the description. It didn't seem worth the time and effort to list them.\n\nI thought they might sit on there forever, but the weird misprint sold within a couple of days at $50.00, and another book that was missing a dustjacket and was temporarily restricted sold for $25.00.\n\nIt might be a good alternative for gdblu, doesn't cost anything to list and you can list much faster than eBay without the higher fees associated with Amazon. If you price at a sell-through rate, you should be able to move some titles and the fees aren't bad.  \n\nI think I will continue to use it for \"problem\" books, while fully describing the condition. I don't list many books in Acceptable condition on Amazon, as I am pretty protective of my seller's rating, but I'm not as concerned with a bad feedback on Half or eBay as they are a very minor source of income compared to Amazon. (Will still offer a full guarantee and work for customer satisfaction, as always - my eBay rating is still excellent.) If Amazon is like Target, and eBay is like Walmart, Half.com is kind of like a dollar store or an online yard sale. It's essentially found money for titles I didn't have high hopes of selling.\n\n","name":"t1_d1fxgx3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-28 04:47:37","week":13}

{"id":"d1g7ag0","author":"badreligionfan","body":"Things that I have done that could help you to stretch your money:\n\n1.) Shop at a low-cost grocery store like Aldi. I've been going there almost exclusively and spend between 30 and 40 dollars for whatever is on sale for food that lasts 2 people all week. You can probably do way better than that, but that is from me not being that frugal while shopping there. Cheap but really good. Planning meals ahead is key.\n\n2.) Share the Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBO Go accounts of your friends and family. You're young, you probably know of other online no-cost alternatives.\n\n3.) Roommates. I have been living with roommates since I flew from the nest at my parents. I got married and said goodbye to roommates...but now my wife is technically my roommate but she currently isn't working.\n\n4.) Get married? Once I got married and altered my tax exemptions on my W-4 I've been getting more money (and still get a refund when filing my taxes). Don't get married for the sole purpose of tax benefits, though, or you're in for disaster.\n\n5.)  Get your furniture on the cheap from somewhere like Restore, which is run by habitat for humanity.\n\n6.) If you need help finding a job, some states have workforce exchanges (at least Maryland does). They give you tools for finding work based on your individual skill set.\n\nI'm sure there are more things that I can't think of, but just know that many of us on here have probably been in somewhat similar circumstances. You will do fine, and the feeling of being independent can be a boon for you and motivate you to do well. Adulting is hard, but so worth it to not have to take shit from anyone.","name":"t1_d1g7ag0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-28 13:02:47","week":13}

{"id":"d1g9gcj","author":"comp21","body":"ok, I have a little bit of time for a response... let me give you a little history first:\n\nI started custom building computers back in August of 1999. Since then I have had a retail store, a divorce, a subsequent bankruptcy, closed my retail store and since Jun 2011 have been basically a self employed tech.\n\nHere's two big things I learned:\n\na) it's ok to tell someone \"no\" if you either can't make money on the project or if the project, as they want to do it, will give you a bad name. I do not cater to people who want to half ass things. Doing it that way does not do either of us any long term good.\n\nb) focus on the higher margin items - i.e., I don't build custom machines any more. it takes too much time for too little a return, especially when factoring in the warranty and extra support they expect since you're \"right down the street\".\n\nMy big money makers (percentage-wise) are managed/hosted antivirus (I used Vipre Business... I run a console on a dedicated machine with a 100meg fiber link that supports just under 500 clients. I have a different policy for every customer account, I back the server up periodically and that machine emails me when there's something severe. Customers who sign up for it get discounted virus cleaning should something get through. I also pro-rate their licenses to Jan1 then each year they're billed for the entire year. You take a little hit on the first year sometimes but not much... at my level, licenses run around $8.70 each (by memory, could be slightly off) and I charge an average of $46 per machine. Also, if you buy your licenses in the 3rd quarter each year you can usually get 10% off and, if you buy three years at a time, you get an extra year free (not factored in to the cost I told you above).\n\nI also manage backup systems for customers... I install a software package (which I'm not going to tell you right now because I found a _major_ flaw in their software 10 days ago and they've yet to fix it so we may be switching soon). It emails me reports each night... combine that with Logmein (we're switching to teamviewer here in June though) and now you can log in and fix things when they happen. So, for $50 / month, I take care of all their backups, manage them, etc. On average I log in to a client's machine once every 90 days and they buy the software up front. Again, every at $50 a month or below is billed annually and everyone above that is quarterly. I back them up to my Amazon S3 account... on average I'm pulling in $1500 a month and the account costs me $95.\n\nNow, my business is set up a little differently than most: I don't do retail. I keep a small inventory of parts on hand for service work. I have one tech full time, another part time high school kid who's there for training... I have a subcontracting crew I've worked with for 15 years that install all my phone systems, alarm systems and cabling (things that I categorize as \"one timers\"... i.e., you put them in \"one time\" and rarely have to see them again... so, it's ok to sub this work out and not know about it personally as the sub is available to handle the occasional call). \n\nIn the \"store\" we perform what I consider \"residential\" type work... virus cleanings, drop offs for repairs, laptop parts repair, mobile device repair.... the \"store\" is an 8x16' section of a friend's office supply store that we rent for $500/month with utils. I pay their staff $4 per check in for anything they have to deal with. It helps us both: she gets walk ins she would not get, we have \"staff\" I don't have to keep on payroll to watch things for us and it's cheap... and we focus on the high margin things like service and not selling stuff. This also helps us keep our service levels high and our name good as we're not wasting time doing other things.\n\nMy secretary works out of her home nearly an hour's drive from here... I forward my main number to her cell and she handles everything through Google apps for appointments, scheduling, calling customers, etc. Everything is mostly handled over email communication. Cost: $350/week. She took a pay cut to be home with her husband more, not drive in to work every day and to have an overall better life. Well, I take that back, I just gave her a raise to $400 a week... fun fact: she's also my former mother in law :)\n\nWe're not a huge company... around $300k in revenue but I've managed to squeeze a 67.4% gross margin out of that with the right focus and cost cutting. Now that I've decided to hire someone though, we're growing... he is doing a great job at the bench (residential work) and we're up around 22% from last year so far. I didn't want to grow for the longest time... having employees that were \"friends\" was part of the reason for the bankruptcy... who do you fire? It sucked...\n\nNow... what do I do? I mainly focus on network security and servers. What I categorize as \"high maintenance\" items. Items that need constant monitoring, constant \"shoring up\" and items that cost a lot of money. I can control my quality better than anyone else so I make sure the big stuff stays under my thumb. A lot of my personal work is performed remotely so I sit at my desk at my house with dual 27\" LCDs overlooking the Mississippi River and try to enjoy life a bit while I get shit done :)\n\nHope this helps some... It's hard to form a coherent reply this long when Reddit only lets you see a few lines at a time. You're welcome to PM me any time. I gotta get some coffee and head to a client's now.","name":"t1_d1g9gcj","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-03-28 14:52:15","week":13}

{"id":"d1gbv0g","author":"messyentrepreneur","body":"I had a very similar situation. I wasn't getting kicked out but my parents wanted me to pay 500 dollars per month when I was 21. I just started my business and money was tight. I wasn't going to pay them so I moved into one of my friends places for 500 dollars per month. I only had 500 dollars to my name at the time and that was to pay my first month's rent. My situation was a little different because I had a small business doing computer repair so I just had to hunt for work on Craiglist and network with others to get work. Your 5000 dollars can go a long way if you're frugal and start getting more income. Check the gigs and services section in Craigslist to see if there is anything up there you can do for extra cash. \n\nIf you have a running car you can see if you can see if Amazon Flex is in your area. It's 18-25 per hour and you set the times you want to work.\n\nhttps://flex.amazon.com/\n\nYou can also make money on Ebay on the side. Go to goodwill to buy items for 3-5 dollars and sell them on Ebay for 15-25 (sometimes more). Ebay is great because they show you what items sold and how much they sold. Also the last time that item sold. Brand name stuff normally sells decent on Ebay along with shoes. \n\nAs others have said live very frugal. Eat cheap, ramen noodles, pasta, etc. You can find a lot of recipes online that you can use ramen noodles to make them better for cheap. Buy store brand products. Look for coupons online and the Wed / Sunday newspaper. Some stores have double coupon days.\n\nAre your parents keeping you on their insurance, cell phone plan, etc? \n\nAll of my furniture was given to me for free from friends and family. Just ask people if they have anything if that they don't want. Others will want to help you. You just have to be willing to humble yourself and ask.\n\nGoodwill become your best friend. \n\nBottom line you'll get through this. Don't stress over it and everything will be fine.

{"id":"d1gwaih","author":"anonim11","body":"I'm fairly new to the game but have been soaking up as much info as possible. As a n00b, I'm hesitant to start with CC -&gt; VGC -&gt; Serve -&gt; CC bill pay (even though the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/wiki/faqserve) says there are no confirmed reports of shutdowns due to this). I'm more interested in using Serve to pay monthly rent (~3000) for now and make headway towards minimum spend/reap in on rewards.\n\nI was approved for Ink+ last week and will be applying for SPG Personal and Business today and tomorrow, so I'm looking at $13k in minimum spend over the next three months to qualify for the bonuses, which is quite a bit outside of my organic spend range. Here's my plan:\n\n**Ink+ (min spend $5k)**\n\n* Purchase $5k in Amazon GCs at office supply stores (there are a few in my local area) in regular intervals over the next three months\n* Are there any online stores through the Ultimate Rewards portal that sell Amazon GCs? This will let me get higher than 5x rewards.\n\n**SPG Personal (min spend $3k)**\n\n* Load Serve with $1k/month, online, for three months. There's a daily limit of $200, so I'd load every 5-6 days.\n\n**SPG Business (min spend $5k)**\n\n* Load Serve with $2k/month, in store, for three months. This adds up to $3k/month in Serve which I would use for rent.\n* I plan to go the route of CC -&gt; VGC -&gt; Serve load for rewards. That said, I'm not versed in the best method of doing this to minimize risk.\n* There are no Family Dollar stores nearby; there is a Rite Aid within walking distance and three Wal-Mart stores within 30 minutes. Would I be looking at something like purchasing 3 gift cards per day (up to the maximum value) with the SPG Business card, loading them to Serve at Rite Aid the same day, and repeating the same process every few days until I've got $2k loaded (in addition to the $1k from online loading)? I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction if there are threads on recommended VGC purchase/Serve load intervals to, again, minimize risk. This isn't technically MS since I'm paying rent, but I still want to reduce the chance of having my Serve account shut down like the many folks who've been reporting in as of late.\n\nEdit: Yet another option would be to open new bank accounts and fund up to the max via CC, though this seems like more work than necessary if I can safely use the Serve method above.","name":"t1_d1gwaih","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-03-29 00:02:49","week":13}

{"id":"d1hrvrk","author":"o08","body":"I don't know what the effect on unemployment would be.  In theory, we are a consumer economy and more money in the hands of those most likely to spend (low income folks) would mean more customers in stores and a better bottom line.  \n\nI do think that small businesses like a bagel shop with 2 employees would be hurt by this.  I feel like a small business tax credit would help offset the disproportional burden on them.  \n\nBut with regards to larger corporations, they'd have to either reduce dividends or executive compensation or move to Mexico where they don't have the customer base.    \n\nBottom line is that low level workers are suffering from a myriad of reasons and those workers can't survive in todays economy.  The government is then supporting them through many different social programs and these programs are being paid for by the middle class.  Should corporations be responsible for their welfare or should we the people be responsible via increased taxation?\n\nI remember when I was living in L.A. about 10 years ago that the Mexicans at Home Depot waiting around to do yard work for whomever needed it banded together and set a floor of $15 an hour for odd jobs like leaf raking.  If they could do it, the state would probably survive.\n\nI'd imagine, though, that the end result of much of this is that online sales from Amazon and others become more dominant and a $15 minimum wage will just speed up that trend.

Also, I like being able to have 40 boxes laying completely flat, taking up very little space on a shelf versus having a giant pile of empty boxes.\n\nAlso, before the recent USPS price changes when you got charged extra per ounce and First Class was limited to up to 13 oz, having specific boxes that were the optimum weight and size for certain items I sell in quantity actually saved me money on shipping and limited the amount of padding I needed to use which mostly or completely offset the cost of the boxes I bought (more so if you factor in time saved).\n\nFurthermore, if dumpster diving for boxes was actually economical, you'd imagine a company like Amazon would save millions a year if they stopped buying new boxes and just paid employees to go around to lots of dumpsters.  Of course, they don't actually do this because it isn't economical and if you contemplated paying someone to dumpster dive for your, you'd realize that you aren't really saving much, if anything, by doing this.\n\nFor the record, I do save a lot of boxes I get when I order things and they do come in handy and they do save me money from time-to-time especially for very large boxes.

Order before 6pm, and you book was overnighted.  I slayed the market in the first year, because I knew the clients' primary concern was time to get the books.  Same books, reasonably the same price, bigger names, just better inventory and shipping.\n\n\nYou don't have to do something different.

They take a cut, you get a cut.  your cut &gt;&gt;&gt; adsense.  \n\n\nAffiliates are people who sell product.  You run ads on your site for their product.  Consumers click through and buy their stuff, you get a commission.    This can be lucrative, becuase you are paid for performance - the more you sell, the more money you make.\n\nCPA is Cost per Acquisition (you get paid per sale).  That's basically the affiliate model.\n\nCPC is Cost per Click.  That's adsense.  You get paid everytime someone clicks.\n\n\nCPM is Cost per Thousand.  You get paid by impressions - no matter what the visitor does.  THis is nice, but difficult to find advertisers willing to do this.\n\n\nYour first step should be visiting similiar websites and start looking at how they're monetizing.  Then start testing these alternatives.  You will need to research and test to increase your income.\n\n\nMy thoughts on Amazon affiliate program?

{"id":"d1itco0","author":"trevorparsons","body":"As with most online high-yield APY accounts, there are monthly requirements you must meet in order to qualify for the higher rate. Failure to meet all requirements means you are only paid interest on a lower (as low as 0.01%) rate\n\nIn this specific case, here's their friendly formatted rate schedule:  \nhttps://www.myconsumers.org/home/rates.html\n\nSo pretty simple to see that if your balance is between $15,000.01 and $20,000, you'll earn the highest APY of 4.59%. That's insanely high in today's market. But there's a catch, of course -- certain monthly requirements you must meet in order to qualify. Reading the fine print reveals:\n\n&gt; The basic service requirements include: a) you make twelve (12) PINless card transactions (any transaction that does not require a PIN) that post to and clear your Reward Checking account; b) you access Online Banking at least once; c) you receive e-Documents (must have enrolled and accepted the disclosure; and d) you have a direct deposit or ACH debit (including Bill Payment) post to and clear your Reward Checking account.\n\nConsidering the 4.59% rate, that's really not too much to ask. As stated elsewhere in this thread, twelve \"PINless\" transactions a month could be a dozen $0.01 Amazon gift card balance reloads.\n\nBut we're not quite done yet. If you look at their rates schedule PDF you'll notice something that otherwise flies under the radar:  \nhttps://www.myconsumers.org/documents/TIS_Share_and_Drafts.pdf\n\nUnder Tier A, it states:\n\n&gt; Basic service requirements met **+ $1,000 in credit card purchase transactions**\n\nSo now you also have to spend at least a grand a month to qualify. For those with work-related reimbursed expense reports or those in the /r/churning world, this may be an easy feat. For the rest of us, probably too rich for our blood. Though, to their credit, Tier B only requires $500/month spend for an APY of 3.59% and Tier C has no additional spend requirement for an APY of 3.09%. Still 3x higher than most online savings banks.\n\nI currently have some savings stashed in American Express Online Savings. No monthly requirements to meet, but gives a much lower rate of 0.9% right now.","name":"t1_d1itco0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-30 09:32:42","week":13}

{"id":"d1j2rqi","author":"zackiedude","body":"I think the problem with traditional advertising is you don't know if people have beards and/or if they care enough to use balm for them. I would think about where you *know* who those people are. People have mentioned barber shops, which I think is great to grow, but it may be hard to scale (imaging having to manage 1000 different barbershop relationships). Some things I would look into:\n\n* **Organic Search:** Optimize your site so when people search \"Beard Balm\" they find it.\n* **Amazon:** Yes, you'll lose about 7% of your margin, but the sales from Amazon will probably be worth it.. unless they decide they want to create a private label version of your brand--I don't think you have to worry about this because you're niche. I would suggest Fulfilled by Amazon because at my company we've seen 3x sales when on FBA vs. seller-fulfilled. This will also help you grow without dealing with the pain of fulfillment.\n* **Social ads:** I know this sounds silly, but many social networks allow you to really filter down to relevant audiences. The CPC may be higher but if you know someone loves beards, it's probably worth the click. It's hard to keep track of lifetime value of a customer this early in your biz, but try to keep that in mind.\n* **Image search:** This is a bit outside my wheelhouse, but I would see if you can make your beard balm rank higher on image search. At my company, every year it has driven a little bit more business as people do more searching by image than text.\n* **Referral:** There are companies that help you develop referral networks and take a charge. Essentially, blogs will write about your product and take a cut of sales. Then the referral company takes a small cut of that. I don't know how large you need to be to work with these types of companies. We personally use [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/) but I think they might be for larger companies.\n\nHopefully those stir some mental juices for you!

I tried to purchase products myself the other day just to test the rumor.  If I had purchased the product before, I could re-order with no difficulty.  But if it was a product I had never ordered before, it would not let me purchase it now.  A little research online shows many, many customers affected by this, with no idea what the problem is.  It could affect sales.  I went to eBay and bought books and dog toys and everything Amazon wouldn't or couldn't sell me.

{"id":"d1jkei4","author":"phulbarg","body":"Nowhere near all of it goes back into the **local** economy. The money you pay to Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Ford, Netflix, Spotify, etc. and other non-local companies go out of your local economy, and the higher the local prices rise the more people will seek to do business with non-local companies. I may pay $10 more to get my shoes at a brick and mortar store, but if it is $20 more I might choose to go to Zappos or Amazon. The local shops will also funnel a big part of their revenue out of the local economy, when you pay for a ticket at the theater most of it goes to the movie distributor which isn't part of the local economy. When you order a meal at the restaurant a significant part of the money goes to buying the ingredients, and other miscellaneous items that are not bought locally. And just like you, the higher the local prices become the more companies will switch to sourcing their ingredients non-locally.\n\nFurthermore companies that can move from your economy may choose to do so. E.g. if you have a manufacturing operation you may move that to a place with lower minimum wage, at least if you have a large amount of people being paid near the minimum wage. This means the inputs into the economy will decrease as well and it could very well lead to higher unemployment.","name":"t1_d1jkei4","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-03-30 22:48:24","week":13}

I had a Seller that was buying product from a local major Company warehouse.

As a result, they were able to buy below wholesale and sell at wholesale, below the price Amazon could buy and sell for a profit.  After asking for a copy of the invoice to prove, these products was not bootleg, Amazon went to the local warehouse and signed an exclusive agreement to buy all the product available.  Then Amazon blocked the Seller from selling any more of that product line and sold the product at full MRSP.  This Seller has had about ten products he was selling like this.  One example I can disclose because there were a lot of Sellers, were new Disney movie releases.  Sellers could buy at wholesale and sell below retail and still make a good profit.  They went in signed an exclusive agreement with the distributor, blocked any Sales from all sellers, and now sell for a substantial profit.

{"id":"d1kcutj","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"There are a lot of opinions on where to sell. Amazon FBA is best if you want to do the least amount of work, but it also effects your bottom line a bit (but not as much as it seems at first glance, because people pay more for FBA goods). Amazon Merchant Fulfilled and eBay are about equal in my opinion, but some goods sell for higher or quicker on one versus the other. Check out sales history to make that decision. I'm an eBay guy myself, because eBay allows me to sell broken stuff and stuff that may be missing pieces (as long as explicitly state that in the title, condition, and description). A lot of my money comes from broken stuff, because it's what people overlook near me. \n\nEtsy is kind of the weird sister of eBay and Amazon. Things sell slower, but things that you wouldn't even be able to sell for $10 on Amazon or eBay can sell for hundreds on Etsy. I recently sold a hot pink sewing machine for $450 on Etsy. It took 3 months, but it sold. It would have sold for somewhere around $200 on eBay immediately... so you gotta way the wait versus the profit there. Keep in mind you can only sell vintage or hand-crafted things on Etsy, but their fees are significantly lower.\n\nSpeaking of fees, try to understand the fees of all the different venues for selling. On average, assume eBay or Amazon will take 15% of the total.\n\nThere are many other selling venues, some more popular than others. You could do Sears Fulfillment, Walmart Marketplace, Bonanaza, ebid, or any number of smaller sellers... but I wouldn't recommend it.","name":"t1_d1kcutj","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-31 15:06:22","week":13}

Charging extra for a product to justify a donation isn't well received.  There was an article about UK companies who were doing this so they could qualify as a \"socially responsible\" company and it did not go over well with consumers.  I can't find the link.

Most prices will stay the exact same for the reasons I outlined above.  If Target decides to raise their prices on their goods to keep their profits the same, Wal-Mart will say fuck it, take a 10% hit in their margins, and reap 5x as much in total business because they've got much better prices on the same goods since they're willing to make less in profits.  \n\nFurthermore, if I'm making $8/hour right now and suddenly I'm making $15, the fact that a pair of socks might now cost me $0.25 cents more just doesn't matter.  I don't buy socks that often and I'm making so much more money that I'm still way better off than I was before.  But all those businesses that I can now afford to patronize that I couldn't afford before are also doing much better.  For $8/hour I was paying rent and food and nothing else.  When I start making $15, suddenly Amazon is getting my business and I'm eating at restaurants and buying new tires and whatever else I can do with all that extra money that I don't need just to survive.  All that money goes directly back into the economy.\n\nYou're looking at the downsides and of course I don't know any of the specifics of your business.

{"id":"4cxud7","author":"bobsledjoe","body":"I’m a seasoned FBA book reseller who made $20k last year in sales. It’s definitely not the most anyone’s made doing FBA, but it’s enough to start feeling some real pain points when it comes to managing my inventory. \n\n\nI started off with Inventory Lab, which simply wasn’t fast for listing because I had to make a pricing decision after each scan. And at $50 a month, it was cutting too much into my profits.\n\n\nThat’s when I started using Scan Lister. It was a lot better for bulk listing, but it was a pretty clunky experience. The main problem is that it was a desktop software not synced with the cloud, and I had remote employees who helped me source items. I wanted them to see what I was seeing in real-time, and that simply wasn’t possible.\n\nAfter all this, I figured, I might as well just use the Amazon bulk listing template + Dropbox to share my data with my employees. This worked for a while but was tedious, mainly because ISBN codes often have multiple ASINs. Often times, hard copy books and soft copy books match the same ISBN, which means it’s a pretty big hassle to first upload my listings, and then have to go into Amazon to fix it.\n\nI decided, enough with all this, and built a web application to handle my sourcing needs. It grabs the product after each scan, so I know that I’m selecting the right product. If it’s the wrong one, I can easily search for the right one right inside my dashboard, and update it. It also lets me set a default price, so I can focus on the sourcing+scanning first, and then use my repricer to optimize my pricing later. Best yet, it’s synced to the cloud with every interaction, so my employees always have the latest data as long as they’re logged in.\n\nFor me, this solved all my major pain points from remote communication, minimizing listing errors, and bad workflow from Inventory Lab’s forced pricing decision per scan.\n\nI don’t want to advertise on this subreddit, so I won’t post the link to my product here. If you want to inquire further, feel free to send me a private message. The main advice I can give you is: as soon as you start separating your workflow into two pieces, scanning, and repricing, you’ll save a lot of hours. Let the computer do all the work of analyzing the prices and choosing the best ones, and focus yourself on sourcing products and good prices! Your life will get a lot better, and your FBA business will grow. In this business of flipping, I really learned that it’s all about bulk; being able to increase your listing speed by an order of magnitude will really increase your net profit.\n","name":"t3_4cxud7","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-01 22:17:29","week":13}

{"id":"4d585f","author":"Semyonov","body":"I have about $12,000 in credit card debt.\n\nI don't have the best credit score so consolidation is for the most part out of the question - except for lendingclub... they are offering $12k, 36 months, but a 31.89% interest rate overall. My debt to income ratio is apparently too high to get approved for lower interest rates.\n\nThere are also lower amounts available, but same interest rate.\n\nI make $2500/month right now, and pay $700/m towards credit card debt (just paid off a few, it was $900/m). This isn't the minimums, I'm just paying $100/m on each card, but the interest is taking away a lot of the gains.\n\nMy other expenses are utilities, 2 cars, cell phones for my wife and I (she pays the rent with her salary, that's it), and occasionally eating out.\n\nMy question is this: would it be a good idea (credit score wise) to pay all of the debt down quickly (consolidation) and then put most of my income towards that, or try the snowball method (which is what I've been doing, but it's very slow and may not improve my credit score fast enough - I'm currently at ~620 - to be approved for a home loan at the end of this year)?\n\nI know the interest rate on the consolidation is very high, but with it my monthly would still be less than what I'm currently paying, and I could put way more towards it as I cut expenses elsewhere. I also know to throw out my credit cards that I do have.\n\nAlso, I heard about the Slate credit card, for balance transfers with 0 fees for 15 months, but does that require a high credit score?\n\nThank you much for looking at this, all advice would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: To better help you guys:\n\nHere is a picture of all debt:\n\nCar Loan one: $4993.38 @11.49% - $192.22/mo\n\nCar Loan two: $20601.74 @8.99% - $510.93/mo (I know this is high, love the car, one of the few things I'm unwilling to get rid of, just want to refinance)\n\nCredit Card 1 (bill me later, paypal): $1276.45 @19.99%\n\nCredit Card 2 (Newegg): $1153.63 @25.99%\n\nCredit Card 3 (Amazon): Paid Off @18.49%\n\nCredit Card 4 (Amazon Store Card): Paid Off @26.24%\n\nCredit Card 5 (Wells Fargo): $1249.86 @15.40%\n\nCredit Card 6 (Credit Union): $5889.26 @9.90%\n\nCredit Card 7 (MicroCenter): $500 @27.99% (as of now 0% though for the next 9 months)\n\nCredit Card 8 (Discover): $1625.63 @23.24%\n\nUtilities: ~$50-$60/mo\n\nComcast internet (no TV): $82.95/mo\n\nCell bill: $150.12/mo\n\nCar insurance (another biggie, just got a new company, still a not great rate, best I could find): $360/mo\n\nAnd that's everything on my spreadsheet that I use to keep track of my finances.\n\nTotal Debt is around $38k if you include the cars, I owe about $1733.35 in minimums/mo including everything, and make around $2500/mo salary (not including other income but I don't count that).\n\nAlso; I'm getting a one-time cash influx of $3800 in 2 weeks. Not sure how to best use that.\n\nEdit 2: I used [this](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=1056.15&amp;name_2=Paypal&amp;balance_2=1276.45&amp;payment_2=35&amp;rate_2=19.99&amp;name_3=Newegg&amp;balance_3=1153.63&amp;payment_3=42&amp;rate_3=25.99&amp;name_5=Wells Fargo&amp;balance_5=1249.86&amp;payment_5=28&amp;rate_5=15.4&amp;name_6=Credit Union&amp;balance_6=5889.26&amp;payment_6=165&amp;rate_6=9.9&amp;name_7=MicroCenter&amp;balance_7=500&amp;payment_7=35&amp;rate_7=0&amp;name_8=Discover&amp;balance_8=1625.63&amp;payment_8=48&amp;rate_8=23.24&amp;)... Holy crap... is that accurate?? All credit card debt gone by November next year???\n\nEdit 3: There's a flaw in that program I think... it doesn't account for the extra disposable income I could put towards these debts ($600/m), it just accounts for the minimum payments due. How do I account for the extra money I could throw towards all this?\n\nEdit 4: I used mint.com's goal planner which accounts for the $1600/mo that I can throw towards all this (but not my cash influx of $3800) and the new date is December of this year to be credit card debt free!","name":"t3_4d585f","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-03 08:30:03","week":13}

{"id":"d1l5pba","author":"1chemistdown","body":"Hi Colorado!!  I was born and raised there.  Miss it, but of course I'm biased.  \n\nIt is not too late to start over, and I recommend it.  I was over 21 when I started college and I do not regret it for one second.  Even got a Ph.D. but that is a story for another day.  I do have some recommendations for you, and I'm assuming that you're in Denver or close to that region.\n\n1.  I highly recommend getting that 22.5k up to 30k and placing that in savings.\n2.  I really recommend going to a community college to start.  You can take a night class--or two--to get yourself back into the swing of things.  Take stuff that is easy to start and counts towards the general requirements.\n3.  If it's been a while since you've taken calculus, I highly recommend taking that again.  A minor in math will go a long way in your CS degree.\n4.  If your goal in CS is to work for one of the big tech companies, which pay extremely well, you may consider going to a better program than CU.  Not that you cannot do well with their degree, but easier access will come from some other programs.  I believe WA and CA have some reciprocity programs with CO, but you need to check into this.  My information is dated.  That said, if you can go to UW or Berkeley they will feed you right into those fancy high paying tech companies.\n5. Check into grants and student loans.  Key word is **subsidized**\n7.  Work part time (many CS students at UW do simple spec work for various companies building apps at $50/hr while in school).  Live cheap and study hard.\n8.  Make sure you do internships at the best most prestigious company you can get into.  Try and do two summers of that (Sophomore/Junior).  Look into their requirements now so you know where you need to be at in order to apply for them and get them.  You need to be placed at Google, Amazon, Apple, FaceBook, etc. for at least one of the internships.  This will give you a leg up on get a position with one of these guys and that super high pay.\n\nA lot of people here in pf will tell you not to go into debt, but in this case you would be going into a field with a high earning potential.  I know for a fact that the top tech companies will pay you that well out of the gate, have signing bonuses and stock grants.  Again, you'll have to leave CO for that.","name":"t1_d1l5pba","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-01 02:11:48","week":13}

{"id":"d1l8u3i","author":"BobbyTrosclair","body":"I spoke with a seller support rep when they were rejecting numerous ASINs a couple of weeks ago. She said one of the biggest problems that is using up storage space and costing extra processing expenses is the \"Re-Inbound\" problem. Apparently, a lot of sellers remove their inventory just before the Long Term Storage Fee date, and then ship it back. Back last August, AMZ first initiated a longer hold period before they would accept previously removed items. It left the same amount of junk in their warehouses, they didn't get the LTS fees, and on top of that, it doubled the cost of in-bound processing (which is a big expense for Amazon, as the same loads of worthless crap have to be processed in again and again. That wasn't enough to free up space, so they are drastically increasing the wait time before sellers can ship it back.\n\nThere are some valid reasons to remove and re-ship items, as the AMZ rep told me, as many people who are selling seasonal/holiday items will remove them to avoid LTS fees and re-ship them just before the season. The October 1 date they cited would thus allow sellers of the two biggest holiday items - Christmas and Hallowe'en - to get their inventory back in while avoiding the fees.\n\nIt sounds like now, this is the new tech they are trying. I have to say I like it more than the ASIN inventory holds, as I have very few books that have more than one copy of an ASIN. I started removing really slow selling items. Like NeedleFishGarr, a lot of those were items I sent in before I got wise on the best ratio of sales price to sales rate. I'm creating a leaner, higher pay-off, faster turn-over inventory of books now, and I can see it in my biweekly payouts by Amazon.\n\nA month ago, I identified those older items that were unlikely to sell at the prices I had and changed them to clearance prices, cutting the price by half or more. A lot have started selling, and I'm making a little profit on those instead of destroying them or having them returned. I'll do another price drop soon, and those that haven't sold by April 30 will get removed. And, like dijital101 said, free boxes and air-packs!

{"id":"d1lzzde","author":"iPCV","body":"I don't think Amazon was ever a lowest price seller. It was just the lowest price if you account for 2 day shipping and hassle free returns/exchanges. They offer price match as a service if it is sold by Amazon.\n\nAlso, a lot of their products are sold by third party FBA so the price are set by individual sellers, basically eBay without bidding. That product you pointed to was sold by Flash Forge, so basically whoever runs Flash Forge is responding to you saying they don't want to price match. After that they probably realized they priced it too high so reduced it to be a bit more competitive.\n\nThe REAL question is, if you found it cheaper somewhere else, why don't you buy it there instead of expecting other sellers to price match your convenience?

{"id":"d1m0ume","author":"Jessie_James","body":"Amazon used to almost always have the lowest prices on just about everything I bought (mostly electronics, tools, etc).  I've been using them for a long time - easily ten years.  The shift in prices is just a slow progression for them to become more profitable IMO.  And that's fine, but I think many people may be lulled into a false sense of the prices still being the lowest all the time, which is no longer true.  That is where my suggestion to use a price comparison tool comes in.  I didn't even know these existed until last year.\n\n&gt; The REAL question is, if you found it cheaper somewhere else, why don't you buy it there\n\nSimple - I did!  I bought it from the eBay seller I showed.  However I *prefer* to buy from Amazon and their sellers simply due to their fantastic policies.  Prime shipping is also very nice.  I bought this on eBay, and it should show up some time next week, perhaps next Friday, which is slow compared to Prime shipping.  If I have any issues or want to return it the process *may* not be as easy and accommodating as Amazon and their sellers.\n\nIn short, Amazon offers convenience and speed, and is more trusted than many other stores - I know they will treat me right.  Therefore I prefer to use them when possible ... but not when the price is $200 more, even for a marketplace seller.","name":"t1_d1m0ume","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-01 19:38:39","week":13}

{"id":"d1mo92n","author":"ErroneousFunk","body":"Like other people have said, you haven't budgeted for entertainment, clothing, cosmetic/hygiene products (not everything comes from a grocery store), or... well, looking at my recent credit card bill, a very large part of what constitutes day-to-day living. \n\nAnother concern is the way you did the math on your student loan debt. You're currently paying $576/month in interest on an $80,000 principle. Because banks don't let you take out \"infinite year loans\" you are paying some amount of principal in the minimum payment. However, it kind of seems like you just did \"80000/2157\" and called it a day, unless there's some information you left out.\n\nI mean, I understand why you did the math the way you did, and this may actually work out in your favor, but it's a little concerning because you don't seem to be thinking very deeply about interest payments, or how that will work in the long run. I had some friends get into a huge financial trap where they were paying money into their 401K because it was pre-tax and employer matched (larger principle, less important over time), while not paying off a credit card with 18% interest (smaller principle, more important over time). They just didn't understand how they were screwing themselves over in a huge way by not understanding how principles and compound interest worked. You really need to get an intuitive sense for it. \n\nAlso, with the New Zealand vacation thing -- it's awesome that you went! Enjoy the memories :) Moving forward, try to get away from spending money because you feel like you'll regret not doing something, or \"it's a special once in a lifetime event\" Check out (literally! From a library if you can!) the \"The Millionaire Next Door\" for inspiration. I'm getting married in May and struggling with this right now. Our household income is $160-170k/year, and it's hard to not spend money when every 2 seconds there's some \"big once in a lifetime opportunity\" expense. I just realized today that no one cares if we have gift bags at our wedding :-p I spent hours planning them, and had hundreds of dollars worth of purchases all set to go in Amazon, I had convinced myself that it was a necessary thing, and I was like \"OMG, what am I doing!?\" We're also honeymooning via Amtrak. You can get a 2 week 8 trip ride pass for $450/person, and we're staying with relatives in different states along the way -- across the country and then back again! Definitely not the most glamorous vacation, but the stock market is having a sale right now and $1000 invested now is a few thousand down the road that could be used for more fun adventures! And, with your student loan debt, you get an automatic 6% \"growth rate\" on the money you put into it, simply because it's decreasing your debt!\n","name":"t1_d1mo92n","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-02 06:17:56","week":13}

{"id":"d1n8mqu","author":"NellucEcon","body":"Rents?  You didn't mention rents anywhere in the above post.  \n\nIn any case, where is the rent seeking in data mining?  You could argue that Facebook gets rents from network externalities, but it's not at all obvious that they get rents on information when many different firms compete to acquire information (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc), and when other firms can mine information from Facebook as well.  And if there are rents, then what is the appropriate policy prescription?  Surely it isn't to prevent Facebook from monetizing data.  Maybe it is to make that data more widely available?    \n\nIn any case, what I object to is the emotional tone of your argument.  Appropriately defined property rights lead to efficiency (Coase Theorem).  The government often defines property rights so as to improve efficiency, such as with pollution credits or patents.  These property rights aren't defined in terms of what people feel but in terms of what improves efficiency.  If a person invents something should he own patents on it indefinitely because it is his idea?  Or should we eliminate patent protection because nobody should own an idea?  Well, neither.  We choose patent duration (that is, the duration of exclusive property rights on an idea) to balance the deadweight loss of monopoly profits against the innovation these profits spur.  \n\nMake an argument that preventing Facebook from monetizing data will increase efficiency and then I will start taking you seriously.","name":"t1_d1n8mqu","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-04-02 20:57:47","week":13}

{"id":"d1nl9zs","author":"adamgalas","body":"After listening to the interview 2 things stood out especially strongly. \n\n1. The part where Baiju talks about how RH allows new investors to try out investing with $1,000 because \"even if you lose it all it's no worse than dropping your iPhone in the toilet\" was deeply disturbing. \n\nThat's because this implies that even Baiju assumes that most RH users would not be true investors (who accumulate shares over time to own a piece of a quality business for the long-term) but rather speculators/gamblers who will dabble in short-term swing trading. In fact the fact that he thinks some could lose 100% implies that he might be thinking about penny stocks in particular which are the absolute worst thing new investors could do. \n\nIf you have $1000 or even $100 the worst thing you could do as a new investor just learning the ropes is to \"throw your money away\" by gambling like this. \n\nEven a single share of Apple ($107) will still teach you the basics of investing and help you learn the most important habits of successful investing. \n\nSay you can only save $100-$200/month. Start with 1 share of Apple, since that's something Millennials are likely eager to follow anyway. \n\nThen build a watch list of quality companies you are interested in that you use (Peter Lynch's \"Buy What You Know\" principle) such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Under Armour, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Alphabet (ie new name for Google) ect. \n\nOR better yet learn about the amazing compounding power of dividend growth investing, which historically is the absolute BEST way to build long-term wealth. \n\nRH allows you to become incredibly diversified into quality blue chip dividend growth stocks such as Apple, Disney, Southwest, Visa, MasterCard, Starbucks, and Nike.\n\nThen as you learn about different industries and various investing principles you can keep diversifying, even a single share at a time. \n\nCase in point, my own \"Buy and Hold Forever\" Dividend Growth Portfolio is up to 58 high-quality names and counting! In fact by the time I'm done researching every dividend stock in America (been at this for years) I expect I'll be at 75-80! What's more, eventually I expect BWLD, PNRA, UA, GOOG, FB, and CMG to all pay dividends and I'll keep adding to my portfolio up to 200 holdings (The plan for this portfolio is to invest millions over decades and it should be worth $25+ million eventually)\n\n I'm far from a rich dude and if I wanted to keep my commissions down to 1% then to even buy a single position in each of them I'd need at least $30,000-$80,000 to do that. \n\nPLUS my investing plan is to follow a series of 4 strict \"add more if this happens\" rules with all my investable cash (so that I take advantage of market irrationalities and crashes to minimize cost basis and maximize yield and dividend income over time) so really I'd need $100,000+ to get started. \n\nRH evens the playing field by letting anyone with $100+ per month in savings to follow the same strategy used by the most successful investors in history. \n\nGiven enough time (50+ years) this means that almost anyone can become rich and financially independent. \n\nJust because you are starting off small doesn't mean you should ignore the most important aspects of real investing (patience, consistency, and staying calm when markets drop) and just think \"what the hell, its ONLY $100-$1000 so let's put it all on black and spin the roulette wheel!\"\n\nInvesting = gambling is the worst possible lesson RH could be teaching people. Most people already think Wall Street is a casino, one that's rigged in the big guy's favor. \n\nThat's not true at all and I'm worried that if RH gets even 10 million people to sign up, 90% of which gamble and lose and get the wrong ideas about investing and then quit, then they'll end up failing as a business because those people will stop using the app and destroy the business model. \n\n2. That being said, the services that RH is adding, such as instant, are immensely beneficial to real investors. \n\nCase in point: S&amp;P 500's average annual total returns since 1871 has been 9.1%. \n\nLet's say you use a low cost ETF that simply tracks the S&amp;P 500 and invest as much money as you possibly can each month (but you're poor so that's $100 per month) as soon as you can afford to while keeping costs to 2% (rule of thumb is always keep commissions to 2% or less). \n\nIf you use the cheapest \"normal broker\" Option house, which charges $5 per trade, then this means investing every 3 months, $250 at a time. \n\nNow say that you never improve your salary, and invest just $100/month (average) for 50 years, earning the historical return -2% or 7.0% (including ETF fees).\n\nAfter 50 years (so ending at age 70-75, around retirement age in the future) you'd have invested a total of $60,000. \n\nBUT the value of your portfolio would be $521,983.19! What's more that would be paying around 2.5% annual dividends or $13,049.57 per year ($1,087.46/month) in dividends!\n\nNot bad right? So even if Social Security goes completely bankrupt you should still not starve!\n\nBUT WAIT! What if you could completely avoid that $5 commission? It's only 2% of your money each time though, so how much of a difference could that make? \n\nWell with no commissions you'd actually earn 9% per year, which after 50 years would be worth $1,066,129.63! That's almost $550,000 extra! \n\nBetter yet your annual dividend income is now $26,653.24 or $2,221.10! More than double! \n\nFolks that's a modest pension, one that's not reliant on the government and available to every single American who can scrape together at least $100/month in savings!\n\nBUT WAIT! What if you're like most people and your income rises over time. Let's say that that you start investing at 25 and in your 20's you can only invest $100/month, $200 in your 30's, $300 in your 40's, $500 in your 50's, 600 in your 60's, and $700 in your 70's. \n\nHow much would you have by 75? \n\nIf you use a regular broker? $1,976,600 paying $49,400 in dividends per year. Sweet right? That's a comfortable retirement pretty much everywhere except Manhattan or San Francisco. \n\nUsing Robinhood and saving on commissions? $3,293,400! Paying $108,400 per year in dividends! \n\nHoly crap! That's actually enough to live in NYC or San Fran if you wanted too! \n\nPLUS remember that those are just dividends! They almost always increase every year (historically at double the rate of inflation) thus preserving your buying power AND keeping you from EVER running out of money even if you were to live forever!\n\nPLUS you never have to sell a single share! That means no capital gains taxes to Uncle Sam! AND if you die and leave that to your family? As long as the value of the portfolio value is $5.5 million (if you leave it to a single person) then there is no inheritance tax AND the person inheriting the shares NEVER HAS TO PAY A PENNY IN TAXES! \n\nThat's because the cost basis resets when they inherit it! So they could theoretically sell it all tax free and become rich OR better yet just hold onto the shares and the sweet, sweet dividend stream!\n\nHave more than $11 million? Split it in $5.5 million increments to all your kids, maybe their spouses, your friends, their kids, whatever! \n\nLeave it to 10 people and you can have a $55 million portfolio generating $1,375,0000 per year in dividends that you can give to 10 different of your favorite people (or give it all to charity, same sweet deal applies) and they pay $0. \n\nPLUS! Those dividends? They are taxes at either 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on the tax bracket that the person is in (bottom 2 brackets pay nothing, next 2 15%, top 1% pay 20%). \n\nME? Well since I know all this, have a great job writing dividend investment articles for The Motley Fool (where do you think I learned all this over the past 17 years;) AND have a plan to invest 60% of my gross pay ($5,000 per month) AND happen to know which companies are likely to generate long-term total returns of 12%-16% per year, AND my portfolio is designed to pay 3.5% dividends, then by the time I'm 80 I'm likely to have: \n\n$161.3 million - $721.6 million paying $5.6-$25.3 million in dividends on which I'll only have to pay $1.1 million to $5.1 million in taxes!\n\nSO yeah, I'm optimistic about my future as a future \"0.001%er\";)\n\nBUT I'm going to earn my money the right way, through patience, thrift, AND helping to teach the world to invest better so we can all be rich and live in a Star Trek like Utopia where all work is done by robots and everyone lives off their dividends and spends all their time doing whatever they want (studying, philosophy, art, various self improvement stuff, you know, self-actualization:)","name":"t1_d1nl9zs","subreddit":"RobinHood","subreddit_id":"t5_2uud8","created_utc":"2016-04-03 03:02:55","week":13}

{"id":"d1nsdo9","author":"zer0cul","body":"I can help with the credit interest problem.  Here is a guide to easing credit card problems that will only be helpful if you truly want to pay down your debt.  If you aren't dedicated it is a guide for ruining your future.\n\nBefore following these steps use the tax return to pay off the store cards and wait a month for that to be reflected on your credit report.  Put the extra $1200 left over in savings and don't touch it unless necessary.\n\nStep 1:  Apply for [either Citi Simplicity or Citi Diamond Preferred.](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/compare-credit-cards/citi.action?ID=balance-transfer-credit-cards)  They have a ridiculous 21 month 0% interest on balance transfers and purchases and 3% balance transfer fee.  You need to get at least a $6k credit limit.  If your credit limit is too low use your savings to pay some of your Amazon card.\n\nStep 2: Apply for Chase Slate (if you have fewer than 5 new lines of credit in the last 2 years).  The credit limit you get doesn't matter.  \n\nStep 3: Transfer the Chase Amazon balance to the Citi card. Call Chase and ask to transfer your credit limit from your Amazon card to your Chase Slate and close the Amazon card.  Or ideally keep it open with a tiny credit limit and never use it again, but probably just close it.\n\nStep 4: Transfer from the Discover to Chase Slate.  0% interest for 15 months and $0 balance transfer fee.\n\nStep 5 (Ongoing): Spending goes on Citi card. Divide your initial Citi Simplicity balance by 19 and make that **plus any new charges** payment each month for 19 months.  Divide your initial Slate balance by 13 and make that payment every month for 13 months.\n\nAs for student loans I suggest you track your progress.  I've kept a spreadsheet with my student loan and car payment totals and filling it in each month makes paying exciting.
