I've read that this is a popular choice amongst users here.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements, I need to have 12 transactions with my debit card. To do this, my plan was to just purchase 12 $0.50 Amazon gift cards over the course of the month, also an idea I picked up from pf.\n\nThe first two gift cards I purchased was fine. It showed up when I checked my account online that I had 2 transactions out of 12 to satisfy the requirement. However, I have since made several more purchases, and they have not showed up as additional transactions.\n\nThe recent purchases are not \"pending\", so that shouldn't be the problem, and I made sure on my Amazon account to uncheck the \"process as debit card\" in order to make it a PIN-less transaction.\n\nAny idea what is going on?

{"id":"4fcaup","author":"Tanooki60","body":"I'm about to make my first major beer money purchase. Just to be clear, I consider over $100 major in the eyes of beer money. If I hadn't found this site, I wouldn't of ever been able to make this purchase. I'll be purchasing an Xbox One (as soon as I get my gift card from my credit card company, which should be today). I would never of spent my own money on one, because I hardly play games anymore, but yet I still want one. Using beermoney was an easy way for me to get something I want, but can't justify spending money on. \n\nI started my beermoney journey on March 20th. Once you figure out the sites/apps that are worth your time, earning your beermoney is a breeze. Here is a list of sites/apps I've used, with proofs, to gain my beermoney (no referrals will be used):\n\n$65 - [Earnhoney](http://earnhoney.com/en): This was a majority of my beermoney income. I could of made much more, but there was a 2 week span where they were having issues, and it wasn't worth running Earnhoney at all. - [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/lCvCBld.png?1)\n\n$38 - [Perk](http://perk.com): I've just started using this more. I should of used it all along because I've been making about $5 a day with it. - [Proof, minus my $3 Perk Plastic](http://imgur.com/a/H1kjL)\n\n$25 ($30 Pending) - [G2Crowd](http://g2crowd.com): I work in IT, so this was pretty simple as well. There's a lot of software in there I've use, or have used. - [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/xtlSmhQ.png)\n\n$25 - [Swagbucks](http://swagbucks.com): This one is super easy, once you figure out which offers are worth it. A good place to watch is the SwagBucks facebook, and the SwagBucks sub reddit.\n\n$5 - Beermoney Amazon GC Winner - Won the GC on this sub. \n\n$5 - Random Amazon GC - I actually have absolutely no idea where I got this one from. All it said in it, was Congrats. I'm not going to turn down a free Giftcard, though.\n\nI supplemented the above beermoney with somethings that aren't truly considered beermoney. Mainly, redeeming my credit card points for a $100 Mastercard GC, and Amazon Mturk.\n\n$84.26 ($2.67 Pending) - [Mturk](http://mturk.com): I started this April 1st. This site does require some actual work. If your just starting out, the first thing I would do is try and get 100 HITS before you start trying to focus on the money. A good place to watch is the HitsWorthTurkingFor sub. - [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/hy73FLy.png)\n\nMy advice to anyone starting out with a beermoney journey: stick with it. It'll all come together in time. Find the things that are worth the time, and you don't mind doing.

{"id":"4fd73z","author":"cosmicjetlag","body":"EDIT: resolved. Small line of credit it is. Thanks!\n\nHey y'all.\n\nI'm 24, live in NYC, and was...not born into any financial goodness by any means. Like, my parents weren't able to co-sign for private student loans because their credit is so poor, that sort of thing. And before you say \"you should have gone to community college/state schools/not gone to college\" when I tell you my student debt, I will preface it with 1. even though my family is broke (mom schizophrenic and unable to be employed, father unemployed at the time, both with HUGE debts of their own), state schools were giving me NO aid whatsoever and the private school I went to actually was the cheapest...originally (long story); 2. I absolutely needed to get far away due to a very bad home environment (details upon request); and 3. I do not regret it for the world and would not take it back, ever, for any amount of theoretical money or glory, as it was exactly the place I needed to be, so bygones are bygones and I'm pleased with that decision to go where I did and when I did even if it did cost me...\n\n$80,000 when I graduated, combined federal and private. Having been lurking on this forum for several years, I know that people have a habit of berating choices like this, and if you're going to do that, please just don't, because it won't do anyone any good. I think and stress about this debt literally every day and I've got it down to about $75k almost three years out. I'm not paying the federal loans because PAYE, and I've got $320 or so a month in private that are bleeding me dry but I do pay. I've been accepted to and plan to attend a very prestigious program in Game Design, but I will have almost $200k in debt at the end of it because somehow nobody gives scholarship money to the poor gay female. That said, the high potential of a good salary after graduation very nearly outweighs that debt. Also, transferrable programming skills.\n\nOkay, great, now that we've got that out of the way, I've been looking into credit cards lately. My credit is not great (in the 600s, which is...slightly more than my rent), and I work about 25 hours a week for a tipshare job at $9/hr, though I do get about $150 in tipshare per paycheck. I AM LOOKING FOR OTHER JOBS. Sometimes I get to work a spot that gives me actual tips, but that never amounts to more than $75 or so. I have a lot of expenses, but I know people need credit, and honestly, I need a card because while I /can/ pay my expenses, the deadline sometimes comes before my paycheck, and I need that wiggle room. Nothing more. I know the horrors of credit card debt and will not be using it for much more than my utilities and occasional food (I'm likely going to be approved for SNAP in the next week or so). I did two years of AmeriCorps, which is another long story, and those two years asphyxiated my savings.\n\nExpenses, if needed:\n- 600/month rent\n- 80ish utilities, but I pay for EVERYONE in the house and they pay me back, so I need to have about $250 in my account at a time\n- 320 student loan\n- 116 transportation\n- 10.75 gym\n- 30 for pet expenses (food/insurance)\n- whatever's left for food/fun\n\nI've been denied for three credit cards in the past few months: the Amazon Rewards, Discover It, and Capital One Quicksilver. This seems to be, um, a cosmic sign that perhaps it would be a very bad idea to get a card. But I know that credit is necessary, and I'm scared I've missed my window to ever get one. Help? What would you suggest getting or doing? No credit card, as the fates seem to be telling me? Or a different one than the ones I've tried, which seem to be the ones with the highest rating and best bang for the buck?","name":"t3_4fd73z","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-18 20:12:54","week":16}

{"id":"4firu0","author":"-mrmr","body":"Hello everyone. Like a lot of college students (I'm at least told) I had a large impact on my credit score early on in college, except mine was in a hugely negative way.\n\nBack story: Freshman year of college I got an new, really nice (at the time) job with a high salary and I thought I was going to have it all 4 years of college. The problem was that 1) This job was a temporary position (I knew this at the time.) and 2) I was dumb. So while having this job, I opened up multiple credit cards (3), on top of the ones I already had that my parents opened up, and my student loans. After I lost that job (about 6 months after opening all those cards). I began falling behind on the payments, and then eventually they ended up being charged off, all while NOT telling my parents because I didn't want them to know that I had fucked up this badly (the main reason), and two because I didn't want them to worry about me because my mom was sick and they had their own problems. \n\nSo I currently now have a job again, that is not a temporary position, but I'm (probably obviously) more interested in fixing my credit/saving my money than I am spending it. \n\nNow that you have a backstory here where I am currently:\n\nCurrent monthly income: ~$1200\n\nI've moved back in with my parents, car is paid off, my only (current) monthly expenses other than whats below is Gas and Food. \n\nCurrent credit score(bad): Less than 550\n\nOpen accounts, but NOT negatively affect my credit (i think):\n\n* Federal Loan through FedLoan: 1sub stafford loan 2 unsub, total of $10,00 currently all in Forbearance\n\n* CitiCard Credit Card: balance of $1490, $1700 credit limit, paying ~$80 a month on it. (Parents opened/both paying.)\n\n* Macy's Card: Balance ~$80, $900 credit limit. (Parents opened/paying)\n\n* Lowes Card: Balance ~$500, $650 credit limit. (Parents opened/still paying.)\n\nNow the bad stuff,that IS negativity affecting my me  that I opened freshman year of college.\n\n* Barclays Credit Card: $2200 balance, $2400 limit. Charged Off.\n\n* Chase Credit Card: $1200 balance, $1200 limit. Charged Off.\n\n* Amazon Store Card: $1100 balance, $900 limit. Charged Off.\n\n* Sallie Mae Loan: $9700 balance, currently paying on time, but had a 120 day period where I didn't pay.\n\nAll the information above is gathered from my credit report. \n\nCurrent plan: \n\n* Start paying the FedLoan (currently in Forberance) Loans.\n\n* Stay on track with Sallie Mae Loan\n\n* Bring the balance of the Lowes card down to ~$100, over the next 3 months..\n\n* Bring balance of the CitiCard down to ~$700 over the next 3 months.\n\nThe main problem is, I don't know what to do about the cards that were Charged Off, and I need advice/help about dealing with them.\n\nI understand that I can't make them magically disappear and have my score go up, but i would at least like to be able to reach a point where I feel comfortable enough moving out and not worry about how my credit is going to affect where I can live to the extreme. \n\nI also understand that I am in a incredibly lucky position where I can fix this, which is why I need help taking advantage of the situation.\n\nThank you! I would be more than happy to give more information if needed.\n","name":"t3_4firu0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-19 19:42:02","week":16}

List has no car as we don't own one.\n\nAdditionally we spend around 1000EUR on Amazon/Ebay/Online monthly plus 500EUR in rented IT infrastructure (servers).\n\n7000EUR total, around 5k left.\n\nI store 2x1000EUR per month local on our bank accounts and 1000EUR on a foreign one, 1000EUR by a friend in cash and 1000EUR in cash at home for random spending.\n\nDoes this make some sense? Anything that urgently needs changing?\n\n\nAs for the future:\n\n* The plan for the freed 2.5k is the foreign account plus move the 2k local also there, our currency is not very strong/useful and EUR accounts are regulated, so i want to move as much as possible outside the control of our central bank/banks and legal system.\n\n* Amazon/etc spending will reduce once we have all stuff we wanted over the years (already hard to find stuff), we've set the budget flexible basically as luxury gift for now to have some fun.\n\n* I want a car, notably a Tesla, this offers us tax incentives and general low insurance cost, should i lease it, finance it or buy it outright after some months? What % down payment on first 2 options?\n\n* Should we store cash somewhere?

{"id":"4fk5da","author":"AcapellaMan","body":"So I'm at a point where my company is getting ready to launch pre-orders for a skateboard design. I've decided to do pre-orders so I do not have to front the capital and stock inventory. That being said I know there are going to be issues of cancelled orders etc. I have a few questions. \n\nWhat issues can i expect to run into with pre-ordering? \n\nI'm currently deciding to use [TryCelery.com](http://TryCelery.com) to accept pre-orders and payment since setting it up on our wordpress side would look plain with 1 product. I would rather use their site as a squeeze page. \n\nWhen it comes to fulfillment I'm looking at shipwire, fulfillrite, or a combination of Shipstation/Amazon with their new partnership. From my understanding you can link Shipstation with TryCelery and with Amazon as well. \n\nManufacturers are in the U.S and we will be shipping globally. From what it looks like shipping can run anywhere from 20$-80$ depending on the location. \n\nWhat are the best options for my situation, it seems like shipping is going to eat a lot into the margins on the board. From what it looks like shipwire seems to be the easiest &amp; most seamless alternative than to go the Amazon route. \n\nAnyone experienced with this that can chime in I'd greatly appreciate it. \n\nTL:DR I'm doing skateboard pre-orders and need to figure out a relatively cheap fulfillment option for international sales.","name":"t3_4fk5da","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-20 00:25:45","week":16}

{"id":"4fpekn","author":"sam88z","body":"Hi guys,\n\nI'm experiencing some pretty hectic days over here.\n\nFirst off, my apologies for the incoming wall of text, but I'd like to explain it as clear as possible.\n\nHere's the case: \n- Established a single member LLC in the US as a non-resident and started selling goods on Amazon, at the end of 2015.\n- Had a lot of trouble finding an accountant with experience in international taxes etc.\n- Did find a firm but as I am newbie with no profit up to this point, seemed they didn't have much interested in me and left me on the side for a few months (they postponed multiple 'meetings', didn't really answer emails or weren't available for calls,...)\n\nAlthough our first meeting was months ago, it was only now that they could tell me with 100% certainty that I would had pay  federal income tax in the US and not Belgium. \n\nAt this point I realize I had to take action and do some more research myself but I can't change the fact that because of all dead time that went by, I am now late with my filing and payment(if any as I not profitable as of yet) of the taxes. \n\nWhat I was wondering really, as I am a Belgian resident with an US LLC things get MUCH more complicated than it seemed at first hand.\nThe accounting firm just gave me a two possible outcomes/quotes that he still needs to figure out himself (sigh):\n\n- If there is no permanent establishment and no state nexus then he’ll probably charge me $3000 for the Federal protective tax return and treaty based return disclosure in this first year, and $1500-$2000 each year thereafter.\n\n- outcome 2: if there is no permanent establishment BUT a state nexus(which I'm guessing it is as I have physical products stored in Amazon's warehouses), then this would immediately means a fee of AT LEAST $8000.\n\nHere was the full email that the collegue sent to my accountant in regard to getting my single member LLC's administration in check:\n\n\"I think that a short memo outlining the key US Federal income tax issues (including an introduction to State taxation) should cost approximately $3,500.  That assumes that the enterprise will undoubtedly constitute a permanent establishment. If this is not a clear case and we need to analyze whether or not the LLC constitutes a PE, the fee should increase by $2,500.  We should also review whether the LLC creates a taxable presence (“nexus”) in particular States (be it for State income tax or for sales &amp; use tax purposes).  The fee for an in-depth State nexus analysis would need to be discussed with our State &amp; local tax (SALT) team.\n \nI don’t think that we can hand out an “off-the-shelf” memo for free.  But given the size of the operation, I can see how our fees are problematic for such a small business.  Perhaps we can have a phone call (including myself and a SALT person) to outline the issues and risks (in lieu of write-ups).\n \nGoing forward, I would anticipate tax compliance costs to be as follows:\n \nAlternative 1: no PE in the US, no State nexus\n \n1.    Federal protective tax return and treaty based return disclosure: $3,000 in year 1; $1,500-2,000 in subsequent years\n \nAlternative 2: no PE in the US, but State tax nexus (incl sales/use and income tax)\n \n1.    Federal protective tax return and treaty based return disclosure: $3,000 in year 1; $1,500-2,000 in subsequent years\n2.    Pro-forma Federal tax return (as basis to determine Federal taxable income for State tax purposes: $3,000 - $4,000\n3.    State income tax returns: $800 - $1,000 per State\n4.    State sales &amp; use tax compliance: TBD\n \nAlternative 3: PE in the US\n \n1.    Federal tax return: $3,000 - $4,000\n2.    State income tax returns: $800 - $1,000 per State\n3.    State sales &amp; use tax compliance: TBD\n\nBest regards\"\n\n\nFor those who were in a similar case or those who have some knowledge on this matter, are these standard fees to pay?\nOver the past few months I’ve spoken to a few LLC owners and none of them ever mentioned something of this scale.\n\nAgain, my apologies for this wall of text, but I would be any of you kind enough to respond, forever grateful!\n\nPS: I finally get to meet him again on friday but wanted to check if there were any of guys that could verify this info, at least in some way.","name":"t3_4fpekn","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-20 22:34:07","week":16}

{"id":"4fuzwk","author":"OohImTellingMom","body":"I'm kind of new to Reddit and love this sub. Most of the people that post here seem to have genuinely good intentions and are looking to help others. I thought I'd pitch my 2 cents and hopefully someone will get something useful from it. I just wanted to share what I have learned and some of the \"tips and tricks\" I use personally with my own finances. \n\nThis is not meant to be an exhaustive list and some of it may be repetitive, just wanted contribute. I apologize in advance if this is not the correct sub, or if it's redundant.\n\nThis is gonna be a long post and open discussion is welcomed. I'd love to hear any tricks you know, as well.\n\n**1 - General Personal Finances (Budgeting stuff).**\n\nEdited due to feedback.\n\n**Learn to ~~balance a checkbook~~ reconcile your accounts -** Seriously, even if you are completely electronic, learn how to balance your account. I worked for almost 5 years in the banking industry. Your bank may seem to be made of magic and everything is available to you online at all times, the truth is an enormous amount of human work is done behind the scenes. You wouldn't believe some of the breath-taking mistakes I witnessed working in this industry. This is your money, keep track of it.\n\n**Pay your bills, on-time, all the time -** This may seem like a no-brainer, but I know full grown adults who still play the \"I'll just pay such and such bill later so I can buy Witcher 12 right now.\" game. Pay all of your bills by or before their due date, period. This will save you so much headache, especially when you find out your bank or utility company (always after they have already nailed you) has a fee buried 25 pages in from their terms and conditions. You agreed to the terms, you owe the fee.\n\n**Keep track of how much you owe, to where -** Keep a record of every credit card, student loan, personal loan, everything you pay on a scheduled basis. Know the interest rates and all of your minimum payments. I keep a spreadsheet on my Google Drive. It doesn't have to have anything other than the credit limit, the amount owed and your payment information. **No account numbers, ever.**\n\n**Banks and money based companies are NOT your friend -** They are institutions whose sole purpose is to make money, nothing more. I don't care how much lipstick the put on that pig, they are there for your money, be defensive of your money. And stay well away from those \"You've been pre-appoved for $5000.00 right now\" scams. They usually have interest rates well into the 100% range. Same goes for the paycheck advance businesses, you will always lose. Even if you can pay it back on-time, you pay way too much in interest.\n\n**Bank with a local Credit Union -** If you can qualify for membership, do it. They almost always have better interest rates on just about every product they offer. The ones I have dealt with over the years also generally have fewer/lower fees and are more open to helping you if you run into trouble. I double-dog dare you to try and get Wells Fargo to reverse a fee, triple-dog even.\n\nEdit from /u/AmoebaNot: With regards to interest rates. If you are going to shop for a large purchase (car or something along those lines) shop interest rates with your bank or credit union so you don't get stuck with a higher interest rate. Some vendors may have financing deals with certain lenders and you may not be getting the best rate. A pre-approval letter is also a bulletproof way to be sure you're getting the most bang for your buck on large purchases.\n\n**Have and MAINTAIN an emergency fund -** Even if it's only $200. Anyone that has had a tire blowout between paychecks knows that if they just had that extra $50 bucks... Set a limit that is reasonable for you and keep it there. Only touch this money when you REALLY need it.\n\n**Keep your creditors hands out of your pockets -** Setup and use your banks billpay service. You send the money to them, don't let them pull it from you. Take the time to set this up, trust me, it's one less thing you have to remember once it's done. I spend all of 5 minutes working on my bills a month. You will only have to change the amounts on bills that aren't the same amount from month-to-month if you do it right. By doing this, you have absolute control over where and when your money goes. It also means they can't continue to pull money from you when you have paid the bill off, which they can and will do.  \n\nEdit from /u/koksnot (oh, reddit...): Make sure you check your billpay occasionally to be sure that payments are being sent and received as you expect them. \n\nAlso, Federal Banking Regulation DD allows banking institutions to charge overdraft fees for any automatic recurring debit or credit card transactions. **Even if you have opted out of overdraft protection.**\n\n**Change your damn banking password -** Use password1234 for Facebook and let it rot. If you have ANY stored financial information on ANY (yes, including Steam) site, you should be changing your password AT LEAST every 90 days. You would be very wise to also do this with any email account(s) associated with those sites. I have a dedicated gmail account that is used solely for my banking and money accounts, which keeps everything in one easy to access place. \n\nThis is a MUCH smaller headache to deal with than if you ever get compromised. I don't care what claims the bank makes about identity theft protection and your accountability for fraudulent charges, they will fight and you will cry. Somewhere buried in the terms and conditions is a term or condition you didn't satisfy, their lawyers are smarter than you.\n\n**EDIT:** This section is causing a lot of dissent, and I'm going to be a bit blunt here. **The main message being expressed here is to be diligent in protecting your financial information, pick and choose your method according to what makes you comfortable.** MFA, Two-Factor and password managers are great, no argument there. However, even Wells Fargo does not offer MFA, neither does BoFA (at least not on my CC with them). Telling people to only bank with a bank that offers this severely limits banking options. Banks that even claim to have MFA fail miserably by only offering two or three different screens with a picture or security question. \n\nPasswords are the defacto login method and have been since the dawn of the internet. Additionally, this wasn't ONLY meant to address banks, my Amazon account relies on simple username and password authentcation. Password security is a base tenet of IT (my professional field). **There is a lot of back and forth in this thread regarding this topic, proceed with caution.**\n\n**Specifically regarding password managers -** Yes, they are great, and a very secure option. They can also be very confusing to use if you are not technically apt. Additionally, they can cost money if more than one person in your house accesses your accounts, say, your wife or girlfriend.\n\nOverall, most of the people who will read this are your everyday guy and gal who still use good ole simple usernames and passwords to access their online accounts. Seriously.\n\n\n\n**2 - Your Credit and You.**\n\nImportant sites:\n\n* https://www.ftc.gov (download and become familiar with this [PDF](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/fair-debt-collection-practices-act.pdf)).\n \n* http://www.consumerfinance.gov\n \n* https://www.annualcreditreport.com\n \n* [Experian Online Disputes](http://www.experian.com/disputes/main.html)\n \n* [TransUnion Online Disputes](https://onlinedispute.transunion.com/disputewizard/)\n \n* [Equifax Online Disputes](https://www.ai.equifax.com/CreditInvestigation/home.action)\n\n\n\n**Know what your credit looks like -** Having bad credit puts the brakes on a lot of the things you can do in this world, including employment in some cases. No credit can be worse than bad credit, so you need to build at least some. \n\nPull your credit reports at least once a year and make sure that the information on all three bureaus is 100% accurate. Annual Credit Report is a government sponsored/endorsed site that allows you one free pull a year from all three agencies without having to sign up for BS monitoring services. If you need someone else to keep an eye on your credit reports for you, you are too out of touch with your credit. Do not rely on sites like Credit Karma solely either, be interactive with your credit.\n\n**Don't sign-up for BS monitoring services -** Seriously, they're a joke and reactive, not proactive. You should be keeping a close eye on your reports yourself. If you dispute a credit item, are turned down for credit or have a hard hit inquiry done (buying a car or applying for a credit card) you get a free report from all of the bureaus. This is a Federal reg, they are required to do this without the BS monitoring service.\n\n**Collection agencies (long and fun) -** I rebuilt my credit from a mid 300 score to over 800, most of which was all my fault (collections, etc.). The following isn't just what I have read, I have done this. \n\nYou are allowed to take exactly one single call from them, no more. In this call, you will repeat one single mantra only and then you will ignore them. Practice this in the mirror if you have to, \"You must send me verification of the debt.\" Verification of the debt is the exact term you want to use. Even if you KNOW you owe the money, you ONLY say that. The burden of proof is on the collector, not you. Verification of the debt is NOT the letter that they will send you telling you that they have the account. They must provide a signed contract from the ORIGINAL creditor to prove the debt. This is federal law (the PDF and site linked above) and if they try to lie or fake it, they are in a world of shit.\n\nThey will ask you to provide your address, etc. This is a tactic to keep you on the phone and get you talking. They have your address, trust me.  They are trying to get you to say that you owe the money and/or want to pay it. Credit debt has statues of limitations and what is called \"Tolling\". If you admit to the debt or say that you want to repay it, you're done. If you are outside of the statute of limitation, you have just reset the counter and are on the hook for the debt. This is Tolling, they can then pester you and even sue you for the money.\n\nEven if you know you owe the debt, they cannot proceed until they have provided you with the verification, which MUST be done in writing. You'd be surprised just how unorganized collection agencies are. \n\nIf they can and do provide you with the verification, get a lawyer. I know, you can't afford one right? Wrong, most lawyers have a flat, usually reasonable, fee for dealing with collectors. I use a pre-paid legal service which costs me like $15 bucks a month. Seriously, get a lawyer. You really don't know what you don't know in this situation. A lawyer can usually also help to get you a much lower settlement if it comes to that. Get a lawyer.\n\nBe aware, they can still report you, but you can dispute it siting lack of verification. 90% of the time it will be removed. I have played this game and know it very well. I was not the best with my money when I was younger and did some stupid, stupid things.\n\nI was going to go into credit cards and auto loans, but this is probably long enough. I'm more than happy to post that if you all would like, as well. Hopefully, this will be helpful to some of you. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.\n\nCheers and thanks for the fish!","name":"t3_4fuzwk","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-21 22:37:12","week":16}

Other than the battery life, it is in top-notch condition. No scratches, cracks, what-have-you. But of course, my first instinct when it started dying way too fast was \"Well, the battery is sealed in, so I suppose I'll have to buy a new phone now.\" \n\nThen I came across this article. Instead of hitting Amazon for the phone I was eyeballing, I decided to Google for \"Replacing Nexus 5 cell phone battery\" instead. And it turns out that for about $20 + free Prime shipping, I was able to get a new battery, which is then stupidly easy to plop into my cell phone with ten minutes of work.\n\nFor about 1/10 what I was going to pay for a brand new phone, I essentially just extended the life of my existing device by another year or two.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/technology/personaltech/choosing-to-skipthe-upgrade-and-care-for-the-gadget-youve-got.html?_r=0\n\nAmazing how much a simple search about fixing things yourself might save you.","name":"t3_4fvfv4","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-22 00:14:41","week":16}

{"id":"4fwl64","author":"PayingForMania","body":"So this happened.  I learned a few months after my roommates left that they'd left behind a gift.  They are substantial in the vacant room which contains no furniture I wish to keep, and there are at least a few in my bedroom.  I worry that they may now be elsewhere in the house as well.  \n\nI understand that calling an exterminator can be exceptionally expensive for this problem, and I'm broke.  I simply don't have access to more than $300-400 for this problem, unless I put off dealing with it by a month or more.  I'm wondering if I can get away with buying some supplies online and doing it myself.  \n\nI know to do the bag on my mattress, I ordered one on Amazon and it's arrived.  But I'm waiting to do the next steps before I put it on.  (I'm sleeping in yet another spare bedroom that doesn't seem to have any.)  I attempted to buy a cheap steam cleaner on Amazon, but after trying it it doesn't seem beefy enough for the task to I'm going to send it back and maybe just rent an industrial model instead.  I also ordered this oven thing for books and electronics - it's like a giant pizza warmer looking thing that heats everything inside to sauna temperatures, which kills the bugs.  But it's not big enough for furniture.  So I have to steam clean everything.  The local rental shop has them for $55 a day. \n\nAdding it up, it comes to about $300 in supplies and rental equipment to do it myself.  That's cheaper than what I would expect from hiring someone, but I'm not sure that it's really worth cheaping out on this.  Has anyone here had a bed bug infestation?  What would you recommend to try and save money on the problem?","name":"t3_4fwl64","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-22 04:51:34","week":16}

{"id":"4fyuju","author":"CantPowerTool","body":"I’m 28, currently working for a good company making a decent salary and I’m getting some pressure from friends and family to buy a house in the area asap. I feel like I’m not quite ready to buy yet, and what I’m looking for advice on is the idea that if I wait, I’m losing out on things (money, equity, home-for-the-price, etc).\n\nFor a little history, I graduated college in Dec of 2012, and I’ve been working for the company I’m currently with for about 3 years. We’re in Austin Texas. I got hired on at 40k salary, and have worked my way up to a current 59k salary. I’m putting 8.5% into a 401k, but have zero savings to speak of. I graduated with 36k in student debt and that’s down to 17k or so and it’s more or less what I’m working on. My take home, right now, is $3,194.00 every 2 weeks, so in July and Dec I get a 3rd paycheck. I’m doing well in my company, and the company is growing so I see staying where I am or going up over the next few years. I doubt I’ll get demoted or fired any time soon, but you never know with life.\n\nFor locals, the rent and buy prices in Austin stood very well over the housing crisis, and now in 2016 it’s on a pretty steep climb with rent in North Austin getting higher and higher. 1 year ago when pricing 2 bedroom apartments most places under $1100 a month where shitty, in bad neighborhoods, old, had bad layouts, etc. If your apartment was ‘nice, for student living’ it was $1100-1400 and ‘nice’ looking places were $1400-2000. I put in some hard work looking at places and found an awesome place for the money. Currently I’m paying $575 for rent + $100-150 for utilities depending on the time of year. I have a few sub $20 payments, like Netflix, rental insurance, and Amazon Prime. Phone is $55. No car payment, just maintenance. My biggest cost right now is food, I’m working on that.\n\nOn to the request for advice: \n\nI’m able to save say $500 – 1500 a month right now and in the last few months/years have gotten my loans down and also eliminated my credit card debt. I’m about to make a big repair on my car, estimated $3k so my ‘savings’ is about to be used. IF I end up buying a home soon, I’ll be very cash poor, and will more or less rely on the ability to rent 1-2 rooms to afford the mortgage. In my view, this means I’m not ready even though I think I could most likely work it out and have a very likely 1-2 room renter already. Here’s what friends and family are saying: 1) you make too much money not to own a home. And 2) you’re going to miss out if you wait.\n\nOne of the things people say to me is that the mortgage rates will increase at the election late this year, so now is the lowest interest rates I’ll see in a long time. The other thing is that there is a USDA loan available for a nearby area I’m looking at which requires zero down payment. I’ll have the normal PMI until 20% is paid, and there are a few caveats but the point is it’s an avenue through which I could get a house without a down payment saved up.\nSo, in realist terms can you folks help me determine what I’d miss out on and how much I’ll lose by waiting a year or two? If interest rates go up 1% - how much less home can I realistically afford? What about 2% increase? Does anybody have some secret-sauce insider info that the Central Texas area is going to continue to balloon?\n\nI’m a little worried that I might price myself out of living in the area, I more or less cannot afford the Austin zip code as it is, with the shittiest / smallest homes going for $200k. Decent 20-30 year old homes are $200-300k and ‘moderately nice’ neighborhoods are $300-500k. ‘rich’ places are $600-1m in Austin. I’m approved for $220k by myself. So, Reddit, am I right to feel like I’m not ready yet? Are they right in that I’ll be missing out if I wait? If so, how much am I loosing for waiting? Thanks in advance for any helpful thoughts and advice.\n\nEDIT: Fixed PMI, don't know what my fingers were thinking.\n","name":"t3_4fyuju","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-22 17:06:20","week":16}

We’ve converted your balance over at a 1:1 ratio, so you aren’t losing anything! If you had $3 of credit before, you can still redeem for a $3 Amazon gift card today. You also earn the same amount for each ad you watch.\n\n&gt;We’re offering exciting and new redemption options — including gift cards from Steam, Target, and iTunes. We’ve been running polls over the past several weeks to get your feedback on what other options you’d like to see, and we’ll continue to explore additional redemption options as we can get agreements in place!\n\n&gt;Many of you send us notes or post on our Facebook wall with your insightful feedback. We’ve heard one thing loud and clear: you want additional ways to earn. Starting today, you can now earn extra NADApoints by completing offers. These offers vary — many require nothing more than your email address. Best of all, the points you earn from completing offers don’t count against your daily limit!\n\n&gt;Finally, a quick update on our free cell phone service! We’ve just received our first test phone activated on the NADAmobile network. This process has taken much longer than we anticipated, but we’re looking forward to the day that we’ll be able to activate your free service.\n\nI'm hoping they don't turn it to crap. ~~Currently there is no way to redeem you points or earn with the site being \"down\".~~\n\n*EDIT: They are back up.","name":"t3_4fzovd","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-22 20:06:01","week":16}

{"id":"4g0arb","author":"destinednomads","body":"Greetings!,\n\n    We are 23 year old high-school sweethearts from Northern California who love to travel and work for ourselves. To accomplish this we have been generating revenue by “flipping” part-time, using Amazon and eBay for a few years now. By researching the best “flipping” techniques and modern online business strategies, and then applying that knowledge along with our current, ever evolving experience in this field, we are able to turn decent profits from home. Our goal is to be living on the road, and traveling the country full-time in a camper van by this summer. We plan to continue sourcing for FBA during our travels, however because of the limited space constraints of our camper van, we will no longer be able to flip anything that doesn’t fit the FBA profile (i.e.: used shoes, clothes, antique goods, etc…), this is where you come in!!!\n\n        We are looking to team-up/partner-with you if you have interest in receiving more inventory to flip via whichever platform you prefer. Whether you are short on time, short on transportation, or have a lack of reliable local resources from which to source product, we envision our partner(s) having at least some experience and most importantly, having consistency, dedication, as well as the cooperative skills necessary for this collaberation to become a successful business venture. Whether you are a part-time flipper (like we are) juggling two jobs and/or other responsibilities, or a full time flipper, you may have the need for more inventory and either lack the time to allocate to sourcing for your business, and/or live in a sourcing “desert”, etc…\n\n        Our idea is that by collaborating, we can help to be at least one of your sourcing solutions! Upon finding the best suited partner(s), we will setup a partnership in which, essentially, we will act as a mobile resource, sourcing inventory (customized based upon the types of products YOU like to flip). During the entire process, we will keep in close contact with you to ensure everything runs smoothly. I understand it will take some hard work to setup a good system that works for us both, but it is something we are willing to put our best efforts towards so that perfectly good and profitable inventory will not get left behind! \n\n       If you are a flipper and think this opportunity is something that could work for you/us, and are interested in hashing out the details or have questions (suggestions even), please reply so that we can discuss it further!\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n- Andrew &amp; Chelsea","name":"t3_4g0arb","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-22 22:18:20","week":16}

{"id":"4g0sqb","author":"Cabooseaholic","body":"(This post is from a question I asked in r/pcmasterace. I was told to post here for better anwsers)\n\n\nHello! I made a post a few days ago wondering if I should buy a Pc from maingear. Most, if not all the comments sadi teh same; build my own, but I wanted to go into more detail about why I wanted it to buy it like that.\n\n\nFirst let me clarify; I have built my own PC's in the past. I love, love, LOVE building my own PC's. I know that feeling, after many hours of taking careful steps into building you beast, when you power it on for the first time. But, this time is a bit different.\n\n\nJust joined the military and got my first credit card ever (U.S Navy Federal Credit Union). Got it just in case of emergency but also to build credit. I want / need a really good PC, and a way to reward myself for getting out of BMT and, in a few months, tech school. I would usually buy the parts and build it myself but I wanted to take advantage of the credit card without going crazy.\n\n\nI plan on buying all the parts form one place. I plan on getting a $5-6000 PC. I actually want to make payments on it rather than paying for it all at once. I would use my credit card to make payments and pay off the credit card each month. I know the thing is to pay 150% more than the minimum, which is what I plan on doing. This way I can get the PC and make payments.\nI choose Maingear mostly as an example, but also because I know they offer a plan to make payments. If there is a better place to buy a PC like this, please let me know and I'll take it into consideration.\n\n\nAlso, I want to get a water cooled system. I know people say build it yourself, but I say NOW WAY to that. If it was cheaper, yes, but not with a build this expensive. I'll leave it to the company.\n\n\nOf course, I can try to buy all the parts from a single source (Newegg, Amazon, etc.) and make payments to them a month and pay someone else to build the system I want. But I don't know about that either.\n\n\nSo what should I do? Should I just wing it and build it, guy it pre-built from a company or buy the parts and let a computer store or someone build it?\n\n\nThank you","name":"t3_4g0sqb","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-23 00:15:01","week":16}

{"id":"4g5beh","author":"Epic_MC","body":"WARNING: This method is mostly passive but it will take a while before it pays off. This is also a theory as I have not achieved level 7 myself. **It is also iOS only**\n\n\nWhat is Scratchy? Scratchy is a mobile app that gives you free scratch tickets every day for gift cards or points. However, the scratch tickets almost never give out gift cards. Another way to get gift cards is by using points. Points are earned by scratching tickets (1 point per ticket) or winning on a silver ticket which gives you 5 points.\n\n\nIn the app, you get 10 scratch tickets per day to start. You accumulate points which level you up after you get a certain amount. After each level up you get an additional 5 scratches per day.\n\nThe levels are:\n\nLvl 2 - 100 points \n\nLvl 3 - 500 points\n\nLvl 4 - 1000 points\n\nLvl 5 - 2000 points\n\nLvl 6 - 3000 points\n\nLvl 7 - 4000 points\n\n\nSo how are you going to make money with this? You can exchange 500 points for a $5 Amazon gift card. At level seven you get 40 scratches per day, and if you get one point from each it will take about 12.5 days to earn that 500 points.\n\n\nBut 4000 points is obviously a lot and will take time to get to. There are also \"streaks\" that can help you get more points if you play every day. A 15 day streak gives you 15 points, 30 days gives you 100 and 100 days gives you 500. I'm not sure what the bonuses are after that.\n\n\nSo if you start at level 1 getting ten scratches per day, it will take you 10 days to get to level 2. On level 2 you get 15 per day, so it would take about 27 days to get level 3. On level 3 you get 20/day and it would take 25 days to level up. Level four takes about 40 days to get to 5, level 5 takes about 33 days, and level six about 29.\n\n\n10+27+25+40+33+29= 164 days or about 5.5 months. So it will take a long time before this method will start paying off and keep in mind this does not include the streak bonuses so if you play every day you will shave off some time. \n\n\nAgain, I am only on level 2 so at this point it is just a theory but I'm almost positive this will pay off in the end. It really doesn't take much time to get all your scratches done for the day so it's worth a shot to try. I scratch them on my break at work or when I'm watching TV. If you liked this method and sign up after reading I would appreciate if you use my promo code when signing up, **COOPER6597**. You will get a bonus 3 points and I will get 15 when you reach level 2. Feel free to start a ref train as well :)\n\n\nApp Store Link - https://appsto.re/us/A12N6.i","name":"t3_4g5beh","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-23 23:14:50","week":16}

I didn't even know and there are like five days of overdraft fees. Luckly that is only $25 and the negative balance as of this moment is $39. Annoying but not a huge deal.\n\nI have some kind of identity issue with paypal where I can't load money to the account but my sister sent me some from her account so I was able to transfer $50 from paypal to the bank account but it says it will take several days.\n\nThe problem is that I am far away, otherwise I could just go to the bank and give them money.\n\nSo being the weekend I cannot get a hold of them which is my real dilemma.

{"id":"d26y2d6","author":"MylesMDT","body":"Not really.  A good Arkansas stone can set you back $10-$100, depending on size, grit, and quality.  That $10 job isn't even big enough to properly sharpen a pen knife.  Anything useful for kitchen knives is going to be at least in $30-$40 range.  More likely $60+.  \n\nAnd to properly sharpen a knife is not something than someone with zero skill is going to do.  It takes training and lots of practice to do it efficiently and well.\n\nAnybody *can* learn how to do it, but it's not a zero skill task.\n\nMost amateurs will ruin the bevel of a perfectly fine blade before they properly sharpen it.\n\nThere are three points to sharpening a knife.\n\nCut the bevel correctly to match the factory angle.\n\nSharpen the blade on the bevel without cutting into it or removing an excess of metal, deforming the overall profile.  (ie. concave edges)\n\nHone the edge to refine the perfect alignment.\n\nAll three of these tasks require entirely different tools and techniques.\n\nThe frugal method?  Have a friend who knows knives teach you.  Or have that friend sharpen them. Or buy a cheap carbide tool to recut your bevel every time, and skip the sharpening/honing steps.  If you are already using cheap knives, there is nothing of value lost.\n\nEDIT:  People overstress that carbide tools remove too much steel.  I happen to have knives that have been carbide cut for decades.  They are still fine.  In fact, I still use them at work.  In a commercial kitchen and at home.  If you screw up your blade profile, that's a different story.  That knife with a kris like curve is now trash.\n\nOh, and how are sharpening stones hard to find?  They are ridiculously easy to find.  Go to your hardware store, kitchen supply store, Walmart, Amazon, etc. ","name":"t1_d26y2d6","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-18 02:39:25","week":16}

{"id":"d273bny","author":"oceanalwayswins","body":"Hey, sorry for the delay! I often read replies as I'm taking care of my twins, and then later accidentally forget to reply.\n\nMen's clothing has changed quite a bit. I learned most of what I know from my mom who has casually flipped since I was a kid. I often find myself seeing brands I used to find with her, then I get excited until I realize that it's not worth the trouble anymore. Tommy Bahama is a major one that comes to mind. Their silk camp shirts used to sell for an easy $40-50, now you are lucky to get $20. Unfortunately, I end up looking things up as I go when it comes to men's. I mostly do women's, because I'm more familiar with brands. I strongly recommend typing in brands on eBay and filtering for sold listings. Try browsing websites like Nordstroms and look up their brands. When you are shopping, learn to recognize quality. Such as fabrics, stitching, etc. If you know it's a brand that came from Kohls or Macy's, it's not worth your time. I always grab what I think is good, throw it in my cart, and research sold prices on eBay before I go to pay. Yes, that often leads to finding a couch and looking up 50 things. But I've found that is my quickest and easiest way.\n\nI hate poly bags.... I used them more until I bought myself a vintage scarf on eBay. It arrived to me in shreds... Probably got caught up on a belt in the post office. I prefer bubble mailers. I get them on Amazon. They are more expensive, but with eBay shipping discounts, I feel like I get my money back. Also, this way I can just fold up the item and shove it in. Most shirts go this way first class. Anything heavier, like pants or jeans, I use a padded flat rate priority mailer. Same concept. Anything bigger goes in a priority mail box, typically medium flat rate or the non flat rate that is about the same size.\n\nNot sure about Plato's closet.... It's been several years since I went. I once took in some of my own clothes to sell, and I walked away disgusted at what they paid me. I wouldn't bother. I only buy clothing that I know I can flip for a minimum of $25 on the low end. My sweet spot is $30-40. For the $25-40 range, I pay $2-6 max per item. I like to keep profit margins as high as possible to make it worth my time. No sense in paying $6 for a pair of jeans I'll only sell for $20, you know? \n\nAs a girl, women's comes much more naturally to me of course. I haven't had issues but other people claim women are more picky and make more returns. In thrift stores I've noticed that in general men's clothing is usually in better shape. As in less items on the rack are worn or damaged. If you're a guy, start with men's... And vice versa. Even if it's just dress shirts. Or shoes. Pick like 2 areas to master then slowly branch out. It's hard to cover all areas when you first start out.","name":"t1_d273bny","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-18 05:04:28","week":16}

You got to maintain the thing which most people just don't know how to do or don't care to spend the time doing.\n\nShopify is easier for most people, assuming you don't have special requirements. I have a dropship site with Shopify but I also have Wordpress/Woocommerce installed on another because it has more specialized needs. Syncing with Amazon FBA inventory automatically isn't something Shopify does for any budget I considered reasonable since 95% of sales are direct from Amazon anyway.\n\nShopify is pretty much a set and forget system for me. It runs itself, orders come in, I process the order, simple. Wordpress/Woocommerce while much better than it was years ago still has it's quirks. The plugins don't always work correctly, updates sometimes screw things up, etc. I got to make sure the server isn't being DDoS attacked and such, got to keep the hackers and bots at bay, etc. For most people, and it's why people recommend Shopify, doing the maintenance on a \"free\" platform just isn't worth it. You'll save yourself the headache, unless you have special requirements that Shopify doesn't do then well you're probably stuck using something else.","name":"t1_d27cs6x","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-18 12:28:00","week":16}

I used to order from Amazon a lot but the last year it was mainly just over the holiday season. Think a lot of retailers have stepped up their game to do sales or match Amazon. I live an Amazon taxes area so I don't get that extra discount anymore. I'll just renew November and December for a month. If there is anything that I want on other months I'll just pay 10.99 and perhaps see if there is anything else I want to order. I think I'll probably have it 3-4 months out of the year that way. \n\nI have yet to care for any of the Amazon Originals. Thought Man in High Castle was okay but half way through I was just watching it to get it over with.Then I tried Mozart in the Jungle and Betas for a few episodes. I've yet to watch Transparent but should be there if I renew later. I don't use the Kindle library or Amazon MP3s beside sometimes I tell my Echo to play music and it finds a prime station. I can do without that.\n\nI used to get my games and new blurays from them but lately Wal-Mart.com has been beatingthem  when it comes to some dvd/bluray preorder prices plus they have that instant watch where I can view it on VUDU after buying and watch it early. Now I get my games at Best Buy because the Gamer's club 20% off new titles. Amazon finally does that too but I don't have to wait on my postman to bring the game to me plus I get those Reward points.

{"id":"d27yqac","author":"MrSolutionFinder","body":"It's how many people get started, however IMO eBay is kind of like a drug. It's easy to start and hard to pull away because eBay gets you the sales easily. The other problem being eBay takes a cut to provide what's basically advertising service, so instead of having a budget to advertise chances are you'll be paying that to eBay. It leave little money to go on your own at a later point.\n\neBay is an easy way to get sales but it's a hard way to build a brand. I can prove it with one simple question, without looking it up what was the name of the last business you purchased from on eBay? You don't know right? Neither does anyone else. They know it came from eBay but chances are they haven't a clue which seller on eBay sold the product.\n\nNow this isn't to say going on your own is easy, eBay is going to get you almost immediate sales if you're priced decently. I've started a few businesses over the years and the only ones that never posted a loss had eBay or Amazon behind them. All the others? They either failed entirely or started in debt. When I want tech products I generally visit Amazon, eBay, Fry's, and Best Buy. Sometimes, if I remember they exist, places like Newegg. The problem being if I'm already having issues remembering Newegg exists (and I seriously sat here for a few seconds to remember their name) chances are I won't be remembering to visit you for tech products unless you have a good selling point. A place like monoprice is my goto for cheap cables. If you're the source for say cheap laptop power supplies I'd have go on my own, if you sell a handful of different things then eBay might help.

{"id":"d27zu9a","author":"Rucati","body":"There's a couple things you could do, which kind of depends on your situation.\n\nThere's some online websites you can use to make a bit of money, depending on where you live. If you're in the U.S. you can use Amazon Mechanical Turk, takes a bit to get going but you can bring in a fair amount of extra money depending on how you do (some people make upwards of $700 a week pretty consistently, but they do it as a full time job). I've found making around $100 a week isn't terribly tough.\n\nAnother choice is teaching English in a foreign country. Not only do they usually not require a specific degree, but a lot of the time they don't even require you to speak the native language. Personally I could never go teach English in like Japan because I don't speak Japanese, but if you have the balls to try that it's an option.\n\nThe last, and probably best option, would be to find a higher paying job. Obviously. You mentioned you consider yourself good with people, have you considered sales? Car dealerships in particular have a high turn over rate so they're often hiring, and most don't require experience. If you're good at it it would at least be a way to make 50k+ a year pretty reliably.\n\nOutside of those options just pay as much as possible towards your loan.

{"id":"d28b031","author":"Evebitda","body":"I'm going to be honest, after getting Comcast's Xfinity X1 service I wouldn't touch Netflix with a 10 foot pole. The product (X1) is 1000x better than Netflix. You get the newest seasons of all the top shows and past seasons as well On Demand, you have access to much better quality content, as well as paid rental content, and the service includes blisteringly fast internet (200Mbs in my area) for $120/month. It's certainly more expensive than Netflix, but it's also an indescribably higher quality service. And this is coming from someone that has been a Netflix subscriber back when they were only sending out DVDs. The X1 service is so good I'm actually considering cancelling my Netflix subscription.\n\nThere is definitely competition around the corner for Netflix. The problem with TWC in the past was that they didn't have any reason to improve their service since they lacked competition. Now that Goggle has lit a fire under their butts in the internet provider category and Netflix/Amazon in the content/TV provider category, TWC has improved tenfold. In my opinion Netflix is wholly overvalued, although I still see it capturing marketshare in the lower end market where people don't wish to spend $120/month for internet and cable w/ On Demand. That being said, Netflix does *not* warrant a valuation nearly on par with TWC unless it can capture massive marketshare worldwide, especially in China.\n\nI actually want to throw up now that I feel like a Comcast shill. Ew, I never thought I would be advocating their products. Their customer service is still ABYSMAL, though.\n\nEdit: Also, TWC actually makes money even if I feel it's a bit overvalued/fair valued. Netflix is absurdly valued.\n\nEdit2: Guys, I understand that you might own Netflix stock but downvoting me doesn't make the truth go away. You're all going to get fucked in the long run.

It is a sign that the potential runway for Netflix to bring on new customers in the U.S. is still nice and roomy. For international, on expectations of 4.49 million new subscribers it added 4.51 million. However: Netflix lowered guidance for new international subscriptions next quarter, predicting only 2 million net additions, on analyst estimates of 3.45 million. Considering the company just launched in 130 new countries, that isn't good enough, and shareholders understandably wonder why the service isn't more popular abroad.\n\nAnother challenge is that a lot of competitors seem to be coming to the marketplace as well(Amazon, Apple, HBO etc) and NFLX's price is the way it is because it is a hype/momentum stock, which means that every quarter must be amazing, anything short of it would send the price downwards and bad results would send the price off a cliff.","name":"t1_d28pk9h","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-19 12:46:11","week":16}

{"id":"d28sji3","author":"minedigger","body":"The Amazon announcement is highly relevant to how it trades today. Netflix are predicting only 500,000 US adds next quarter - and this number was determined pre the Amazon announcement. If Netflix loses a mere 1 in 100 of its US members to the new Amazon service over the next quarter, and loses a mere 1/4 of its expected new adds (analysts are expecting it to lose half of these to Amazon), it goes into negative territory. According the conference call, it's already expecting modest \"churn\" from ungrandfathering of millions of accounts, so price is clearly an issue for some.\n\nThis is what people are thinking about it trades today post earnings. An example of an analyst comment:\nQuote:\nMark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets views Prime Video's break-off as a \"significant negative\" for Netflix\nSo yes, it's extremely relevant for short term trading. More importantly, Netflix being \"finished\" means you can confidently short it here and ride the swings if it moves against you, as Netflix has zero upside for the rest of its existence.

{"id":"d290ogp","author":"dharmon","body":"First, keep in mind that Buffett does not speak in riddles, sometimes you just have to look at what he says from his point of view.\n\nI don't have the link, but find on YouTube a CNBC interview with him. It's short, about 5min. It's the one that starts with him laughing about \"I've got news for you, you're only the 2nd dumbest guy on the planet when it comes to the cloud. You're looking at #1.\"\n\nIn this interview he spells out exactly what he sees:\n\n- First, he mentions talking to all his CEOs, and no doubt others that he has access to like Wells Fargo and AmEx. He notes how deep these institutions are in IBM tech and won't / can't switch anytime soon. He makes special note of how for many of them, Amazon AWS is not even an option.\n\n- He notes how IBM customizes his offerings. He is hinting at IBM's prime competitive advantage: enterprise sales, not tech. I like to joke that IBM will send Ginny Rometty (the CEO) to personally give a lap dance if the client is big enough. Amazon is learning this is where the long-term good money is, but I think they are too late. Google is only just now realizing that a party is going on. Microsoft is IBM's biggest competitor in this regard.\n\n- I think from these data points he figured out a floor on IBM's earnings. From there its trivial to figure out a bargain-bin price.\n\n- IBM's ROE is through the roof, cause their capital expenditure needs are so low, and their capital base is shrinking, even with all the data centers they are building. They have consistently returned cash to investors via dividends and buybacks. Basically Buffett isn't worried about management concerned with empire-building.\n\nThese factors combined to show a bargain bin price for IBM where there was only one direction to go. Buffett bought at a price that was too rich for me, but IBM was recently as low as $120 / share. This is prime evidence that the market still has significant bargains even in huge cap companies. Normally I don't touch companies this big but I was scooping up shares and some LEAPs.","name":"t1_d290ogp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-19 18:14:45","week":16}

{"id":"d2972c2","author":"[deleted]","body":"Few things I can think of and trust me I do a lot more things apart from these to stay frugal.\n\n* Using Chrome extensions while I am shopping and adding up the savings (Recent savings include a storage drawer I liked and wanted to buy from Overstock, and my extension saying that it was available for $129 at Sears, instant 60 bucks in the pocket there with it)\n* Using cash back portals to get max for my $, rather than giving it up for overpriced retail (refer to my earlier tip at https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/49zm6c/bookmark_to_quickly_lookup_cashback_deals/ on how to do this for any site)\n* Search for coupons as well. A tip here is to search for coupons and cash back in an incognito windows such that you don't jeopardize your chance of cashback because several coupon sites have their own referrals which don't pay you (e.g. Retail me not).\n* Using portals like Raise and CardCash to purchase GCs for a great discount if I don't have a GC before making a big or small ticket purchase (Example, I wanted to buy a sofa from Macys for our home and it was for $1600 inclusive \"yes I splurge at times :)\". I saved us about $650 on our $1600 purchase which included delivery fees which could not be waived off :(. Similar for the bed I bought where while I used GC combined with a generous cashback and coupons. I also do this before I buy movie tickets and combine it with my AMC Stubs card which I purchase every year for about $10 to waive off fees online, shaving almost 20-25% of ticket prices. Yes I am lazy but still Frugal and AMC gives me back $10 for every $100 I spend which offsets the fees I pay for it)\n* Putting off buying some essential things for sometime so that I can find rebates, cashback etc (I end up doing these for TP, Washing Detergents and so on among other things)\n* Cleaning my own house and car (While I did invest in a Roomba, small vaccum for about $20 and a whirlpool cleaner to sweep my floors clean earlier)\n* Hording on deals for Giftcards at reselling portals when I have a clear need for them in next 6 months.\n* Diligently following sites to know when my cards have the best deals on certain sites and also periodically visiting the banks itself to check out their offers to make sure I can save better. I also do this before making a purchase to ensure I can use an existing deal.\n* Religiously saving every coupon from BBB because they have some awesome deals and accept expired coupons and are a great corporation to buy from for both customer and after sales service\n* Not buying into Amazon hype all the time because there are lower prices elsewhere (see point 1)\n* Saving up enough to invest $40K in '8' 5% interest accounts, netting me ~$2000 a year in interest, which is good enough for a big purchase of ~$1500 (after tax) in big ticket purchases or year end vacations every year rather than letting that money sit around idle.\n* Using an app like Wallaby to let me know which cards will give me the best rewards for the store I am currently purchasing to maximize my $.\n* Using an app like Prism to keep on top of my bills so I never pay any interest to CC companies or banks.\n\nPhew, quite a list, but there are a lot more things I do apart from these as well, ask if you have any questions.\n\n Edit: Added additional GC and coupon tricks and information.","name":"t1_d2972c2","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-19 20:31:25","week":16}

It seems like your total is about $26,270 in debt. \nAccording to you your income is about $1,200 a month.\nIf you paid down your debt using 100% of your income that would take about 22 months (2 months short of 2 years - assuming you never get a pay raise or find a higher paying position).\nYour only monthly expense is gas and food which is a good thing! \nI would tackle your consumer debt first (credit cards).  \nHere is a potential plan:\n1. Your first month if you spent (50%) or $600 worth I would say (Macys* then Lowes) with $20 left over of that $600. \n2. Then tackle the Citibank Credit card ($600 a month is about 2 1/2 months for a balance of $1490)\nYour credit score will probably rise once those 3 accounts are closed out assuming you throw them to the side and not rack up a higher balance.\n3. Assuming the worst situation to when you cannot negotiate with the debt buyers (collectors) you can pay off $600 principal a month on those (assuming your student loans in forbearance allowing you to either not pay on it for awhile or reduced payments) The $4,500 in credit card debt I am talking about here (Barclays, Chase, Amazon) This would take about 8 months give or take.\n4. Tackle all of the student loans as they come due once the credit cards are paid off. ($600 a month)\n($19700/$600 a month) equals 32.8 months (almost 4 years)\nI would suggest continuing to live at home until your debts are gone. I don't know what your current payments are on all of that debt so forgive me if my numbers are not realistic :)\n","name":"t1_d2984jy","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-19 20:53:53","week":16}

{"id":"d299yxt","author":"waTabetai","body":"I learned a few things about car maintenance on YouTube. People are surprised because I'm a little girl. (Not a little girl, but I mean in height.) It looks impressive I guess.\n\nI learned how to change my oil, get dents out of my car, and defog my headlights (lasts longer with a clearcoat). \n\nI was in the process of buying these ramps for $50 on Amazon so that I could fit under my car. I read the comments, and this guy basically gave a tutorial on how we could make our own ramps. \n\nBasically, he said he spent a few dollars on lumber and gave us the dimensions that he used to make the it. I asked Home Depot if they had any unsellable lumber (he mentioned it in his review) with these sizes, and they actually had quality scrap wood, which they cut and gave to me for free. I spent about $1.50 on nails and used wood glue I had to make a ramp for my car, and I learned on YouTube how to change my oil. It's expensive the first time because you may have to buy the ramp/oil holder/funnel/wrench/etc. But after that, you just have to buy the filter and oil. When you're done, if you buy a large (old) oil jug thing like me, you can use it like three times, and then you can drop it off at Autozone or something for free. Usually at places where you change your oil, you think you're only paying like $30 for an oil change, and $10 to dispose of the oil. &lt;-In addition to the one to two hour wait. Also, I guess you could always trust the company changing you oil (especially if it's the dealer), but when you know what kind of oil you're buying for sure, there's a little happiness knowing that it's better for your car.\n\nHonestly, I didn't realize how easy it was, and it's worth my time/money to just do it by myself. Also, you can get rid of small scratches from your car (that you think are scratches) with fine sandpaper and car wax. You can remove huge dents with boiling water or a heatgun/hair dryer. With various grits of sandpaper, you can sand the oxidation out of your headlights and then keep them like that with a clearcoat.\n\nYoutube is amazing.\n\nedit: Also, using ebates. I've used ebates for years, on anything I can. Flights, furniture, clothing, groupon especially. It takes literally 3 extra seconds of my life to get like 1% cashback on something small. Sometimes I tell myself, \"Well, why do I care about 5% cashback on something that's only $10.\" But it really helps out on the tax and stuff. It really helped me out using coupons to sites like Overstock, and then getting a fat 10% back from ebates on my couch and bed.

To keep power, heat, and per unit cost down a lot of processing is going to have to be offloaded to cloud servers (plus other factors like data storage, remote access, etc.) Companies have tried rolling their own edge to cloud systems with impressive lapses of basic security.\n\n\nIntel is positioning itself to provide end to end hardware and software solutions, from the data center to the API to the end users device. If Intel can establish a good reputation for security (not hard by comparison) they will even be able to add value by reassuring consumers that are increasingly aware that the cheap security cameras on Amazon are patently unsafe. Coming tight integration with FPGA at the data center level will provide a more attractive comprise between cheaper, more agile general purpose x86 processors and more expensive and efficient dedicated hardware with a narrow scope of usefulness. Unlike FGPA the tech behind 3D XPoint is too new to truly appreciate its role and effectiveness in the field but memory latency is quickly becoming a prime bottleneck for a lot of applications and with test units already in the wild the coming years.\n\n\nFor years now Intel has been proactively divesting from the shrinking PC market to invest in growing markets like IoT, data center, and related business services. The sharp job cuts will significantly reduce run rate freeing resources to establish themselves in growing sectors and with Stacy Smith moving back to operations I'm confident that those resources will be used wisely.","name":"t1_d29nubz","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-04-20 02:47:28","week":16}

{"id":"d2a1apk","author":"Barrill","body":"Well, here goes...\n\nPretty much, I graduated high school in '09 and went to community college for a few years before heading to a state school to do computer science. It was a fun time, but I ended up skipping classes and doing nothing but partying and playing video games/taking adderall for 3 semesters straight. I got straight F's in two of the semesters...it was pretty ridiculous (and a huge waste of money). Not only that, but I had a pretty rough addiction to adderall, as I would take it and stay up for 2-3 days straight playing video games.\n\nIn spring 2013, I took classes at the university's local community college since I hadn't told my parents anything about my failures of the past 2 years.\n\nSummer 2013 was pretty much the low point...I found out from my FAFSA that I would no longer be getting financial aid for school, I was kicked out of the university after being given TWO chances (New Start program), and I was working at the same old gas station back at home. My programming skills were shit and I had no money to pay for classes (parents weren't doing too great finanically).\n\nI was contemplating between going back to the university's local community college in an attempt to get back into the university for the THIRD time, or joining the pipe fitter's union with my buddy up north. I decided to bury my head down and go for it again.\n\nI moved back down to the university's campus with a couple of my previous roommates and started job hunting. I remember, at the time, I seriously interviewed to be a janitor at the mall. I ended up getting two jobs by September - a cook at Sonic, and a desk job at a doctor's office.\n\nFor three semesters (f2013, sp2014, su2014), I pretty much just worked my way through school.\n\nFall 2014 is when I got financial aid back, which allowed me to ease up on my work hours and focus more on school. This whole time, I had hardly touched an IDE. After talking with my old university again, I had myself on track to re-apply for fall 2015. I still had no idea if I'd get in. I pretty much decided to spend the next year I had until then to just work on my programming skills.\n\nSo I took a couple electives that had no transfer value - Android development and database development. What really got my programming rolling, though, was a roommate matching software that I wrote for my landlord and sold to them. That was summer 2015. It was right around then that I got re-admitted into the university.\n\nAt this point, I was on a roll. One of the best decisions I made was to take out a private student loan so that I could quit both of my jobs. Once I did that, I signed up for a few hackathons in my region. This was Part A of what got me ahead. I'm not sure if you're in IT, but once you expand your knowledge of just the availability of the different kinds of software, you really start to your mind working.\n\nPart B was probably the most important part of what got me ahead. I got an offer from someone I know to do some programming work for them, part-time. Even though I took out a loan NOT to work, I figured this would look great on my resume.\n\nWell, it did. I was in the hunt for a summer 2016 internship and, based off of my track record, I had low expectations. To my complete surprise, this part-time programming position, plus my 4-5 hackathon projects, got me interviews with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and a lot more companies. I accepted an offer with one of them.\n\nAdditionally, in December, I got an offer to work full-time while being a full-time student, from home still, with a salary of $65,000. That's what I've been doing. By the time I graduate in 2017, my salary will be higher than I could have guessed and I'll be able to work from home/live wherever.\n\nPretty much, the moral of the story is that you have to start small and create your own momentum. Even if you feel silly for feeling productive/good about small things, who cares. Keep it up and, soon enough, these things will become bigger and bigger and you'll realize you're crushing everything. Shit won't just happen - you gotta start small and let it snowball.\n\nTL;DR: Build a snowball","name":"t1_d2a1apk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-20 08:52:46","week":16}

You also have a financial interest in people buying the product from your website.\n\nThe TOS specifically states no financial interest.\n\nI wish this was a black and white area and I wish Amazon would straight up say, yes you can have an affiliate link to the same product you review on Amazon (or no you can't), but it's not that way. \n\nThis is based on me seeing patterns and interpretation of no financial interest part. I don't like speculation, but that's the way it is. \n\nCoupon reviewers get purged all of the time. The only real rule for reviewers is free / discount product up front, no compensation, and must post disclosure. Reviewers who do those things get purged all the time, so there are other criteria that aren't expressly stated, but that they very much enforce.\n\nAnd with that, good luck! \n\nYou can choose to proceed if you wish, but I can tell you if you gave me a free Dyson, or similar high-value item and asked me to review on Ammy + blog affiliate link, I would decline.

{"id":"d2axl5f","author":"LEE4PREZ","body":"in the US, an LLC is pass-through taxation. Meaning the only taxes you pay are on your personal income. For my LLC, I file a IRS Form 1065, which outlines my sales, expenses, cost of goods sold, etc. It's really for information purposes. From the 1065, I complete a K1, which is my wage report. Then I file a form 1040 for my personal income taxes using that information. It's with that form that I'll send in any payments or money I owe. Amazon accounts can be setup to collect sales tax where applicable, and taxes on sales would most likely be in the state where the LLC is created or where Amazon distribution centers are located.

I think the content is good enough to subscribe if someone enjoys watching TV. \n\nWhat I want to add here is that stock prices reflect more than just today's situation but what we expect in the future. \n\nIt's a safe assumption to say streaming services will be the dominant TV/Movie provider in the coming future. \n\nIt's also very likely that as cable diminishes (the old generation users pass away, grim but true) , large content providers will begin looking into streaming too. The question is whether they will host their own channel, hop onto Netflix or Amazon. \n\nI think there is space for both of them.

Simple.\n\nFreedom gets 1% back on everything, and each quarter has a 5% category. So for Oct-Dec they did 5% on Amazon (great for Christmas) and actually bumped it up to 10%.\n\nThese points can only be cashed out at 1 cent per point.\n\nBut when getting close to planning the trip, you can get the Chase Sapphire Preferred which is a great card (with a great bonus) and it would allow those Freedom points you've gotten to be transferred to airline rewards programs and be spent at closer to (and in excess of) 2 cents per point, basically doubling the rewards rate from before.\n\nI say to wait until you want to spend the points because the CSP has an annual fee of $95 but it is (currently) waived the first year. So you can get the card, get it's bonus, and within a year spend the points on airline travel.\n\nThese cards all have their own bonuses, and those plus the earned points times each member of the family of legal age (each social security number can get each of the cards) can really add up.\n\nAnd since you're a family, you can even transfer all the points to a single account, as chase allows household members to freely transfer points.\n\nThe CSP requires pretty good credit, but the Freedoms are much easier.\n\nIf you guys can handle the credit cards (start slow) it would be smart to add the others as Authorized Users of the cards in each other's names. This would make all the cards report to each persons credit report and build all of their credit up.\n\nLike I have a Chase Sapphire Preferred and have my mom as an Authorized User (also gave a bonus of 5k points) and I am an authorized user on my moms CSP. This makes it so we each get on time payment history for each card.\n\nNo credit cards are ripoffs if you pay the statement balance in FULL each month. Interest is only applied to what isn't paid. And of course, annual fees which are more a matter of how much you value the benefits of the card.\n\nThat's a good all purpose plan as you can use the points from those cards on a wide range of airlines.\n\nIf you can find out the airline you'd want to use, you can look at their specific credit cards, either to cover the full cost, or to supplement the Chase UR points.\n\nBut start slow! and make sure you have a process for ensuring you don't overspend.

There isn't going to be a new dominating force or something of that nature.  Processors are ultimately tools and each of the ones you listed are going to have their pros, cons and as such be best suited for certain use cases.  All we have now is a bigger tool box.\n\nA lot of this has been happening beneath the surface in the hardware for a while too.  The GPU use to be in charge of virtually everything that happened on a computer.  Slowly but surely people realized it was a waste of time to have that processor doing certain tasks.  Instead of reading bytes from a floppy drive and wasting cycles on that DMA controllers were invented.  Instead of manually doing PWM on a crude speaker sound cards were invented.  Same goes for video and so forth.  Processing tasks have been offloaded to specialized hardware for decades at this point.  We're just becoming more flexible with the designs and letting applications access them on some level.  I mean I wouldn't be shocked if sound cards end up becoming some general purpose DSP platform as well.  There's finally some interesting developments happening in the RAM world too.  \n\nI think it is an exciting time in the field and a lot of this is happening below most people's radar even if they work in the field due to the heavy focus on web apps and other content that doesn't touch any of this and probably won't for another 10-15 years.  It's definitely an exciting time to be in the field and very nice to see some design diversity reappearing after Intel pretty much won the processor wars in the 1990s-early 2000s.  I'd also add that there's some really cool things that have happened on the capital side of things.

Or someone who can do both. You could go with a branding company to handle it for you, but do you have the funds for it? We're not talking a few hundreds here, but thousands of dollars. Taking the business to the next level requires several adjustments to the overall strategy &amp; operation - the website being only one of them. So unless you have a lot of money to burn, its probably best to stick with a small team or freelancer to handle the task for you.\n\n.\n\nBefore you proceed with this, you need to do some research on who your customers are what they're looking for in your brand. Note everything down, and structure it properly. This will be important to the designer when determining how to re-image your brand, and how the brand and site is to be perceived by your audience. You can probably pay your designer to do it for you, but it's best if you handled it, because you know your customers better than the designer ever will.\n\n.\n\nAfter the designer creates the brand and design of the new site, the developer will handle the creation of the site. It needs to be smooth, run without visual issues, and also be viable on mobile. That's the first step. The other steps will involve massive social media promotions, possibly selling through Amazon (if your operation supports it), hiring models and professional photographers to showcase your products, and so on.","name":"t1_d2bg5vk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-21 09:40:41","week":16}

No model or manufacturer and chances are you simply aren't going to sell the thing. Most people actually don't sit around comparing prices, we do it because we flip stuff but most the world just goes to their favorite site and clicks buy. This is why you can drop ship between the two sites for a profit. Don't worry about it being cheaper on Amazon, be worried about selling it.\n\nListing the same item twice, not illegal. Ethical?

{"id":"d2bia1k","author":"emsai","body":"&gt; Given the market you're going into and based on your write up my only question is...why are you thinking freemium? I don't know enough about your product by why give away something that complex for free? Applications like this can be vital to a company's success so why wouldn't you charge for it especially when it you're paying for the servers? As an outsider, I applaud your endeavor, but it reading through I get the feeling you're out for the emotional return instead of the financial.\n\nGood point. \n\nIndeed, I also have doubts about the freemium approach. I think my post transpires it. However I think it could be a way to pave the road for larger-scale adoption. Maybe one way to look at it is the following: Giving out the core that everyone uses (ERP, business) unless consumption gets high, and capitalize on larger users and/or pro features.\n\nRegarding emotional, that's included indeed but end of the day I'm a businessman and I do look at the bottom line. You can't go too far with it without putting the company in imbalance, and that's something I'd never do. So don't worry about it.\n\nIf you look at Google, Amazon Cloud and other large companies, all of them heavily use the freemium or freemium-ish approach to get to that insanely large user base. Gmail has basically destroyed Yahoo mail in a freemium way, and then Google could capitalize on their premium mail solution for businesses. Does it work? Yes.\n\n&gt; If you're saying the basic version would be able to support a 1-2 person business or one with limited transactions, how much would they need to grow before moving to a paid service and what would that next tier look like? How are you going to sell them on it?\n\nIf I had the full answer to this, there would be no need for this post anymore. This is one of the critical questions.\nThe program is consumption-based cost model, so indeed there has to be a limitation. But for example, someone making 1-2 invoices a day could use it for free for at least 1 or 2 years. It depends on the extras they need.\n\n&gt; You hit the nail on the head regarding uptime, support and being a business critical application. The sheer amount of time and cost required to support a business critical application is exactly why it should be a paid product. It's the same reason you won't see multi-million/billion dollar companies relying on open source software for mission critical operations.\n\nAnother thing I look at is selling the entreprise version THROUGH the SaaS. This is a private system that only the company can log in (think about it as an intranet system) with mission-critical support, computing power and the whole nine yards.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, leverage where your product differentiates you from the competition and charge for it. You don't have to charge more but you have to cover your costs and make a profit and that's where marketing, networking, and sales pitches come into play.\n\nIt'll be clearly different than other solutions in the market. That's good. Covering costs - critical indeed. Fortunately I have been long planning for ways to cut costs. This way I can be competitive and not worry about making a profit.\n\n&gt; All that said, if you have a product that's near ready can you find some customers that would be willing to pilot your software? There are a few ways to approach it but striking an agreement where they pilot the software to give you feedback and either you eat the cost or the pay it, but get some data to model out what it'll cost you to host and support 1,2,3... companies.\n\nShortly approaching this stage, and yes there will be some full free users in return for critical feedback. I'm also considering invitation-based for a limited time. Once I'm confident about how the existing users handle the system, public launch can go ahead. However now I feel that I should better delay the public launch for 1-2 months or so and better prepare for it.\n\n&gt; There are so many options as to how to structure and license a software product, especially when you get into SaaS and hosted offerings but one of the biggest things you'll need to know is how much it'll cost YOU to support a company and go from there.\n\nFull Cost per user calculation, depending on consumption. I've got this suggestion in a different post and it stands.\nI have a (very) rough idea where my prices could be... just based on what someone else is charging for something (somewhat) similar. But I guess A/B pricing testing will tell more.\n\n&gt; It's an incredibly complicated answer as to how you structure your pricing and something I've been struggling with myself for a couple of months but you need to consider all of the factors and come to the best solution that will please your customers while also bringing in profits.\n\nI've been struggling with this for 2-3 months already... so don't tell me. Difficult and critical. I feel you.\n\n&gt; Edit: Forgot to mention that you said the software will provide a financial benefit that would be a fraction of the cost of the software. CAPITALIZE ON THAT. Get that data and use it in your sales pitch. After you've sold the F&amp;B of the software and how amazing it is, help them write their 3-5 year business case as to how PAYING for your software would end up in higher profits.\n\nCost reduction / business growth proof. Case studies. Excellent idea - thanks!\n","name":"t1_d2bia1k","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-21 11:56:49","week":16}

{"id":"d2brlen","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"No particular order and is not a complete list, just what I can think of at the moment.\n\n1. Equity Residential (EQR), although I think we are closer to the top of the cycle in terms of apartments. Sam Zell sold off 23,000 apartments in this REIT and - earlier this year - paid a special dividend.  If you have a long-term view, this is a well-run REIT focused on apartments in space constrained major cities. However, I'd really wait for a significant pullback.\n\n2. Vornado (VNO). One of the oldest REITs and quite well-run, owning a hefty amount of DC and NYC real estate. The issue, however, is that while they own a ton of extremely high quality NYC real-estate, the company is certainly not diversified. I do think Vornado is overvalued at the moment and getting it in the mid $80's would be more appealing.\n\n3. Tanger Outlets (SKT) I fucking hate the mall, but I do think that the \"high end outlet\" concept has a lot of appeal to people seeking value.  Tanger is the only \"pure play\" on this.\n\n4. QTS (QTS), Coresite (COR), Equinix (EQIX), Digital Realty (DLR) and others. The Data Center REITs - in my opinion - are the most appealing REIT sub-sector, as I think they are absolutely a long-term growth story. That said, they've run up a good deal, too. Equinix (EQIX) went from a bit over $300 to $260 in February, then proceeded to ramp to $330. Coresite (COR) and QTS (QTS) also ramped significantly after the decline earlier this year.\n\n5. Realty Income (O). Consistent, predictable triple net REIT that has paid dividends monthly for many years. I think it's run up much too much lately and would be more appealing if it got back to the mid-50's.\n\n6. Ventas (VTR): High quality, well-managed healthcare REIT.\n\n7. American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI). The cell tower REITs.  I'd rather the data centers, but this pair (CCI being us-centric, AMT being global) are worth consideration.\n\n8. Prologis (PLD). Terrible 2008, but the company has rebounded. Amazon being a large customer. They have benefited from e-commerce.\n\n9. Retail Opportunity (ROIC). Again, I don't care for the mall, but this is a smaller, well-run REIT focusing on malls with need-based anchor stores.\n\n10. EPR (EPR) Entertainment focused REIT. Not something you would own if you think that moviegoing in the future is people sitting at home with VR helmets or if you think moviegoing in general is gradual decline either way. They do own schools, entertainment venues (waterparks, indoor golf and other recreation centers) but a lot of movie theaters. Not for me, but has been well-run over time and pays a monthly dividend. If you are positive on moviegoing going forward as well as discretionary dollars going towards new kinds of recreation/entertainment places, I'd much rather point someone to this than owning one of the theater chains. No, this is not all theaters, but if you are positive on moviegoing, you are likely positive on recreation/entertainment dollars and while not a moviegoing \"pure play\" and not for me, terrific dividend here, paid monthly. \n\nSL Green (SLG, volatile) and Boston Properties (BXP, wait for pullback) are a couple of others that come to mind. Equity Lifestyle (ELS) is another, which owns a lot of property on or near waterfront. ELS would definitely be more appealing after a meaningful pullback.","name":"t1_d2brlen","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-21 17:18:55","week":16}

Its slow and I wonder if my criteria is too strict as I rarely find more that 4-5 books, many times no books.\n\nThere's a FBA seller/blogger named Nathan Holmquist who says he is able to sell most books for his minimum of $9.95 FBA using the following trigger:\n\n'Lowest Used Merchant Fulfilled &gt; 49 cents &lt; 2,000,000 rank'\n\nHe ignores all FBA because its unreliable partially due to what Amazon shows us and people price things like idiots anyway. \n\n$9.95 is a little low for me. I prefer $12. But anyway, I've set up a trigger for Used FBM &gt;$1 and under 2 million. I have another trigger for ranks of 3-4 mil, but its like $10 minimum FBM. Then I'll manually re-check those before buying. I also just got a bluetooth scanner. So I just scan and listen for the cha-ching. I don't look at anything else until I am ready to go to the checkout.\n\nNo idea if this will work. It has widened my buying criteria which could be good or bad. The one issue I am seeing is a lot of books like this: $1 used FBM, $3 new FBM, $6 FBA. Its high enough to trigger BUY, but its under my $12 floor. Maybe these still sell at $10-$12 FBA eventually due to the good rank but I don't have the evidence yet. And I don't think there is a way to trigger multiple criteria.

Nearly half my sales and  profit comes from trade with Europe - that's just the sum I can directly attribute to the union and the free trade agreement within member states. This part of my business will be threatened by a Brexit as the free trade agreement is almost inevitably going to be revoked, leaving me worse off as I become more expensive for my buyers on the continent (who may need to pay import tax on my product). \n\nThe UK will probably have to renegotiate independent trade terms with China, a key supplier for me, and as market of 60m rather than 150m it's unlikely to get such a good deal as a smaller trading partner. This also jeopardises my sales to UK businesses if my supplier relationship is in doubt.

Like the aesthetic is fine but as someone who had no idea what your business did before clicking that link, it took me way to be able to a) find farrow co on google, b) figure out your niche and then c) use the site to be able to browse your collection.\n\nI didn't try the checkout process.\n\nAs a potential customer, I just want to look at all your shit and know what you do and find a product you make that interests me. I don't know you by name, so that won't help you. Therefore, to show me your range you need this process to be as fast and easy as possible to interest me. But you've hidden the view shop link in the innocuous subtle hamburger menu. Why would you hide away the most important aspect to your business?\n\nHover images don't work on touch devices. So I had no idea those photos were navigation and where they would go.  A website I worked on in a similar market area we got 30% of traffic from mobile devices. For you I had to scroll like 5 screens to find a product with a price tag and name. Then i assumed you just did wallets and belts and card holders because that's all i'd seen evidence of. I was surprised by all the categories i eventually found in your menu. 2 clicks down. \n\nThen I went to a product category. And the navigation of your shop categories went out of sight, and i certainly hadn't thought to memorize them. There were 2 products in the category i chose, so it didn't take long to want to see something else. But again, no breadcrumbs, no easily accessible navigation of any kind to do so. I had to go 3 clicks down into your menu again to get to somewhere else. Not even the damned footer provided a shortcut to the main shop entryway.\n\nI eventually select View All because fuck that menu noise and i just see wallets for 10 scrolls. So by now i've forgetten about what your other categories were at all.  Then with more scrolling I see there's 7 pages left and hell no i'm bored now and so i leave your site and go do something else. \n\nWeb design is about moderating between your priorities and the customer's priorities to ensure both are adequately catered to. While i think your navigation is likely better on desktop, you've made the age old mistake of aesthetics over functionality. Maybe that shit will fly when you're a household name, but right now you are no Gucci, so don't push your luck.\n\nIf your business is real small and you're doing this on your own, I would strongly suggest reading google's analytics help docs and rethink your site.

So what, you might ask?\n\nPayPal has a history for treating business customers extremely badly, going back all the way to the start. Back when they were pretty much the only game in town and doing credit card processing for yourself was not affordable for small players, you could not get around PayPal.\n\nYet PayPal would randomly pull shit like blacklisting businesses - and anyone known to be working for that business - for life and for no apparent reason, kidnap funds for 6-12 months (they'd just delay all payments by a year, imagine that for a small dependent business), etc. They would never explain why, even when you got lawyers involved (they'd give you only transaction numbers, and those you couldn't verify or appeal because you couldn't login). It has happened to one of my old businesses (we had enough cash and our own CC processing, so it wasn't more than a nuisance in our case), and I know several other people who have run into these issues. More than a handful went out of business.\n\nOver the years I have done business with many of the big Silicon Valley corps, none of them even come close to the shadiness of PayPal in those days, not even Amazon.\n\nAs much as I think Tesla is awesome, and some of his other ideas aren't half bad either, I can't help but look at the guy with extreme distrust. To me he's more akin to the bankers who caused the 2008 crash than a revolutionary entrepreneur; I just can't shake the feeling that at some point he's going to screw a lot of people over for his own benefit.","name":"t1_d2cyjg6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-22 14:26:21","week":16}

Drop the classes immediately and you won't have to pay a dime. Amazon will never ask for verification again. 1st year is $50 savings - college application fee (~$30) = $20 savings. Every year after is a $50 savings.","name":"t1_d2d6eju","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-22 17:52:27","week":16}

It only adds a little bit. \n\nThe dutch oven one is similar to one I sold at my consignment shop booth for $30 so perhaps try CL  that way you can avoid shipping. Consignment is like Amazon FBA, It's only worth doing if you have a lot due to the fees. I rent my currant booth for $300-500 a month (it's 500 during summer 300 the rest of the year) plus 5-15% (5% is for books) of every item sold. You can consign single items with no booth but that can easily nick 40% of your sale price. \n\nCorning ware is a B!tch to ship. It is easily one of the top worst 3 glassware's for me shipping wise only beaten by delicate teacups, and stemmed glasses. They are very heavy so you need a lot of bubble wrap and packing peanuts to prevent them from slamming into the loading bay with a force equivalent to the Chicxulub impact the second a worker drops it. I would definatally try your local market such as facebook groups followed by CL (or what ever your local equivalent is)\n\nI'm actually using the open roaster one as a bonsai tray for a tree I'm training (it had a chip so it was worthless). not related in any way but it did remind me I need to water them :P","name":"t1_d2d6z2z","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-22 18:05:19","week":16}
{"id":"d2d70bj","author":"roebuck85","body":"If I look up a book on Amazon and it has more than one listing I check camelcamelcamel and list it for sale under the listing with the lower sales rank, I figure that's what most people are looking at when they buy. Be careful of paperback vs hardback, sometimes they're in the same listing as a variation so you can't tell if the hardback or paperback or ebook, etc sells better, and sometimes there will be separate listings. Also, different printing years and different editions will often be listed separately so look for the one that matches yours.\n\n\nAs far as sales rank, it's personal preference. a 5000 sales rank book will probably sell very fast, however to be competitively priced it will most likely be pretty cheap. 100k-250k seems like the sweet spot, good prices and quick movers. Most people agree that books up to 1 million are safe and will move relatively quickly, 6 months to a year. Myself, If I'm at a 3 dollar a bag book sale I'm taking everything between 1 and 2 million or so that sells for at least $10. Higher ranked books need a higher price point to make them worth listing and shipping since they're going to sit for awhile before you get any return on them.\n\nTextbooks are one place to really look at camelcamelcamel, they can sit at 1-2 million for 3/4ths of the year and then sell dozens of copies or more in a few week or two long periods. Some surprising books follow the textbook model especially political science and literature topics.","name":"t1_d2d70bj","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-22 18:06:07","week":16}

Anyone can set up a website with no knowledge of coding nowadays(Wordpress, for example). Affiliate marketing, for example, is when you go to amazon and say \"hey. let me advertise your products on my website! But i'd like a referral perk for sending a paying customer your way!\" and Amazon says in reply \"Yeah! That sounds great. Here's 4% to start. If you get a lot of traffic we'll slowly up you to 10%!\" \n\nEssentially its a blog that does short but sweet reviews of books. One submission gets entered every day. People decide if they want to buy a book based of the review or not, the reader clicks the referral link, and a site like amazon ships it to them. Not necessarily drop shipping.. You make more money per purchase (generally speaking) when you do drop shipping. The point of affiliate marketing is to get hundreds of thousands of readers to read your blog and hope at a small percentage of them buys the product you are promoting, so a lot of purchases can equal out to a decent pay stub.","name":"t1_d2d8tds","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-22 18:46:47","week":16}

Everything seems to be word of mouth for the most part. There are a few big forums and things, but no huge thought leader that i can determine so far. Still doing research on it all though.\n\nAre you selling to aircraft manufacturers then? Like an accessory they can install in their planes?  \n\nYeah, B2B is a different game. Are there trade shows where you can show off your product? \n\nThis is kind of a sneaky trick: at the trade show, record a little video testimonial/review of yourself talking about how great the trade show was and how it helped your business. Put a little text at the top or bottom with your website's URL, but don't make it too big or obnoxious. \n\nYou don't need to be fancy, you can record the video with your smartphone. Looks more real and authentic anyway. Although I recommend getting a smartphone lavalier mic as I'm a stickler for good audio. They used be more expensive, but you can search on Amazon for \"smartphone lavalier mic\" and now find models that go for about $20. These are the types of mics you clip onto your shirt.\n\nExample:\n\n&gt; Hey, I'm here at the National Business Aviation Association's Business Aviation Convention &amp; Exhibition! There are exhibitors here that service any need you have for private jets. If you're in this market, you need to be here. Paul Anderson and his team have done a wonderful job putting on this event. I've made contacts, gotten leads and done more networking in a day than I have all year. Come to the next one, you won't regret it.\"\n\nHot tip: if you name the organizers, it's almost irresistible for them to share.\n\nSend a nice e-mail to the organizers with your video:\n\n&gt; Hey,\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm having a great experience at your trade show. I made a little video testimonial. You can watch it here:\n&gt; \n&gt; [insert YouTube link]\n\n&gt;Thanks for all the work you're doing to promote our industry.\n&gt; \n&gt; sexy_wrxy\n\nYou could embed the video on your own website and give the organizers that link. But I think that might come off as too self-promotional. Giving them the YouTube link is safer. You'll have your website URL in the video anyway. You can also link to your website in the YouTube description field under the video.\n\nThere's a decent chance the organizers might put your video on their website. Best-case scenario: they'll even blast it out to their e-mail list of attendees and exhibitors. Which is like free advertising, and it's targeted. Nobody turns down a good review, lol. Make them look good, and they might make your business.\n\nSide bonus is you build a stronger relationship with the organizers.\n\nHope that was helpful.\n\n","name":"t1_d2dhk00","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-22 22:05:38","week":16}

To accomplish this we have been generating revenue by “flipping” part-time, using Amazon and eBay for a few years now. By researching the best “flipping” techniques and modern online business strategies, and then applying that knowledge along with our current, ever evolving experience in this field, we are able to turn decent profits from home. Our goal is to be living on the road, and traveling the country full-time in a camper van by this summer. We plan to continue sourcing for FBA during our travels, however because of the limited space constraints of our camper van, we will no longer be able to flip anything that doesn’t fit the FBA profile (i.e.: used shoes, clothes, antique goods, etc…), this is where you come in!!!\n\nWe are looking to team-up/partner-with you if you have interest in receiving more inventory to flip via whichever platform you prefer. Whether you are short on time, short on transportation, or have a lack of reliable local resources from which to source product, we envision our partner(s) having at least some experience and most importantly, having consistency, dedication, as well as the cooperative skills necessary for this collaberation to become a successful business venture. Whether you are a part-time flipper (like we are) juggling two jobs and/or other responsibilities, or a full time flipper, you may have the need for more inventory and either lack the time to allocate to sourcing for your business, and/or live in a sourcing “desert”, etc…\n\nOur idea is that by collaborating, we can help to be at least one of your sourcing solutions! Upon finding the best suited partner(s), we will setup a partnership in which, essentially, we will act as a mobile resource, sourcing inventory (customized based upon the types of products YOU like to flip). During the entire process, we will keep in close contact with you to ensure everything runs smoothly. I understand it will take some hard work to setup a good system that works for us both, but it is something we are willing to put our best efforts towards so that perfectly good and profitable inventory will not get left behind!    If you are a flipper and think this opportunity is something that could work for you/us, and are interested in hashing out the details or have questions (suggestions even), please reply so that we can discuss it further!\"\n","name":"t1_d2diap1","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-22 22:23:13","week":16}

{"id":"d2dt1wy","author":"DaveVT5","body":"tl;dr - I went with a VOIP system and pay as you go w/ the lines and while it's not perfect I wouldn't ever go back to a physical system.\n\nLong stream of conscious version:\nIn my last company I invested in a phone systems as we grew and really regretted it. Started with a recycled 8 line Avaya system. As the company grew spent over 65K on a Cisco Unified Messaging blah blah. I recently started a new company. Have 42 FT employees but we only have ~6 desk phones for IT, Admin types and another four polycoms in conference rooms. Then about another 5 \"soft phones\" for those of us who are on the road. We did a long search and settled with RingCentral. Big reason was because we get the 800 conference call-in feature for the same price as the phone lines. Had previously been spending ~$800/mo for another dedicated service. We also used Join.me for screen sharing (we sell B2E so a lot of phone presentations). Some customers had difficulty with the RingCentral version of Screenshare so we may end up switching off of RingCentral. Internally we have had some issues w/ call quality on RingCentral though I am pretty sure it is because QoS (quality of service-a networking feature) was not configured properly.\n\nPicked it over 8X8 but couldn't give you the long list why. The phone product is pretty solid. I'm pretty sure they acquired a screenshare/video company and rebranded it because it's a separate app and not as integrated as I like. But I may be asking for too much. If you just want a solid VOIP solution I would recommend RingCentral. But buy the phones off of Amazon and save 50%!\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_d2dt1wy","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-23 03:20:40","week":16}

That's what is most important instead of worrying about competition. \n\nOther things you might need in the future is an actual business license ( not sure if your to young to get one ) so that you can get a resellers license to buy products tax free from distributors and resell them to your customers in case they need new hard drives, more memory, or small stuff like flash drives or usb charging cables...etc you need to contact your state board of equalization to get one but a business license is required.

{"id":"d2ejoo5","author":"Evebitda","body":"I mean, the employees get paid because *other* people actually shop at the store and buy merchandise from them. This shopping habit is being subsidized by the people who actually buy from stores, and if everyone suddenly stopped buying from the store and instead purchased online the stores would cease to exist. So no, the people at Aeropostale or other retailers that had to close down are no longer getting paid. \n\nEssentially these physical retail stores and their customers are subsidizing sales at internet retailers, because without the ability to try on clothes and see which ones they like or which ones fit the purchase would never have been made online. I personally think it is a bit scummy to use a service you have no intention of paying for, but that's obviously not a view held by all. The only reason people see, to think this is okay is because they see these retailers as a \"faceless corporation\". Could you imagine going into your local mom and pop store to try on clothes, make them rerack the clothes for you, purchase the item on Amazon and then come in next week to rinse and repeat? I couldn't, I would feel horrible. I love to support the services I like even if that means spending slightly more. \n\nIf everyone had the mentality that they should try on clothes at the store and then buy them online the whole idea would cease to work because the retail stores would no longer exist (which, to an extent, seems to be happening). Unfortunately, the cost of running a retail store is higher than being an online retailer because of the physical location and services provided. The online retailers piggyback off the retail stores and something is going to have to change. There is no way for the retail stores to compete on cost so I'm not sure what the answer is. Charge to try on clothes? Have a retail outlet that is simply for trying things on and then ordering online? The latter would only worm without fees to try on clothes if the stocked merchandise is only available through the retailer.\n\nMy guess: physical retailers will start having in-house brands that are only available through them as well as collectivizing and refusing to offer merchandise that manufacturers also offer online at lower than retail prices. This *has* to be a transient issue, because if it became the norm for everyone the storefronts would no longer exist.","name":"t1_d2ejoo5","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-23 21:12:40","week":16}
{"id":"d2ejxg3","author":"Evebitda","body":"Which means that, at least for items that consumers prefer to see or try in stores, something will have to change. Margins will come down but it is impossible for those retailers to sell at exactly the same price as most online stores that don't have to maintain a physical storefront and the services/expenses that come along with it. Something has to change, because if everyone started doing this the physical stores would cease to exist. It is being subsidized by the customers that still shop and buy items at the store, and if it becomes the norm to shop and buy items online there will no longer be a physical location to see items at.\n\nThere are a few things that could happen: there could be price fixing by via collectivization of retailers and refusal to allow merchandise in stores that is sold cheaper at online retailers. There could be in-house brands that are only offered in store and not online at cheaper prices. There could be storefronts that open up and charge people to come try on clothes/merchandise etc. (very unlikely).\n\nAnyway, I hope you get the point. These physical retail outlets and their customers are subsidizing the windows shoppers and Internet retailers. This only works when people continue to buy from the physical location. If it becomes more and more popular to buy online the stores will continue to go out of business and eventually this trend doesn't exist anymore because the stores don't exist anymore. Maybe in the future there will be one Amazon store in the city that everyone goes to in order to view products and then buys them online? Who knows. For now it isn't a huge issue because people still shop at retail stores, but as the older generations continue to die off and stop shopping retail something will have to change. For products that can be bough sight unseen (eg a generator) the retail locations will probably just go out of business and only online retailers will remain.","name":"t1_d2ejxg3","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-23 21:19:42","week":16}

{"id":"d2esexl","author":"VufenMC","body":"Yes. Credit checks can hurt your score (idea is that you are in need of credit so you must be bad I guess), but this is minor effect. Mine dropped only 5 points after I refinanced my student loans and opened my newest card. My current score is 764. However, the larger credit/debt ratio can increase your score (the thought being banks trust you more with money so you are good). ALWAYS keep your total balance less than 30% of your limit. \n\nPlus different cards have different benefits. AMEX Blue gives you a free membership to Shoprunner (free 2-day shipping for many retailers) among other benefits (would recommend AMEX blue), certain Discover cards have their 5% cashback quarters good when they have Amazon. \n\nI got my first card as soon as I turned 18 (before the laws were changed making it harder for young people to get their first card, thanks Obama http://imgur.com/a/ibp5U). Flashforward 7 years I currently have 4 credit cards and 1 store card with a combined credit of $26,500. I was actually surprised when my newest one, gave me a limit of $10k. I would not suggest any more than 3-5. \n\nBut always keep your oldest card open. The longer you keep a credit card open the better it looks on your credit report. My oldest is a crappy Capital One that charges an annual fee (this was when CapitalOne would approve almost anyone). But since I have been a member since 2008 they usually waive the fee when I call. However, you can usually switch cards within the same bank and still keep the account age, i.e. if I switch to the QuickSilver my credit report will still show my account opened since 2008. \n\nEdit: Different banks have different credit ranking so relying on increasing the limit of just one card might not work. CapitalOne refused to increase my limit, from $500, until last year while AMEX and Discover were competing with each other by increasing my limits every couple months.

{"id":"d2f9rcu","author":"WellingtonWaterbury","body":"EDIT: TLDR: Alibaba exists to make OTHER people wealthy, this is why they will continue to do well, and have a very large moat.\n\nNo, no, I don't think that you are, or at least I am not taking that way.\n\nOkay, for the sake of explanation, and I know this is probably the most difficult part, but you and I both have to stop making comparisons to Western countries for analogies. This is where China is getting compartmentalized, e.g. Alibaba is the Amazon of China, Baidu is the Google of China.\n\nNeither of those sentences are true because China is not America. \nThe reason I think Alibaba is a much more dominant company than Baidu and Tencent is because Alibaba has essentially created a capitalist economy and/or ecosystem within a communist country. Think about it, Alibaba and their platforms allow for Chinese citizens to experience supply and demand, competition, and reap the rewards. \n\nBaidu, on the other hand, is an algo driven search engine, who is restricted by the government in what it allows its users to reach as in their results. Research why Google ultimately left the country. \n\nAlibaba on the other hand is building an infrastructure that allows for the millions of rural Chinese to compete in a free market for the first time. So Alibaba is not a company, its an economy, or an ecosystem. They literally have a solution for every situation of doing business in China, from a customs broker, to an escrow service. JD.com is just an online store with its own logistics network that operates on a much smaller scale. Western media pit the two as competitors, but they compete in a way that Barnes and Noble competes with Amazon. (Western analogy, I know.) \n\nThink about it like this. Alibaba is the owner of a mall shopping center. Amazon rents a store in the mall. Macy's rents a store in the mall. Mondelez rents a store in the mall, etc. Because of Alibaba, Western companies are now able to access a huge demographic and it is paying off immensely, look at Costco's sales on Singles Day.\nThat analogy shows you how people are misunderstanding what Alibaba actually is.\n\nSo to tie this together, Baidu has already been limited by the government and will continue to be as a result of that. Alibaba however, has given the Chinese people their first taste of a competition driven economy, and now is the avenue for many Chinese to make their living, meaning they depend on Alibaba. \n\nTencent controls how Chinese communicate with WeChat, but they do not control WHAT they say, meaning Baidu is really the only company whose core business is limited by the government. This is causing them to branch out into other areas in order to stay relevant, e.g. autonomous car. However, Alibaba and Tencent are causing Baidu to fail at these other ventures because of their influence on the Chinese people.\n\nWhich do you think is a stronger infrastructure a search engine or a quasi economy? \n\nI was going to type out a description for each one of the below listed businesses but, I would suggest researching them yourself to really get a grasp on how much Alibaba is changing the world. If you have the time, look up each one of those companies and remember that Alibaba Group owns them ALL. To compare them to Amazon or Ebay, is laughable.\n\nAlibaba Group, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall.com, Juhuasuan, AliExpress, Alibaba.com, 1688.com, Alimama, Alitrip, Alibaba Cloud Computing, YunOS, AliTelecom, HiChina, Autonavi, UCWeb, Umeng, Xiami, TTPod, DianDianChong, DingTalk, Alipay.\n\n","name":"t1_d2f9rcu","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2016-04-24 14:13:15","week":16}

{"id":"d2fbg6v","author":"80spizzarat","body":"There are other apps, but the one most people use is the Amazon Seller app. It's free and as long as you have an internet connection where you are scanning it works fine. \n\nYou scan the UPC barcode on the back of the book, just like you would for any other product. If the price is too low to make a profit, you put the book back and move on to the next one.\n\nYou print out a label and stick it over the barcode when you send the books in. You send in a bunch in one big box and the warehouse workers scan the labels as part of the check-in process. They may have you send boxes to different fulfillment centers.\n\nHow to send in an FBA shipment is too big of a subject for one post. There are how-to videos on YouTube that walk you through the process. I'd suggest starting here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4R0jhhtkfU\n\nI would also suggest sitting down and reading through the guides on the Amazon site. Read through everything related to the categories you want to sell in. Selling on Amazon can be a minefield and they are very unforgiving if you screw up. If your account gets suspended it is for life, and it's very difficult to get back into Amazon's good graces. If you're serious about wanting to sell there, take the time to learn what they expect because it's much better to keep from getting in trouble in the first place.","name":"t1_d2fbg6v","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-24 15:35:38","week":16}

{"id":"d2finw6","author":"_second_look","body":"First, thanks for weighing in!\n\nYes, totally agree re: the FBA benefits. \n\nLet me see if I can clarify current state and my thoughts:\n1) ecommerce site because I want my own thing. \n\n2) ecommerce Because of the nature of what I am selling. Many of the items I am selling are open box, restricted amazon brands, hazmat (ex. nail polish / cannot FBA) or have already died on the vine through Amazon, and sellers are sending them to us to liquidate. \n\nOur model includes the fact that the 3P sellers we consign with have already tried to, or did sell these items once. Most are happy to get money back out of them, and know they are not going to be their main money makers. \n\nWe offer a large discount off retail price to our customers. So even if its an item that we *could* FBA - if you combine lower selling price minus amazon fees minus consignment split, it's an even lower payout to our vendors. I suppose we could try a price point threshold and off load some of it.\n\n3) I am embarrased to admit that I do not understand your suggestion to use Amazon listings to run PPC and build backlinks? Can you elaborate?\n\n4) Largely, our FBA business is completely separated from our consignment business, in that the products are offered in one place or the other, for the reasons mentioned above. Otherwise, I would continue to run the majority of it through ammy!","name":"t1_d2finw6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-24 19:18:40","week":16}
