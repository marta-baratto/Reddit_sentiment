{"id":"4hlz50","author":"carl0071","body":"I have been self-employed for about 9 months now. I sell goods on Amazon and eBay which I buy from retail outlets, car boot sales ('flea markets' to those in the US) and other places.\nPrimarily, my tools of the trade are a wallet of cash, a bank card and a smartphone with eBay and Amazon apps.\n\nEverything I sell is sold online, and the payments are handled by Amazon and PayPal.\n\nSo you might be wondering *why* anybody in my position, working how I work, would *need* a credit card terminal.\n\nThe answer is, I don't need one. I've worked in various retail positions before I became self employed and everybody knows that it costs the merchant a fee to accept a card. But I never knew how much that fee was.\n\nA few months ago, an advert appeared on Facebook advertising a free handheld credit card terminal. No monthly fee, no hidden charges.\n\nInitially I thought to myself *'I don't really need one'* but then I also thought *'What do I have to loose?'*\n\nObviously I won't say which company it was because this post is advice, not an advert, but there's several companies which offer the same thing and you can find them very easily.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nThe card terminal is free - it plugs into your smartphone or iPad.\n\nThe app is free.\n\nDelivery is free.\n\nFor every payment you take, the charge is 2.75% - That's it!\n\nThere is no 'per transaction' fee either.\n\nThis makes it perfect for small businesses to take small transactions.\n\nAccepting 100 payments at £1.00 will cost you the same as 1 payment at £100.\n\nThis is key to this idea, because it removes the idea of telling your customers \n\n**\"You need to spend a minimum of X before you can pay with a card\"**\n\nThat whole idea of small shops turning away a customer because he wants to pay £3.50 by card is ludicrous!\n\nSo how does this help me?\n\nI have taken over £300 in payments with my card terminal so far - and at least £100 of that wouldn't have been paid if I didn't have a card terminal!\n\nI keep it in the car with me, so when I went to sell some of my old stock at a car boot sale, I stuck the \"Visa, Mastercard, Amex\" poster in my car window.\n\nMost of what I was selling was under £5 per item, but I had a couple of customers - who obviously had the intention of reselling the goods elsewhere - buy over £100 worth of DVDs and video games from me.\n\nPerhaps they had sufficient cash on them to start with. But the fact that they both noticed the sign and then *asked* me to make sure I accepted credit cards, says to me that they were more comfortable with making a large purchase using a card.\n\nAnother time this came in useful was when I sold a games console to somebody on eBay.\n\nThe buyer was local (&lt;30 minutes drive) and so he asked if I would deliver it in person the same day. The buyer offered cash on delivery, but was conveniently £20 short of the total when I arrived.\n\nWhether or not the buyer was genuinely short of cash, or whether he simply expected me to discount the total amount by £20 will never truly be known to me, but the fact that I was able to say to him \"That's ok, you can pay the other £20 by card\" gave me the satisfaction that I hadn't driven 25 miles to be £20 out of pocket.\n\nIn addition to this, when a friend needed help with her computer, I was able to accept a card payment for parts I'd needed to buy in order to fix it. \n\nShe didn't have enough cash on her at the time, but had I not had the card reader, it would have been too easy to say I will collect the money next time, and then eventually forget about it.\n\nAs well as the convenience of being able to accept payments on the spot, it is also more secure. \n\nIt eliminates the chance of accepting counterfeit notes, nobody can rob you because the payments are all digital, and it's safer than PayPal because customers can't do chargebacks. \n\nAll payments are accepted using 'Chip and Pin' so they are so much more secure than a signature or online payment.\n\nI have no doubt that I will find more uses for my card terminal, but I would highly recommend one for anybody who receives payment from customers.","name":"t3_4hlz50","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-03 08:10:08","week":18}

Now I'm planning on spearheading my path to being debt free. \n\nFirst of all, I make about 3,000 take home a month, and I'm working overtime currently, so that ups it to about 4,000 a month. \n\nRent (including utilities): 600\n\nPhone: 100 (this is after some manipulation, about as low as I can get for what I need)\n\nStudent loans: 450 a month \n\nCar: 500 a month (I drive long distances and bought new, with only a few months until payoff, so changing this isn't going to help much)\n\nCable: 25 dollars a month (HBO go+ az prime) \n\nGroceries: 200 a month \n\nVarious vet bills: 60 a month \n\n\nCredit cards: \n\nDiscover: 6,500 (22% apr) \nVisa: 9,800 ( 10% apr) \nAmazon store card: 1,500 (0% apr til June 2017) \n\n\nFor the past few years I have pretty much lumped all my free cash into my credit cards and then charged everything to my credit cards (sure, I have the self discipline to churn!!) now, I realize that's a huge mistake. \n\nMy plan is to take a 16,000 dollar loan from Earnest for 5.5-11% apr. if I get 11 percent (my credit is good, I don't think I'll get that high) I'll reapply for only the amount on the discover. \n\nWith this loan, I will cut up all but one of my credit cards (for emergencies) and start building up my emergency savings. \n\nWith that said: \n\nShould I cut up all my credit cards I don't plan on using? I was told having more history was good, as one of my biggest issues with credit is a short credit history. But I have many cards now (0% apr and balance transfer, yo!) but I think that's actually hurting me. \n\nShould I still keep certain cards for large purchases? (My American Airlines card has some great benefits for large purchases) and just keep that card in a safe until I need it so I don't use it irresponsibly? I don't have the self discipline to keep them in my wallet, but I won't use them if I don't have them. Would cutting them up help at all? Can I just stash them in a safe?  \n\nAre personal loans a bad idea? \n\nHelp?\n\nThanks for reading.

{"id":"4hpi2b","author":"SasquatchCunt","body":"I wanted to take a break from shitposting and offer something of substance for once.  Although I’m questionably qualified to give advice, here is my guide to gambling your borrowed money on stocks reporting earnings.\n\n**Preface:**\n\nThe purpose of this is to list resources, methods, and thought processes so you can incorporate what I am sharing into your own trading.  I believe this will mostly help the noobs.  Maybe some people with more experience will find this useful?  I’m hoping anyone with more insight than me can add to the conversation.  This is not a suggestion or solicitation to buy, sell, or fuck yourself with any security.\n\n**Components of an earnings announcement:**\n\n•\tEarnings per share (EPS):  How much did the company make or lose per share?  Was it above or below what was estimated?  In my experience EPS has the least amount of impact on share price move.\n\n•\tRevenue:  How much money did the money making part of the business bring in?  You can have great EPS, but if you’re not bringing in the business and report revenue under estimate the stock will probably go red.  Meeting, exceeding, or missing on revenue estimates typically does have an impact on share price move.\n\n•\tGuidance:  Where is the company going?  Good or even great EPS and Revenue can see a stock trade red after-hours if the guidance is below expectations.  While not always the case, I have noticed guidance typically drives the stock’s price movement the most.\n\n\n•\tThe Market:  Yup.  Even if everything logical is saying the stock should go up or go down and it is doing the opposite.  The Market doesn’t give a FUCK about the Shouldland you’re living in.  Never underestimate a trade going completely wrong just because the market doesn’t give a shit about you or anything logical.  \n\n**Who is announcing what when?**  \n\nThat’s the first question you want to ask yourself.  Yahoo earnings calendar is a great start.  I’ve since graduated to [EarningsWhisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com) and [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com).  [EarningsWhisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com) is a nice way to gauge how the stock has performed during past announcements.  [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com) is unmatched in helping visualize past earnings performance and future expectations.\n\n**Take Action:**\n\nYou’ve found the stock you want to gamble on, but what is the best way to do it?\n\n**If you’re bullish you can:**\n\nAction| Pros | Cons\n---|---|----\nBuy the shares outright.    | You own equity.  If shares move up in AH or PM trading, you are poised to profit then or during market hours.  If shares drop, you still own the stock.| Stock needs to move a large % for YOLO gains.  If done correctly this comes with a large capital requirement.\nBuy calls.| Cheaper than buying the stock outright.  Wild gains if stock moves up a large amount.| Can easily take 100% loss even with reasonable strikes and expirations.  IV Crush will fuck your butthole.\nSell Puts.| You get paid right away.  IV crush works in your favor.  If a stock gets put to you, you now own the equity.| Need the capital and privileges to have a stock put to you if you're wrong.\nCall Spread.| Position yourself for upside gains while lowering your cost basis and maximum loss.  Selling premium.| Gains are capped.  Buying and writing contracts increases commission costs.\n\n**If you’re bearish you can:**\n\nAction| Pros | Cons\n---|---|----\nShort the shares outright.  | Simplest way to bet against a stock.| Infinite loss potential.  Covering shares while the stock moves north is very painful.\nBuy puts.| Normally cheaper than shorting the stock.  Wild gains if stock moves a large amount down.| Can easily take 100% loss even with reasonable strikes and expirations.  IV Crush will fuck you butthole.\nSell Calls.| You get paid right away.  IV crush works in your favor.  | Infinite loss potential.  Much higher loss potential than shorting the stock.\nPut Spread.| Position yourself for downside gains while lowering your cost basis and maximum loss.  Selling premium.| Gains are capped.  Buying and writing contracts increases commission costs.\n\nOf course there are other strategies than what is listed above.  You'll see some people suggesting selling Iron Condors as an almost sure way to \"collect premium\" on a volatile stock regardless of which direction it goes after earnings.  Find what works for you and apply it.\n\n**Some of my notable earnings gambles:**\n\nWinners:\n\nOptions| % Gain\n---|---\nCOLM Aug 21 2015 65.0 Call| 460.72%\nWDC Sep 18 2015 85.0 Call| 341.69%\nSYY Aug 21 2015 37.0 Call| 167.79%\nEMN Aug 21 2015 80.0 Call| 143.33%\nNFLX Jan 22 2016 90.0 Put| 835.44%\nAAPL Apr 29 2016 102.0 Put| 308.66%\n\nLosers:\n\nOptions| % Gain\n---|---\nTREX Sep 18 2015 50.0 Call| -100.00%\nKMX Sep 18 2015 60.0 Put| -100.00%\nFB Nov 06 2015 100.0 Put| -99.01%\nBBBY Jan 15 2016 50.0 Call| -100.00%\nMW Jan 15 2016 25.0 Call| -100.00%\nMU Feb 19 2016 15.0 Call| -100.00%\n\nThis by no means is meant to impress anyone.  I fucked up more trades than I've had successful ones.  Maybe one day I'll be able to say I've had more gains than losses in this account, but we're a few good trades away from that still.\n\n**My Methodology:**\n\nAfter some $SPY puts thrashing and almost decimating my play account for a 2nd time I decided to gamble on earnings again with either call or put spreads.  This helps me lower my cost basis, mitigate risk, and maximize return.  For instance I am gambling on $PZZA earnings AH today.  First I will look at [Estimize](http://i.imgur.com/9DPQUmW.jpg) to get a feel for how they've done in the past as well as what to expect for this earnings.  Looking only at the revenue screenshot I'm seeing current Q1 guidance is only slightly above previous Q1 guidance.  My thoughts already are they will deliver good earnings.  Whether or not they will and how the market reacts is completely out of my control.  Next I check the [charts](http://i.imgur.com/bV6jrwV.jpg).  Nothing compelling there beside the stock has traded higher and has sometimes reacted violently to earnings announcements.  Being I'm bullish [I'm now analyzing the profit/loss of a call spread](http://i.imgur.com/EX1pZXS.jpg) that expires 18 days from now.  You can see my maximum loss is $365 while my maximum profit potential is $2,135 even if I only have a 21% chance of the underlying touching that $65 strike.  Without writing calls my cost basis would be closer to $600.  I'd rather lose 100% of $365 than $600.  While trading like this won't spare you from the IV crush, selling a put or call in addition to one purchased helps offset that slightly.\n\n\n**Closing:**\n\nWe all about the yolo swag max gainz around here, nigga.  Trading earnings can lead to explosive returns and it can also empty your account if you go too hard on a trade and end up wrong.  $AAPL, $TSLA, $FB, $AMZN and plenty of other stocks are a blast to trade around earnings and gains are there to be made.  Don't be a fucking retard about it and maybe you'll be posting gains instead of QQ sessions about your account getting destroyed.  Remember you can always trade AFTER the earnings announcement and sometimes get just as good of returns.  Good luck, have fun, and be sure to go fuck yourself!\n\nEdit:\n\n$PZZA AH not looking good.  Solid EPS beat, but revenue did not meet expectations and guidance provided did not impress.  The guidance given is a year over year increase so maybe having this spread out a few weeks will help with the outcome and people will buy the dip.\n\nEdit #2:\n\n$PZZA getting me paid niggggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","name":"t3_4hpi2b","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-05-03 21:23:05","week":18}
{"id":"4hqnl4","author":"jacobwheeler","body":"I'm a NEET with autism, depression, social anxiety, panic attacks and some agoraphobia (not full-blown. I leave my house like twice a week minimum. Usually at night). I've been out of work for 13 months now. My unemployment insurance was cut off 3 months ago, I don't qualify for welfare and I probably won't qualify for disability because you have to declare assets and I have savings from years of working (mostly part-time but some full-time) and a trust fund (it's not enough to support me for life though). \n\nIt's really difficult for me to hold down a job. I live with a parent to cut down on expenses. But I pay 127.60USD/month for auto insurance alone (auto insurance is expensive here in the Greater Toronto Area) and I live in the suburbs with my dad so I can't dump my car since you need a car to get around here. And I have other expenses. I'm trying to cut back as much as I can. But ultimately that's just putting a bandaid on a gaping flesh wound. I need income rolling in to stop the bleeding.\n\nI've tried Swagbucks, Perk, Casho, GrabPoints, Clixsense, InstaGC, Cashcrate, Clickworker, coinworker, bitcoin faucets, dogecoin faucets, Coinurl, I tried gambling my bitcoin faucet money at crypto-currency casinos out of desperation too (I'm afraid that it might be against the rules to post ref links since I'm new to this sub and barely post on reddit in general but you can PM me for my ref links if you want to help me out. Sometimes referrals give you a kickback too.)\n\nSwagbucks I make 90+SB/day minimum (0.90 CAD PayPal) to ensure I hit my first daily goal so that I can win the daily and streak bonuses. I barely shop at Amazon.ca anymore (If you get the $25 gift card, 90 SB = 1.02CAD Amazon.ca money) and I never shop on Amazon.com (90 SB = 1.02 USD Amazon.com Money = 1.45 CAD!!) \n\nAnd there are so many rules involved with r/GCX (gift card exchange) that I feel discouraged as a Canadian wanting to earn some beermoney (or in my case, NEETbux). Like you have to be an active redditor but I haven't posted on reddit in over a month. Swagbucks and Perk gives the shaft to Canadians. They won't let you redeem in USD for PayPal. So Canadians get 21% less for the same work if they shop at Amazon.ca instead of Amazon.com. And they get 38% less for the same work if they want cash (PayPal)!! I cashed out 25CAD to PayPal recently and had a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nI ended up breaking my streak twice because the fuckers set the daily goal to 120 SB and it's so much work to make that much. \n\nWith Perk, apparently they give Canadians less points per video. And it's fucking 33250 points for a 25CAD PayPal ffs (1330 points/CAD). Meanwhile 24500 points gets you a 25CAD Amazon.ca (980 points/CAD) or 25USD Amazon.com (980 points/USD = 770.32 points/CAD). Canadians get 21% less for the same work if they opt for Amazon.ca and 42% less if they want cash!!! (PayPal). WTF\n\nWith Casho, they pay in USD (PayPal or bitcoin). Thus far I've made 1.72 USD in 6 days, cashed out 1 USD to my bitcoin wallet just to check if they pay. They do. You can cash out to PayPal at 2.50USD. You just install and run apps. Fast way to make money but the daily upper limit is low.\n\nFor GrabPoints, I barely every use it because I gave up on it. I'm at 716 points after a month or so. 1000 points = 1 USD. Whenever I get a notification for free points (usually 6-7), I take it. Can redeem PayPal at 3000 = $3. I think they pay in USD for PayPal to Canadians. I'll find out once I hit 3000 points I guess.)\n\nI gave up on Clixsense, InstaGC, Cashcrate. Those don't seem to pay well. But maybe I'm just not using them correctly. They have surveys but I hate surveys. So much work for little reward and often times no reward.\n\nClickworker barely has any decent work for me. I'm at 2.72USD and need 10USD to cash out. I usually just do voice recording tasks when they come up. Those pay well. \n\nCoinworker uses crowdflower and I got paid like 0.5c in satoshi for like 10 minutes work. You're better off with bitcoin faucets at that point ffs. So much work for little reward. 180 points = $1.80 minimum withdrawal.\n\nBitcoin faucets pay shit because they only get about 10-12 USD/1000 impressions from advertisers. I managed to make nearly 200k satoshi (&gt;1 CAD) in a week. lol.\n\nI also got a dogecoin wallet yesterday for the lulz. Dogecoin faucets pay shit too. But maybe these dogecoins will be worth something some day.\n\nCoinurl gives me like fucking 150 satoshi max (that's like &lt;0.001 CAD. lol) per click for content I share on social media. What a joke. And coinurl and ad.fly ads annoy the shit out of people.\n\nAmazon Mechanical Turk rejected me last month because I was Canadian. And I haven't received an e-mail from them offering me a spot even though other Canadians have been getting offers recently. I applied to Leapforce a month and a half ago and no reply. Lionsbridge didn't have jobs for English-speaking Canadians last I checked.\n\nEquipment I have (for a potential farm)\n\n- Nexus 5 16GB (daily driver, Android 6.0+)\n\n- Nexus 5 32GB (Android 6.0.1, used to be my primary until I cracked my screen and the repair was almost as much as buying a new 16 GB Nexus..)\n\n- Moto E 2nd Gen (Android 5.0+, only a year old, used to be my primary, was going to sell it but I might use it to farm now)\n\n- 2013 Nexus 7 tablet (Android 6.0+, busted usb jack, I have to use wireless charging)\n\n- 2009 Dell Studio Laptop (slow as all fuck)\n\n- iPhone 4s (I reset it recently. It won't let me use it without a SIM card. Fuck) (outdated firmware)\n\n- Fall 2011 iPod Touch (old ass firmware)\n\n- HTC Desire HD (old ass HTC Sense/Andoid 2.3+ firmware)\n\n- 2012 Asus Zenbook (DC jack is busted, I need to pay 159CAD to fix it. So I can't use it until I fix it)\n\nLet me know what \"strategy\" I can use to make about 10USD/13CAD daily. I've heard about \"Perk farms\". But Perk has been nerfed to hell recently. So I don't know if it's even possible. Note: I have a 200 GB/month bandwidth cap too (fucking Rogers). Thanks. :)\n\n**TL;DR: Title is self-explanatory. Why does every beermoney service treat Canada like a red-headed stepchild and why do they have to give you a steep penalty for cashing out (PayPal) compared to getting gift cards when PayPal fees are only 30c + 2.9% per transaction?**","name":"t3_4hqnl4","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-03 23:47:40","week":18}

{"id":"4hv8h5","author":"slickfast","body":"Here are the three:\n\n1) Trying to make money through Shapeways (drop shipping 3d printed products). I'm a design engineer by trade, so designing little products and selling them through there seems natural. There doesn't seem to be much potential for earning a full-time income though, according to successful makers on there. So far I've only made $17 after 3 months.\n\n2) Website/brand - I just started a website/instagram handle called everyday-cyclist.com. Similar to everyday carry, it shows off cyclist's bikes. My plan is to drive affiliate traffic to amazon by calling out the parts. Started my MVP almost completely free with a reshelled Tumblr site and a custom domain.\n\n3) Private Label Amazon FBA business - This is where I plan on using my money. I've got a niche picked out that I want to grow a brand in, and I'm in the product research stage (still picking a product to make). This is by far the riskiest option, but also has the highest earning potential by far.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I on the right track? Should I go a completely different direction, like use the website to create a drop-shipping store of some kind? I'm thinking I should cut the shapeways thing and just focus on the website and FBA business.","name":"t3_4hv8h5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-04 18:19:43","week":18}

Most cards have both our names.\n\n* Chase Bank - 88% usage $1760 balance, we pay about $150/mo; $2000 limit, currently at 0% APR but will go to 23% after the introductory rate ends\n\n* Capital One - 92% usage $1380 balance, about $100/mo; $1500 limit, 23% APR\n\n* Torrid - 80% usage $640 balance, $75/mo (we pay this down easily); $800 limit, 25% APR\n\n* Walmart - 0% usage $0 balance, usually $30/mo when there is a balance; $150 limit, 23% APR\n\n* Ashley Stewart - 22% usage $130 balance, $40/mo (paid down easily); $600 limit, 25% APR (also want to close since I rarely use it)\n\n* TiresPlus - 59% usage $708 balance, $75/mo; $1200 limit, 22% APR\n\n* Sunoco - This is currently at 100% ($300) but it normally sits at about 2/3 used and we pay it off each month which is $250; $300 limit, 25% APR\n\n* Paypal - 80% usage $560 balance, $60/mo (usually paid by ebates.com refunds); $700 limit, I can't find an APR but the interest is usually $10/mo.

If I had started doing it 2 years ago, I would have made $500 by now in Amazon Gift cards.                  \n                   \n**Here's what it is:**             \nThere is a browser plugin/extension called **HONEY ([REF](https://joinhoney.com/ref/piplwi) | [Non-REF](https://www.joinhoney.com))** which activates itself and finds you coupon codes and discounts whenever you are buying something online at almost any websites (Amazon, Walmart, Target, GoDaddy, - you name it)               \n                  \nOnce installed, it stays in grayed out color on top right corner of the browser. On the check out page where you place the final order, the plugin becomes active and highlighted. Click on it to let it scavenge for coupon codes online and automatically test each coupons individually to find you the best money saving deal out there. This process might take from 5 to 30 seconds. The end result is that a coupon code is automatically applied that gives you the best available discount on that purchase.                \n        \nBesides the instant savings, you also get cash back rewards every time you shop online by just keeping that plugin active during checkout. Simply click its icon on Chrome browser when it is highlighted and choose \"Get Bonus\". Everytime you shop online, you earn something called \"HoneyGold\" where 1000 HoneyGold = $10 Amazon gift card.            \n         \nI just renewed a domain for $10 and made 73 Honeygold from it. My another purchase worth $61 from Walmart is pending its processing.               \nAbout $200 purchase = $10 Amazon gift card.           \n           \n**Minimum threshold:** 1000 HoneyGold for $10 Amazon gift card.            \n**Screenshots:** [http://imgur.com/a/nm5UZ](http://imgur.com/a/nm5UZ)           \nHoneyGold earned from GoDaddy domain renewal: [http://i.imgur.com/sxvnn6X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sxvnn6X.jpg)         \n                 \nI feel like this extension can make some passive Amazon beermoney. It does not demand much at all. Feel free to invite each other and make a referral network out of it.              \n         \n\"Refer friends and you'll both get HoneyGold with their first qualifying purchase.\" Apparently when someone you refer uses HONEY for the first time, both of you get credited with HoneyGold.            \n                        \nIf you'd like to give it a try, you may use my ref-link which is linked above or make your friends refer you so that both of you benefit out of it rather than just one person.","name":"t3_4i3s4v","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-06 07:21:06","week":18}

{"id":"4i5kn3","author":"blueeeee12345","body":"Hey guys,\n\nThis is a bit of a rant, but I felt like I needed to get this out there.  I’ve been flipping on and off for the past few years and only recently got into FBA last September. One thing I keep noticing that kind of bugs me is people complaining about a “Race to the Bottom”.  I was a minor in economics while in undergrad and what you guys complain about is a basic concept in economics called [Supply and Demand.](http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp) \n\nAmazon FBA seems to capture the free market pretty well. If there is low demand and a lot of supply, price goes down.  If there is a lot of demand and low supply, price goes up. This keeps happening until we find equilibrium, which is a fair price decided on by the market. That’s just something that comes with any free market we operate in and part of the business.\n\nWhen you guys talk about keeping the price the same for an item, you are suggesting [Price Fixing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing#United_States)  This is when all sellers involved agree to maintain a certain price to keep profits high.  While I would love to keep high profits, that is not how a free market works and is actually illegal in the U.S. \n\nI understand it can be frustrating seeing your profits decrease, but if you believe the demand is there and your price is fair, eventually the price should reach its equilibrium and you get your profit$. Let's just be thankful we have the opportunity to participate in this platform!\n","name":"t3_4i5kn3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-06 17:25:14","week":18}

{"id":"4i6bak","author":"stevehl42","body":"When you learn how to sell ebooks without using hard, cheesy sales tactics a whole world of opportunities opens up for you. You can focus on giving value without using any technical sales strategies or complicated pricing structure. It free’s up your time, and helps to simplify your work life.\n\nYou’ll stop losing sales and leads from visitors who want to pay less than your fixed price, and you’ll earn more from customers who would like to pay more than your fixed price. Either way it’s a win-win scenario.\n\nBy using “Pay-What-You-Want” you’ll be able to reach a larger audience which will help you to ultimately make more money.\nIt’s an amazing feeling when you realize you don’t have to use hard sales tactics to make money online. You can just focus on giving your gifts to the world and not worry about the rest.\n\n**Let’s Start Publishing**\n\nIn this guide, I’m going to show you how to sell your digital products, whether it’s an ebook, video or audio file, it doesn’t matter. I’ll show you the fastest way to put these things up for sale and price them using ‘pay-what-you-want’ pricing.\n\n**Why It Works**\n\nThis pricing scheme works because (1) it costs you very little money to distribute a digital file and (2) it allows you to reach the most amount of people and (3) it allows your super-fans to pay you larger sums of money.\n\nHere are some case studies to consider:\n\n**Case Study: The Hybrid Athlete**\n\nAnthony Vennare and his brother started [TheHybridAthlete.com](http://thehybridathlete.com) and in less than a year they’ve been able to generate over $100,000 per year in sales by using a ‘pay-what-you-want’ pricing scheme. If that doesn’t light a fire under your ass I don’t know what will.\n\n[Here are some other good case studies.](https://medium.com/@tmorkes/pay-what-you-want-the-ultimate-sales-strategy-4030c63c5798#.r5cqqkvjf)\n\n**My First Cast Study: TRUE Web Presence Ebook**\n\nMy first attempt at selling my ebooks using ‘pay-what-you-want’ pricing didn’t go as well, but it certainly shows promise.\n\nSo the ebook was called [TRUE Web Presence](http://truewebpresence.com/). I sent about 400 visitors to the sales page over the first week. I received about 31 actions in total. I only received $20 in gross sales in the first week with the highest amount paid being $7 and the most typical being $1. Most downloaded for free of course, but at least I’m building an audience. I still get a few downloads and sales a month but nothing to write home about really. I have stopped promoting it though and have moved on to writing other guides. I do still try to cross-sell guides with any new guides I’m offering.\n\nWhile these results may not seem very impressive I believe it’ll snowball if I can continue to give value to my audience. Also, I’m not convinced making it free or charging a fixed priced would’ve given me better results. There are a lot of variables at play and as The Hybrid Athlete case study shows, serious money can be made.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably should not have gone with a more traditional sales letter for TRUE Web Presence. As you can see with The Hybrid Athlete, they don’t have a sales letter at really, just an about us.\n\n**Step-By-Step Instructions**\n\n**Step 1**: Sign up for [Gumroad](http://gumroad.com/) or SendOwl to accept payments using ‘pay-what-you-want’ pricing.\n\n**Step 2**: Create a new product listing in [Gumroad](http://gumroad.com/) or [Sendowl](http://sendowl.com/). Upload your files and any artwork you have. It’s best to have an ecover of some kind but is not always necessary. Sometimes it’s better to test out the content first, then develop it into a more polished product with ecover and separate domain name. (FYI: Because your product is ‘pay-what-you-want’ you don’t need a lengthy sales letter to get the download or sale.)\n\n**Step 3**: Drive traffic to your offer. You can either send traffic directly to your Gumroad URL or create a simple website for xtra branding using BookLaunch.io, Wordpress.org or any other type of website. Build one from scratch if you’d like. My favorite themes and plugins for Wordpress are made by Thrive Themes. FYI\n\n**Step 4**: Rinse, wash and repeat. You’ll gather a larger audience with each new digital product you release, and a larger number of people paying you money without using fixed pricing.\n\n**Getting It All Started or Results Realized**\n\nSometimes driving traffic to your offer can be difficult. For this reason, I decided to test out a different strategy that helped to generate more eyeballs:\n\n**My 2nd Case Study: “How To Design Your Website To Make Sales” Guide**\n\nFor this guide I tried something a little different. I wasn’t generating as many eyeballs as I’d like to my content so this time around I published the guide online for free at medium.com and on reddit.com/r/entrepreneur. You can see it here:\n\n[Medium](https://medium.com/@stevelongoria/how-to-design-your-website-to-make-sales-7e939a5928b#.42esyi8y5)\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4dj0os/how_to_design_your_website_to_make_sales/)\n\nThose 2 postings generating roughly 1,000 views in 24 hours. At the end of the guide, notice I add the following sentence and link:\n\n“Like this info? [Download a copy for your digital library here](https://gum.co/SwMv).”\n\nThis link leads to the PDF version of this guide. It’s my Gumroad ‘pay-what-you-want’ sales page however. At first, I actually didn’t think I’d get anybody to even give me their email address for something they already read, but they did. I was able to add over 20 people to my email list and make a few bucks in the process.\n\n**Email Marketing**\n\nGumroad and SendOwl let you send out emails to your customers but if you need more functionality than they can provide for you, then you can easily integrate MailChimp or another email marketing service using [Zapier.com](http://zapier.com).\n\nIdeally, after people download or purchase one of your guides, you should follow-up via email promoting your other guides that are complimentary.\n\nWhenever you release a new guide, you will also email it to your ever growing list of fans/customers.\n\n**Amazon**\n\nIf you created an ecover for your guide, go ahead and upload to Amazon and set a price. Why not get whatever organic traffic you can from the big boys. You still want to send people to your site though so you’re building a customer email list, plus the fact that they can acquire the guide for whatever price they want on your site gives them extra incentive to do just that.\n\nIt’s good to test out an exit pop-up on your website that lets your visitors know they can get the guide on Amazon if they don’t trust giving a little known website their contact info.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI hope you see you now that the sky truly is the limit when it comes to the ‘pay-what-you-want’ pricing strategy. Now it’s time to go forth and give your gifts to this world. Generate gratitude in your fellow man and you’ll never be in want.\n\nLike this info?

{"id":"4i8buy","author":"DeathByFan1","body":"I just started with flipping books, and bought a used KDC-200 bluetooth scanner on Amazon for 50$. I didn't see much point in investing 99$ for the Opticon 2002. \n\nHowever, today I ran into this strange issue. \nThe battery of the device was clearly full, indicated by the battery icon. After scanning a regular book in normal fashion, the red light that normally emits as a thin line, suddenly turned into the shape of a dot. The dot stayed there indefinitely, confusing the crap out of me. \n\nI tinkered with the device, tried resetting it by pushing all the buttons at once. The reset did get rid of the dot, however once starting to scan again, the dot appeared again. I could not get the usual line-shaped indication that a scan was being done normally. Oh, and of course, the scan did not go through successfully. FBAScan, the app that I normally use, would not respond at all. \n\nI do not want to return it to Amazon, because I've clearly used it successfully. I cannot find any troubleshooting resources in the user manual, and want to consult the flipping community here on Reddit. Does anybody think this is simply a broken device from too much use?

{"id":"4i8tsm","author":"[deleted]","body":"So, this sub has taught me a ton of stuff over the last year or two since I found it and started lurking. I rarely post and figured it's my time to chip in. \n\nI've seen a lot of stuff about garage sales and haggling at them that has made me cringe lately and with the \"season\" about to start I figured I would share some basic tips that help me make some decent money.\n\nI don't know if this is the best place or way to do this but here goes.\n\nMy guide to rummage sales with the intention to flip on eBay(I have only just started dabbling in Amazon)\n\nI'm going to break this down into a few sections for your enjoyment.\n\n*How to find the sales\n*When to go\n*Navigating the sale\n*Which Items to buy\n*How to haggle\n\n**How to find the sales**\nOther than the obvious craigslist(or area specific clone), buyers guide(shopper, personal ads, etc.) the best thing to do is find a website that lists all of the community wide sales in your area.\n\nI hit 2-4 city/village wide rummage sales a weekend. It might sound like a drag to get up at 5 or 6 and drive for an hour but it's worth it. \n\nDepending on your location it's probably pretty rare for there to be 100-200 sales within 3 or 4 square miles. The 30 - 60 minutes to get there is worth it when you realize you can drive a block and hit 5 sales before getting back in your car again.\n\n**When to go to the sales**\n\nEarly. But every other time as well.\n\nI'm one of those people who's parents actually said \"the early bird gets the worm\" every day of my life.\n\nIt's true. You don't stroll up to a garage sale at 10AM and find copies of 100$ board games sitting on a table by themselves or sterling silver candy dishes just hanging out.  \n\nYou have to work for that stuff. No sleeping in.\n\nOn the other hand. If you do sleep in, don't get discouraged.\n\nPeople miss things all the time. I routinely walk up to sales and find graphing calculators for 10$, and every day I find at least one PS2 with a bundle of crap games and 2 or 3 controllers for like 15 bucks.\n\n Learn to recognize the things in your area that everyone overlooks.\n\n**Navigating the sale**\n\nFirst off, don't get overwhelmed. You're going to be faced with piles of nick knacks and baby clothes and rusty tools, worthless dishes, whatever you can think of.\n\nMy method is to take a sweeping look as I walk up.\n\nLook for obvious home runs and lock them down. \n\nI walk on BOTH SIDES of every table.  \n\nPeople will often put things places that make no sense. \n\nI've found high end walkie talkies with baby monitors. I've found Nintendo Power magazines in a crate under a pile of socks.\n\nYou gotta be thorough.\n\nAt the same time... time is money. Don't pick up every shiny thing and look for a sterling stamp. Learn patterns. Understand what a piece of crap metal thing from China looks like. Avoid stupid nick knacks like the plague unless you know what you are looking at. \n\nThat crap is all a huge time sink. Move fast, be thorough.\n\nAs far as your phone goes. Be respectful. Most people probably won't raise a fuss if they realize you are checking prices online. But don't tell your buddy how much you're going to make. And god forbid don't tell the person you're buying something from how much you're going to flip it for.\n\nAnd most importantly. Don't make a God Damn Mess. That shit WILL come back to bite you when it's time to ask if they have the cord for that vintage perk or the dongle for there PS3 guitar.\n\n**What kind of stuff to buy**\n\nPersonally I have a huge range of things I'll pick up, but starting out there are a few things to look for that will make consistent profit.\n\nBoots - feel free to buy almost any pair of adult sized Cowboy boots(in almost any condition) for 7$ or less. Even a total dud pair will sell for 15$. Steel toe boots, biker boots, MILITARY boots, all sell quickly and for good profit.\n\nJeans - If you manage to snag a few pair of solid but unspectacular jeans like Levi's for under 5$ a pair you can easily sell them as a bundle of 4 for 45-60$ + shipping. \n\nVideo games - Screw the newer stuff. The fail rate on older systems is much smaller, and the profit margins are much higher.\n\nDreamcast, PS1, Gamecube, N64, SNES games are almost all homeruns as long as they aren't sports(for the most part) and aren't total trash(sesame street, cabelas hunting, nascar, etc) and you can get them 2$ or less. Bonus points if it's an RPG or has dragons in it. \n\n-note- for the disc based games. If it doesn't come with the case and manual or is scratched up, don't get it unless you know it's worth something.\n\n-Sports Jerseys Every area seems to have a ton of sports jerseys for cheap. I buy almost every jersey I can grab for under 5$(assuming it's a popularish player and in decent condition).\n\nYou will occasionally hit it big(75$+) but almost every jersey will get you 20$ unless it's unbranded trash. The most popular brands you will see on a daily basis to grab are Majestic, Logo 7, Nike, Rbk, Wilson and Champion.\n\n-Area specific things\n\nI used to see all these Harley Davidson jackets for like 50 - 60$ everywhere and I was just shocked. I used to pay like 10$ tops for leather jackets. Then I checked eBay and realized they go for 200+.\n\nSame with vintage camping gear. It's saturated near me. Check aluminum percolators out. Solid 20$ for nice ones or old glass top ones. \n\nNice Stanley thermos's go for like 40$, I see those things everywhere.\n\n-understand the power of bundles\n\nA random unknown metal band tshirt for 1$ might not be worth buying. 10 of them for 10$ though... probably is. If you see a pile something that has little value(similar shirts, some brands of jeans, patches, etc..) think about what 10 of them would sell for.\n\n-Learn about a new item every weekend.\n\nLearn by flipping. Sold listings area great, but until you actually buy that stereo and test it, list it and (oh God) ship it, all the sold listings in the world don't mean a thing.\n\nGet your feet wet, learn from experience, but follow through after the purchase. Expand your base.\n\n*how to haggle*\n\nFirst off you gotta understand. Yeah, people are getting rid of stuff, but it's still their stuff. Be respectful. \n\nIt all starts when you walk up. Say hello. Make a nice comment about the day or their yard or whatever.\n\nIf you want to haggle the best way for success is to get a bunch of stuff. People aren't as interested in lowering the price of a hat from 2$ to 50 cents, but they might let you take 10 of them for 5 bucks.\n\nIf there is a best offer situation or you make an open ended comment (can you go any lower on X?) you need to either offer a good bit lower than what you are willing to pay or get them to offer first.\n\nIf they have something with best offer on it many people will assume it's because they value it highly. Often it's just because they have no clue what it's worth. \n\nIf they won't give a price, just say \"I don't know\" and offer something really low but not nothing(1$ on a 200$ receiver is insulting, 5 - 15$ is just a typical lowball with a mild chance of success).\n\nWell my laptop is dying.\n\nThe end.","name":"t3_4i8tsm","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-07 07:19:09","week":18}
{"id":"4i8udc","author":"Hasygold","body":"Hi Entrepreneur community. I need a favour from you guys! \n\nBasically, we have a big client meeting this Friday. By big, I mean this client meeting could make or break us. We already demo'd our product to them before and got a follow up meeting with a CTO. Our product uses the raspberry pi  7inch Pi Foundation screen. \n\nWhat happened is that while working on the product today, we had ordered the 7inch screen but the friend we asked to get it for us got the wrong screen. The screen he got requires an external power source (essentially useless).  We were going to design the case using the screen as well this weekend. The unfortunate thing is that's the only screen we had. \n\nThe issue is we need a 7inch Pi Foundation Screen but we also need it soon enough so that we can print/design a case around it to package our boards. \n\nSolutions: \n\n1) order the screen from Amazon Prime. The only thing is we're in Canada and that product cannot be primed to us. We do live in Toronto though so what we can do is if one of you redditors lives near the border you can amazon prime it and we'll go across the border to pick it up. \n\n2) buy it directly from another redditor. If any of you have this screen, please send it ASAP and we'll pay for it and postage. If you live near Toronto (border US cities included) we can even come pick it up! \n\nWhat do you guys think? Can any of you help? Any is greatly appreciated! \n\ntldr: something blew up, need 7inch Raspberry Pi foundation screen within 2 days for big meeting, any redditors that live near Toronto that have this screen or any near US border cities that can get amazon prime, please message! \n\nEDIT: THANKS to all you guys for your help! The community is truly awesome.. Shoutout to /u/scallopwicket for selling to me his own pi screen he had lying around. You guys are the best!

{"id":"4ifxad","author":"UnnecessaryBigWords","body":"I was never really taught the importance of establishing credit, so I did not even get a credit card until 1 year ago (I'm 24).. so time is not on my side. \n\nThe other thing is that during those times of ignorance, I had applied for cards from stores like Best Buy, Amazon, etc. and was always rejected because I had no credit at the time. I had no clue this was bad for my credit score.\n\nHere's my current situation:\n\n**Credit Score:** 644\n\n**Card Utilization:** 30% (I almost always keep it at 0 buy paying off my card immediately after a purchase, but was unable to this time)\n\n**Derogatory Marks:** 0\n\n**Average Age:** 5 months\n\n**Total Accounts:** 2\n\n**Credit Inquiries:** 8\n\nA few of the inquiries will be removed this year because it will have been their 2 year mark, but most of them were made in 2015. Right now the only things I can think of to increase my score are to use my card and quickly paying it off shooting for 0% utilization.. and waiting. It seems like the only other thing I can do is wait for the age to go up, the number of hard pulls to go down, etc.. \n\nAre there any other steps I can be taking to raise my credit score?\n\nAlso, looking at buying a house, I have a couple grand saved up right now and can save about $2,000-3,000 each year to put toward a down payment. I really would love it if somebody could just clear a path for me so I know what route I should be taking. \n\nShould I wait a couple years until I have $10,000 saved and have had a chance to raise my credit as much as possible? Should I wait until my credit has reached a minimum score? Is there *any* way I can move forward on buying a house soon, like in a year or less, without it being a stupid move? \n\nThanks!

{"id":"4ig3qt","author":"Financemanstan","body":"Before you start investing you must figure out just how much risk you can tolerate when it comes to your investments. There are 3 main kinds of investors: conservative, moderate, and speculative. There are [quizzes](https://www.calcxml.com/do/inv08) online that you can take to help you decide where you lie on the spectrum. Most young-adults will fall under the speculative to moderate part of the spectrum because we have more time to earn back the money we could potentially lose in risky investments, compared to adults who are much closer to retirement.\n\nConservative investors do not invest in risky or speculative investments. They prefer to make small, but far more sure gains than riskier investors. Conservative investors like investments that pay dividends quarterly or pay out a specific sum of money after a set amount of time, like bonds or CDs (Certificates of Deposit).  Conservative investors may also like to utilize ETFs and Mutual Funds because they offer diversification at a reasonable price and some pay out consistent dividends. Most of the time conservative investors are older and are much closer to retirement, so they cannot afford to lose the money that they invest.\n\nSpeculative investors are on the opposite end of the spectrum. They would rather make huge profits, but at a much higher risk, meaning that there is a larger chance for them to lose money than to make money. This is more appealing for younger investors because we can afford to lose money since we have time to earn it back by working. Examples of speculative investments are “options” and “futures”, which sound like strange names for an investment vehicle. Options and futures are similar to each other, but only options are going to be discussed more in-depth. The reason why they are considered speculative is because they are basically a bet on which direction a market will head. If there is one thing in this world that you cannot do, it is predict the market.\n\nModerate investors fall somewhere in the middle, which is where most investors do fall. Moderate investors do not like to gamble all of their money away like speculative investors do, but they do not like earning the small yields that conservative investors do. Moderate investors are likely to be invested across the board, with some riskier investments and some safer investments. This sort of diversification allows the investor to avoid losing a large portion of their money, but still gives them a chance to hit the jackpot on an investment.\n\nNow that the 3 main risk categories are covered, I would like to discuss different investing styles that investors can follow. Similarly to risk, there are 3 main investment styles: active, passive, and swing. If you did more research about investment strategies you would never stop learning of a new one, but when it boils down to it, these 3 categories cover the main concept behind all of the numerous strategies out there.\n\nActive investing, as the name implies, is when you are actively buying and selling stocks daily. You may hear active investors referred to as “Day Traders”, but they are just investors who buy and sell their stocks all within the same day. The idea behind this strategy is that the investor can beat the markets by buying a stock early and waiting to sell it when it goes up in price at a later time, which could be seconds, minutes, hours, or even days. This strategy is not recommended to amateur investors because there is a lot of risk in trying to beat the markets. If you are wrong, the stock could just lose even more value and you, therefore, would lose more of your money. Plus, if you aren’t trading with that much money, the profits you may make would be offset by the fees your brokerage would charge you to do all of that trading. I've already discussed [how brokerages charge their clients](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ib3t9/how_to_begin_investing_as_a_young_adult/), so if you are still wanting to pursue the active trading route, you should look for a high frequency brokerage firm.\n\nPassive investing, also as the name implies, is when you buy stocks, mutual funds, ETFs (exchange traded funds), etc. and hold on to those investments because of the small profits they generate. There are 2 directions that this strategy can take its investors, but there is only one you want to be heading. The direction you want to avoid is the one where you buy a stock such as one from Google or Amazon and just hold onto it without periodically checking its value, like you should be doing. Both of these stocks do not pay dividends, so the only way you can earn a profit is if the stock’s value goes up and you sell it. The problem with this approach is that some investors do not check their investments as they should and the stock could go down in value, or lose some of the value it gained. The more favored direction of passive investing is when the investor buys stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, etc. that pay out a dividend quarterly, because their portfolio value is steadily increasing every 3 months. \n\nFinally, swing investing/trading is the strategy many investors follow because it is a balance between the two other strategies. Swing investors look to buy and sell a stock within 1-4 days to earn a decent profit. This strategy incorporates some of the risk and reward of speculative investments, but balances out the potential losses through other safer, more guaranteed investments. Because this strategy is not too far in either extreme and still offers a big “jackpot” chance with some investments, most young-adults would fall under this category, but it also leaves most losing all of their money. It is very difficult to play the stock market in this way, so I personally tend to lean more towards the passive investing side, because I am focusing on taking advantage of compounding dividend payments and the time that I have. If you haven’t figured it out already, **time** is one of the most important variables that helps you decide your risk tolerance and investing style.\n\nFirst Post: [How to Begin Investing as a Young Adult](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ib3t9/how_to_begin_investing_as_a_young_adult/)\n\nSecond Post: [Understanding IRAs and 401ks](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ib5ya/understanding_iras_and_401ks/)\n\nFourth Post: [Understanding Stocks and Dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4in4fz/understanding_stocks_and_dividends_for_new/)\n\nFifth Post: [Understanding Diversification and Inflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4in7gt/understanding_diversification_and_inflation_for/)\n\nSixth Post: [Understanding Mutual Funds and ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4irsby/understanding_mutual_funds_and_etfs_for_new/)\n\nSeventh Post: [Understanding Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ixrqz/understanding_options_for_new_investors/)","name":"t3_4ig3qt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-08 22:05:12","week":18}

{"id":"d2p1xen","author":"Theresbeerinthefridg","body":"Before I get to the food prices, let me mention a very quick thing about bread. It's something of a cultural meme among Germans to complain about bread in the US. This goes back to past decades when all you could find in some US grocery stores was mushy white bread. Germans, as you know, take bread very seriously, so they just *love* to complain about it. \n\nHere is the thing though: This is 2016, and there is plenty of good bread available all over the place. In fact, I have never been anywhere in the US where there was no good bread available. If you don't find it, you are not looking hard enough. Of course this may not be German bread, but there are always French bakeries, Jewish bakeries, Russian bakeries, and more and more American artisan bakeries. \n\nI'm sure you are already doing this, but it may be worth to remind your German students to keep an open mind and try what's good locally. And if they get too homesick, they can order German pumpernickel-style Vollkornbrot on Amazon. A case of 6 packs is less than $20 - not much more expensive than in Germany. Stores forever too, so this is actually great frugal food. :D\n\nAs for the prices, I definitely don't think they are wrong, but I do think they generalize a bit much. I am German born and raised and spent the first 25 years of my life in southern Germany. What is definitely true is that the government uses these market baskets to determine the minimum amount of money people need to live, which in turn influences the social welfare programs. So the basket informs the amount of government aid people may receive - maybe that's what your students meant?\n\nThe reasons I am so certain there are no general set prices are these:\n\n1. There are very cheap groceries in Germany, but there are also very high priced items. A 25 cents yogurt and a 1.50 euro yogurt - same stuff, different label. Who decides who can sell what at what prices? And would this happen at the commodity level, at the wholesale level, or at the retail level? Apart from the logistics, one would assume this would be a huge topic of discussion in the news all the time, but I don't read anything about this despite reading German news every day. \n\n2. Even though Germany has very strong government welfare programs compared to the US, there are other European countries where the government takes a much more active role, especially the Scandinavian countries. Yet, prices for food are  *sky high* in countries like Denmark and Norway and less affordable to their citizens. One would think that those countries would have similar programs to keep food affordable if such a policy existed in Germany.\n\nNow, there *are* definitely price caps on other things such as drugs  and books (interestingly). I need to do a bit more research on this.\n\nWoah, long text, sorry!","name":"t1_d2p1xen","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-02 02:44:57","week":18}

You can write off $0.54 for every mile during sourcing trips. Make a 100 mile trip and that's $54 you don't have to pay taxes on. I use Triplog because you can set it to start automatically. I have it set to start when it connects to the Bluetooth stereo in my car.\n\nI signed up for Godaddy Bookkeeping to keep track of my finances. It's pretty popular with flippers since it imports automatically from eBay and PayPal. It usually updates within a few hours, or you can force it to update immediately. It can pull info from certain large banks too. It also works with Amazon, but the data update is much slower. Godaddy only pulls it right before your bi-weekly payout. Something on Amazon's end I think. It works with Etsy but I've never sold there so I don't know how smoothly it integrates there.\n\nI use my PayPal account for flipping. Buy inventory using the debit card. Stuff that sells on eBay goes back into the flipping fund. Stuff that sells on Amazon goes into my bank account to pay bills and other stuff. Godaddy keeps everything straight and helps me track stuff I can write off as a business expense.","name":"t1_d2pjf9r","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-02 14:14:02","week":18}

In the late 90s we had lots of high-priced tech stocks blow up after a mania.\n\nHaving up to half your portfolio in four stocks seems to be excessively risky to me. They already make up a big % of the major index funds, so if you get a total stock market or S&amp;P 500 you're overweighting them even more. Of course you could get mid-cap and small-cap ETFs to balance out the large stocks.\n\nRisk managment is often based around not letting one or two positions have a huge influence on your long-term returns. I would only want one stock to be max 5% of a portfolio, otherwise your risk of blowing up is too high.","name":"t1_d2pvyrn","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-02 19:55:22","week":18}

{"id":"d2qj64c","author":"Nerkata","body":"Several aspects to consider here:\n\nThe Gigafactory is Teslas only real advantage and it talks about downsizing and delaying the whole project are to be found everywhere. Even if everything about it is true, it has the planned size and there will be no delay, Tesla has to cash out on its advantage as soon as possible. \n\nThe reason other car makers do not/did not produce EV is due to the non-profitability of EVs. They are simply not profitable enough to double-down on them. Daimler acknowledged the importance of EVs by investing and cooperating with Tesla from early years on. But now - as Tesla is growing more popular and stronger - several carmakers will start doubling down on EVs and then you have to consider financial resources because companies like BMW, F or Daimler are incredibly lucrative businesses which make billions of dollars a year. Classic car sales aren't going anywhere the upcoming 5-10 years and they could sink billions of dollars to build EVs and force down prices. And they will. Not today but in the next 5-10 years which is more than enough time to catch up with the battery capabilities of Tesla.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Car companies are used to calling back cars due to technical issues or as a precautionary move. Tesla is not - at least not on a large scale. What happens if they have to call back 20% of the Model 3 due to a technical issue? How will they manage the financial hit? Questions like that seem to be ignored currently when I look at the valuation of Tesla.\n\nConsidering your last point: What is the plan of stealing market share while having absolutely NO profit? Amazon could cash out on its market share because their business model allowed so. But car makers are hardware sellers. They need to make money the moment they sell the car and Tesla is currently NOT making any money with their car sales. The S Class and the 7 Series are highly profitable cars and even Tim Cook asked the journalists on a conference call \"What's wrong with being Mercedes?\". \n\nLet's look at it this way: Many people compare Tesla with Apple. That comparison looks logical on first sight. A new company charging in and changing the way of car making. But Apple created a new product. They substantially improved the phone. They could produce as many phones as they wanted because the infrastructure (charging) was the same. Tesla has not substantially improved the car because driving an EV is basically no fundamental improvement to current cars (although being a LOT OF FUN). It can't mass produce cars because the infrastructure isn't there yet and it can't cash out on it fast enough to build massive cash reserves like Apple did.\n\nWe'll see where the journey goes. In 5 year we'll know more.","name":"t1_d2qj64c","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-03 04:31:34","week":18}

Physical products in an evergreen niche, retail store, ecomm website, and selling through Amazon. Amazon was the key to explosive growth.\n\nWe spend nothing on advertising beyond the advertising you can do within Amazon's system, and occasional product giveaways. \n\nPlan is to start shopping for buyers of the business next year and cash out for $10-12MM.

{"id":"d2qnszp","author":"throwawayinaway","body":"Wow, awesome reply! Thanks for so much info.\n\nI'm in the Chicago area so in terms of continental US shipping so hopefully I'm at least favorably located.\n\n&gt; Is this all through Ebay?\n\nNo, some stuff we sell through Amazon (FBM), but mostly eBay. This is a new business, so the daily volume isn't there yet but we're getting there. Or we better, because I already have a ton of inventory to sell, haha. One of the challenges is that our merch is so varied. We have some smaller items (under 5 lbs) and some large/heavy items (over 50 lbs such as microwaves, wine fridges, vacuums, etc.) but most are in between. Things like coffee makers, tools, housewares, bedding, etc. Definitely larger than a USPS Flat Rate box, and I think given the merch type (distressed inventory of some sort, usually an open box item at least) the customer is looking to save $ (including on shipping). If they're buying an $80 item for $30-40 they probably don't want to spend another $20-30 on shipping ... at that point they probably just go ahead and buy it new. So shipping discount is probably something I need to figure out. I have FedEx and UPS accounts, so maybe I just need to estimate my projected volume 3-6 months from now and see who will have the better discount. Maybe if UPS is only really cheaper for the largest/heaviest packages we just make sure to offer UPS shipping for those items and do the rest via FedEx. And maybe Priority as an expedited option.\n\nSo far (several weeks into the business) FedEx has given the cheapest quotes, but now you've got me wondering if I'm even comparing apples-to-apples (FedEx discount vs UPS retail). I've been self-employed (S-Corp) for ten years, so you'd think I'd have this all figured out already, but my previous business only shipped FedEx or UPS envelops using prepaid 3rd-party labels so for me it was just grabbing the right envelope and printing the provided label. Now I'm paying for my own shipments and dealing with non-standard merch sizes so it's just completely different.\n\n&gt; If you only want to use one carrier the majority of the time even if there are cheaper options, then, yeah, it won't be that helpful for you. If you want every package to be shipped as quickly and cheaply as possible, that's what it's for.\n\nThis is a really great point. I'm trying to balance cost savings vs running around doing 2-3 drop-offs (FedEx, UPS, USPS) until the volume is there to do daily pickups. That and the time savings -- posting eBay listings is easier and faster if we're using one carrier, vs using FitShipper to determine the best carrier per item. That could double the time it takes per listing. But maybe that's really only necessary for items under or over certain dimensions and/or weight. Make sense?\n\nSomeone here posted last week I think about upsconnect.com offering a year of free UPS Smart Pickup. So I do plan on contacting them to evaluate that discount with the eBay discount that I signed up for a couple weeks ago.\n\nHopefully all this makes sense. I very much appreciate all the insight, this community has been great so far. FitShipper looks great, and I do think an option to select and compare the typical discounts from both FedEx and UPS would be helpful.","name":"t1_d2qnszp","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-03 06:41:32","week":18}

But what I've noticed over the last few years is that more and more of the products I receive the first time have serious issues that require a return. \n\nBut you didn't really answer my question. My point is if you're Amazon and you're getting tons of returns, what's more cost-effective for you? Sending the rejected goods back to the original seller, or sending the damaged goods to the next customer, hoping they'll just keep it?   Admittedly it's a grey line - a scratch on a new disk enclosure might annoy me enough to return it, but maybe not the next guy.  What I'm wondering now is whether Amazon has an internal policy to not return damaged goods back to the original seller until the item has been returned at least a few times. This seems to be what's happening.  \n\nI still find value from using Amazon and really hope they will fix this problem.  Clearly it's a sensitive subject.

{"id":"d2rc6jz","author":"Redditor_of_Rivia","body":"I left my career 3 years ago to buy and sell online full time. I worked 50-60+ hours a week at a salaried position making around $60k/year and was amazed when a guy who worked for me told me that he made about $10k/year extra with his wife by going to yard sales and selling on eBay. He used the extra income to pay for his grandkids' birthdays, Christmas, as well as his vacations during the year. \n\nI started going out on my weekends off in the fall of 2012 and 6 months later I was ready to leave my job for good. With $5k in savings, you have plenty of money saved up to get started and this is something you can easily try during your off time to see if you like it before you decide to quit your job. I currently make plenty of money to cover all of my bills and can work more or less depending on whether I want to make more money or enjoy more free time. There are tons of great, free resources out there to give you info on how to get started. I watched a lot of YouTube videos of others who did the same thing and I still watch them to try and learn as much as I can.\n\nThree years later, it was the best decision I ever made. My quality of life is much better. I have way more free time and leaving behind the stress of my former career is a huge blessing in and of itself. I almost never put in a 40 hour work week, yet still have enough to pay all my bills on time without worry. I have had months in the past where I worked 5 days a week, 12-15 hours a day for myself (something I'd have regularly done at my old salary job) and I would see immediate pay off making twice as much as I would on my previous salary. You definitely get back what you put in, so if you're gung-ho about it, you can absolutely make a killing. My lifestyle doesn't require that level of work, so I prefer to work less and enjoy more of my free time.  \n\nI sell on eBay, Amazon, Etsy as well as buying and selling locally. Yard sale season is just kicking in where I live, so this is the perfect time to get started. Salvation Army and Goodwill are also great resources and if there are any local mom and pop type thrift stores in your area, those are usually a great place to source as well. I think you could have a lot of fun doing it and seems to fit your \"freelance\" lifestyle. I'd be happy to help you get going if you are interested and want any tips.

I've got a very simply one with a different sheet (tab) for each year, and very straight forward columns: Description, Date Bought, Price, Bought From, Comments, Date Sold, Price, Sold To, Comments. This allows me to keep a history of how well I've done on similar/same items in the past as I come across them (this regards your comment for investing a few hundred into a single flip), gives me structure, and keeps me from forgetting anything. It not only gives me a history on the items I buy/sell, but also allows me to recognize easily when I've done business with the same party before, often times a successful meet allows me to leverage a better deal on my end given good history. T\n\n * For the rest I can't offer much, as I myself still only deal locally - I have not yet moved to eBay/Amazon and all the hassle of Shipping.

{"id":"d2rvero","author":"orapple","body":"God I hate online journalism sometimes. ComputerWorld sources their info from dramexchange, but they don't link it anywhere I can see. I tried googling for the source, but my keywords are pulling up only articles that spout the same claim and source it from dramexchange, but they point at the ComputerWorld article, or they straight up just source it from ComputerWorld. Can't find the original to check the methodology and that's worrying.\n\nFor one reason, a [different article](http://www.dramexchange.com/WeeklyResearch/Post/2/4309.html) I could find from dramexchange shows the price history of a 500gb HDD vs a 128gb HDD. It looks bad for the HDD, till you realize that manufacturers haven't been lowering costs for HDDs so much as increasing the capacity you get for the same $. Quite a long time ago, I got a 1tb HDD for $60. Rather than selling 1tb HDDs for $30, it's more likely I'll find in stores a 2 or 3tb drive for the same $60. So, why compare to a 500gb HDD? This specific market doesn't work like this.\n\nThe other issue I have with the CW article is that it claims prices are plateaued at 6 cents/gb, but a quick search on Amazon for a 4tb HDD brings up [this](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=4tb%20hdd) and you can clearly see that it's less than 3 cents/gb. So where the fuck is CW/dramexchange/Alan Chan/whoever getting their research from? Sure, enterprise drives cost differently (unless you're BackBlaze), but enterprise SSDs also cost more.\n\nBack to the Google paper, the key phrase I found intriguing was \"the growth rates in capacity/$ between disks and SSDs are relatively close\", implying that HDDs are getting cheaper at the same rate that SSDs for their usage is getting cheaper. At this point, I'm inclined to agree with Google more than CW/dramexchange/Alan Chen because I haven't seen the original source for that yet and I can easily find contradicting information. I would love to see the original research because I'm interested in this sector and don't want to make any misinformed decisions; I'm not tied down to the idea of HDDs over SSDs.\n\nIn fact, the very first thing I did when I bought my laptop previous to my current one was get rid of the HDD in favor of a Kingston SSD. Building a desktop, my first priority was also finding a SSD and then adding on an HDD as an afterthought later. I wholeheartedly agree that no one should have an HDD as their primary, but I've got this feeling that HDDs will reign supreme in the data center side of things for at least one more decade.","name":"t1_d2rvero","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-04 03:46:05","week":18}

Since it was \"damaged\" though, he got it for 2/3 the original price. Refurbished ones are nice so long as you make sure you are getting it from a person you trust. I personally do not trust buying refurbished online unless it is from a major retailer; no eBay or Amazon for me simply because anyone can put \"refurbished\" on their page. If you are in college, I suggest asking your school's IT office if they do refurbishing of your laptop. My school has this. You give them your laptop and a few weeks later they'll contact you and give you your laptop back.

I will often buy Amazon.com cards at the grocery store, but obviously there are dozens of stores to choose from.\n\n* 3% at gas stations.\n\n* 3% at major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others). \n\n* 1% on everything else.  \n\n* Varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back, $10 off a $10 purchase at walmart, $5 off a $5 purchase from itunes/app store, I have used all of these personally) that vary with time.  There are usually close to 100 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods.\n\n* An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.  Your eligible purchases can be covered when they're accidentally damaged or stolen for up to 90 days from the date of purchase with your Card.\n\n* Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).  A free yearly FICO score.\n\n* And perhaps the most important thing of all,... \"among the best customer satisfaction\" of all the credit card companies ( http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-us-credit-card-satisfaction-study ).\n\n* Last tidbit is a story I would like to share.  I was in Dallas, rented a car, apparently they have toll roads with no toll booths (not sure how a non-local would even pay the toll).  Got a $17 charge from some company in Arizona which I did not recognize.  Reported it to Amex as not authorized and they reversed the charges.  I later found out that it was for the unmarked toll (I guess they use some kind of out-of-state billing company).  So Amex gives you free tolls on rental cars (Joke,... but not really).\n\nThere is an annual fee of $75 but you get $150 as soon as you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months.","name":"t1_d2sa8ir","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-04 13:19:17","week":18}

Here are your pre-market news movers on this Wednesday morning-\n\n&gt; **Time Warner** — Time Warner earned an adjusted $1.49 per share for the first quarter, 19 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly above forecasts. The bottom line was helped by earnings growth at the HBO and Turner units.\n\n**TICKER SYMBOL:** TWX\n\n* [CHART](http://finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=TWX&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)\n\n(**[LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TWX)**)\n\n&gt; **Priceline Group** — The travel services website operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of $10.54 per share, outdistancing estimates of $9.65 a share.

I work from home so no transportation or gas costs. I cook all meals at home and almost never eat out. I don't drink coffee either and also prefer mostly water or mineral/sparkling water. I buy groceries in bulk from Costco every month or so and store it all in the freezer portioned, and only make one or two trips a month to restock on milk and veggies. Since we have no children, between two people in the household and the cats, we consume at a very slow rate. I also plant and use my own herbs. Outside of groceries, I also have Amazon monthly subscriptions that deliver all essential other stuff I need to me every few months.\n\nI guess if I reflect on it, be able to work remotely is the biggest reason it works out so well for me, as I certainly spent more often when I had to commute. The other big reason is probably not having kids.\n\nEdit: Lots of people are curious what I do for entertainment and I've probably responded to all the comments individually but I'll sum it up here: video games (primarily PC, PS4, WiiU and 3DS), netflix/tv/hbogo/movie nights at home, board game/bbqs with friends, hiking, volunteering and attending meetups, going to the beach or the lake or park (luckily all are within walking distance), attending gaming-related conventions throughout the year (often free for industry or a comped pass), movies (Costco tickets in bulk), gardening.

If my guess is correct and you're going to Amazon, you can join First Tech credit union right across the street from where you work.  If elsewhere, join BECU.  Heck, you can join BECU if you prefer.  Look them up online and read through all they have to offer.  \nAfter you establish credit you can look at a schwab account.  The schwab acct. has an interest bearing checking account and a brokerage account combined, world wide ATM reimbursement and no foreign transaction fee for using their debit card.\n\nIn the US, you'll want to get a visa or master card.  Amex has a lot of good cards but they are not as widely accepted here as you will want.  After you get here and establish your banking and get your first payment, you'll then want to apply for a credit card.  I'm stating that you want to do it this way in case they decide to do a financial review.  If they do, you want a payment record to show them as proof.  Anyway, once you get your pay record then consider which cards you want to apply for and then use the company websites to see what happens when you use their pre-qualification links.  I doubt they'll work for you, but it is worth a shot.  If you get no hits from the prequalify links, try for a simple card from Capital One.  Capital One is willing to take more risk than a lot of companies and they'll give you a fair deal, plus their quicksilver line of CCs have no foreign transaction fee.  **Avoid Credit One!**  They are predatory.  Once you've established credit for a bit, you should be good to go for a lot of really good cards.   \n\nGood luck.\n\n[here is a link of links for prequalifying sites, the Barclay link doesn't work](http://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/building-credit/minimize-risk-check-if-youre-pre-qualified-for-a-credit-card220647375)\n\nEdit: In your case, I would skip a secured card and try for a regular credit card.  If you're denied, I would contact them and ask for reconsideration.  Based off of job and income you'll probably get the card.  Just don't set your sites too high for the first one.","name":"t1_d2sjjd3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-04 17:48:45","week":18}
{"id":"d2sjvs4","author":"adamgalas","body":"Amzn web services is going to make this a monster cash flow machine in the coming years.\n\nCase in point, 2015 it earned $1.25 in profit off $107 billion in revenue, about 0.5% net margin.\n\nBy 2018 analysts predict it will hit $193 billion in sales and earn $15.8 per share or almost $8 billion in profits, nearly 15x increase in 3 years.\n\nProfit margin to expand from 0.5% to 4.1%. Better yet at some point Amazon's free cash flow will begin outstripping even Bezos's ability to spend cash on disrupting industries and they'll start building up a monster cash hoard ala apple or Google, aka alphabet.\n\nThat means buybacks that will start to bring down share count and balloon the free cash flow (aka \"owner earnings\") per share.\n\nThis will inevitably lead to dividends and finally let me buy the stock.\n\nHow long until we see all that? Depends on how many worlds Bezos's wants to conquer. Theoretically he could expand amazon internationally and grow prime to 250-500 million members eventually. That's $25-$50 billion in revenue right there. Aws? At some point it could represent the majority of the company's sales and could raise profit margin to 10% on $500,$600, even $700 billion in sales. That would make amazon the most profitable company in history.\n\nThe earliest I forsee buybacks is 2020, but most likely 2025, maybe not till 2035. Dividends start 5 years later so maybe not until 2040.\n\nI think that amazon is the most likely company to hit $1 trillion in market cap first, with Facebook and Google being neck and neck in second and third.\nWill the stock ever split?\n\nGreat question. Apple got to a high of $780 and only split so it would be added to the Dow jones industrial average which is share price weighted.\n\nIt's possible that Bezos's wants amazon to go to at least a thousand a share or even pull a Berkshire and never split and just have price rise for decades (Berkshire class a shares ipoed at $7 and hit a high of $240,000).\n\nRemember that price is irrelevant other than being able to efficiently buy.\n\nPersonally as someone who is broadly diversified I'd appreciate managemt pulling a 25:1 split anytime the price rises to over $250 a share because otherwise adding a single share can represent more capital than I want but never think that a $10 stock can double easier than a $1,000 stock.\n","name":"t1_d2sjvs4","subreddit":"RobinHood","subreddit_id":"t5_2uud8","created_utc":"2016-05-04 17:56:13","week":18}

We handle a lot of Amazon's delivery, so if your tracking number says it was delivered but you didn't get it, contact your local office.\nWe are able to use the GPS on the scanner to figure out where exactly it was delivered (to see if it was a misdelivery or a theft.) If it was misdelivered, the postal service will attempt to reclaim it, including but not limited to having the postal inspector and local authorities get involved. A USPS parcel is considered mail, and as such it's a felony to keep one that doesn't belong to you.\nIf the package was delivered to your house but you didn't get it, you can still contact the postal inspector.

However, some of the riskier/more growthy names that do not offer a dividend are - in some cases - much more appealing. I've mentioned Hain (HAIN) positively  in recent weeks and that is up nearly 10% today after the quarter. That stock has been obliterated along with Whole Foods and is much more appealing than some of the old school staples names. \n\nNeutral: Healthcare. Actually bullish on healthcare mid-to-longer term, but short-term I think the concern over healthcare prices and political theater will go for for a bit longer. Look for long-term opportunities. \n\nBullish: data center REITs. They've run up a lot so I would wait for a pullback, but I think the demand (http://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-microsoft-capital-spending-good-for-data-center-reits/?ven=YahooCP&amp;src=AURLLED&amp;ven=yahoo) continues onward. They are - I think - a nice growth and income play long-term.\n\nBullish: Financial tech: Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Fiserv (FISV), Jack Henry (JKHY), Global Payments (GPN) and others. I also like the exchange operators, particularly Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which reported a terrific quarter earlier today.\n\nBearish: The Mall. I so don't want to be in the mall. I don't want mall REITs, I don't want mall-centric retailers, I really, really don't want second/third-tier stores. Sears, JCP, Kohl's, Macy's and others are going to be closing stores and there will be continued moves towards e-commerce as Amazon continues to push forward. The era of the mall is over. That's not saying that there will be no malls, it's saying that many of the dime-a-dozen malls are going to be abandoned or repurposed and major mall operators are going to have to evolve. \n\nBullish: Food safety. Neogen (NEOG), Ecolab (ECL).\n\nBullish: Agriculture: some names compelling long-term holdings at these levels.\n\nBullish long-term: Protein consumption and anything related, including John Bean (JBT), Zoetis (ZTS), Cal-Maine (CALM), Tyson (TSN) and others.\n\nBearish: MLPs. This is not saying that MLPs are going away, but I think the future of the asset class will be limited at best. The absolute obliteration of many pipeline MLPs over the last year I think stunned many retail investors who viewed them as reasonably safe income and that the business model based heavily on volume was to some degree insulated from commodity fluctuations.

Mainly to do with currency hedges related to foreign asset purchases (M&amp;A).\n\nThis was an absolute blowout, and the earnings call was VERY much improved.  The transparency keeps getting better, and that alone should provide some stability for the stock.  I am actually pretty surprised they are so close to break-even on the cloud.  It sounds like they will be cloud profitable within the year, although they didn't commit to that yet.  The fact they expect the growth to continue to be triple digit was encouraging, although they are starting from a smaller base than AMZN and MSFT for now.\n\nI think the big takeaway is if they could do this in the middle of the China trough... wow.  I remember when I saw the 120 valuation, I thought people were nuts, but if China can recover and they continue to grow like this, that may be justified at some point.  Mobile hasn't seemed to capture people's interest as much this quarter, but that was a big win, as it had been a major concern.

So you need to weigh your monthly expenses to your return - but generally speaking UR is going to come out on top in terms of value for everyday spending.\n\nLet's say you value SPG at 3CPP and UR at 2CPP... just using the Freedom Unlimited at 1.5% - you are earning SPG and UR at the same net worth on using either card.  That's with no bonus categories or anything else which you would get from other UR earning cards.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I like SPG more anyway... it's my everyday card.

{"id":"d2uyah7","author":"will_shatners_pants","body":"I studied elec engineering and have a M.Fin and work in finance but don't value equities, so i am a layman too.\n\nThat's the thing with valuation, there are so many [ways](http://www.ftpress.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2109325&amp;seqNum=6) to assess it. Many will say it is overvalued, others will say it is undervalued. \n\nIt's pretty clear that the current value has huge growth forecasts built into it so it then comes down to whether you believe the assumptions underlying the growth forecasts. Is there going to be a transition to electric autonomous transportation in the timeframe suggested by Tesla? Are the products Tesla makes/will make good enough to beat any competition in this space? Will battery storage get cheap enough in conjunction with renewables to replace current energy production? Is the management team capable of following through on the huge execution risk? Can competitors move into the space quickly? Will the plan be inhibited or assisted by legislation? \n\nMy personal opinion is positive for most of these questions. for the following reasons:\n\n    Is there going to be a transition to electric autonomous transportation in the timeframe suggested by Tesla?\n\nElectric vehicles appear to be better for the environment (depending on elec source), the drive train is simpler, more efficient and powerful than an internal combustion engine. Batteries appear to be following a slow but steady increase in energy per dollar and i have not read anything that suggests this will stop. We are seeing routine but incremental movements in the direction to autonomy from Google, Tesla and many traditional vehicle manufacturers, the large ridesharing companies are moving in that direction and there are a lot of tech companies trying to do the same thing (AAPL, Faraday, many Chinese internet giants). In related fields Amazon is testing autonomous drones, SpaceX and Blue Origin have automated significant portions of their launches. Warren Buffet has invested in BYD which suggests other clever investors like the sector/direction (even if they don't invest in Tesla). These are all positive.\n\n    Are the products Tesla makes/will make good enough to beat any competition in this space?\n\nConsumer Reports gives them the highest customer satisfaction rating of any vehicle manufacturer, although there have been some reliability issues in early production models. Again positive.\n\n    Will battery storage get cheap enough in conjunction with renewables to replace current energy production?\n\nseems that way but it is anyone's guess. certainly can't rule it out. Prices have come down dramatically and i haven't found anything to suggest they have hit a floor, there is plenty of room left to use economies of scale even if there was no technical innovation.\n\n    Is the management team capable of following through on the huge execution risk?\n\nMusk is probably the single best manager on earth at the moment, how can someone who is a part time CEO of two companies do so much? That said, the timeframes stated are insanely short. I think you can bank on them being late but it is probable they will get there. Tesla has also hired some amazing people in many areas.  This is iffy for me overall, I'd expect huge changes in share value depending on timing but in the longer term are likely to achieve their goals.\n\n    Can competitors move into the space quickly?\n\nPossibly if they team up, Google autonomous tech with traditional car manufacturers production and body knowledge. Unsure how quickly batteries can scale but these large companies certainly have enough balance sheet to make something happen in a reasonable timeframe, but obviously they are behind Tesla's production. Probably unlikely that these companies will get their shit together as quickly as a single focused company can move. Can there be a quick ramp in battery raw material production? unsure, but there could well be a price squeeze if demand jumps, while Tesla have their sources locked in. Moderately positive on this front.\n\n    Will the plan be inhibited or assisted by legislation? \n\nThere are already plenty of subsidies helping EV's get off the ground. some Euro countries are starting to contemplate banning the sale of IC engines next decade. positive overall. Autonomous will be risky for any government to legislate, plenty of trials going on though. I have a moderate to negative view on this in the medium term.\n\nOverall I think they will grow into their current valuation and then the next round of growth forecasts will be baked in. My guess is that there will be plenty of Kodak's in the auto industry over the next 15 years as older manufacturers are too slow to move.

Then I clicked the Utility category which has an image of a band that looks like the Hermes strap, and again no strap like that in your catalog. If you're going to feature watch bands on your home page, they damn well better be for sale on your site. There's nothing more frustrating than seeing something you like, clicking through, only to find out that it's not even listed for sale. If I found your site and clicked through I'd bounce back to Google in a second and be on to the next site.\n\nNext, *who are you*?? The About page has almost no information about the company, who founded it, why, etc. Anybody can sign up for a Shopify account, but you have to **build trust** to get people to give you their credit card.

Phone number? Live chat? Physical address? Prove you're a real company and not some kid in his mother's basement (and if you *are* some kid in his mother's basement, try to at least look professional).\n\n* **Policies and Terms** What's the return policy? Where are the instructions? Where can I send an item back? How are items shipped? What if it arrives defective? How long does shipping take?

{"id":"d2v9zfl","author":"PM_ME_YOUR_RATTIES","body":"So, you have a lot of high interest cards, but not huge balances on them.\n\n**Stop spending on entertainment.** No eating out, no movies, no clothes. EVERY item you buy is financed at 25%+, because that's your highest interest rate. Until you get ALL of your credit card debt gone, nothing else matters. You pay bills, buy groceries, and cook at home. Entertainment is library or your existing subscriptions, and you should look at thinning them out, too- do you really need to pay for Spotify?\n\nSince there are some variables, like gas, not included, let's assume you have ~$2500/month available for debt repayment (and that gas card is paid in full each month, so that comes out of the other expenses, not this $2500 we're using for debt repayment). At first, a chunk of that's going to be servicing debts, but that will change.\n\nWhen does the Chase card grace period end? Most setups like that back charge interest if it isn't paid in full by that date, so you will definitely want to pay it off before that happens.\n\nHere's your first month action plan on the debt:\n\n* Credit One. This is a small balance, only $270, at a 24% interest rate, with a $50 (!!) annual fee. Get rid of it, then close it. The annual fee makes the 24% interest rate much higher, since you pay extra for the privilege of that rate.\n\n* Torrid. This is your highest interest rate, so it goes next. $640 balance gone.\n\n* Ashley Stuart. Another 25% interest rate, so it goes. $130.\n\n* Chase. This is dependent on when that grace period ends on the Chase card, but let's assume it's the Chase card, as your intro period is up in, say, July or August, so it's a priority. The remaining $855 goes here.\n\nSo after one month, you've paid off three cards and half of a third. Your monthly debt servicing was at $780, and is now down to $605.\n\nMonth two action plan:\n\n* Chase. This should be ~$900 to finish.\n\n* Capital One. Capital One gets hit now. This gets everything you have left, which is $995 (or so).\n\nAfter your second month, you now have a completely paid off a fourth card and are most of the way through a fifth. Your monthly debt servicing is now down to $455.\n\nMonth three action plan:\n\n* Capital One. Finish it. Should be somewhere around $380.\n\n* Amazon. You don't list the interest rate, but I'm betting it matches the Capital One and Chase cards. Kill it. $840 down.\n\n* Tires Plus. Next in line at 22%, so this goes now. $700 (since the last two months should knock that $8 off).\n\n* Wells Fargo. This is at 21%...and your last card. You only have an extra ~$700 to throw at it above your normal payment, but that brings it down to $60-70.\n\nSo, at the end of three months, you have ~$70 left on any cards. Congratulations!\n\nYou're not done yet.\n\nMonth four:\n\n* Wells Fargo. ~$70 for freedom from this last CC debt.\n\n* Emergency Fund. You want, long term, to have 3-6 months of expenses in your savings, which is ~$7500-$15000. However, you have some other high interest debt, so let's not go that far; let's get one month's worth; the balance of your debt repayment money goes here.\n\n* One small extravagance. You may buy one extra, not to exceed $100, for your family as a reward for getting this far.\n\nNext up, you tackle that car loan. 12% is ruinous for that kind of note. All $2500 you had for debt repayment goes here until it is gone. This is done in five more months, bringing us to month ten.\n\nMonth ten, you get another treat, not to exceed $200. You've had a long road to get here, but you have. You are now debt free!\n\nBack to the Emergency Fund. The good news is that you no longer need to factor in the car payment, and you can re-evaluate your insurance needs. Combined, this should bring down your necessary expenses per month by $350+, meaning that your $2200 E-fund is now equal to a full month's expenses. Topping this off at 3 months will take less than three months savings, with six months expenses taking about five more months.\n\nOnce your E-fund is complete, you can loosen your spending habits a little bit. Your ~50% savings rate is not necessary any more, so you can start looking at taking a vacation, or buying things now and then that are pure luxury items, not necessities. Just don't go overboard, and keep at least 20% savings happening- you will need to retire at some point!","name":"t1_d2v9zfl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-06 18:10:41","week":18}

Also, I'm not sure that any of the major office supply chains will let you buy a $500 VGC with a credit card (and anything less than $500 really makes it not worth it, you want to get the most you can since the fee is the same whether you load $20 or $500). Staples sells $300 VGCs online with a $9.00 fee, which absolutely is not worth it, but I think there are occasionally deals on them, but TBH, I don't pay a whole lot of attention.\n\nAlso, Office Depot (and probably Staples, but there aren't any in my area) sell gift cards to other stores with no fees. The other day, I had to make a $300 purchase from Amazon, so I bought a $300 Amazon GC from OD with my Ink. Boom. 5x on Amazon.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that any purchase protections your credit card has go out the window when you use GCs.

Also, look into couponing for household goods, as those are easy to coupon for at CVS and Walgreens ( [Have a link](http://www.southernsavers.com/cvs-weekly-ad-deals/) )\n\n*  Dry Cleaning is probably not going to get any cheaper, but if you can find machine-washable versions of things you dry-clean currently, that will save you money in the long run.\n\n*  Look at what you're buying from amazon/ikea/walmart and see if they're \"needs\" or \"wants.\"  If you have amazon prime, consider not renewing it/cancelling it and asking for a partial refund.

Many household things you can buy at walmart can also be found at dollar stores, so if you don't need super high quality stuff/a lot of the product, consider going to a local dollar store instead.\n\n*  Restaurants:  the biggest reduction is going to be \"going less,\"  but if that's not an option, consider:  \n\n&gt;  Have fewer drinks (if drinking), or pregame if going to bars with friends.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  Ordering just an entree or just an appetizer, instead of both\n&gt;\n&gt;  Going to places with specials (lunch specials, happy hour, etc)","name":"t1_d2vwy7f","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-07 03:49:50","week":18}

We work from home, and the work is either on the computer or in the workshop making books (which is our converted garage). So, it's easy to get distracted and be self-motivated some days.\n\nWe put up a few things when Amazon Handmade got started. But as we're just a two person business with no employees, we simply don't create enough product to make money selling on Amazon. It's an excellent platform for some, but for our particular small biz, the fees were simply too high.\n\nAs far as marketing... \n\n* I got a lucky break early on when [I was Etsy's featured seller.](www.etsy.com/blog/en/2010/featured-seller-secretsafebooks/) It got me enormous exposure, and the shop sold out in one day, (not that I had a ton of stuff at that time, but I think it was over 30 sales which was huge at the time).\n\n* [Here's one advertorial](http://groomsadvice.com/2010/09/21/groomsmen-hidden-flask-books/) we bought on The Man Registry's Groom's Advice blog we purchased that has brought us sales over time, because it's on a blog where the content remains on it, and people come upon it when searching for groomsmen gifts.\n\n* We do [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/SecretSafeBookscom/193138904044805), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/secretsafebooks/), and haven't yet figured out Instagram, but I know that is gold for a lot of people. \n\n* A recent thing I did in r/Pics (which was within reddiquette!)\n[\"7 yrs ago, I quit my day job as a museum gallery guard to handcraft secret safe books, here are five of them..\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/486ldk/7_yrs_ago_i_quit_my_day_job_as_a_museum_gallery/).

{"id":"d2w0vq8","author":"KnowledgeNate","body":"I guess it really depends on your risk appetite. You're in a position at 26 years old that very few people in the world will ever get to. However, you also said that you come from a wealthy family, which suggests to me that you could probably lose money and still be fine, at least financially.\n\nSo, I'd first answer the fundamental question: how much are you able to  invest, assuming you lose it all, and assuming that you won't spiral into destitution? Whenever I invest, I'm prepared to lose every single penny.  What are the consequences of losing the full $500K? Did you put up collateral? Is the relationship at stake? Is your reputation at stake? Does he \"own\" you now? Are you beholden to him in anyway?  Personally, $500K is not nearly enough to \"buy\" me.\n\nWith that preface in mind, there a lot of different things you could do:\n\n-Invest 95% in safest assets possible and the other 5% in high risk, high reward bets - this could be in the start up space, tech space, or any other risky bets. NNT refers to this as the \"barbell\" strategy. You could also buy out-of-the-money options to make short plays on indexes every day (thus bleeding small amounts every day) and wait for a market crash, and then exercise all the options at huge gains. You may not have enough principal to do this though.\n\n-You could do nothing. Retire. Sit and read about investing for the next 1-2 years. Learn everything possible, start tracking companies quarterly financials, learn them intimately, and then wait. And wait. And wait for a market crash, in which many equities will be priced at fire sale values. Luck is when preparation meets opportunity. Start preparing for a huge crash. Have the gun-powder at the ready. And then plunder and pillage everything in site.  The best investors are able to control themselves for years, decades even, sitting on their thumbs, playing bridge, and waiting for Valhalla.\n\n-NYC is the best real estate market in the world, and frankly, will never not be.  If I were you, I might buy something in Queens or certain parts of Brooklyn that have tremendous appreciation velocity. Pay attention to transportation and subway lines. \n\n-Work within whatever circles of competence you may have. Study that circle ferociously and invest accordingly.\n\n-Start a strip club in Manhattan.  You have people, you have money, you have pretty girls. Everywhere.\n\n-Study the FANGs. I mean really fucking studying them.  I could be buying into the hype like everyone else, but I can't fathom a scenario in which the FANGs aren't around in 10 years.  AMZN in particular, though seemingly over-priced, seems like a monopoly in the making. I myself witness the death of LARGE retailers every day. But I'm an investing hack.\n\n-Bitcoin. Just kidding. But who knows, maybe take a tiny position where the payoff will be so large it won't matter that it's a small position.\n\n-Purchase more equity in your existing company.  Your incentives are completely aligned, you know the management well, I'm assuming you've learned a ton about the space just by being a large shareholder - and buy/sell accordingly. You will naturally care the most about this investment, since this is where you have the most to lose. \n\n-Become a NYC seed tech investor. Hit up every single tech event possible. Have allotments of $10,000-$25,000 to invest per company, and hope and pray that 1/100 hits.\n\n-Don't worry about becoming as rich as fast as the next guy. There will always be guys making more money at a faster rate than you. Be happy with what you have.\n\n-Do all the compounding calculations with respect to fixed income investments and find out the size of the principal amount you need in order to sustain yourself and the lifestyle you want for the rest of time. Work towards that principal amount and then GTFO.\n\n-Consider an amount of money that will permanently free you from forced employment - take it, and don't ever look back. You will now be rich in money AND TIME.  Don't focus on building wealth anymore, focus on building the richest life for yourself. Consider helping others. \n\n-Personally speaking, I wouldn't fuck with too many broader equity investments. You're not exposed to huge growth scenarios, and frankly its a game that a very small amount of people can win over time.  Luck plays a HUGE role in this.\n\nEnding caveat: I'm a hack.","name":"t1_d2w0vq8","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-07 05:58:36","week":18}

Whether you choose a broad mutual fund, ETF or single equity it doesn't really matter. IF you do choose a single equity, I would stick with a single substantial company and also understand there will be more volatility in your investment. Any holding of Berk would work, AMZN, GOOG or something with many large institutional holders.  On the ETF route SPY is a no-brainer. You'll have a non-trivial amount of money in a few years. \n\nThe other piece of advice I would give is invest in real estate. One of my colleagues told me to use part of my bonus as a down payment on a small track house and to lease it out at effectively a break even lease rate. After a few years you build enough equity in the house to buy another and do the same thing. Not only do you get good tax write offs but you are also building a portfolio of rental properties that becomes substantial over time and you're using your renters money to do it.

{"id":"d2w3559","author":"jacobwheeler","body":"Haven't made a deal on r/gcx yet but from what a couple others have told me, the sender of PayPal money has to pay a fee to PayPal (I believe 30 cents + 2.9%). So the absolute most you can sell that $1 Amazon GC for is 67 cents. And no one is going to offer you 67 cents for it if they are going to have to pay 33 cents in fees to PayPal.\n\nI have been able to send PayPal money before to friends and also merchants without ever having to pay a fee though. I don't know why other people are being charged a fee. Apparently you get charged a fee if you use your debit or credit card. But not if you use your paypal balance or draw from your bank account with PayPal. But I am pretty sure I used my credit card tied to my PayPal account when I sent money to a friend. I'm pretty sure I didn't use my bank account.\n\nHonestly if I were you I would rather just trade that $1 gift card for bitcoin and then gamble it at a bitcoin casino. That's what I did with my bitcoin faucet money and when I got paid ~2190uBTC (1USD at the time) for doing offers (installing/running apps). Faucet money and petty bitcoin payments are practically worthless. No one is going to bother trading you cash for 2220uBTC. But if you win a 50x bet (&lt;2% chance) with a $1 wager and walk away with $50 worth of bitcoin, you can trade it for cash. All of a sudden that petty bitcoin change becomes a $50 bill.\n\nBitcoin miner fees are microscopic compared to PayPal. Bitcoin miner fees are as little as 2072 satoshi.

There is a level of security, access, and convince that some people are willing to pay a premium for. Because of this dealers need to become more competitive. The loosening of the laws help them in this too. They feel more free to deal to new people. But they also are doing better customer service I find. No longer can a dealer leave you waiting around or be flaky. You'll say fuck it and just go to the local shop. The easiest way for Street pot to compete is price.

My income doubled when I used just Amazon links vs. just add-to-carts. With add-to-cart buttons, I believe people are put off the confirmation  screen where it asks them to confirm adding the items to the cart.\n\nContrary to popular belief, all Amazon links have a 90 day cookie, not just the add-to-cart ones. What I mean is, suppose a visitor clicks on your standard Amazon aff link and adds any item to the cart. Now even if they buy that item after 24 hours or 24 days, you will get commission for that item. It is not just the add to cart button that has the 90 day cookie. But if they do not add the item to the \ncart AND do not buy it within 24 hours, you dont get any commission.\n\nFrom [Amazon](https://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/help/t2/a11):\n*\"You earn advertising fees on any qualifying items placed in a customer's Shopping Cart within 24 hours of their arrival at Amazon.co.uk via your Associates link. However, this 24-hour window closes once the customer submits his order or reenters Amazon.co.uk through another Associate's link. Once the window is closed, you will not earn advertising fees on any subsequent purchases. However, if the customer then returns to Amazon.co.uk through one of your Associates links, this opens a new 24-hour window.*\n*It is of course possible that a customer may arrive at Amazon.co.uk via your Associates link, add an item to his Shopping Cart, and then leave Amazon.co.uk without placing an order.* **As long as the item was added to the customer's Shopping Cart during this 24-hour window, you will still earn a referral fee if the order is placed before the Shopping Cart expires (usually after 90 days).** *The referral fee will not be credited to your Associates account until the customer has purchased the item, accepted delivery, and remitted full payment to Amazon.co.uk.\"*\n\nI would rather the person not get put off my website and continue clicking my affiliate links till then find something worth adding to their cart of their own volition, than get irritated because of the confirmation screen and go off to my competitors niche site!\n\nSo my advice is just try to get people to Amazon - they are experts at conversion, let them do that bit and pay you for the lead!\n\nCheers\nPiiGirl","name":"t1_d2w7yhw","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-07 12:19:25","week":18}

It's still artificially influencing the market, it's still not viable for individual sellers on Amazon, and it's still pointless to complain about in this sub.\n\nSecond, OP asserted that if demand for an item was high and your price is fair (note: OP said \"fair,\" as in appropriate for the market, not \"high,\" which is what you assumed) then once the low sellers exhaust their inventory your sales will come in.  You misconstrued \"fair\" as being out of pace with market demand, which is the exact opposite of its definition.\n\nFinally, and ironically, your examples actually make OP's case.  In the case of the Zune kits you were selling, supply far exceeded demand.  Let's be honest: Microsoft made a huge push for an iPod-killer.  America responded with a resounding and near-unanimous \"no thank you!\"  You were making some money selling to the small minority of folks that were into the Zune.  But when supply far exceeded demand, major retailers like Best Buy dropped prices and clearanced out supply.  Small-scale resellers misjudged the market, bought in, flooded the market with low-demand low-priced goods, and further eroded your sales.  The demand was never there, so this doesn't disprove OP's scenario whatsoever (which was predicated on high demand, or demand exceeding supply).  And in this case, the fair market price (the price which the market demands) was below what you paid.\n\nThe invisible hand giveth, and the invisible hand taketh away.","name":"t1_d2w8l5w","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-07 13:02:36","week":18}

There are usually close to 100 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods.\n\n* An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.  Your eligible purchases can be covered when they're accidentally damaged or stolen for up to 90 days from the date of purchase with your Card.\n\n* Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).

{"id":"d2xkke2","author":"Peggy_Ice","body":"Sorry but you have flawed logic here in assuming what's good for Jeff is good for all of his investors. \n\nUnlike Jeff Bezos, virtually every other investor in Amazon is highly diversified, from retail investors exposed through index funds to teachers exposed through their public pensions. \n\nIn other words, no CEO should try to diversify on behalf of shareholders because they are perfectly capable of diversifying themselves. For example, Coca Cola can diversify itself by buying Zynga but that's just stupid. Coke executives are good at managing Coke, not at buying technology companies. Any investor in Coke, however, is perfectly capable of buying a share of Zynga to diversify his own portfolio. \n\nThe best way Amazon can serve its shareholders is by being really really good at being Amazon, not at all by diversifying its businesses. \n\nLet's think through a hypothetical scenario where I am the CEO of Amazon and by law I have to have 100% of my wealth tied up in the company. In that case my incentive would be to lower the volatility of Amazon via getting into unrelated businesses. It might lower the overall return of my assets, but outweighing that is it would massively lower my volatility. It would improve what is called my portfolios sharpe ratio - the ratio of my average return less the risk free rate to my average volatility.\n\nThis isn't my view - it's an academic and widely accepted view of portfolio theory. Take a look at the Wikipedia article for the Sharpe Ratio and you'll see why the incentives are set up this way.

{"id":"d2xoade","author":"XxShortBusHeroXx","body":"One of the higher end Roku's would seem to meet most of your requests, however their cost is a bit higher than other options. The models which can play USB content seem to run from around $70 - $100 USD, so it will depend on how much you'd like to spend. I have several Chromecast ($35.99) as well as a Roku Streaming Stick ($49.99), and I think both are good options. They do go about their duties a bit differently, however. These two options do not have USB ports, so they can't play content directly on the device, but there is at least a workaround for this if you're fine with sacrificing USB capability for streaming over your home network. \n\n**User Interface**\n\nBoth devices do stream the content directly to the TV, so no difference there really, it's more or less just how you get to your content. The Roku stick came with a small dedicated remote, and it uses its own user interface you navigate through on the TV. The Chromecast doesn't really have a UI, instead you're using your phone or a tablet as a remote and navigating to the media you want to stream to the TV via applications on your phone. Roku does have this ability as well, at least for some applications I believe, but I don't use it a lot to know which ones may be able to do this. \n\nMy parents prefer the Roku for the remote and they find the interface a bit more intuitive to use. Kids and less tech savvy folk may also lean this way since it is pretty easy to pickup and go. Both accomplish the end result pretty well, so this is mostly up to your preferences and who the users might be.\n\n**Services**\n\nThey both do have a lot of the same services available. Both have Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Go, as well as Google Play Movies, Youtube, MLB.tv and others. I do know Chromecast DOES NOT have Amazon Video, while the Roku does, if that is something you use. I believe Spotify requires a subscription in order to stream to the Roku, but the free version does work with the Chromecast TV dongle. If you use Spotify Premium, it shouldn't affect you, but if not then the Roku will lack that feature for you. For volume control, but most apps through the Chromecast allow you to control volume through your phone, and I'm guessing Spotify will allow you to do this as well. I'm not sure if Roku has this feature or not.\n\n**Local Content** (the workaround)\n\nAs I said, some of the Roku's can play local content off a USB drive, but you would need one of the higher end models in order to do so. The new models can get a bit pricey, but you might be able to find an older gen for a bit cheaper than current gen. The good news is however both Chromecast and the Roku Streaming Stick can use Plex, which is a free program/application. Plex can act as a media server on your computer, and stream your content directly from your computer over your network to your dongles. The application you'd be looking at is called Plex Media Server, if you're curious to check it out a bit more. It's quite a handy application, and it organizes content very well. Content would need to be separated between TV Shows, Movies, and Music for it to work the best, but the program does most of the organizing for you. It grabs posters and movie info automatically for you. Plex can also help convert content for you if for some reason the file type isn't compatible with the device you're trying to stream to. The user interface is very nice on Plex, and it can keep track of watched/unwatched content, remember where you've left on on shows and movies between devices among a lot of other things. It is pretty easy to set up as well, and once it is going it can be pretty much left alone.\n\nI will note, Plex does work best if the computer the Plex server is on is connected via an Ethernet cable rather than WiFi. When mine was on WiFi, some content struggled at times, but it tended to be really large super HD files. Through Ethernet I don't experience these issues and playback is smooth.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send me a message.
