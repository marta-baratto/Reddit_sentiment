Even if they don't buy anything on your lists, you will still get rewarded for getting people on the site.

It will be seen by Shopswell users and you could help them out by getting them some sales.\n\n\nHere's some lists I have made to give you an idea of what you should be doing:\n\nhttps://www.shopswell.com/lists/mindy-macfarlane-wishlist\n\nhttps://www.shopswell.com/lists/mindy-macfarlane-baby-gaga\n\nhttps://www.shopswell.com/lists/mindy-macfarlane-dream-big\n\nhttps://www.shopswell.com/lists/mindy-macfarlane-geeky-goodness\n\nhttps://www.shopswell.com/lists/mindy-macfarlane-live-fast-die-pretty-xoxo\n\nhttps://www.shopswell.com/lists/mindy-macfarlane-tasty-d\n\n\nHave fun with the site!

{"id":"3t3soz","author":"longtailwriting","body":"First off: **Thank you very much for this forum!** I got a lot of feedback on my previous post [\"18 days after starting FBA: The addiction has begun\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/3p97gx/18_days_after_starting_fba_the_addiction_has_begun/). I wanted to expand on my original post a bit. \n\n\n*Three major things have changed since my last post:*\n\n* I cancelled Inventory Lab ($40/mo)\n* I downgraded my Amazon Pro\n* I discovered my \"floor\" (**Explained below**) - $7.99 \n\n\n\n\nEach book costs me $3 to get to Amazon's shelf + cost of book. Here is how I got to that number:\n \n\n\n* $1.50 - ship with Inventory Placement (.30/item) \n* $1 - Amazon Non-Pro\n* $0.25 - FBA Scan and packing stuff/labels\n* $0.20 - Gas for my car\n* $0.05 - Shelf space at Amazon\n\n\n\n(Inventory Placement is a luxury I enjoy very much.)\n\n\n\nMy cost of books has been about 0.5 per book. Furthermore, for every sale, I keep 52% after Amazon Fees [pick and pack, referral, etc].\n\nSo if I buy a book for 50 cents and sell it at 7.99 that sounds like a huge margin, right?\n&gt;$7.99 -&gt; $4.15  (Amazon Fees)\n\n&gt;$4.15 -&gt; $0.65 (Cost to buy the book and get it on Amazon's shelf)\n\n&gt;4 minutes to find book with scanner. 4 minutes to list book. \n\n&gt;That's an hourly wage of $8.13 (Below minimum wage in my state -Washington-)\n\n\n\n\n*It would make more sense to flip a burger than a book at that point.*\n\n\n\nI still love it though; why? Because my average sale price is about **$13, not $7.99**. \n\n\nI've been getting 20 books in 45 min lately; $65.2. That puts me at $32.6/hourly wage. (I try to only sell sub 1 million sales rank)\n\n\nI then take all the profit and invest it back in, and it keeps growing! I feel like I am actually building something here. \n\n\n\n    TL;DR I am making about $30/hr even after all expenses via flipping books; though I have to keep a close eye on costs.\n\n","name":"t3_3t3soz","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-17 03:40:44","week":47}

It's super easy to use and a great catch especially if you EVER shop online. After making an account (completely free and takes less than 30 seconds), you just type in the store you want to purchase from and click on \"Shop Now\" to be directed to the store's site. Then the store's site will pop up and you just shop on like normal.\n\n[REFERRAL LINK TO EBATES](http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=KwcD-XTZ8bx0nRwInHCGjw%0D%0A&amp;eeid=26471)\n\n[LINK TO EBATES](http://www.ebates.com)\n\nDepending on the store, you'll get a certain percentage of cash back for your purchase. For example, Sephora is 8% cash back right now. So if you spend $100, Ebates will add $8 to your account (usually takes about 24-48 hours). BEST PART IS THOUGH-THERE'S NO MINIMUM! So even if you buy something for $3, you'll still have the chance to earn cash back on it as long as you go through Ebates. I can tell you first hand, those cents add up!\nFour times a year Ebates will pay you, either via check or PayPal. I've been using Ebates for about a year and a half now and have received about $100 in total...

{"id":"3t60hi","author":"Spythe","body":"So I was helping someone in another thread and decided to do an Inventory Placement breakdown to see if it actually saved you money. Turns out on my previous shipment it would of actually costed me a bit more. Here is the post and why I'm not a fan of Inventory placement.\n\n1 thing I'm not 100% sure on is once you sign up for Inventory Placement do all items cost the .30 or its just items that wouldn't have gone your chosen fulfillment center hub?\n\nOne example is I shipped 105 items a few days ago.\n\n* 15ish to MD(17.5lbs), cost - 7.96\n\n* 25ish to CA(14 lbs), cost - 7.77\n\n* 30ish to Dallas(30 lbs), guessing would be my main center since I live in Houston. Cost 8.89\n\n* 40ish to IN(45.1 lbs), cost 14.98\n\n* Total without Inventory Place - 39.6(actually looked everything up)\n\n* So lets say all the items went to Dallas, that puts me at spending 24 dollars just for Inventory place. Now that would require at least 2 boxes, possible 3 so I save at best 2 boxes so that is about 4 to 5 dollars for Home Depo boxes, tape, void fill. So best case I saved 20 dollars sending items to 1 place for shipping supplies(which isn't 100% certain with Inventory place just the same SKUs) before account for the shipment difference.\n\n* For me to send items to Dallas from Houston its roughly .30c a lb(when using 1 box, could go up with more than 1 box.). So it would of been $31.98(if everything to Dallas BUT that isn't 100% certain even with Inventory Placement).\n\n* Total with Inventory placement - 31.98(for shipment) + 20(inventory placement fee) = 51.95. So it was actually a lot more to send this exact same shipment with Inventory Placement. Now if you want to take into account how much easier it is to handle a shipment with all your items going to 1 place that is worth something.\n\nAll fit in one box for each location, but the one that went to TN arrived before the Dallas and all items went live as soon as they got there. Ended up selling 4 of the multiplies before the day was over. Now my Dallas shipment arrived but only 1 went live with 2 to 3 other getting shipped somewhere else. So now at least 2 are back ordered. Instead of dealing with Amazon moving your item around(I think its still not 100% avoidable), you send your item to the location it will go live at instead of having a higher transfer chance. If all my same SKUs arrived at Dallas maybe only 1 or 2 of that item would of went live instead of 4.\nJust 3 days ago I found a crazy deal with RA for 4 of the same item. So I got them shipped out that same day and all went to Dallas. 1 went live and now the 3 others are back order til the 18th.\n","name":"t3_3t60hi","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-17 16:34:19","week":47}

{"id":"3t8go2","author":"sturnado","body":"I'm going to be 30 in less than two months. I'm currently working through a temp agency for an internet company replying to users who write in via email. I've been at this company since early spring, when they hired me they told me the introduction period was 90 days after which I could apply for full time. Around day 60 they changed the introductory period to 180+ days. I've now put over seven months into this job, am making $34k/year, I have no PTO, no sick time, and no health benefits. My job is mindless and dull.\n\nI have a GED and most of my work experience is in corporate banking (low level sales and low level management). I've felt like my life has had no direction for... well... my entire adult life really.\n\nI've never really cared for any job I've had with some very limited exceptions, such as when I had a manager I loved or got along wonderfully with my coworkers, but truth be told I do not like the idea of busting my ass 40+ hours a week for the rest of my life making some rich stranger even more money while I struggle to make my car payments.\n\nI only have about $1,000 saved up. I have two ideas for businesses, one of which is just an Amazon reseller business that I first learned about after purchasing a Udemy course on making $10k/month selling on Amazon. The other business idea I do not want to keep to myself for now, needless to say there's a hell of a lot more work and money that would be needed to make it work.\n\nI'm terrified at the prospect of actually starting down this road as my entire life has pretty much been the following:\n\n1. Have great idea\n2. Gradually lose interest\n3. Completely ignore idea\n4. Go to work, go home, play video games until I go to bed\n\nMy father was the exact same way minus the video games, and I'm terrified I'll wind up like him - in massive debt, living alone with no real friends or close family to speak of, without enough money to heat my home past 55 degrees in the winter.\n\nI don't need massive piles of cash to be happy. I think I would be happy building something myself and watching it grow under my care, yet my inability to remain motivated on any area for long concerns me greatly.\n\nI already decided I want to get out of my current job, the company atmosphere is changing and it is not for the better, and how they handled extending the introductory period left a sour taste in my mouth. It seems as if I put time and effort into this position but have almost nothing to show for it, other than the fact that it has paid my bills.\n\nMaybe I have ADD, maybe I had a shitty upbringing, maybe I'm just a lazy asshole. I don't know why I am the way I am with regards to self-discipline, but I know if I keep going the way I am I will never be happy with myself or my life.\n\nWhat would you entrepreneurs recommend? Should I first start searching for another job or should I just put in the hours at my current one and attempt to get an Amazon reselling business off the ground?\n\nHow do you or did you personally find motivation and, most importantly, the discipline to follow through?","name":"t3_3t8go2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-18 02:09:59","week":47}

{"id":"3tap93","author":"AwesomeFaic","body":"Edit: I should have titled this to \"influence actions\", not specifically purchasing\n\nI've recently started a small Amazon Affiliates store that's built on the notion that there are people interested in buying niche products but don't know what to buy and for what reasons. So I built [Venturious](http://www.venturio.us). Right now I have one product category with a good bit of text explaining basic keywords the average person may not know, followed by brand sections with a short paragraph with the short history and significance of the brand. Lastly, there is a high resolution image of each product the user can click to go to the Amazon page. Each image has an informative caption but with a more \"sales-y\" vibe, hoping to push them to click through to Amazon.\n\nStructure aside (general information -&gt; specific information -&gt; sales), are there good resources about structuring text to push users towards an action or type of action? I'm thinking more specifically than \"use powerful language\" or trying to get a user to click a CTA button. I want them to be curious and explore the products naturally, but right now based on traffic they rarely click more than one product (although a decent percentage convert to a sale, which is great).","name":"t3_3tap93","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-18 15:24:06","week":47}

{"id":"3tdnuj","author":"rockyTop10","body":"First, this isn't so much about managing my finances as I am doing decent in that department (small car loan debt, zero student loan, zero CC debt, some investments, some savings).  \n\nI've been dabbling with using my credit cards instead of debit card in order to take advantage of their cash back rewards programs (5% at Amazon, groceries, gas, 1% everything else) and am able to stay within my budget. My question is **when** do you need to pay things, and when does interest kick in, etc, etc.  \n\nAs an example, I might buy gas on the 12th of October, groceries the 17th, haircut the 21st, and 2-3 Amazon purchases throughout the month. My CC company tells me that my minimum payment is due the 5th of November and I get my next statement a few days later on the 8th.\n\nObviously, the minimum is due for the previous statement, not what I just accrued during October while the new statement is for October.\n\nSo, for my *October* purchases, in order to not have any interest charged, I must pay them off by what date? What if the charge has not posted yet? What if I make a purchase on that day? Should I wait until a specific day or just make a payment every single time I use my card for the amount charged, before it actually posts online?\n\nI am probably making this more complicated than it needs to be.  \nThanks for your time.","name":"t3_3tdnuj","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-19 03:27:08","week":47}
{"id":"3tdrm2","author":"coloroverstress","body":"Hi Everyone,\n\nRecently, I had a simple idea and decided to validate it to see if I could (1) get users and (2) make money.  The answer to both questions so far has been YES!  So, I am now really excited about my method here and hoping to grow.  In this post I hope to:\n\n* Share some lessons I learned, and\n\n* Ask for you suggestions about how to get more exposure and grow\n\n**Intro**\n\nMy [website](http://www.getcheapfood.com) is just a simple tool I built to alert users whenever Amazon has a really, really good deal on groceries.  No daily spam; just an email whenever there is a promo code or sale that makes you think \"Damn, that's a good deal\"\n\nI made the site quickly just to \"validate\" the idea, and my results suggest that this has some real promise.\n\n* On 409 visitors, I signed up 175 people (over 40% conversion rate)\n\n* My emails with deals are being opened around 25%-40% of the time, and have an overall 5% click through rate\n\n* From those clicks, I have begun making money!  Amazon affiliate links in the emails give me a cut of the pie whenever anyone places an order.  \n\n**Lessons so far**\n\n(1) *Keep it Simple*\n\nI remember reading an article from the creators of drop box that they wanted a very, very simple landing page and a one-click simple product.  They believed this was the key to their success.  I've seen so many people succeed on the simple opt-in page model.  It has really worked for me.  I think the lack of a cluttered interface, and a simple concept, is what distinguishes me from some of the \"coupon blogs\" out there that are full of ads and nonsense.\n\n(2) *Earn Trust When Using Affiliate Links*\n\nThis is something that I took from www.thesweethome.com.  They use affiliate links, and are not shy about it, but I still love that site and always go there because they are *trustworthy*.  Their reviews are legit and clearly the product of hours of work.  Similarly, I am not going to send a million emails a day or spam people.  I try to only send deals that are truly worth spending time looking at.  I think if people see that, they will come to trust the emails, stay subscribed, and consider buying what I send.  So far, zero unsubscribes.\n\n(3) *Just Try It*\n\nThis is commonly said here, but success comes to those who are willing to give something a try (not just those with an idea).  Honestly, when I first thought \"hmm, maybe people would benefit from this and sign up\" I didn't know if I was being naive or not.  But, a month later, I have enough positive results that I want to grow...\n\n**Help me grow!! What should I be doing?**\n\nSo I know that getting eyeballs on my website leads to sign ups, and I know that sign ups lead to more revenue, but I am having trouble with growth and would love your suggestions.\n\nI tried the usual approach of emailing bloggers in my market.  I sent well written emails (with a touch of flattery, and really took time to learn about the blogs I was emailing).  I reached out to \"frugal\" bloggers and \"coupon\" bloggers.  But no luck!  I had almost no one write me back despite sending out a *ton* of emails asking if I could guest post, do something for their community, exchange social shares, etc.\n\nI have also tried a bit of promotion on reddit, but this can be tough as I am sure many of you know.  Big subs like /r/frugal and others will remove anything that is commercial or has to do with affiliate links (and likely with good reason, and that's their right as mods).  But, I do believe I have a neat idea that could benefit people.\n\nSo given that the above two methods aren't working so hot, *what can I do???*\n\nWhat are your suggestions on how I can get my site out there to the masses (or even less than the masses) and get some visitors and growth.  I am open to standard best practices or more creative ideas!  \n\nAnd most of all, thank you!!!\n\nP.S.  If you are a likeminded entrepreneur or someone working in this area (frugality, groceries, etc.) let's talk!!!\n\n","name":"t3_3tdrm2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-19 03:56:49","week":47}

{"id":"3tjes8","author":"Snathious","body":"I work for a wireless carrier's branding partner, it's essentially a classic run-of-the-mill cell phone retail chain with stores across a number of states in the US. A few weeks ago, a contest was introduced whereas sales representatives would be eligible to win X amount of dollars in the form of Amazon.com gift cards for meeting certain sales criteria. We've recently come to find out that those winning these amazon gift cards are experiencing a drop in their weekly paychecks. After emailing our payroll director, he/she stated that this is because the Amazon gift cards that we are being rewarded with are being reported as wages through our payroll system and a tax on each Amazon gift card amount is being withheld from our weekly paychecks. I think this is ridiculous! It's not cash that we can spend anywhere we want, they're Amazon gift cards! Any help or advice is welcome, feel free to ask any questions about anything I may not have mentioned. For the record, every sales representative is paid an hourly wage + sales commission. These gift cards are being given to us on top of hourly wage + regular sales commission.

{"id":"3tlxdj","author":"deerseason","body":"Thanks to you guys, and yes, even The Points Guy, who was actually one of the first sources of information for me. \n\nAfter spending 8,000 dollars for my wife and I to travel through Europe in 2014 (only getting rewards with my BoA Travel Rewards card), I vowed to finally buckle down and figure this whole awards travel thing out. We were planning on making our annual big trip for 2015 to be the Philippines (to visit family; it would be our first time back since we'd gotten married) and Sydney (where we'd never been, and my cousin had just had a baby, and my wife really wanted to be up close to a koala).\n\nIn January of 2015 (as part of a NY resolution, I guess), I read up a TON, and signed up for the CSP, the Ink Plus, and the Arrival+.\n\nThat was a LOT of minimum spend to take early, and we definitely stocked up on Amazon Gift Cards and VGC (no Redbird for us unfortunately), and paid taxes with the Arrival. I even managed about 3 months of Serve before online loads ended.\n\nFinally after a lot of back and forth, we decided to pull the trigger on our trip, 80,000 United Miles round trip per person, plus about 125 dollars in fees each (we are not deluxe flyers, luckily we're short people). We actually still had to buy about 10,000 miles just cause we didn't want to wait another statement closing to be able to book, but that's fine.\n\nWe're not fancy hotel people, so we just used the Arrival+ to book cheap hotels via hotels.com, from which we earned another free hotel night.\n\nLater on I decided to add a layover in Taipei for 75 dollars in change fees, wherein I had about 11 hours OVERNIGHT where I planned to just wander around the city on my own, eating and drinking (my wife wouldn't join me in the Philippines for another week).\n\nI had priority pass access from my dad's Amex Platinum (through which I am an AU), and she and I used our Lounge Club passes as well.\n\nAnd then FINALLY we had accumulated another 60,000 UR points and decided to just finally splurge and get the PARK HYATT SYDNEY on our last two days.\n\nIt was an amazing trip, and effectively cost us only our incidental spending (about $1000 over 3 weeks for me, about 600 over 2 weeks for her). The miles and the cash back covered everything else.\n\nWe've since signed up for the AA cards, the US Airways card, AND the Citi TYP. Was able to use the latter to purchase tickets (via the travel portal, sadly) for Christmas, and our 200,000 AA miles will go towards our trip to Japan next year, and hopefully another trip to London.\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_3tlxdj","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-11-20 21:20:43","week":47}

{"id":"3tqfef","author":"TheRealAntacular","body":"I know a lot of the time here I talk about \"betting with the base rates, not against them,\" but I'm not sure if people understand what I'm REALLY saying. This is a great piece from Investor's Field Guide (the blog's author is the son of James O'Shaughnessy), where he breaks the base rate argument down better than I could, at 1/8th the length\n\nhttp://investorfieldguide.com/fun-with-f-a-n-g/\n\nHere's the relevant part, for those playing at home:\n\n&gt; Let’s assume:\n(1) **That each company’s market cap grows by 7% per year for the next 10 years (roughly the market’s historical growth rate).** 7% for 10 years leads to a doubling of market cap. (2) That in 10 years, **they each trade for 21.9X trailing 12-month earnings,** which is the current multiple on the S&amp;P 500...\n\n\n&gt; Let’s take Amazon as the best example. It’s trailing 1-year earnings as of 10/31/2015 were $328MM. Its market cap was $293B. So if it doubles in the next ten years, to nearly $600B in market cap, and trades at 21.9x earnings, that means it will have to **grow its earnings at 55% PER YEAR** for **10** years. That is *possible* but highly *improbable*. I looked back to 1973 and found that a small percentage of companies **(0.28% of them)** did grow earnings at that rate for 10 years (many off of a much smaller base than Amazon). \n\nSince 1973, less than 1% of all companies have grown their earnings as fast as AMZN would have to in order to justify it at a market multiple a decade down the road. \n\nThat's the \"base rate.\" You wouldn't bet the farm (or any meaningful amount of capital) on something that had a less than 1% chance of success, right?\n\nOf course, if you disagree with this over all assessment, the next question is: why? Is AMZN **STILL** not going to be a \"mature\" company with a mature P/E in 10 years? Iirc the average Fortune 500 company exists for approx. 40 years, so AMZN would be 3/4 of the way towards expiration by 2025. I think that it deserves a mature multiple then.\n\nTo summarize, as the author did:\n\n&gt; Will Amazon be the next company to grow that fast? Could be. But based on the outside view, the odds are about 9 times worse than hitting a random number in roulette.\n\nBe smart: Go for Red. \n","name":"t3_3tqfef","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-21 21:44:04","week":47}

I finally dumped BOFA for my local credit union and got a 750$ secured card in the process. For the first two months I maxed out my 750 limit and paid it off no problem, but then I signed up for Credit Karma and it warned me about keeping a Utilization less than 30%. Since that time I have kept my usage to 30%, and got a car loan. My scores were ~610 before car loan, ~655 afterwards, where they have stayed for four months.  \n  \nLast month I accidently went over 30%, I think maybe 38% or so, and it took three points off my scores. I don't understand why this had such an immediate effect on my scores, and how this squares up against various reward programs. I feel like 70% of my credit could be earning rewards...  \n  \nAs a followup on that, I just got approved for the Amazon Store Card, and I had intended to sign up for either a Chase Freedom, Citi Double Cash, or AMEX Blue Cash.... but I have 8 Credit Inquiry already from the auto loan process and Comcast/Tmobile after moving last year. I don't know if I should add more hard pulls while trying to get another card, or just wait until some of them fall off. My wife and I could really take advantage of the cash back on gas/groceries but we do have long term goals of getting a house and dont want to make our admittedly poor credit take even longer to improve.","name":"t3_3trwml","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-22 04:47:27","week":47}

{"id":"3tsggm","author":"WhateverAccount123","body":"Hey guys,  so I'm new to selling on Amazon.  I really got into it back in October, and currently do FBA.  Near the end of October a buyer purchased a product from me that was new in package.  I sent it out and a few days later I got messaged 3 times (all the same message) with the buyer stating the item was defective (ok, well, sometimes new items are broken right out of the box) and he wanted a refund.  I sent a message back that I was sorry that the item was defective and that I would happily accept the item back as a return and issue as full refund once I had the item back.  I don't hear anything for a few days and then Amazon sends the refund request for them.  I authorize it and after some time receive the item back.  Oddly, the item is just as it was when I sent it, the buyer never even opened it.  Now, about a week later, the buyer has left me a 1/5 star feedback.  Claiming I lied about the state of the product, was unresponsive, and that I didn't take responsibility for the defect.  He goes on to state how I should not be allowed to sell on Amazon and praises Amazon support for being the only reason he got his money back.\n\nConsidering he has already ignored my messages once, I doubt I can get him to remove the feedback.  Also, its full of lies, since I sent him a message back through seller central that I would gladly accept the item back as a return.  I am new so maybe I missed a policy, but I don't believe I was in the wrong to tell him I would do a return and not simply issue a refund.\n\nI was hoping people more experienced with Amazon could help me out.  I only have two pieces of feedback right now (my first being a 100% satisfied customer and then this), so this looks really bad on me. \n\nUPDATE:  Emailing customer support ended in an automatic denial since the item was defective (which it's not, I have since opened the item and used it myself).  I have now called support and they are looking into it and should have a response by tomorrow evening.","name":"t3_3tsggm","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-22 08:17:11","week":47}

Sorry for the text wall.\n\nWhen I go into my local bank, there's usually a couple people in line.  My bank never seems to have more than 2 or 3 tellers on duty, and it takes them probably 5 minutes on average, so they can handle about 12 people per teller per hour, leading me to think they probably see 216 normal transactions a day, figuring they average 2 tellers from 8 am to 5 pm.\n\nI'll figure half are deposits and half are withdrawals, with some small number being people coming in for other random services a teller could help with.\n\nI'm going to take a wild guess and state that the average cash deposit is in the $500 range, individuals dropping in obviously less and businesses varying wildly based on how much cash business they do.  I'll guess that half of the deposits are cash at a bank as well.\n\nSo, 216 * 50% * 50% * $500 gives me $27000 cash deposits per day that could be any denomination of fraudulent.\n\nI found an actual statistic that .01% of all bills are counterfeit.  Messing around with the numbers, I think I came to the conclusion that per every $1,000,000 in circulation, $3567.83 is counterfeit.\n\nIf we can trust all of this, then ($27,000 average daily deposit) * (open 6 days per 7 pays in a week) * (365.25 days per year) = 27000 * 6/7 * 365.25 = $8,452,928.57 cash deposits per year.

{"id":"cx2847h","author":"shireboy","body":"I'm an art major who \"lucked\" into software development 15 years ago.   In general, you can go toward \"operations\" - setting up systems and maintaining them, OR \"development\" - writing code to build new things.  There is some trend toward \"devops\" that do both, and there is always overlap to some degree.  I'm more of a developer turned dev-ops, so will tell you how to do that:\n\n* Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, one popular server-side language ( C#, Java, or PHP), one popular database (SQL Server, MySql, Postgres), and one popular scripting language (DOS, bash, or PowerShell). \n* Go \"broad\" learning the basics of each.  Get to where you can stand up a website or write a simple little app that uses the things above.  Just a simple 2 field form that stores data in a database and lets you view it.\n* Learn tools that help you do the above faster.  CMS tools like WordPress or Umbraco.  Development frameworks like Django or ASP.NET.  CSS and Javascript frameworks like BootStrap. Again, go broad- follow the \"get started\" on each just to get a general sense of what they do and how you could use it in the future.\n* Learn cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Azure to learn how you can quickly stand up websites and buy services that take care of some common functionality (authentication, database setup, hosting, etc.)  Each of these have generous \"free\" tiers that let you kick the tires and learn each thing.\n*  There are plenty of online schools to help you.  Pluralsight has good pay content, but also youtube, code academy, and others.  But whatever tool you choose, learn by doing.  You can whip out any text editor and create a .html file and teach yourself HTML and CSS basics.  Only once you've done that some, consider paying for resources and tools.\n* Visual Studio Community is a good free development tool.  Eclipse is also popular. \n* Learn about source control.  GitHub or Visual Studio Online.\n\nYou may benefit from picking some side project(s) like a personal website or some niche website.  Set up a todo list or trello board to give your self-learning a little structure. \n\nThat will take a while.  But, once you know the things above, you should be fairly confident to say \"yes\" when asked if you could tackle some development project for a company.  From there you can decide whether it makes sense to start your own consulting service or join another company.  While the above is a little web-specific, if you get decent at it, you can use the same skills for lots of specific areas- app development, in-house apps for companies, BI dashboards, etc.  Don't paint yourself into a corner - there is no \"one right tool\" or \"best language\".  Become a person who is technical and can understand business's problems and have a big toolbox to reach into to solve them.","name":"t1_cx2847h","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-16 18:12:41","week":47}

Have since resolved it completely.  \n\nThere are a couple things that will make a big difference.  First thing to is get those forms filled out!  You can download previous years' tax forms online, but what I did was hit Amazon and buy copies of TurboTax from each year.  (Side LPT: Use Turbotax.  It's so goddamn much easier than paper forms.)\n\nOnce you've got your taxes filled out, you'll know the thing that will make the biggest difference: **Do you owe any money?**\n\nIf you don't owe any money, just send those babies in.  If you were entitled to a refund you might not get it, but that's not the worst outcome in the world.  I got the refunds for the years I was entitled to, both state and federal.\n\nIf you do owe money, you may want to see an actual accountant, as the IRS charges a fee for not paying on time, plus a small interest charge on the amount you didn't pay (+fees).\n\nThere's also the X factor in how much money you make.  If you didn't make a lot of money, this is possibly the one time you get to consider it an advantage - the government, by and large, is not going to swing it's crazy busy and crazy expensive recovery arm onto somebody who's filed taxes late and doesn't owe anything (or very much), *especially* if you've independently come forward to pay the money you owe.  I had one return that owed money, for which I included a check with the return, and was very nervous about that being a year late.  IRS didn't care in the slightest.\n\nSo, tl;dr - Prep your returns.  See if you owe money.  If you don't, send them in.  If you do and it's small, pay it like you would have normally.  If you do and it's big, then you're better off getting an accountant and a tax lawyer.\n\nEdit: grammar like an adult.","name":"t1_cx2jdas","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-16 22:47:35","week":47}

{"id":"cx30274","author":"Spythe","body":"Nice to see you actually took people's advise, that is a good step. Unless you're selling 40+ items a month, having an Amazon Pro account is a bit overkill especially starting off. With that said scanning books without an Amazon Pro account can drive you nuts constantly seeing minus in profits.\n\nI think you're floor calculations are a little off but having a floor is a good idea. I personally don't have one and it solely depends on how cheap I can get an item. I've picked up books where I only make a buck or 2 off of it, or the super rare event I break even but need a few bucks to get 50% off on Sunday. Starting off my goal was to get as many items to FBA as possible to try to generate feedback, now that I have an amount I feel comfortable with(still sub 50 after 900+ sales). I pick items a bit more carefully but if you're already at a location it feels like a waste leaving money on the table, no matter how small. My avg sale per unit is 16.60 and I typically pay on avg 2 to 3 dollars per item.\n\nI still think Inventory Placement is not worth it imo. One example is I shipped 105 items a few days ago. \n\n15ish to MD(17.5lbs), cost - 7.96\n\n25ish to CA(14 lbs), cost -  7.77\n\n30ish to Dallas(30 lbs), guessing would be my main center since I live in Houston. Cost 8.89\n\n40ish to IN(45.1 lbs), cost 14.98\n\nTotal without Inventory Place - 39.6(actually looked everything up)\n\n* Managed to write all of that not include the actually price difference. So lets say all the items went to Dallas, that puts me at spending 24 dollars just for Inventory place. Now that would require at least 2 boxes, possible 3 so I save at best 2 boxes so that is about 4 to 5 dollars for Home Depo boxes, tape, void fill. So best case I saved 20 dollars sending items to 1 place for shipping supplies(which isn't 100% certain with Inventory place just the same SKUs) before account for the shipment difference.\n\n* For me to send items to Dallas from Houston its roughly .30c a lb(when using 1 box, could go up with more than 1 box.). So it would of been $31.98(if everything to Dallas BUT that isn't 100% certain even with Inventory Placement).\n\n* Total with Inventory placement - 31.98(for shipment) + 20(inventory placement fee) = 51.95. So it was actually a lot more to send this exact same shipment with Inventory Placement. Now if you want to take into account how much easier it is to ship with all your items going to 1 place that is worth something.\n\nAll fit in one box for each location, but the one that went to TN arrived before the Dallas and all items went live as soon as they got there. Ended up selling 4 of the multiplies before the day was over. Now my Dallas shipment arrived but only 1 went live with 2 to 3 other getting shipped somewhere else. So now at least 2 are back ordered. Instead of dealing with Amazon moving your item around(I think its still not 100% avoidable), you send your item to the location it will go live at instead of having a higher transfer chance. If all my same SKUs arrived at Dallas maybe only 1 or 2 of that item would of went live instead of 4.\n\nJust 3 days ago I found a crazy deal with RA for 4 of the same item. So I got them shipped out that same day and all went to Dallas. 1 went live and now the 3 others are back order til the 18th.","name":"t1_cx30274","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-17 06:28:38","week":47}

{"id":"cx3axof","author":"persimmon40","body":"&gt; And what do they sell for? Are we talking about hundreds of dollars here?\n\nWell, I give you few examples. The markups that you will be expecting to pay for similar things online are usually in a range of  100-130 %. For example, something that I bought for 10 $ is being currently sold at amazon for 23$ + shipping. Similarly, something that I bought for 23 $ is being sold at the same Amazon for 50 $ + shipping. So I am trying to find that sweet spot for my own pricing factoring in the shipping cost being the Canadian Seller. Since you look like an experienced seller, if you don't mind me asking, do you think I can make any profit here?\n\n&gt;Yes, if you want to send an item to the US with tracking, the cheapest method is via Canada Post 'Tracked Packet'. Rates vary depending on the weight of the item; starts at about $16 CAD if it's under 250 g, and maxes out around $19 CAD up to 1 kg\n\nI have read here on reddit that there are companies who offer USPS shipping in Canada (ON) for USPS prices (3-5$ with tracking).

Get on a real platform.\n\nGolden Rule: Due Diligence and not pumper sites. I was one with a AMZN post yesterday and I made 2.5% in 3 hours (not huge but not bad either). I know more about Amazon then most because I am a customer (cloud, retail, &amp; stream), and I research the fuck out of them. When I saw the dip I knew there was 2% - 6% gains. Not because a webpage or article said so. funny thing was yesterday there were videos all over stock twits of experts saying it was going to $500. By they way your one stock would have returned 2.5% too.\n\nThe fucking diamond rule: when researching put the ticker with \"pump and dump\" into a google search and see what you are looking at, that will save you thousands of dollars.\n\nBig titties and beef jerky tasting nipples rule: You need to treat this like any form of gambling, you will hear stories of a dude / chick hitting it big with a small bet, but that is not how it works. The guys and gals that grind with leather asses and research make a living and do hit big rips, just not lottery rips. Lottery rips are lottery rips, they bring the weak money to the table that the sharks get to feed on. Don't be weak money, grind out your $600 into $1,000 in the next year, then grind that 1,000 into $2200 and add some pocket money and grind on and in 5 years or so you will have a big enough stack to be making multiple plays including throwing lottery bets out as fun bets not desperate bets.\n\nDON'T BE WEAK OR DESPERATE MONEY - EVER!!!!","name":"t1_cx3nd5x","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2015-11-17 20:56:40","week":47}
{"id":"cx3nog9","author":"Cheznor","body":"&gt; Since you look like an experienced seller, if you don't mind me asking, do you think I can make any profit here?\n\nWell, first of all, you will not be able to sell your charms on Amazon, as jewellery is a restricted category. You need to jump through a bunch of hoops to be approved to sell jewellery on Amazon, including providing purchase orders of your product, as well as proof of authenticity. You can read more about that [here](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200316610#approval_reqs).\n\nAssuming you can't break through that category restriction, eBay and local sales are your only option. What did you pay, and what is the selling price, for some of your charms on eBay? Note that many eBay buyers will be very skeptical of buying jewellery online simply due to the plethora of fakes coming out of China. So hopefully you have proper documentation to assure authenticity.\n\n&gt; I have read here on reddit that there are companies who offer USPS shipping in Canada (ON) for USPS prices (3-5$ with tracking). Is this something that you're aware off?\n\nYes, there are a couple of companies in Canada that offer these services if you are lucky enough to be living in one of the cities they operate in. Since you mentioned Ontario, I assume you live there. The most notable company is [Chit Chats Express](http://chitchatsexpress.com/) which operate out of the Toronto area (branches in Markham, Mississauga, and Pickering). You'll have to look around their site for prices and such; I'm in Manitoba so I've never had a close look at the services they offer.","name":"t1_cx3nog9","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-17 21:04:01","week":47}

There are bunch of similar charms on ebay, though. However, it is hard to say whether or not the ones on ebay are authentic. The ones that I've got are authentic, as I've got them from authorized dealer for a significantly reduced price. Everything is in genuine package with tags still intact. All the stamps and markings are in place. \n\nTo be honest, I feel that I have a decent shot at Amazon. The only problem I face is that my inventory is not that big and that if I start selling Pandora charms at Amazon, Pandora itself will be after me for offering lower price on their own product on the same venue (Amazon) they're selling themselves. I am not going to try Amazon at first, only ebay. \n\nSurprisingly there is a big market for charms on Etsy. A lot of people openly claim that what they sell to be authentic and the prices support that. There is one particular charm that I have got for 22.95 $ is being sold for 50.46 + 5.55 shipping. Another one I've got for 19.95 is being sold for 39.45 + 5.00 shipping. Across the board on both Amazon/Etsy I am looking at 100-130% mark up on my COGS so far. Cant compare to ebay tho. \n\nI am thinking of charging 50 % Mark Up on my items + cost of shipping.

You should do more research on credit cards if you don't understand what the terms mean.\n\nMyfico.com is a good place to start and there's some decent youtube videos out there that explain everything.\n\nWhen it comes to Amazon though, the store card is way better. 5% cash back if you're a Prime member. 6-12 months 0% APR depending on how much you purchase. And for select Amazon merchandise you can get 12-24 months 0% APR financing.\n\nPlus the card is provided by Synchrony which hands out CLIs like candy every 4 months and they're very generous.

{"id":"cx4i64e","author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm late to the motivation party but I hope you read this anyway. \n\nOnce upon a time, 5 years ago I went through a destructive relationship. For distance reasons I broke up with her and things went sour. I still loved this girl and she then just went off on me and called me out on all my flaws and vulnerabilities. \n\n**She ripped me a new asshole.** And I kind of turned into one.  \n\nWhat does this have to do with being an *Entrepreneur*?\n\nEverything, really.\n\nBasically something snapped in my head that day and I became very depressed for a few years. My grades were suffering in University, I listened to depressing music, had depressing thoughts, started doing drugs and smoking cigarettes, and simply put I began to hate the world. \n\nIt felt like the world was working against me and nothing could change that. I felt hopeless and helpless. \n\n**Then I took a philosophy course** \n\nI fell in love with the thoughts of Nietzsche, Kant, and Sartre. \n\nSartre, as an atheist, believes there is a depression and void that humans can fall into when they don't believe in a deity. What is man's purpose, when their life is utterly meaningless. We grow up, we work, we die, the universe continues and will eventually forget about us. \n\nThis is the way that I felt, so I dug further. \n\nSartre's answer is that life is \"only but what you make of it.\" Your life is composed of a series of micro decisions. Small choices where you, the director in this satire we call life, has to make a call and see where it goes. He also believed that there was no wrong answer to these questions. Whatever you choose is the right answer because at the end of the day, the choice is yours and you should do what makes you happy. \n\nWithout arguing the fine points of hedonism and how that philosophy can be destructive I would to say that**this really resonated with me.**\n\n*****\n\nSo what does this have to do with Entrepreneurship?\n\nIt make me realize that I was the king of my existence. I also decided to look at the hand that I was dealt. \n\nI was 19, depressed, lonely, unhealthy, and on the verge of flunking out of University, from a decently well off family but not one that was willing to help me if I couldn't help myself. \n\nBut all these things were my own damn fault. \n\n**But I could change it.**\n\nI decided to analyze **what has gone wrong in my life, and more importantly, why**\n\n*****\n\nI was making choices that felt good at the time, but felt shitty later. I was undisciplined. Probably because I was depressed and didn't give a fuck about anything. I had bad habits like drinking, smoking, staying up too late, skipping class, etc. \n\n**I acknowledged that this was not good and that I was going to change it**\n\nAnd not change it in the new year, not change it next month or week, not change it tomorrow. \n\nI started right-a-fucking-way. \n\nI took action. I took my first step, my first tiny decision to being a good human being.\n\n**Here comes the most important part of this rant.** (That I just remembered I am late too)\n\nI SET GOALS. \n\n- I told myself I would only drink once a week. \n- I told myself I would stop smoking. (I got up snapped all the filters off my cigarettes and threw them in the toilet. Flush mother-fuckers.)\n- I told myself I wanted to look and feel better (I was a bit malnourished.) \n- I told myself that I wanted to make a lot of money and find better friends. \n- I told myself I wanted to stop hating myself and the world and start loving everybody. \n\nI set SMART goals. Look this is, this is important for goal setting. \n\n**Then I did what all those New Year resolution'ers don't...I fucking did something to achieve those goals.**\n\nThat day I grabbed some sneakers and went to the University gym (after a few hours of research on a program). Luckily a trainer spotted me and helped me out a bit. I must have looked lost. I felt lost. I had no clue what I was doing but I knew one thing. I was going to change. I was going to be Ubermensch. \n\nI was going to go on a beautiful journey to self-efficacy. \n\nI was going to be the best person I could be mentally, physically, and emotionally. I was also going to make as much money as possible so I could live comfortably. \n\n**I developed healthy habits** \n\n- I went to the gym or did a bodyweight routine 6 days a week.\n- I wanted improved cardio so I picked up kickboxing. Great way to sweat toxins out. Both physical and mental toxins I might add)\n- I studied regularly.\n- I STOPPED playing video games. (In fact I put away any possible distractions. \n- I started dressing better.\n- I discovered how much money you could make by owning a business.\n- I read more and discovered how I wouldn't have to work 9-5, 40 hours a  week, 5 days a week for a measly 2 days a week off. \n\nAn Ubermensch doesn't play by society's rules. An Ubermensch doesn't let barriers get in his way. An Ubermensch builds walls to block out toxic people and distractions and knocks down barriers that stop normal people from achieving their dreams. \n\n**Your questions answered.**\n\nI'm not going to hold back I am going to tell you what's up. \n\n&gt;Should I first start searching for another job or should I just put in the hours at my current one and attempt to get an Amazon reselling business off the ground?\n\nYou need to evaluate your life and get rid of distractions. Playing too many video games? Unplug the fucking thing and donante it to a kid who wants it or sell it for cheap. Get rid of it. Don't do it tomorrow. Don't let virtual friends hold you back. Get rid of it. Today. Take some action. Unless you decision of the day is to play video games into your 50's and end up as somebody you despise, get rid of it now. This will not help you on your journey to becoming the person you want to be. \n\nTake one hour or more of you day for the next month and read \"The Millionaire Fastlane.\" Just do it. It will do you some good and you can swallow the red pill that is owing a business.\n\nStart taking care of yourself physically and mentally if you don't already. Start working out, even if it is running 3 times a week and doing push-ups. Get in bed earlier, if you aren't tired, read a book. It will make you more tired and you will be better rested in the morning. \n\nSet some fucking goals for yourself, man. If you want to be an Ubermensch start acting like it. Write them on sticky notes and post them around you house. \n\n&gt;Maybe I have ADD, maybe I had a shitty upbringing, maybe I'm just a lazy asshole. I don't know why I am the way I am with regards to self-discipline, but I know if I keep going the way I am I will never be happy with myself or my life.\n\nYou are feeling this way because you did this to yourself. Set goals. \n\nWho do you want to be in 10 years? Write it down. Even if it is crazy like be a billionaire. Look at it every day. If you are about to pick up the X-box (get rid of it) think to yourself, \"Is this going to help me become the person I want to be?\"\n\nNow, you may be saying, but where has this gotten anybody? Isn't this a long process. \n\n**It is a long process but it gets better quick.**\n\nI was a depressed loser who almost failed school and now:\n\n- I own two businesses\n- I look good and feel good\n- I live with my girlfriend (of 3 years) who is the love of my life\n- I graduated\n- I had a job right out of University because I developed some social skills\n- I have probably read 100 books on starting businesses and marketing\n\n&gt;How do you or did you personally find motivation and, most importantly, the discipline to follow through?\n\nThe discipline. The discipline is this:\n\nYou have 80 years on this planet if you are lucky. It is widely uncertain of what happens when you die. I am not religious, but I believe there is magic in the world. A baby being born, a life being saved, falling in love. They are miracles and some things can't be explained. **But I have no proof that this life I am living right now, is my only kick at the can.**\n\nWhen I die. That could be it. \n\nSo make the best of it. \n\n- Do you want to be rich or poor?\n- Lonely or surrounded by family and friends?\n- Fat or Fit?\n- With purpose or without?\n- Owing or being owned?\n- Working 5-6 days a week with no benefits? Or 3 days a week making better money?\n\n**Do you want to be the rest? Or do you want to beat the rest?**\n\nNow about your Amazon business. \n\nGo for it. Try it. Fail or succeed, you did something! Anything is better than what you do now.\n\nAs far as a job? Why would you get another job, you will be back in the same spot, at least for you now you have a roof over your head. Only quit your job if you have another source of income and it is getting in the way of your dreams. You can dream big, but make sure you are going to eat tomorrow. A healthy body and mind need healthy food. \n\nIf you need a more flexible schedule to work on your business, then make the change. \n\n**One last time.**\n\nSET GOALS. \n\nELIMINATE DISTRACTIONS.\n\nBE HEALTHY.\n\nREAD MORE.\n\nSTART A BUSINESS. \n\nOnly do the things that bring you closer to your goals. \n\nYou do this for 24 months and I promise you that you are going to see a change in your life. I did. Other have. Tomorrow the sun is going to rise and you had better be taking action. \n\nI took my time to type all that out to help you. Now go help yourself. You are the only person in the world that is going to do it. You are the only person in the world that can do it. \n\nThe world is not a tv with a remote control. \n\nIf you want to change the channel, get up and do it yourself.\n\nEdit: a formatting error\n\n\n","name":"t1_cx4i64e","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-18 15:26:25","week":47}

{"id":"cx4k5q5","author":"ChocolateAlmondFudge","body":"&gt; Should I use more money to pay the car off faster, or shovel more money into the CC debt now?\n\nThe best *fiscal* decision is to pay off whichever has a higher interest rate first.\n\nLet's look at it this way: Say you have $100 / mo to go towards an extra payment. We know your CC is at 19% APR. Let's say that your car is at 7% APR. Knocking the CC principle down by $100 is going to save you $1.50 / mo in interest for all future months. Knocking the car loan down by $100 is going to save you $0.60 / mo in interest for all future months.\n\nHere's another example. I looked at a few different scenarios for paying off your CC debt. Here are the results:\n\nScenario | Months to $0 Balance | Total Amount Paid\n:-- | :-: | :-:\n$75 / mo. (min.) | 47 mo. | $3,450\n$100 / mo. | 32 mo. | $3,133\n$200 / mo. | 14 mo. | $2,778\n$300 / mo. | 9 mo. | $2,681\n\nAnd the same scenarios for a 7% APR car loan starting at $2,500:\n\nScenario | Months to $0 Balance | Total Amount Paid\n:-- | :-: | :-:\n$75 / mo. | 38 mo. | $2,778\n$100 / mo. (min.) | 28 mo. | $2,703\n$200 / mo. | 14 mo. | $2,600\n$300 / mo. | 8 mo. | $2,567\n\nAs you can see, interest is a much smaller issue with the lower rate loan while it's a pretty big deal with the high rate CC debt. And for a smaller remaining balance (in your case $1,100), the interest factor is even smaller because interest scales faster than linearly as the principle increases.\n\nOf course, I noted it's the better *fiscal* decision. If there are other factors in your life that weigh in on this decision, you'll need to consider them. But as far as dollars and cents go, all debt repayment possible needs to be dedicated to that CC debt.\n\n&gt; How much should I put into emergency savings, and should I only put money in until I have that timeframe of expenses saved for?\n\nAny money you don't need to spend right now should go in there. So, once you're covered on rent, utilities, groceries, gas, loan obligations, and other essentials, your money should be going into an emergency fund. Try to get to 3 months of expenses saved up and then you can reduce the amount you contribute each month (say, down to 25% of your post-essentials budget) until you get around 6 months of expenses saved.\n\n&gt; How much should I put into retirement? 5% or 15%?\n\nThis is where things get a bit complicated because there are different \"tiers\" of retirement investing. The most important tier is your 401k. You should try to contribute exactly what it takes to get your full employer match.\n\nFor example, where I work my employer matches $0.50 for every $1.00 I put in, up to 3% of my paycheck from the employer. So I contribute 6% and I get the full 3% from my employer. Here's why that's a good thing: Before my money even spends a day in my retirement fund, it has already grown by 50%. (My previous employer matched dollar-for-dollar up to 4% so I basically had double money going into my retirement savings!) Speak with someone in HR to find out what your company's retirement program is like.\n\n*After paying off high-interest debts*, you should look into contributing to an IRA. They are tax-advantaged retirement vehicles. This is significant because that's the same as saying they make an extra ~20% profit post-taxes. By the time you reach retirement, that could easily mean $10,000 extra after withdrawing your money from the account.\n\nNow, if you simply have way too much money, you can start by maxing out your 401k contributions and then move onto all sorts of funky investment vehicles that I don't know about because I don't make anywhere enough to need to care about. But they're in the /r/pf wiki page I linked to.\n\nOverall, the /r/pf wiki advises putting 15% - 25% into retirement. With the money you're making, you'd probably fall into that range by getting getting your full 401k match from your employer and then contributing to an IRA. Without OT, it looks like you'd make nearly $40k / yr before taxes. If you contributed 6% of your pay to your 401k and made a full $5,500 IRA contribution (max allowed per year by Federal laws), you'd be at 19.7% of income going to retirement. If you got 3% employer match on your 401k, you'd have 22.7% of your income going towards retirement with 3% of that being free money.\n\n----\n\nNow, believe it or not, there's way more info about these topics in the [sub wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). There's tons of links to tools that can help you with how to budget, organize your finances, how to do some of the tougher math (e.g., compounding interest), and a ton of articles that explain some of the topics in further depth (e.g., traditional IRA vs Roth IRA - which is better for you now and why). And there's a lot of topics there that you'll be curious about once you get settled financially and want to start reaching for goals like owning a house, going back to school, starting a business, investing, reducing your taxes, etc. (In fact, once you start contributing to a 401k and IRA, you'll want to go over investing and taxes).\n\nLastly, I've found the *______ for Dummies* book series to be a really good intro into personal finance. They make sure to start from the most basic level and build up your knowledge so you can easily understand fundamental concepts in budgeting, investing, etc. And you can probably find an out-of-print, but still up-to-date version of those books on Amazon for the cost of shipping. (Or, go to your library.)\n\nBest of luck!","name":"t1_cx4k5q5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-18 16:27:06","week":47}

{"id":"cx4pllp","author":"BeyondtheWrap","body":"I'm thinking it might be best to stop filling my Amazon balance when the amount reaches that which I would reasonably spend in 3 years. If I use a time discount rate of 3% per year (based on the typical inflation rate), the same amount of money three years in the future has a value of 0.97^3 = ~91% its current value. So it would be worth the current 10% discount on Amazon GCs if I use the value within three years; if it takes longer than that, it would not be worth it.\n\nThat might even be too long though, since it will likely still be easy to get a 5% discount by means of next year's Q4 categories. So at some point in the future, Amazon GC balance purchased today at 10% discount will be equal in value to Amazon GC balance purchased at that time at 5% discount. So maybe it only makes sense to buy enough Amazon GC that would be used before losing 5% of its value. If 3% value is lost each year, it would take ln(0.95)/ln(0.97)=~1.7 years for 5% value to be lost. \n\nSo only buy enough Amazon GCs to last 1.7 years?\n\nIf you have a 5% savings account like in the OP example, I guess then your discount rate would be 5%, so only buy enough for 1 year.","name":"t1_cx4pllp","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-11-18 18:43:54","week":47}

Fuck that.  \n\nI think where you're mis-reading this site in suggesting I find something better to do with my time is in thinking this is all I do with my time. I was in Management Consulting at one of the Big 3 firms before I did artificial intelligence for investment banks. I learned a ton doing this coal product, sale or no sale, I have skills I didn't have before. I spent 3 years doing something where the end product was an algo that sorts derivatives trades by risk and rules--there I learned management, stress and how to hate my life. I spent 2 weeks doing something that taught me product photography, refined my negotiation skills with manufactures, got me thinking about marketing, basic html and css and much more. I take that as a win, making money or not. \n\nThis stupid site is my first attempt at taking an idea full circle. This isn't me going to Staples to buy envelopes and glitter. Market research, procurement, creation, website (photos, copy, content, video), fulfillment, follow-up, marketing, and user response--I could have just come to this sub and wantreprenured my way through case study after case study trying to understand how it all fits together, or I could start a site (no matter how dumb) and try to do it. \n\nI even got to check out the AMZ algo to see how I can rank better for my product--this site being one of 20 ways I can achieve that.\n\nI like coal because it's funny, and the only other ones out there are pieces of shit made in China.  A plastic coal product on Amazon is selling 20-60 a day starting in mid-Nov and going until 12/24. I don't think gummy dicks (outside of bachelorette parties, or glitter (outside of strip clubs) has a similar measurable market. \n\nI agree with you that flash in the pan businesses are doing a dis-service to aspiring entrepreneurs, but I would argue so is most of what I have found on this sub in the last 5 years. Very rarely do you find a post that fucking rocks, I just end up friending good users and following their comments (doubt i'm alone here). \n\nFeedback is feedback, and I appreciate all of it.  I have to disagree with your assumption that I am posting on entrepreneur for sales. #1 If I wanted sales I would BS some \"look what my friend just sent me\" in /r/pics like that dick bag kid did. \nFull disclosure, I haven't gotten any sales from Reddit, nor do I think I will-- I'd see more sales on Reddit if I sent actual dogshit then something I put actual effort into.

{"id":"cx59guc","author":"porncrank","body":"I am not an expert. But here's how I think about it:\n\nTheoretically a high p/e indicates that the market sees a lot of business growth in the future: people think that a company's earnings are going to go up, so they buy based on that speculation, driving both the price and the p/e up. If they're right and earnings grow, the p/e will eventually come back into line. \n\nAnother piece of a high p/e is understanding why the earnings might be low. It could be because their business is slow -- obviously a bad sign -- or because the company is investing earnings in future growth, which is a good sign if they're good at such things.\n\nSo when I look at p/e I think about two things: 1) whether I agree that the future earnings are really as rosy as the p/e would indicate compared to other companies in their space, and 2) why their earnings might be low.\n\nFor example, in the case of Amazon, I think they are very well positioned to keep gobbling up internet real estate and they have lots of growth potential. And I also think they're earnings are low because they're investing like crazy in their business, and they have historically been good at doing so.\n\nSo I would expect Amazon to have a high p/e. Is 900 reasonable? Well, I don't know, but the market thinks so for the time being.\n\nWith an example like Ebay, I don't see what their big future growth area is. And I don't know that they're investing that much in new areas. This could all be my ignorance of Ebay, but they haven't marketed themselves to convince me otherwise. The end result is that a low-to-middling p/e ratio seems plausible. At least until something in their business changes.\n\nHope that helps a bit.","name":"t1_cx59guc","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-19 03:14:32","week":47}

Same goes for the soaps - if you get the more watered down store brands you may feel like you're spending less, but I find it gets used faster so the higher quality stuff is better because I use less for each batch of dishes.  \n\nThere's also a \"clip coupons\" section of subscribe and save which can offer even better discounts if you keep an eye on it.  It does require some maintenance to use S&amp;S because you have to remember to adjust or cancel your subscriptions if you don't want to keep receiving the product and they don't notify you when there's a price change, so for example the dog food can range from $35-62 per 30 lb bag and I get it for $54-57 locally, so I try to only buy it when it's at the bottom of the price range and will never buy it if it's over $54.

As others have said, make sure you pay it off in full every month.\n\nThe Chase Freedom is a great card. They have rotating 5% cash back categories, and are even doing double (10%) for Amazon purchases through the end of the year I believe.  So on top of responsibly building credit, you can easily save some money as well.  They also have a great signup bonus right now of $150 back after spending $500 in 3 months.\n\nKeep in mind that just because your pre-approved or targeted for a credit card doesn't guarantee you will be approved.  Check out your credit score on Credit Karma and make sure everything looks good before applying.  If you decide to go for it and get denied, call the reconsideration line and explain your situation.  It helps if you've had a relationship with Chase (maybe a checking/savings account for a few years?).","name":"t1_cx6mipn","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-20 06:41:34","week":47}

{"id":"cx6uu2h","author":"cmcg1227","body":"Nope, the employer is right. \n\nThat said, the value of the Amazon.com gift cards are likely being taxed as a bonus, and withheld at 25% (this is just how bonuses are generally withheld). Assuming that you/your co-workers are in a lower than 25% tax bracket, this means that the bonus is being over-withheld, and you/your co-workers will received that money back in the form of a tax refund (or reduction of tax bill due to under-withholding on other income). \n\nNow, I do understand your frustration - if the bonus was in the form of cash, you would still see a net increase in your paychecks because normal paycheck + bonus cash - withholding on bonus would still be higher than what you were receiving before. \n\nPersonally, I would suggest just making the best out of the Amazon.com gift cards. Use them to buy items you normal wouldn't - including food, cleaning supplies, etc. If you don't have Amazon prime, purchase that with your gift cards to get free 2-day shipping (sometimes even 1-day shipping).

To make it easier, I am going to assume there are no other deductions pre or post tax. We will assume you have made $50k YTD.\n\nYour employer says I am going to give you a 5k bonus.\n\nIf the bonus is NOT grossed up, you will net $3,367.50.\n\nYou have paid the following in taxes:\n\nFederal: $1250\nSocial Security: $310.00\nMedicare: $72.50\n\nYour employer has also paid those amounts.\n\nIf your employer says, I am going to give you a 5,000 bonus and make sure you get the full 5,000 bonus net of tax. Both you and your employer are paying the following (minus FUTA)\n\nNew bonus is $7423.90\nFederal Tax: $1885.97\nSocial Security: $460.28\nMedicare: $107.65\n\nYou are not being taxed as if you only made a 5k bonus, rather you are being taxed at the proper bonus rate of the $7423.90. \n\nIf you get that $5000.00 net in the form of an Amazon gift card then you will get an IMPUTED by-line on your paystub which means, you don't get more net pay, but that $7423.90 IS going to your earnings as income and being reported accordingly. Based on your personal tax situation you may not owe any more at the end of the year or you may (assuming your regular paycheck was not able to cover any missed tax liability according to the actual payroll calculation).\n\nWhen I worked in actual payroll operations, I would get these questions all the time since people who have other imputed income amounts for things like domestic partner benefits, relo, etc get confused when they have more taxes withheld from their paychecks although they didn't get more earnings because of the imputed amounts.","name":"t1_cx7dzy8","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-20 23:20:57","week":47}

Then ask yourself why would they even consider slowing down to take profits. Why slow down to increase profits when the market they're dominating is doubling every ~6 years? Would you rather profit off of 7% of US retail (ecommerce percentage in 2012) or would rather profit of US retail when ecommerce is 60% of US retail. \n\nBut you (and the author) are correct in being suspicious. AMZN is absolutely playing Wall Street to perfection. They're giving just enough info to imply that they'll eventually own 60% of every retail market, but they're hiding as much info as possible so that we can't know for sure how successful they actually are. But I definitely agree with the poster saying that P/E is a bad metric in this case specifically because of the way AMZN is running their business.

People said, \"Let's assume that Apple gets 30% of the smartphone market by increasing. Market share by 7% a year. Even with that, Apple is way overpriced.\" What that analysis ignored is the possibility that the smartphone market itself doubles in 3 years. Hence the resulting profit explosion for Apple and Samsung.\n\nSo I suppose the question to you is:\n\nDo you think the ecommerce market is set to grow exponentially in the near future?

If they refuse, open an A to Z claim after 48 business hours of notifying them you wanted a return.\n\nIf they don't refund themselves at that point, amazon will do it for them and not require you return the item.  \n\n","name":"t1_cx8rr0x","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-22 06:35:27","week":47}

{"id":"cx8ty8c","author":"thewimsey","body":"&gt; The problem isn't a focus on shareholder value. The problem is a focus on shareholder value this quarter or next quarter instead of long-term.\n\nI've been hearing this tired line for 30 years.  The focus on \"short term value\" was why the Japanese were going to eat us for lunch, since their culture, allegedly, focused on long term value, while American companies were just chasing the next quarter.  Etc.\n\nIt wasn't true then and it's not true now.\n\nSometimes - usually even - a focus on short-term performance *is* important.  In most companies...not all, but most...a decline in profit, and therefore (usually) stock prices, quarter after quarter, *is* bad, and *is* something people should be paying attention to.  \n\nWalmart's recent missing of earnings estimates, plus its announcement that revenue would drop more next year caused a significant stock price drop and was (appropriately) treated by the company as a kind of emergency.  This is exactly what should happen.  \"Oh, let's ignore it and focus on the long term\" is not how WM should have reacted, or did react.\n\nAnd typically, it is the CEO's who complain about \"short term\" thinking, often because they simply would like less accountability. Which is understandable; everyone would like less accountability.\n\nBut, obviously, there are lots of cases where shareholders do focus on the long term, primarily with newer companies trying to establish themselves. Amazon, for example, has very patient shareholders who don't seem to mind that the company often loses money, and when it does make money, it makes very little.  These are not people focused on the short term, as you can see by the very high PE value of the stock.  The same is true for very many new tech companies.  No one is going to crawl up Marc Zuckerberg's ass because Facebook didn't meet some target next quarter.\n\nBut if an established company - Ford, say - shows a steep decline in profit this quarter vs. the same quarter last year, people are going to want to know why, and they are going to hold the executives responsible if they don't have a good explanation.  As they should. This is not dysfunction.","name":"t1_cx8ty8c","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-11-22 08:18:15","week":47}

You seem to be the expert so I wish you would help work through your views, but I'll give it a shot. \n\nAMZN's current market cap is $313B. Let's apply a reasonable PE of 15. That would mean we would need AMZN to make ~$21B in profits every year. Is that reasonable?\n\nLet's try my hypothesis of examining the addressable market. The census bureau estimated the 2014 US retail market to be $5.2 trillion. The worldwide total is estimated to be $22 trillion. \n\nWorldwide sales are hard to see clearly since infrastructure, politics, and existing players are all very opaque to me. So let's like at US sales alone. \n\nFor AMZN to make $21B, let's assume it has 1% margin to it needs to have $2.1 trillion in revenue. Based on the 2014 numbers, that means AMZN would need to take 2.1/5.2 = 40% of US retail to achieve a reasonable PE of 15. And of course, this ignores their growing markets in Europe and Japan (and any other markets which may or may not be succeeding) \n\nIf this happens in 5 years, AMZN's valuation is great. If this happens in 50 years, AMZN's valuation is shit. The reality is obviously something in between. And that's where all the hard analysis work occurs. If you want to simply dismiss this possibility, that's fine, but if you're willing to go through your thought process as to why you feel this way, I'd be interested in hearing your reasoning. \n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cx8x67g","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-22 12:11:04","week":47}

I sell on Amazon and a few other places and it has been going well, I even turned a small profit! The other day, I noticed something odd about my listings. Another user had piggy-backed onto my listings, offering the same product, for 3x the price. They also require 3-5 weeks for shipping. It is obvious their plan is, if they get a sale, they will purchase my product and resell it. This explains the long lead time.\n\nThe problem comes in here: the other seller won the default price in bold and the actual mfg and seller (me) is relegated to fine print. Let's say half the people viewing my listing will scan the default price, notice it is ridiculously high, and move onto the next product. I am getting screwed out of a lot of business because of this.\n\nI checked out the other seller, \"Metrowalt\". They have thousands of listings, all ridiculously high in price. It is very clear what is going on here. Someone wrote a script to scan listings for non-premium sellers. Because I am not a premium seller (which cost $40 per month), I am not eligible for the default price list, if it is contested by another seller. Therefore, this script will find these listings and automatically steal the default listings.\n\nAny ideas? Has anyone else come across this issue? I realize I could make the investment to become a premium seller with Amazon, but is there any other way to handle this? Since I sell through multiple vendors, it will get expensive quickly for me if this starts happening all over the place.\n\nThanks.","name":"t1_cx96eik","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-22 19:09:48","week":47}

{"id":"cx99c7t","author":"TheRealAntacular","body":"&gt; If this happens in 5 years, AMZN's valuation is great. If this happens in 50 years, AMZN's valuation is shit.\n\nThere's one giant flaw in this analysis: it assumes margins alone determine profitability, when in fact margins are just one component of being profitable, [the other two being turnover and leverage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont_analysis) It's ROIC/ROE that measures true profitability, NOT margins. Plug your assumptions in to a DuPont analysis of AMZN [like I did here for TSLA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3mdh16/tesla_motors_is_now_worth_more_than_chrysler/cvegswp)\n\nPlug in the 1% NPM * current Turnover (Sales/Assets) of 1.79 * current Leverage (Assets/Equity) of 4.52 = 8.1% ROE. That's about [in line with the markets historical ROE.](http://i1.wp.com/www.philosophicaleconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/profdrag1.jpg) So you're essentially paying an absurd valuation for company that is no more profitable than average.\n\nHOWEVER, as you said, they're growing. Which means they're asset base will be expanding too. Which will lower turnover, thus lowering profitability. So to counteract this, assuming margins are fixed at 1% as per your model, leverage will have to increase to compensate for the turnover decrease. \n\nIn short, you need to hope for an improvement in margins (currently negative NPM), an asset base that suddenly stops expanding (which almost never happens with high growth firms), and for them to be smart with their leverage. All this just to hit a measly 8% ROE.\n\nNo thanks.\n\n&gt; The reality is obviously something in between. \n\nI don't think it is. I think at the current share price, growth up to a trillion in revenue is already priced in. Considering they're only at 1/10th of that, we're looking at closer to 50 years than 10.\n\n&gt; If you want to simply dismiss this possibility, that's fine, but if you're willing to go through your thought process as to why you feel this way, I'd be interested in hearing your reasoning. \n\nWhen everyone has an insight, no one does.\n","name":"t1_cx99c7t","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-22 20:25:34","week":47}
