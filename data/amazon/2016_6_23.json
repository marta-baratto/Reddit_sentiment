{"id":"4mqsap","author":"vtcdgf","body":"There is a roundabout way to convert your Google Rewards credit to Amazon GCs or Paypal. \n\n1. Download the [Fronto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.fronto) app for Android. Use my referral code \"reddit\" for 1250 points right off the bat. It is a lockscreen app that's been posted before, and now it has an extra page that pays you to download apps through Fyber (Sponsorpay). \n\n2. Go to \"Earn More\" and then \"Fyber (Sponsorpay)\" to see the apps you can download for points. Keep scrolling until you see the ones that require you to make an in-game purchase.\n\n3. Make the in-app purchase using your Google Rewards credit, and get Fronto points for doing this. Feel free to download some of the free apps too, but obviously they pay fewer points. In my experience Fronto credits you with the points promptly without fail. Just don't do any that ask for your email or credit card.\n\n4. Cash out your Fronto points for Amazon or Paypal. 3250 points = $1 Amazon which gives you the code instantly, or 3375 points = $1 Paypal.\n\nFor example, on my offer wall I currently have  some game called Heroes of Utopia - I get 4085 points for making an in-app purpose of $3.99 USD or more, which is worth a little over $1 in Amazon gift card. Proof of this app paying out is below.\n\nThe rate of return is low on this, but it's better than Google Play credit that I have no use for. Enjoy!\n\n**Proof:** http://imgur.com/KkQ9CqS\n\n**Edit**: After getting your Fronto reward cashed out, you can contact Google Play telling them that your in-app purchase was a mistake made by your kid, and they'll refund you!","name":"t3_4mqsap","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-06 04:31:27","week":23}

Since then I've completely changed the way that you earn in-game currency (LB) and win gift cards. I've done away with the offerwalls and I'm focusing on rewarding players for their participation in the auctions, and how well they can gamble their LB. Now your goal is to earn more than anyone else throughout the week, winning 1st prize, 2nd prize, etc. This week the prizes are:\n\n1: $5\n\n2: $4\n\n3: $3\n\n4: $2\n\n5: $1\n\n(All Amazon gift cards.)\n\nYou can see how you stack up throughout the week on the [Win](http://www.loftybid.com/win) page. Gift cards will be awarded every Sunday night at 8PM (EST). At that time everyone's account balance will be reset, and more prizes will be up for grabs. \n\nThe only way to earn in-game currency is through a daily bonus, starting auctions, and betting your LB against other players.\n\n/r/beermoney is probably the only place I'm going to advertise this, so competition for the gift cards may be low. Loftybid is just a project that I've been working on and I appreciate any feedback you may have. I'm willing to alter Loftybid in any way that will make it more fun and engaging. \n\nAlso keep in mind that it's optimized for Chrome on a computer.","name":"t3_4mquxu","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-06 04:48:59","week":23}

I looked up the item on Ebay and there was no sales history or any for sale currently. Nothing on Amazon.  I did find a sales page for the item that listed them at $350 but it stated it was discontinued.  Since this was a computer related item the $350 doesn't mean anything as most of these items decline in value over time. \n\nUsually at this point I toss them all in the discard box that goes to the local auction house but I figured I'd go ahead and list them since I had 4.\n\nI threw them on Ebay about midnight on Saturday for $150 each. When I woke up Sunday morning I had sold 2 for the asking price. I immediately got on Ebay and upped the price to $200. I ended up getting a few more offers around my original price but then someone paid full price and another accepted my counter near full price. \n\nJust goes to show that even if there is no sales history your items might be worth something if you take the time to list them.

I thought it would be simpler to cancel everything and put them in a single new order. In the process one item went from 49.50 to 91.20. They wont uncancel it, and wont price match it.

{"id":"4mzm6c","author":"permanent_throwaway-","body":"I'm looking to explore online retail again. Early on in my career in medical sales I completely flopped on the development in a website for our company. With a couple more years of reflection, a couple more years more experience, and after working as a project manager for my own personal website I have a more refined idea on how to implement this again. I have successfully sold on Amazon for a while but once my direct to wholesale customers picked up it was more profitable to focus all my energy on them.\n\nTo give you a little background on our company, we mainly work with vendors overseas to bring in product to be sold in the US. Due to price discrimination, product sold overseas is generally a much lower price than the same exact product sold in the US. We sell mainly disposable home healthcare medical products such as traechostomy, ostomy, woundcare, diabetic, and urology supplies. We don't really sell things like DMEs like walkers or wheelchairs.\n\nBut now I'm looking into expanding my customer base again now that my wholesale customers are established. The plan is to use the following services to make running my own online store easier and low maintenance so I can also have enough time for my established customers.\n\n* Taxjar- To keep track of sales tax and use their auto payment services to make\n\n* Amazon fulfillment services- To prevent burdening our warehouse with small orders since we usually deal with pallet loads. Our warehouse workforce is structured to handle a small amount of large orders and not a large amount of small orders.\n\n* Shopify- An out of the box solution for a website. I've used it before for other projects and they have an app that syncs with Amazon fulfillment to keep track of inventory and to autofill orders. Also this means that I can take advantage of Amazon's amazing shipping options.\n\nHere's how I imagine it working. I bring in product from my vendors, have large shipments prepped by my warehouse to be sent into Amazon to become our warehouse for small orders, customers purchase off my Shopify website, Shopify automatically sends the order to Amazon to be filled.\n\nSome issues I can foresee facing:\n\n* I would need my own customer service since it would be my own website\n\n* I may need to hire someone to manage the day to day tasks with the website so I can focus on purchasing and my wholesale customers. \n\n* I would also need to work on advertising and bringing in customers since there are established webstores already out there\n\n* I'd need to look into potentially accepting insurance, although there are a lot of people out there who seem to buy this product off insurance being able to accept insurance will increase my customer base\n\nThis is of course a rough idea and I'd have to do more detailed research to figure out how to implement all of this correctly. But on the general concept, what kind of insight could all of you give me for something like this?","name":"t3_4mzm6c","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-07 17:35:15","week":23}

{"id":"4n1ms5","author":"cantbelieveitsbacon","body":"I'm a firm believer in low-cost diversified index allocations. Yeah, I'm a  Boglehead. The proof is in the pudding: data shows that low-cost diversified index allocations provide reliable returns over time. In other words, average is good.\n\nBut another aspect of the \"pudding\" I can't ignore is some of Warren Buffett's frequent quotes like \"investing in strong companies that outdo their peers and whose business have a high barrier of entry\"  or something of this essence. In other words being on the right side of the median is good.\n\nTo me, life is not black or white. One can have a Bogglehead allocation for average returns yet sprinkle some \"better than median\" return salt like Warren for a better tasting portfolio.\n\nData center REITs raised my interest since my line of work is close enough that I understand the technical part and the growth prospects. \n\nIn short the \"data center REIT\" industry will be doing awesome for the foreseable future. Demand for data center real estate outstrips supply and the barrier of entry is fairly high so there are only 6 data center REITs. Moreover they are \"frenemies\" who seem to not compete directly with one another, thus protecting profits. They are also 2 sub-categories: the category I call \"barebone\", a true REIT that focuses on infrastructure, providing only electricity, connectivity and a roof over one's head and the \"cloud subcategory\" which provides hosting on top of that.\n\nThe Cloud subcategory (despite all the hype) is very risky IMHO because customer needs are so diverse and servers depreciate fast. It's also harder to respond to change for the cloud subcategory as software needs created each time, which leads to complexity. \n\nBy contrast the \"barebone\" category is customer-agnostic. Amazon can be their customer, or a Bank or Google. Customers roll in their own racks and servers in the form factor each has standardized and it's less headache. It's a model easier to replicate in multiple locations too and thus it scales better, easier and faster. Think economies of scale. Also the \"cloud subcategory\" may lease space from the \"barebone subcategory\". So the \"barebone subcategory\" ends up laughing all the way to the bank.\n\n\nBut I digress.\n\n\nOut of the \"barebones\" category, the leader is Digital Realty Trust [DLR](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DLR) and the second up-and-coming [DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DFT) a mutliple smaller looks decent. \n\nAlso Yahoo reports a beta of -0.03 for Digital Realty meaning it's inverse correlated to the market. Inverse correlation and growth with good prospects at the same time is good in my book.\n\nOf course puting all eggs in one basket is foolish as an omelette lasts 1 meal whereas a chicken lasts the lifetime of a chicken.\n\n\nBut sprinkled over an \"average\" allocation, leaders in a growing field with a high barrier of entry fueled by our cloud addiction of smartphones promises to move any allocation closer to the good side of median. Keeping in mind that any REIT really makes sense only in a tax-deferred account. \n\n\nI would be interested to know your thoughts.","name":"t3_4n1ms5","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-08 00:03:59","week":23}

{"id":"4n505k","author":"bmooreskier","body":"Hi everyone! For those who don't know, this thread comes as a promise from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4mzqyi/you_want_to_start_an_online_business_but_havent/) thread. I was amazed by the response. I made that comment before heading home from work, and came back a few hours later to see hundreds of replies and like 30 pms. Sorry, but I can't be business partners with all of you. And you don't need me, if you've got the passion or even just a little interest, you can find opportunity. \n\nShameless plug: [here](https://www.touchlinesupply.com/) is the current project that I mentioned I was building. Once the sprint is over and the marathon stage kicks in (and I have some money hopefully) I'll be starting a couple of the new product ideas I've saved. We just launched this week, would love to hear critiques/reviews, or if you really want to support me you can buy something :) here's a 10% off code: reddit10\n\nOkay, let's get started. This is going to be a very brief overview with information that is hopefully new for most of you. I'm hoping to do a follow up video to show you exactly what my research process is, I just dont have the time now. Stay tuned!\n\nAs an entrepreneurship major, the main idea our professors planted in us was that we had to reinvent the wheel, and then create a viral marketing plan that creates an explosive company and last for a few years, and then you repeat. Well, being an entrepreneur doesn't mean you have to reinvent anything. You simply want to find a niche, find a problem or gap, come up with a solution that provides value to the user, and then create a way to inform the user that your solution exists. \n\nOk, so, entrepreneurship 101 is over, time for the good stuff. \n\nSo how do you find a product that will sell well, but won't cost you thousands to market in a competitive niche? It can be tough. Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a website out there that ranked millions and millions of products based on how well they sell online? Well, there is. It's called Amazon. On the bottom of every product page, you will find the 'BSR', or best sellers rank. That is the current rank that product has in it's category. There are many tables and charts out there that will give you an estimated monthly sales based on the BSR and category.\n\nSo you're probably thinking 'oh great now I can go search thousands of products and individually check the BSR and sales/month, this will take forever...'\n\nNope. There's a better way. There are two main programs that expedite product research, allowing you to view the valuable data from each product on the search result page in a single chart. This way you can quickly analyze the top sellers in a niche and decide whether it is right for you. I use JungleScout, it's around $85 i believe, and it's awesome. I actually use it daily. The other program that recently came out for free is Unicorn Smasher. Works the same, monthly sales numbers seem to be a bit lower than JS, but ultimately should work just fine. I just trust JS a bit more.\n\nSo now you have the ability to search a product in amazon, click a button and view the monthly sales of the products by page. So how do I know if I can compete? \n\nReviews and brands. One of the largest factors for ranking (if not the largest) is the number of reviews a product has. When a new product is launched, companies will often do big giveaways in exchange for reviews, which drives down their BSR (the lower the number the better) and gets them better organic ranking, driving those organic sales. So what you want to do is find a niche with a decent amount of monthly sales and not too much competition. Also, if the niche has several household brand names, I just skip it.\n\nHere's my criteria:\nTop 15 results are at least doing a combined 5k sales/month\n\nTop 5 results have a product with less than 100 reviews\n\nTop 10 results have 5 products with less than 100 reviews\n\nThe average price is greater than $20\n\nThe product niche has several names (i'll get into this later, but I mean products like 'sponge' are difficult because everyone is going to search that keyword, but 'string lights' could be rope lights. fairy lights, copper lights, etc.)\n\nMy goal is to find a niche where I can sell 10 units a day at $10/profit per sale. That's 300 units/month, $3000 profit.\n\nSo that's product research on amazon in a nutshell. Once you find 5-10 ideas, track their niches for a few weeks by exporting the data from the research programs. Narrow down your list and see which niche has the least amount of competition on google. Look for opportunities to overtake competitors websites with a nicely-designed and optimized ecommerce website. Your combined sales channels of your ecommerce site, amazon, ebay, pinterest, wanelo, etc. could create quite a lot of income for yourself if you find the right product.\n\nThese are the basics to get you started. There are so many youtube videos, facebook groups (highly recommend 'The Amazing Seller,' learned everything here), e-books, and even subreddits that will teach you more about amazon, FBA (fulfilled by amazon), private labeling, importing, and so on. Now it's your turn to go out and learn more the way that works best for you! Good luck!\n\nSorry I'm bad at formatting, I don't post much.\n ","name":"t3_4n505k","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-08 15:26:57","week":23}

The opportunity is a business that imports and sells goods mostly to restaurants and other businesses.\n\nCurrent sales channels include web + a team of salesmen who have their own existing client-base. I've secured both of these things and will be using them going-forward while also securing our manufacturing/shipping channels in/from China.\n\nI'm looking at adding our items to Amazon and am trying to better understand their FBA program and I was hoping someone here could help answer a few questions I have:\n\nFrom my understanding, all I have to do is setup my account and create some listings. Once the listings are done, I just mail a box of these items to Amazon so that they have the inventory. After that, I just wait until some sell and when they do, Amazon cuts me a check (less any fees)? Is that accurate?\n\nI'll clarify that my motivations of getting on Amazon are a means to legitimize the business more than anything else. I don't expect to make large sales through Amazon and would be quite content just to break-even on them.\n\nI know the prior arrangement this company had with Amazon was that Amazon would come to them with requests for items (as they sold), almost as if Amazon was a wholeseller. What arrangement is this and how could I explore getting this setup instead?","name":"t3_4n5d39","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-08 16:43:10","week":23}

I've been researching dropshipping heavily for the past week or two and have just started looking into products that will be viable to sell. I am hoping to be able to start and go somewhere with my venture on Ebay (and possibly Amazon) before launching a website in the future as well.\n\nBackground Info: I am a 17 year old entrepreneur working online fulltime on my own projects/ventures. In the past 4 months I have successfully launched 3 revenue generating websites that are all making profit; they are managed entirely by a freelancer in Pakistan and I pay the freelancer a percentage of the profits from all websites each week.\n\nI turn 18 in 1.5 months which means PAYPAL which means EBAY and that will align with my schedule and plans to starting a dropshipping based e commerce business.\n\nI feel that I have a solid understanding of the dropshipping basics (i.e. how it works, warranty info, finding the right products to sell, how Ebay works, selling fees, etc.). My question is; what advice do you have for someone planning on getting into a dropshipping business? What am I likely missing and what do I need to know that I probably don't currently know?\n\nCheers everyone!","name":"t3_4n67oq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-08 19:27:58","week":23}

For our example, lets use trifold leather wallets for men. You find a vendor you like and trust from China (Alibaba or Dhgate or whatever you use) then have them label it with your company name. You put it on Amazon and start getting sales. \n\n\n**My questions are:**\n- Why would someone purchase your item instead of someone elses that actually has a big brand name?\n- Why not just keep it generic and instead of private labeling, just buy generic trifold leather wallets? Wont you save money by not labeling your brand on it?\n- How do you get seen when there is so much competition with many of them with big brand names or even other private label trifold wallets? Is this where the whole reviews and good descriptions come in place?\n\n\nI've had success with eBay about 2 years ago but never ventured into Amazon nor did I understand how to get sales with private labeling.

A points system can be used to incentivise people to actually use the car stickers instead of putting them in the bin and taking the voucher.  Have a QR code on every sticker so that when a user finds one in the real world and scans it with their smartphone, both the owner of the sticker and the scanner earn more points and thus earn more money.  \n \nThat would also incentivise people to place the advertising stickers in more prominent locations.

{"id":"4nb6sa","author":"rulesforrebels","body":"This topic seems to come up time and time again, how do I find hot selling items to sell on eBay, Amazon, or my own website.\n\n\n\nThis is both an art and a science. There isn't necessarily a single tool that just magically spits out items we can sell that will make us money. There are a few tools which will point us in the right direction. A couple of paid tools is [Jungle Scout] (http://affiliate.junglescout.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=618), as well as [Terapeaks Category Research Tool] (https://www.terapeak.com?rfsn=188488.9b3d9) which lists every eBay category and is color coded to show what categories are hot. You can then dig deeper into these categories to see sub categories and even products that are hot. I'm going to cover things pretty in depth in this post but if you'd like to see an actual screencast of the process and stats here's a good [Youtube Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04oTbbbgcx8). \n\n\n\nThose are the only tools that will give us product ideas. There are plenty of other tools we can use to actually vet a potential product and find things such as if the trend for that product or niche is gaining or falling in popularity, sales stats of those products so we know how much sells in a given week, the sell through rating, etc. As far as free tools Unicorn Smasher and Camel Camel Camel are two great free resources. In terms of paid programs again you can use Terapeaks product research or Jungle Scout to pull this type of data.\n\n\n\nIn terms of actually comming up with ideas, some people like to search Amazon's hot selling list looking for ideas. Some people like first selecting a niche and then finding products that buyers of that niche are interested in. One of my personal strategies which is tough for a newbie but easy once you have a bit more experience is basically just browsing Ali Express, Alibaba and DH Gate and looking at products. When I see a product which peaks my interest I'll search those products on eBay or Amazon, I'll use some of the tools mentioned above and see how well they sell and lastly I'll compare the price I can acquire or buy wholesale versus what it's selling for on eBay or Amazon. If the margins are huge I'll be less cautious as I dont need to sell a ton of products to make my money back. For example one of my hottest selling items is a $2 item I sell for $29.95. If I buy 100 pieces of inventory, once I sell about 15 pieces I've made my money back so even if I get stuck with teh rest of the inventory I've already made my money back. If it sells well I've made my money back after 15 units and the rest is just money in the bank. If the margins are slimmer I'm quite a bit more cautious in entering the space. Not only do I have to sell a larger percentage of my inventory to make my money back, but furthermore, with smaller margins I can't lowball the market and dump my inventory if it comes to that like I would with the $29.95 item. With that item even if I wasn't selling I could drop my price to say $10, massively undercut the competition and still be in the green. \n\n\n\nNow when it comes to searching for products there's no hard or fast rule about a product must do such and such amount in sales or have a sell through rating over 50% or anything like that. If I had to nail down rough numbers I'd like to see at least 3k a week in sales with a 40% sell through rating or more but again, if a product has a really high sell through rating I may decide to sell it even if overall sales are low as that tells me there's not enough people selling that item. If a product has huge margins again I may settle for a lower sell thru rating or a lower overall sales number. Another thing I'll do to check a product is run a search on Amazon. If the search results all have over 1,000 feedback that may be a product I'll shy away from as its going to be too tough to overcome such established sellers. If there's some products on first page with reviews of less than 100 I feel pretty confident I can catch up to those sellers with a well optimized listing, some external promotion of my product on social media and blogs, and by giving away a few products for free in return for a review.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of competition, don't be scared because other people are selling your product. Your pretty much never going to find a product with no competition and even if you do it's only a matter of time before people take notice and come compete with you. Another tip, don't get hungup on being the lowest price. There is always someone willing to work for less margin than you so dont worry about being the lowest, I routinely charge 30% more than the competition but I still outsell my competitors because I put together better listings, I have a better understanding of ebay and amazon SEO and how to optimize a listing, and I feel I can do a better job of selling and marketing a product than the competition. \n\n\n\nNow eBay is much different than Amazon in terms of winning the buy box on Amazon where multiple sellers can share the same listing as opposed to eBay where everyone has their own unique listing. On Amazon I'm a big fan of either bundling or private labeling. I won't go too in depth on this as it could be a book on its own but basically the idea of private labeling is taking a generic product others are selling and comming up with your own branding and packaging. The idea of bundling is putting together a lot of cheap items to add some perceived value or make a package. Both these thigns will keep others off of your Amazon listing so your not fighting in a price race to the bottom with 10 other sellers on your listing. Bundling in a nutshell would be as opposed to selling a fire starter alone, you may buy a few cheap survival items ie a firestarter, compass, and a paracord bracelet, calling it a survival pack and selling it for say $15 where as each one of these items probably cost you less than .50 cents. It also deters competition as its easy for someone to source one item and hop on your listing but most people who \"piggyback\" are lazy and will not go to the trouble of sourcing 3 items or a collection of items so this allows you to keep your own listing and not compete with other sellers for the buy box.\n\n\n\nLastly I wanted to touch on the topic of how to sell stuff on Amazon and eBay. They are both essentially search engines alot of people forget that. Because of this you can optimize your listing in a way to where your product can rise above other products when buyers are searching for your product or similar products. This comes down to many factors, some are somewhat out of your control when starting out like sales rank and seller feedback, if your a new seller your somewhat behidn the 8 ball. That said you can optimize your listing by using the maximum number of pictures, put as many items specifics as you can, have a well optimzied title with lots of keywords buyers are searching for. For example dont put in your title number one seller on ebay or amazon. No buyer is searching for that, however terms like Watermelon Slicer, Kitchen, Fruit, Corer, etc for a kitchen product would be terms buyers are searching for. YOu should also have a long and detailed description, dont just say Watermelon Slicer for sale, not only is that not professional, it doesn't give buyers much to go on and lastly it's not effective optimization for a listing.\n\n\n\nOne thing I really want to stress is that you can't throw an item up on Amazon sit back and hope it sells. A few years back you could buy Oil Diffusers off Alibabab for pennies and sell them for $29.95 all day long, those days are gone, there's a lot more competition on Amazon in general and specifically FBA. You really need to do some external promotion ie social media, blogs, content marketing, youtube videos. Not only will this drive traffic to your listings which in turn could lead to buys, but it's a longterm strategy as well. If someone reads a blog post about cooking and then winds up linking to your Amazon cooking item that tells Amazon people searching for cooking like your item and you'll begin ranking higher for that keyword.\n\n\n\nHopefully this gives you some insight into how to seek out eBay and Amazon items. As i explained above there's a wealth of tools to help you find products as well as vet products but at the end of the day until you actually list and try to sell an item you really dont know how well its going to do. I often recommend to newbies start with cheap items like sub $3 item, there's even plenty of items you can find for 0.20 to 0.50 cents. You can buy 100 pieces of inventory and only set yourself back $20 or $30, if it flops oh well you waste more money than that on dinner. If a product does well you load up on the next order or potentially decide to private label that product.\n\n\n\nOne last thing, if your totally and completely lost and are looking for product ideas or want a list of product ideas to act as guidance on the types of products you ideally want to be looking for checkout this [list of hot selling products] (https://gum.co/hotsellingebayitems) in various categories. \n\n\n\nIf anyone has any questions on what I've explained feel free to drop a post below and I'll reply to any questions.

I pay for my own rent, food, and tuition for college and took off a year (2014-2015) to save up for tuition and get myself financially on my feet after my parents refused to pay my tution or help with anything. While saving up for school, I got an Amazon credit card and bought a laptop (around 1,000 plus interest) , thinking I could use my cash stash to pay off the monthly minimum payments. I also got a credit card for BofA which had increasing charges on it as I ran out of money towards the end of the semester and had to put charges on it (500). I also foolishly got a paypal credit account when I first got my job, didn't realize the sky high interest rate and went crazy shopping on there (1000) when I first got my job, thinking I'd pay it back. After a year of school, I was promised by the manager of my job that I could work there during summer break and I got enough financial aid/fed loans to pay for tuition. However, since I've been back home, my manager screwed me over and said they weren't hiring after I sent in my application twice (they claimed both times it never went through). I've been sending in job applications in like crazy and haven't heard back from anything and I still need to save up for housing as well. I'm freaking out as financial reality hits, and my parents aren't going to bail me out at all. \n\nMy grandma has offered to pay for my rent for the upcoming year, provided that I work for her the entire summer, thus killing off any job opportunities back home.

I've been offered a potential on campus job as an office assistant next semester, but its not guaranteed from what I can tell.

Designing an email isn't hard. Its time consuming. Ive wasted hours upon hours designing emails to fit certain products, certain niches anything you can think of. But at the end of the day nothing seems to beat the typical written email for your best ROI.\n\nIt seems that the older crowd prefers all text in their emails. Anything from say 35 and older.\n\nA simple logo up top. A bolded header of whats going on and a couple sentences explaining what is you want from them or are telling them with a link or two thrown in there in dark blue bold.\n\n2. If your market is the younger generation, go with visuality instead of written content. The new generation is different. They want everything \"NOW\" so i based our emails on that exact concept. \"NOW\".\n\nBe minimilistic, use nice pictures, no more than 2 or 3 fonts, and no more than a sentence or two....but thats it. The best A/B testing method i did was sending about 2000 separate emails. 1000 all written and 1000 with that \"NOW\" theory of concept.\n\nThe click through rate was as expected. The visual aspect beat the all text content by over 50%.\n\n3. The typical receiver wants a lot of great info/content if you're gong to take up their time. Again depending on the age, i find that people 35 and under live getting A LOT of content but hate reading and spending their time on more than a sentence. So keep your content informative and up to par.\n\nAnyone older than that seems okay with whatever you send and seem more generous to leave reviews, be a return costumer, and dont mind reading a bit more.\n\n4. Make sure you spend some time on your emails. Dont be spending 5 minutes on something if you dont know that it works perfectly. Theres countless businesses out here doing this. When they send out emails they don't think about what they're doing and don't know how important emails can really be or help for their company. \n\nPerfect it. Use it. And implement it.\n\nI dont have much time to write right now but I'll be coming back to this when i can amd update which is why it seems a little rushed. \n\nIve also received a lot of DM's from people replying to my AMAZON consultation business which i think instead of helping everyone individually and charging i will just write a very long post on here, will get back to this, also, when i have the time as i am super busy with work and my own projects at the moment.\n\nSorry reddit im taking so long, been suuuper busy.\n\nFeel free to share what you do to better your email marketing and help out your fellow entrepreneurs!","name":"t3_4nlrjc","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-11 17:14:06","week":23}

{"id":"d3xovgy","author":"Hi-Standards","body":"I think these two previous posts will give you an idea of the two general answers you'll get here.  Either, don't do it! or one really specific thing that worked for someone else, but may not be right for you.\n\nHere's what I suggest you do if you are serious.\n\nIf you want to go internet related, you're going to almost certainly deal with some sort of ecommerce.\nThere's plenty of ways to do that.\n\nAffiliate programs, sell for or through 3rd party providers/suppliers/websites.\nExample: Sell makeup for Avon, or sell silly straws on Amazon.\nThere are people who buy manufactured items in bulk, typically from Asia, then repackage them for sale via Amazon.  The smartest ones ship their items to Amazon and let them deal with it.  The right item can make you thousands a month.  Such as BPA free Nalgene style water bottles.  IT IS ALL ABOUT REVIEWS for success.\n\n\nWebsites - a website or a series of websites set up to specifically generate interest usually regarding one topic.\nExample: Site draws you in with basic info on how to make a great recipe, then offers a cook book with that and many more similar recipes available on that site.  \nSome people have entire networks of these sites and making quite a living just selling what equates to clicked links.\n\nStorefront Website - set up a legit shop online selling whatever your hearts desire.  \nExample:  Any one of the million tshirt companies online.\n\nAnything else is going to get into specific niche markets, and while they do exist, I'm not sure you're looking to get into coding to start a business.\n\nso what about brick and mortar?\n\nI actually have no problem with mutatron's suggestion.  I think if you were to start looking, surrounded yourself with some smart people (an attorney, an accountant and maybe a good business consultant makes for a great team) and really do your due diligence as far as researching every potential avenue goes.\n\nOr, if you are ok with a more modest life, owning a bar or hot dog joint can be fun and reasonably profitable if you create a space for yourself in a smart market.  This could be something you start from scratch or buy and \"re-imagine\" an existing location.\n\nas Conscise_Pirate pointed out though, if you don't necessarily have any particular expertise, it may make choosing a smart business more difficult.  Skilled trades can be turned into businesses with what really is no more than some paperwork and a small investment.  If you don't have a tradesmen skill or haven't necessarily operated any other businesses, as a business owner myself, I'd be doing society a disservice by suggesting anything about it is easy.  \n\nIt will take blood sweat and tears along with that money to really make it into anything big.  Not many businesses are started and end up on top by sheer luck.  So with that disclaimer out of the way, I will always encourage business ownership.  I think it's great, I think it creates pride and purpose and allows a person or persons to truly leave a legacy.\n\nYou're at the drawing board though.  Step 1a.  First things first, you need to at least come up with a general direction for the idea of your business.  \nOnce you do that, you have to realistically ask yourself about what kind of a scale of a business you want to run.  Selling screen printed Tees out of your uncle's garage and starting the next threadless.com both stem from the same idea, but one makes a couple hundred a week and the other is an internationally recognized tee shirt printing monster making millions a year.\n\nAs I reread your post to make sure I've covered as much as I could, it's clear you two are no dummies, you being a graduate that made some money trading properties and he a seemingly successful business man with some experience.\n\nI think if you truly want to do this, you two need to sit down and figure out a business that works for both of you.  Then build a business plan with goals you both can agree on.  Once you get to this point you need to do the work and research to figure out how to make those goals achievable, the kind of timeline you need to make it happen and then goals for what comes in 5 to 10 years.  \n\nI always try and create a business plan so detailed it could almost be a turn key manual on how to start company \"X\" so that I have something to refer to as I move through the initial processes.\n\nI hope some of this helps, not knowing where you live, what you and your uncle's skill sets and interests are, its really hard to make reasonable suggestions.  I have opened a few businesses, and am currently starting my most recent from scratch again.  It takes time, and energy and sacrifice but with patience and perseverance it will always be worth while.\n\n","name":"t1_d3xovgy","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-06-06 06:21:48","week":23}

Let's break it into small pieces.\n\n&gt; if you are selling items that are more expensive.\nI was thinking about selling them at a lower price (for the moment) to see if the idea gets validated. I want to be sure I got what you said: you think I should sell them for a little bit higher price?\n\n&gt;You need to sell 70 a week just to keep eating at taco bell and crashing on your mom's couch.\n\nI just finished high school and I'm currently living with my parents. Money-wise, this website has the goal of giving me some pocket money, as I want to cash out low amounts of money, only when needed. But yes, point understood - being financially independent is, of course, a great destination.\n\n&gt;you might be able to get enough customers by selling this stuff on Amazon.\n\nAlso relatable to the point above, I'm from Romania and I can't sell on Amazon from here (sadly).\n\n&gt;Also, your photos are not good enough. They are good, like a C+.\n\nEven the white-backgrounded ones? I know they're not A+, as I have some photos from the supplier (and some of them really suck, I'm talking here about those with the wooden background like this one: https://www.dandy-supply.com/collections/beaded/products/silver-owl-marble-x-blue-earth), others are done by myself \n\n&gt; If they had photos at the level of yours, they would be out of business fast.\n\nTotally agreed. If I get out of the validation phase, I will make sure they're A+. But again, let me see if I understood what you said: you're talking now about the photos on the main slider, the ones with watches and bracelets, right?\n\n&gt;Your copy also is way sub par. First thing you see should be value proposition and call to action. Whipping post is brilliant again, the value proposition is a beautiful bag and the call to action is a cursor shaped like a finger \"touch it\"\n\nCan you give some examples from the website, please?\n\nThank you so much for the time and for the blunt feedback!\n\n","name":"t1_d3xwg1i","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-06 12:38:07","week":23}

First of all, let me say you that I do not judge anything you are doing but it is crazy how many people get into the same trap. You say you want traffic. And your goal is what?? \"to make a buck or two through Amazon Associates.\"?? Seriously? Again, please do not consider this as a bad intention post and please take it as feedback. \n\nOk, let me ask you something, how much money do you want to make from the website? 100 per month? 1000? 10? After answering this question, please tell me how many visitors would you want to meet your goal? 10000, 100000? \n\nWhat you are doing here, is __selling your visitors to advertisers__ veeeery cheap. If you are doing it just for fun, that's ok, but if you want to make money out of it, you must define the amount of money you make out of every visitor. For example, if you make 100 bucks for every 1000 visitors, it means you are making 10cents per visitor. So if you want to make $1000 you need ten thousand people, and the numbers are veeery generous. If you want to make more, you should increase the amount of money you make out of your visitors. \n\nIn order to have such big following, you need to build huge trust with your followers and trust on the internet is the hardest thing to build. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't care about traffic before I have exact numbers. To give you an example, you can check the website I am building here https://minimalifestyle.com I am giving my best book to visitors in order to have their emails, when I will release a product, people that liked the book will want more content and if I over-deliver my promise, the product will sell itself. \n\nThe main focus though is to create awesome content, to build trust with your followers and then looking for ways to send traffic. \n\nPlease do not burn yourself before you even start.

The category stays in one place, and as far as I know most Staples (et al) are very CC friendly for gift cards and VGCs. The $25k or $50k yearly maximum gives you the potential for 125k or 250k UR points per year. You could easily equal or surpass what you get for maxing your Freedom categories by buying Amazon gift cards, for example, or if you are feeling up to the MSing challenge, VGC.","name":"t1_d3ypweq","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-07 01:09:55","week":23}
{"id":"d3yq8kt","author":"mat_red","body":"I am so glad you posted this. New churners need to realize this: under the new co-branded 5/24, **Freedom cards are a BAD deal.**\n\nGetting either Freedom, which have 15k bonuses, means giving up a 50k or more bonus. Assuming 50k, that's a 35k point difference. With the Freedom Legacy, it would take over two years to make up for this difference, assuming you can get $3,000 of bonus spend on it each year (maxing out grocery and Amazon; I don't think many average cardholders can get much more than this). With the FU, it would take $70,000 of spend for that extra 0.5% to make up for the lost 35k in points. And that is just for a 50k bonus; a 70k bonus would be a loss of 55k points.\n\nAdditionally, the Freedom now has decent competition from other cards such as the Discover It and BCP (even with the new higher AF, you can still get ~4.5+% back on groceries if you use it for gas spend too). And there are a plethora of good 1.5-2% cards. So the opportunity cost of giving up a big bonus to get a Freedom probably should actually be considered close to that full 35k, since you could have gotten a 50k card offer, then another decent 2% and 5% card after you filled your 5/24 slots. So that is at least 35k points down the drain, TWICE if you get both Freedoms.\n\nAnd then there's the consideration that the Freedom may just become an FU anyways, so...\n\nAnd since many people downgrade their CSP after a year, you'll likely be getting a Freedom in a year anyways, so...\n\nPeople need to get this. These cards are NOT worth what you are giving up. Unless you are keeping the CSP long-term and BIG-time into MS, your 5/24 slots would be much better spent on big sign-up bonuses.","name":"t1_d3yq8kt","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-07 01:18:33","week":23}

{"id":"d3ysykx","author":"dgwingert","body":"A good point, but I think your math may be off. Are you considering the $100 sign-up bonus (50, doubled) for the Discover? The Freedom has $50 more in bonus, which is made up for by only $1000 in 10% spending vs. the Freedom's 5% (assuming one spends about the same amount in the Freedom and Discover bonus categories. IF we stick to cashback value, which is admittedly extremely biased against the Freedom.\n\nThe value of UR points is important, and I'd say 1.8 cents per point is a reasonable value, so lets just take it as the gospel and use it for our math. If we apply that value to the Freedom categories, it essentially earns at a rate of 1.8*.05=9%. Compared to the Discover It, that is almost as good. It would take an admittedly hefty chunk of change, $5000 in category spend to make up for this discrepancy. The Discover earns an effective 2% for the first year on non-bonus spend compared to the Freedom's effective 1.8%.\n\nTo make up a completely imaginary person that is just beyond the breakeven point:\n\n30k/year in credit card spending, 3000 of which is in bonus categories.\n\nWith Discover It, they'd end up with $840 in cashback\nWith Freedom, they'd end up with $756 in Hyatt stays or United flights\n\nIgnoring the flexibility of the cash back compared to the UR points, I'd say it is somewhat plausible to STILL come out ahead on the Discover IT, although I admittedly am stretching the limits of plausibility with Discover's acceptance rate. Still, if someone shops on Amazon, buys gift cards at their grocery store in the appropriate quarter, etc, $3000 or more of bonus spend is not too unreasonable to achieve.","name":"t1_d3ysykx","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-07 02:27:49","week":23}

{"id":"d3z9094","author":"ntsp00","body":"APR *is* the interest rate and they all have them. They rape you of your money if you carry a balance and on top of that only make the minimum payment. Minimum payments are little more than the interest you're getting charged so it takes years to pay off. If you pay the card off in full each month you don't get charged interest. \n\nSince you don't have bad credit you should qualify for an unsecured card. Join creditkarma.com (it's free) and it will suggest cards to you that you have a high likelihood of getting approved for. Only apply for one that says \"Good\" or \"Very good\" approval odds. Look for one that has no annual fee and has cashback rewards. Here are cards CreditKarma recommends that have no annual fee:\n\nhttps://www.creditkarma.com/shop/creditcards/noannualfee\n\nAt first I only qualified for the Capital One Platinum card which has no cashback rewards but after having that for awhile I qualified for the American Express Everyday card so I now earn cashback on whatever I buy with it. \n\nDO NOT apply for a secured card unless you don't qualify for any unsecured cards. Secured cards require a deposit that they keep until you close the card. Whatever deposit you give them (usually a minimum of $200) is what your credit limit will be. They usually have an annual fee and when you do close the card it will hurt your credit score because it will lower the average age of your accounts. This is especially impacts you since you have no credit history. \n\nYou can even just get a store card which is the same thing as an unsecured credit card but you can only use it at that particular store. Some have great benefits like the Amazon store card. 5% back on anything you buy on Amazon. \n\nAnd side note, just because you have $6k doesn't mean you need a $15k car. You can buy one much cheaper so your first loan is for only a few thousand. Remember if the car is $15k you have to add on sales tax (7% is $1050), dealer fees, and interest. And the entire time you have that loan you'll be required to carry full coverage car insurance or they can repo the car since it will be a breach of contract. When you're shopping around you should get some insurance quotes too so you have a rough idea of what your insurance payment will be each month on top of your car payment.","name":"t1_d3z9094","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-07 11:28:56","week":23}

{"id":"d3zgc81","author":"creaturefear","body":"TCP and Philips are listed as #1 and #2 for best sellers on Amazon. TCP is my top pick for LED bulbs. Philips has a good reputation for other products, so I'd assume their LEDs are good as well. But I haven't personally tested them, so I can't say for certain. There are so many brands listed on Amazon that I've never heard of. I just stick with the ones I know. Not saying you're getting poor quality if you go with one of the other guys, but just compare customer reviews and tech specs. Make sure you know what you're getting. The most important things to look for are Color temperature, which is measured in degrees Kelvin. If you like warmer \"softer\" light, you'll want a lower color temp. If you like cooler \"brighter\" light, you'll want a higher color temp. Incandescent light is around 2700K, Halogen is around 3000K. Your typical \"doctor's office\" white lighting is close to daylight, which starts around 4000K and up. \"Daylight\" is about 5000K. If you are really picky, you may also want to look at the Color Rendering Index (CRI), which basically tells you how similar the LED bulb's light is to natural light. A higher CRI gives you a more faithful resemblance to natural light, and also allows the light to better bring out the colors in objects that the light is cast on. And of course, you also want to look for life expectancy. Good LEDs are usually rated at least 25,000 hours, but many are now rated for longer. You may encounter \"vintage style\" LEDs that are rated for only about 15,000 hours. I'm not entirely sure why they are not expected to last as long, but 15,000 hours is still pretty good.","name":"t1_d3zgc81","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-07 16:17:24","week":23}

Possible cons are that people might expect next-day delivery and support in their native language. And also they might expect payment methods you might even haven't heard of - for example, in Estonia, we have direct bank links - in cart, you have a link to your bank's online site where you can make instant transaction. When completed, you'll be redirected to the store. And they're by far the most popular payment gateways here, quite a lot of Estonians don't even have credit cards because of they just don't need them shopping online.\n\n2) Make a single brand and domain. Stick for English only or maybe add 2-3 bigger languages too (German, Spanish, French? sth like that). Then people won't expect next-day delivery and understand that credit card/Paypal is standard for paying. If your product is unique, this shouldn't be a problem at all.

It seems that getting into retail is difficult if you don't have a lot of money. You have to provide them with a lot of inventory, their payment terms are 90 days or more so you have to float the cost of manufacturing for up to six months or more sometimes, and you have to bear the brunt of returns etc. \nOn the other hand, a single product does not a company make. Your best bet is to sell them on Amazon to begin raising money and develop a peripheral product line to maximize your customer lifetime value, then once you have that in place, it's easier for you to consider starting ad driven or content driven ecommerce, and ultimately getting into retail. An alternate path is to license your patent to an existing manufacturer.

But it is also important to consider the volume required to MS with FU vs Ink. The fee costs may be similar (or slightly better with the shopping portal) but the Ink has only 30% of the volume required.

It has happened several times now and it is extremely demotivating.\n \nOriginally I set up a website for people to upload their own comics, my website was going to be their publisher and sales platform, they would promote their own work and I'd handle the shipping of a professionally printed graphic novel to the end customer.  The plan was to split profits with the author and everyone wins, I didnt have to do sh1t in terms of being creative and they didnt have to worry about the logistics of making a real comic.  I would never have to worry about quality control as I was printing the comics to order, so I was never going to end up with a stack of 1,000 \"reddit-man vs the world vol52\"'s that nobody wanted.\n \nI had a ton of interest on facebook after getting some art students to help me by submitting comics.  The website worked, the file previews took about 3 days straight of no eating or sleeping to get perfect but were eventually flawless, the sales and feedback pages were perfect, the printers in China were amazing to deal with on skype and were printing and express shipping them back to me for about $4, everything seemed to be in place to launch for real.  I had months of marketting plans lined up, mainly youtube videos and pushing affiliate plans, social media campaigns could probably have taken car eof themselves.  Sh1t got real when I managed to talk 2 big youtubers into meeting me at a geek conference, via email at least they were offered big affiliate %'s if they made a couple of videos and 100% profits if they put their name to their own branded/drawn comics, just so I could get word out.\n \nOf course like I say, out of the blue half a dozen other websites popped up that had never existed before, one of them had a team of 20 people and owned all of their own professional binding and printing equipement.  They had tie ins with Amazon, Facebook aswell as Disney and other media companies.  I later found out they had an entire legal team dedicated to hunting down copyright infringements from competitors, whereas I had me+google search.\n \nNeedless to say nothing came off it, I didnt lose any money as I had very little to being with, just lost a lot of time.  Other ideas I've had since have gone a similar route but I've never been in as deep as the comics site.  The most recent kick in the balls was very surprising as it was entirely localy based, still somebody else jumped in before me because I've not been able to move quick enough, they were in a better position to start.\n \nSorry for the wall of text but thats the answer to the question, what held me back and what frustrated me was working with no resources, human or otherwise.","name":"t1_d40d3og","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-08 04:47:41","week":23}

{"id":"d40gu0c","author":"programmingguy","body":"Thinking of getting into blue chip data center REITs like DLR now is a bit late considering they've have being going up like a rocket since 2014 and trouncing the S&amp;P500 while paying out growing dividends due to their tax structure. That's the only reason main street investors are noticing them now as broad based indexes are not returning much. I only know DLR as I owned it since 2013 and my initial research was good enough to hold a sizable position. DLR was a good way to get in on the cloud and big data frenzy while indirectly having conservative exposure to growth companies like Amazon, VMWare and also mature companies like Micrsofot IBM, Time Warner Cable etc.\n\nDLR now yields only 3.5% which is very low compared to its historical average. 2013 was the time to get in and accumulate positions and then feed off dividend growth thanks to fear mongering from Highfields' Jon Jacobson's presentation at the Ira Sohn conference on DLR and Ben Bernake's taper tantrum which sent the stock tumbling by some ~40% that year (I believe it came as low as ~$40/shr). DLR yielded some 6.5% back then. The shareprice has gone up so much that it now yields only some 3.5% inspite of regular annual dividend increases with some in the double digits. That's very low for DLR and very low for REITs in general. I haven't reevaluated my positions since 2013 except for a brief look at the 10K and 10Q reports so I don't know how overvalued they are now with respect to FFO/shareprice (low interest rates should have a lot to do with their valuations right now). Sure, you could dabble in it a little bit and scale in during dips. There might be some interest rate related shareprice resets but other than that, the market seems to love DLR so who knows if there wil be a sizable correction coming soon when the market resets.\n\nOn another note, I'm starting to see more and more retail investor boggleheads who are generally known to swear by their leader's mantras and countless MPT studies getting worn out with little or no returns from their ultra diversified allocations due to recent market stagnation and are now experimenting a little bit in old portfolio theory aka *investing in good companies at reasonable prices*. The only reason I stick with index funds is because I have no other choice in some of my company sponsored retirement plans. Their performance has been a drag on my overall portfolio. For other brokerage accounts, holding a few good companies through ups and downs and buying when they tank due to market fear or a bad quarter or a downgrade while using dividends to rebalance works out just great. If you have a regular job with enough cashflow, sufficient cash buffer and have no need to take your money out and can keep investing when cash rich stocks you have evaluated tank, you should be easily getting very good returns.

Because what you get when you search for terms like that is SEO targeted spam and click bait.\n\nFor example, start actually reading the Amazon Fulfilment documentation, see what's involved, check out the costs and such. Get a product idea and search for wholesalers, get a rough idea of the wholesale price. Go search the consumer marketplaces to get an idea of the current retail prices.\n\nNow crunch the numbers. Run into any problems? You'll know the specifics to search for and you'll be busting through the BS filter that is SEO specialists peddling their wares for key search phrases.\n\nThe same applies for a lot of those industries.

Solid tips for him to cross check against his current approach. \n\n\"You simply want to find a niche, find a problem or gap, come up with a solution that provides value to the user, and then create a way to inform the user that your solution exists.\"\n\nI like this quote in particular.  Too often people start with what they think is a good idea versus what people actually want. \n\nYour approach is good for selling things on Amazon.  \n\nFor businesses outside of Amazon I recommend people follow a similar approach with different tools.\n\nPull out your credit card statements from the last 3 months.  Look at them and find purchases you made based on things you are passionate about. \n\nWrite them down on a piece of paper.  You should have 5 to 10.  Then filter by which ideas you could potentially develop an online solution for.  Could be an e-book, content, a course.  Narrow you list down to 3.  Pick 1.\n\nGo talk to 10 people that have purchased a similar product in the 1 area you choose.  Ask them what their challenges are.  What would their life look like if the product met their expectations?\n\nThen build a solution using the language you hear during these interviews.  \n\nIt takes time and effort but you can get deep into the psychology of your audience and build products that blow them away. \n\nAs a way of background I have newsletter where I share proven case studies of successful entrepreneurs.  We profile many people who have built successful products.  If you're interested to learn more let me know and I can PM you the link.\n\nThanks again for sharing.

(i) MERRILL+ Visa Signature (my first card), Amazon Prime Store Card (5% Cash back--got 3 weeks ago), Chase Sapphire (Got 3 weeks ago), United MileagePlus (got 70k miles last week) also have a corporate Amex connected to MR\n**3. Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back?** Just getting started. I like lots of perks (premium travel, status, etc), but will take great value when I get it (e.g., amazon prime store card with 5% cash back\n**4. What point/miles do you currently have?** Currently have 100k+ united miles, building up UR and MR points\n**5. What is the airport you're flying out of?** Flying out of SFO\n**6. Where would you like to go?** Would like to go to LatAm in 6 months (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia) and TBD on a honeymoon 15 months from now\n\n**I have 3 ideas for go-forward strategies.**\n\n**1. Focus on Chase:** First, max out on Chase cards when I still can. I have gotten 3 cards recently, so would consider getting Chase Freedom Unlimited and one other Chase card with a big UR bonus (a 60k-70k ink offer) or Chase Southwest / Marriott or something like that. \n\n**2. Big Rewards Strategy** Second is to simply focus on big bonuses. Basically wait a few months to get bonuses on CS and United and then focus on 75k-100k offers\n\n**3. BankAmeriacard:**Third strategy I would really like opinions on is the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card. I have Platinum Honors status with the bank because I do my banking with them, which gives me a whopping 75% premium, meaning 2.6 points per dollar spent. BankAmericard is like the CapitalOne Venture Rewards card in that these points are redeemed on ANY travel at 1 cent per point. Sure, I like rewards but this yield, coupled with BankAmeriacard's cash back card (whose value is roided up to as high as 5.25% back on gas with preferred rewards) simply seem like the best value on everyday spend. The counter argument would be to cycle Chase Freedom Unlimited and Freedom. If you believe ThePointsGuys' valuations that a FU point is worth 2 cents, the Freedom Unlimited yield when converted to UR points is 3% vs. 2.625% for the BankAmericard. The other consideration here is BankAmericard is a great compliment to UR / MR points, which are typically better for airlines, whereas spending BankAmericard accumulation on hotels seems like really good value, since those deals are harder to come by. Perhaps you could argue my everyday card should be SPG then.\n\nWould love opinions here on these 3 different strategies, when I should get my next card and what my next card should be!

Your strategies aren't mutually exclusive, it's just maximizing your return. The Amex MR cards should be in good reach because you can't hit Chase other than those that are not under the 5/24 rule. (And using FU/Freedom is out of the question, because you can't get them for a while, and they aren't good as new signup cards)\n\nAs for the BankAmericard, if you have the status with the bank, I agree it offers the best fixed value redemption, but it is cashback. Unlike points, they have a fixed value - this may be good if you aren't willing to do the work and go through the hassle of optimizing cpp - but you miss out on a lot of the fun.\n\nThat card would be good to apply for after you get the Ink+.

That ship has sailed, and Amazon has increased the cost of selling and warehousing so much, that it isn't even worth it anymore to sell on there unless you have some incredible item to sell on there at a decent price point that you manufacture, and own all the rights to it as well.","name":"t1_d41c27i","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-08 21:49:26","week":23}

It was not, faster, better or cheaper.\n\nCorrect. 100%. \n\nIf it was all done by one person, then I would understand. For example, it's too uncommon for people (the lone inventor) to want to create the next-big-thing and then spend millions bringing it to market, only to have it fail. \n\nBut an entire company? Who did this? How does that happen? How did they miss something so seemingly obvious? And did they never test the product in anyone's home? \n\nBy the way, I should add a similar story with the Amazon Fire Phone (I think that's what they called it). The word on the street on this one, was the failure was based around trying to make Bezos happy, and not the average consumer. Not sure of the details or truth to that, but clearly another example of a complete product flop from a company known for fresh ideas. \n\nIt's also interesting to look at the other side, such as Apple. I can't really think of a major flop that they have ever done. Well...some didn't so well, but you know what I mean. They have had a very good track record of bringing out some amazing things to market. \n\nOkay...one more. Google glasses. Sort of flop.

Citi DC (8/15), Capital One Quicksilver (PCd from Venture opened 5/15), Amex BCE (7/13) and Costco (3/13), Amazon store card (6/14), Sallie Mae (7/15), Discover it (3/11), and a bank credit card through Elan (2/11). Also an AU on my wife's Quicksilver (8/14).\n\n    That puts me right at 5/24, one of the five being an AU, and another being something that was opened exactly 24 months ago (the 6/14 Amazon store card). Also, there's a recently-opened car loan - I'm not sure if that counts against 5/24 or not.\n\n3. I don't have fixed travel plans now - I'm starting a new job, so I don't know when I'll be able to take any vacation anytime soon - but I know I'll want to do some amount of travel in the future. I'm also thinking about buying a house, so I don't want to hit HPs too hard if I can avoid it.

Anyone have that and have opinions? Useful, or not worth it?\n\nAlso, if I go that route, I'm planning on getting a CSP first with what remains of my 5/24. Any suggestions for a second Chase card to get next month once the Amazon store card falls off? Should I wait until next month and get both cards at once? \n\nFinally, ideas on cards to get after that? Being based in Seattle, the Alaska Airlines companion pass seems quite tempting.

{"id":"d41lmlj","author":"GlutenFreeToys","body":"One caveat that everyone considering this should take in to consideration when analyzing data based on Amazon Best Seller Ranks (BSR):\n\nSince this has become a popular medium over the last year for new entrepreneurs, the Best Seller Ranks and Reviews are often artificially inflated due to exactly what you mentioned: Products given away at a discount in exchange for a review.  When this happens, sales rank is artificially inflated and reviews flood in which *appear* to give a product legitimacy.\n\nThe tools that you are using estimates sales based on the BSR, which at the time of your viewing could throw off a wildly inaccurate multiple that turns out to influence your decision.  I have seen products seemingly pop up overnight and due to manipulation and excessive giveaways, a product can appear to have a BSR of 50 with 300 reviews (all within the last week) and if you were to pull a snapshot on Jungle Scout it will tell you the item sells 3,000 units a month with monthly revenue of $75,000.  All of this while the item has yet to have ONE organic sale that generated any kind of profit.\n\nI realize that this risk is minimized because you're looking at the top 5 or 10 listings in the niche, but it's not uncommon for a generally competitive category to have several items from different sellers such as this which will heavily skew the Jungle Scout or Unicorn Smasher results and you'll find yourself in a market that doesn't have near the demand you thought it did.\n\nFrom observing the Facebook groups and Reddit communities that cover this method over the last year, I've seen many users find themselves in this exact situation with thousands of units of product that doesn't move. So be careful out there.  Do your due diligence as you would with any business idea.\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_d41lmlj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-09 01:29:44","week":23}

The Freedom really adds very little of value. You can buy gift cards to Amazon, grocery stores, gas stations, home improvement stores, and restaurants (among others) at 5x UR via Staples or Paypal digital gifts. If you have any plans of traveling domestically or to the Caribbean with your wife, the Southwest companion pass is going to be a much higher value than most other offers.

The main seller holds like 10 of the top 15 spots. And 4 of the top 5 spots. But they are not a household name or even close to it. And their .com site doesn't even show up on the first 3 pages of a google search for the main keywords.\n\nDoes this sound like something I should look into further. Or do I want even less google.com competition?\n\nThis is a niche product. And I am unsure on the cost to produce.\n\nThanks for your guide. Hopefully I can finally start to branch out.","name":"t1_d41uu7u","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-09 05:25:20","week":23}

If you are listing these items as 'New' and are not an unauthorized dealer then those items do not have the full warranty. Per Amazon's guidelines you cannot list them as 'New.' Of course most people ignore this. The de facto rule is that as long as it looks new and was not opened people will list items as new.\n\nIf I were you I would take down the item and throw it on ebay.

It might be hard to compete on Google rankings as first hits are from big stores but you can get your traffic from your network.\nBuild also a mailing list from your blog and a FB page to share some content and reach through different channel.\n\nIf you manage to build an audience you can then monetise using the Amazon affiliate program. For example, when writing a review, add an Amazon affiliate link to your post.\n\nThis approach is different from buying your own inventory but it can be a good way to start.

In your original thread I mentioned how you have to put void fill inside Sega CD cases or the game can pop out and rattle around.

I opened it up and there was no void fill and the game was loose with multiple straight scratches that look similar to yours, ended up having to return it. How it happens?

{"id":"d42q1ea","author":"yaoz889","body":"The match is about average. 1/4 of 15% is about a little less than 4%. I would say for sure contribute 15%, so you can get that extra 4% from the company. (Most company takes it automatically from your paycheck, so you might as well take advantage of it)\n\nAlso, gratz on your SO on his new job and good job on making the payments for your student loans. \n\n\nHere are the steps you should take:\n\n1. Take down high interest debt firsts. Use the avalanche method. Tackle the credit card debts (if you have any) and slowly take down the higher interest student loans. 6% first, then the 5%, then the 4%, etc. Remember, this is the most efficient, but if you prefer piece of mind, I suggest you might use it with the snowball method, if some of the loans are just a few thousand left. \n\n2. Make sure to have an emergency fund. At NYC, I would suggest at least $10k, but $15k would be a safer buffer. \n\n3. Make sure you have all the necessary insurance. If you are renting, has renter's insurance. Also, check out if either of your companies have discounts for insurances like health, auto or etc. \n\n4. Now comes the difficult part, investing. This topic is really just too broad to explain accurately, but let me give you a brief introduction. In the 401k, typically, there is not many choices you can pick, since there are lots of restrictions that the government places &amp; the companies contracts with various brokerages and etc. If you just want to put money in and forget, I suggest you just buy an index fund, it is the safe bet. \n\na)If you are willing to do a little more work, do the index &amp; high profile switch method. This just involves buying the index fund and watching like 10-20 high profile companies: Netflix, Amazon, Google, Walmart, McDonald, etc. When those companies have a sudden drop, research, just to make sure it isn't a big deal, then buy on the dip, after selling your index fund. When the company recovers like 50% to 75%, sell it for the profit. Do not get greedy, most people should use this method.\n\nb)However, if you are willing to take some risks, there are various other companies that you can solely invest in, but I recommend to diversify. Such as buy: 1 stock in e-commerce, 1 stock in energy, 1 stock in insurance and etc. This will lower your profit, but should generally lower your risks. However, buying individual stocks require a solid mentality. When I started, (as a test with like $1000), it was really difficult to stop myself from selling when it dropped like 20-30%. Therefore, if you do not have the mentality, just buy an index fund. \n\n\n5.  Set aside some money to reward yourselves, like a few hundred each month. Don't forget to enjoy life, but don't over indulge. Also, please don't buy a new car, this will make you regret in the future. \n\n\nJust as a last note, you are doing great. But don't increase your spending too much, unless you have enough for retirement. If you want to retire in NYC, you will need a significant amount of cash.\n\n","name":"t1_d42q1ea","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-09 21:50:28","week":23}

But the trick is not to get assigned or you'll realize the loss (or get assigned and it rallies more than what you made on the covered call and will cost you more to get in again).\n\n\n","name":"t1_d42yo2d","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-06-10 01:14:53","week":23}

{"id":"d433edk","author":"jordanwilson23","body":"Interesting approach.  I do the same thing on Amazon.  Also use Jungle Scount and Amz Tracker.  A couple things to add - To outrank your competition, you need to sell more units than them each day for about 2 weeks; 3 weeks if you have the cash flow.  To generate these sales you of course need to tank the price and spend heavy on ads and usually lose to rank up fast.  I try not to lose more than 5.00 per sale after ads.  This leads to some items launching at a 300.00 loss and some at a 1,500 loss depending on the velocity.  I am not the best at this as my top items are only at the 10 units per day range but I have seen some people successfully tackle launches for 100 units a day items and it usually cost them well over 25K to get the items off the ground.  Spending on ads and soliciting reviews is going to be your main factors to get ranked up.  I think your goal of 10 units a day is good since this would involce niches with other sellers moving 10 units a day which is pretty easy.  Sounds like you pulled a lot of info from ASM.

You're selling wood products, make people remember that. Something like \"GotWood\", \"WoodsNStuff\", \"Woodn\" if you want to be hipster. At least have the name describe what you sell. -- If for whatever reason you're hell bent on keeping Regular fit then at least buy regularfit.com as it's expiring soon.\n\nThe website isn't too bad. I would change shipping times to 3-4 weeks, personally I use 2 to 2 months. It's better to deliver more than the buyer expects (early delivery) than have expectations you can't meet (late delivery). If the buyer wants the stuff now they would be using Amazon Prime, if they're buying from you chances are they don't care if it takes long if you're honest with them.\n\nIf you start getting sales, think about getting another theme. You got the basic free Shopify one and it screams dropshipper. Install Google Analytics, it doesn't look like you're using that and you'll want the metrics when you advertise. I'd remove the top bar, not because it shouldn't be there, but the top left icon makes people leave your website. Usually that's where people expect to find YOUR logo and if they click it they should go to your home page... not an external website.

{"id":"d43k6ba","author":"NormanConquest","body":"I feel like you're overthinking it. So, I'll try answer your questions and then look at your scenarios. \n\n1. You can buy shares in a publicly traded company at any time when that exchange is open. So I can buy shares listed on the NYSE between 9:30am and 5pm New York time. \n\n2. At any one time during market open, there will be millions of people wanting to buy a large company's stock. Banks, brokerages and other members of the stock exchange are there to facilitate deals. That is their function as dealing members. They literally match buy and sell orders. \n\nIt's simplest when you use the example of open-outcry markets. Let's imagine that I am a dealer who works on the NYSE floor. I get a call from my office telling me that there's a client who wants to buy 1000 AMZN shares at market (that means at the best price they can get on the market). I write that down, then I literally go looking for someone who has 1000 shares to sell me.\n\nI stick up my hand, and do some hand signals as well as shout that I want 1000 AMZN at market, who's got them for me? Let's say it's now trading at $100. \n\nAnother dealer from another brokerage has a client who wants to sell 500 shares of AMZN at market. He'll say to me, \"Got 500 at market\" We'll both check the ticker board to see what price amazon last traded at (or maybe not, since we're both trading at market), and I'll say, \"Mine\". He'll say, \"Yours\". That means I accept his offer and it's a deal. Now, there's a small difference between the buy and sell prices (the spread). Me and the other guy essentially split that between us. \n\nI'll write the other dealer's name on a ticket and hand it over to the desk or something, however it works in that exchange, and the deal will be processed. The shares will be transferred to my brokerage's account, and from there to our client. \n\nBut now I've still got 500 shares my client wants to buy. So I repeat the process but this time I can't find anyone offering at $100. There's a guy selling 100 shares at $100, but the next offers I can find are 200 shares at $100.50 and 200 at $101.\n\nI'll probably take both of those deals, because the client wanted to buy at market. But once that happens (assuming we're the only guys trading Amazon on the floor), there will now have been deals at $100.50 and later at $101. The next person coming in wanting to buy or sell at market will most likely get the last traded price. Someone wanting to buy at $100 will have to wait for a seller who is prepared to accept $100 - but why would they when there's an at-market buyer willing to pay $101?\n\nComputer trade matching works almost exactly the same. Your brokerage places your order in the market, and matches it with a sell order either fully or in part, and the execution models take care of making sure you get the best price based on when you entered your trade. \n\nSo your questions on this scenario:\n\n1. Banks/brokerages will rarely take directional trades, because they make money from volume of transactions, not from being right on which way a stock is going. If they sell you their own shares, they have to have them (or borrow them). If they have shares, they have them because they want to have them and won't sell just because a client wants to buy. They will match your order with another order if at all possible. \n\n2. Every buyer and seller will usually get the best available price at the time their order is executed. Sometimes there is not enough liquidity to match every trade at the price the trader wanted, but that's life. If there's a big enough difference in price and the order is large enough, your broker should check with you if you're okay with the new price. But prices do change by the millisecond (or with every deal). \n\n3. Not sure I follow. Yes there is a system that tells a trading client what price to show based on dealing data from the exchange. No I doubt it's possible to predict this between the time the data leaves the exchange and when the price is changed on your trading client - and even if there was, how would this help you? The price has already changed on the exchange. There's no way to \"jump in front of\" the prices changing at the exchange. \n\nFor your next scenario: there is no formula, that I am aware of. There is simply the verbal or electronic agreement of brokerage firms on what their clients are willing to pay or accept for the shares. Which is why on very illiquid shares the price can jump around wildly. If the last quoted price was $10 and you want to buy, but the only guy selling is offering at $15, that's the price you get. \n\nIn real life you can see \"market depth\". That's basically a table of prices and volume. Say the current price is $100/share. You can pull up the market depth for that stock and see that the majority of volume is trading around that $100 mark. But there will be bids and offers in decreasing volume on both sides of $100. If there are more buyers than sellers, they will use up all the offers at $100 and start having to pay $101 for their stocks. When all of those offers get sucked up, the price will move up to $102. \n\nIs this making sense? The price moves in one direction rather than another because there are more bids or offers pushing from that direction. If lots of people want to buy but only a few people want to sell, those who want to sell can command a higher price. It's the same as selling sausage rolls at a street market. \n\n**What the bank gets:** Yes the bank gets a cut - known as the spread between the bid and offer price. Let's say we're trading AMZN and the \"pure\" price is $100. But actually the price is quoted as $99.50/$100.50. The spread is $1. As a buyer I will pay $100.50 and a seller will receive $99.50. The remainder is the spread and it's shared between the seller's broker and the buyer's broker.\n\nBetween those two parties there is a kind of spread as well. It's just like retail markup. Let's say my client wants to buy AMZN at $100. I can get $100.25 from a seller on the floor, so I charge my client $100.50. The seller on the floor likewise gets a price of $99.75 from me and remits $99.50 to their client. There's a lot of maths that goes into spreading, but basically a bank is likely to get more business if they offer tighter spreads. That means they let the counterparty bank get a bigger portion of the spread (they get $0.25 but I maybe only take 10c), but do higher volume. \n\nYour last question seems to be about IPOs (initial public offerings).  Now, these are complex deals put together by investment banks that specialize in IPOs and I don't know a lot about how they're set up. But basically you decide what you think your company is worth. Say 10 million, and you are going to sell 50% of your company on the stock market to raise capital. To make life easy, you decide to issue 5 million shares and propose a market price of $1.\n\nOn the day of your IPO your shares will open at $1. From there, that 50% portion of your business (and by association the rest of it), is worth precisely what the market will pay for one share, multiplied by 10 million. Make sense? The market could drop your shares to a penny in a morning's trading, or pump it to $10 before the closing bell - you have zero control unless you step into the market yourself as a buyer or seller. \n\nAnything could happen once you float and that, my friend, is Capitalism!\n\nEDIT: If you still have questions or you want a more practical explanation of how you, as a regular dude, can buy or sell shares, I'll be happy to explain and maybe point you in the direction of an affordable decent brokerage that's suitable for a beginner.","name":"t1_d43k6ba","subreddit":"economy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhpn","created_utc":"2016-06-10 14:53:12","week":23}

I also showed him how quickly we could pay off the cards, which would eliminate those minimum payments and increase our monthly cash flow.  unbury.us was a very helpful tool for this.  I don't know if you have debt, though.  \n\nOnce the high interest debt was paid off, I hit a new problem, which was that I couldn't show him massive interest savings by sticking to a budget.  But I was able to incentivize savings.  So you might say something like, \"If we save $500 a month for 1 year, we'll have $6,000, and we can use $2,000 for a vacation (or something else that you both want) while the rest goes to retirement (or whatever other financial goal you have).\"  It's not ideal because obviously it'd be better to have that whole $6,000 for \"financially smart\" purposes, but it's better than $0.  \n\nWe each have separate checking accounts and we also have a shared account.

I discuss with him what I think we should do (for example, prioritizing the highest interest debt, or prioritizing retirement savings over low interest student loans), but I listen to him if he has any suggestions and we find a compromise.  \n\nThe other part to this is that you should definitely analyze your own spending.

Should be free shipping at that price. Split the servings between a morning and night shake (1 serving is massive). Add extras like whole milk, peanut butter, granola bars, Greek yogurt, then blend. You could easily make it a 1500cal drink per half serving. \n\nCheck out Aldi if you have one near you. I usually grab my protein staples there like eggs ($0.95/dz), milk,  greek yogurt, peanut butter,  and peanuts. I also recently started getting my chicken there  ($2.69-$2.99/LB). The prices there crush any of the grocery chains in my area. Learn to cook with chicken because it could get boring. \n\nHopefully you have a gym membership at around $10/month. The benefits of having access to a full service gym year round with hundreds of exercise options easily outweigh Bodyweight exercises and home gyms. Stick with compound workouts like squatz, deadlifts, and bench. If you need direction, check out \"starting strength\". \n\nThese are just a few tips of things that personally worked for me.

I've quit very high-paying jobs twice in the past, but I never had a good plan.  So I'm back in a job, but I have a plan now.\n\nI started an Amazon business.  I'm making ~1K a month off of my first product, and have about $20K more that I invested into 2 additional products that I think will be more successful, based off of all that I've learned from launching my first.\n\nNonetheless, in the meanwhile, I am working a 9 to 5, and I can't stand it.\n\nSo while my products are being manufactured, etc., I am looking for yet another avenue to make money.  \n\nMy strategy is to just build as many income streams as possible.  If I can get $50 a day from 3 products, that's $150 a day, or $4500 a month.  I'd like to supplement that with say, $1.5K of freelancing/part-time per month, and all of a sudden that's $70K/year salary.\n\nThat's my goal.  I will not rest until I get this goal.  Working a 9 to 5 is the most depressing, horrific, bullshit ever.\n\nWe are humans.  We are living, breathing, animals.  We were NOT put on this earth to sit in a fucking cube for 8 hours a day.\n\nAll I will say is this:\n\nIt's important to plan, but acting is more important.  I planned and planned and planned my Amazon business for a year before I dove in.  And I still made mistakes.  You will make mistakes in whatever endeavor you do.  It's better to learn from your own mistakes than from hypothetical scenarios, podcasts, and your imagination.\n\nThat is why now, I try to have a bias towards action.  I don't care what it is.

Also having savings goals has motivated me to curb my shopping habits. We are saving for a house downpayment so everytime I want to buy something stupid on Amazon I think to myself, but if I don't then we're so much closer to buying a house!!!\n\nIn addition, I'd recommend counseling as the money problems may be indicative of other problems, possibly chemical. For instance, impulse shopping could be a potential indicator of ADHD or a serotonin imbalance.

It's there if I need it though.\nAnyone looking to evaluate plans for themselves may want to determine their recent usage. Figure out what the average call minutes (inbound &amp; outbound), average text usage (inbound &amp; outbound), and average data usage is.

{"id":"d457drf","author":"Heasarc","body":"As it's an amazon affiliate site, the cost comes directly from the Amazon.com website. The prices may need to be updated as amazon changes them by small margins rather frequently. The only reason those particular ones are on the home page is because those are literally the only products I've added so far... it takes FOREVER to add a product (maybe 10 minutes including searching time). I'll likely be adding popular figures/anime as the featured items. \n\nI completely agree with you on the sizing, it should be indicated in the description of each product which I haven't gotten around to doing yet. Each figure might be completely different, but in general the more expensive figures are larger and higher quality (go figure). \n\nI think the main thing keeping me from continuing/putting a lot more effort into this site is knowing whether or not it's niche enough to get customers, considering the competitors are large anime merchandise retailers which sell way more different types of items than figures.

{"id":"d45dcsg","author":"ProgFrank","body":"I make 30k USD, living in Canada. And I find I get away with it really well. Here are some of my ticks and a few comments I have on other peoples suggestions.\n\n- Mentioned by many already, **cooking**. It is so important. Cook all your meals, prepare your lunches. Shop smart. Think of the little things as well, make your own coffee and bring it in a thermos. Save on all the little items like morning coffee, bagels and whatnot. Bring your own. Saving 2$ a day on a coffee really add's up. DO NOT NEGLECT THIS. \n\n- Something else that really helped me was finding a time consuming hobby. I would often just go out to the movies, or buy a 5$ game on Steam out of pure boredom, just trying to occupy my evening after work. Find something that can take up an unlimited amount of time, even if it costs you money. It can sound counter intuitive but it was a great help to me. I signed up for Jiu Jitsu, I can go as much as I wan't during the week, it keeps me active, I train at home in my spare time and stretch. Pick up a guitar, sign up for a martial art, the gym. Find a book club. Avoid from staying idle, spending a 100$ a month on something that will help you keep away from spending on unnecessary entertainment is great! \n\n- Go through all your bills and service providers contracts. When I did this I found tons of little add-ons and subscriptions for things I do not even use. My cell phone provider was charging me 4$ for a voice mail option I no longer needed since I changed phone, my bank had a monthly plan for transactions that was 8$ a month, I had an Amazon Prime subscription I no longer needed and many other things that I simply removed. It saved me an extra 20-25$ a month.\n\n- **DIY. DIY EVERYTHING.** Learn to fix and repair everything. And make it a point of honor to repair everything you can. Youtube is a vast and endless source of video tutorials on how to fix things. If something on your bike, phone or computer breaks fix it. If your sink is leaking, figure it out. I've become a semi-competent bicycle repairman just from Youtube.\n\n- Being frugal is a mentality and lifestyle. Question EVERYTHING you are going to buy. When you need to purchase an item, take the time to find out cheaper alternatives. Question all the extra costs for ''special features''. I often personally find myself looking at something stupid like a fancy back-lit keyboard, when I could just get the regular one and save 40$, and I don't really need the back-lit. It's easy to get carried away with something silly. \n\n- Another dumb point...drag your friends into this. My friends would often invite me out for a drink to a bar. I would go along and end up spending 30-40$ on a few beers over the evening (which is arguably pretty cheap as I'm not a big drinker). At a certain point I just kinda let them know that as much as I really want to hang out with them, I'm trying to save up some money. I would just invite them over to my place for beers in the backyard. After a while, my friends would somethings bring me into check, or sometimes just poke fun at me on those rare times where I really wanted.\n\n- My last point. No matter how much money you make on a paycheck. Take 10% off into a savings account. Make a habit of it. This should mean about 250$ per month. Try and pretend you make 30k per year. People live on a lot less. Put it in a savings account and pretend it doesn't exist. Just don't every touch it. EVER. Unless it's life and death.

{"id":"d45g8fs","author":"JoePride","body":"So you have a domain but no product and believe you can probably sell items printed (already at retail price) by somebody else's site, at a markup.\n\nA few ways this works:\n\n(a) Get the blank garments in bulk from some other country, possibly from the factory that makes them for somebody else's brand, and learn how to mass-print them yourself. (Look up \"screen printing\".) Then crate them over to an Amazon fulfillment center and use that as the back end of your storefront. Print up just enough every week or so to keep the Amazon inventory satisfactory. Get nerdy about your printing skills and slowly improve what you're able to do.\n\n(b) Go ahead and use one of the retail-price printing websites, shopping around a little until you find one where you can tolerate the quality. Look for local guys too on Yellow Pages; local dudes can be a good way to make your operation faster and less complex. Just mark it up even more! This only works if you've got a desirable brand, or great designs. Generally, you're going to get forced into the premium price category. Get trademarks and copyrights. Otherwise, people can just print your design at retail price themselves. So why do you exist?

I think it's risky to buy an IT service company based on sales numbers, because that assumes the clients will stay with you through the transition.  \n  \nThe more tangible value is in equipment (if it's current), vendor relationships (established history with distributors, manufacturers, etc can mean some deep discounts and perks), tools, and intellectual property (solid procedures for deployments, repairs, business processes, etc). A client list isn't worth anything without a guarantee.  \n  \nBefore starting my business, I was working with a break/fix shop that was doing things the hard way, sold \"managed services\" that did not fit the business model at all, and refused to listen when I laid out a better plan.

As far as I can tell all of the bike lights I would be competing against mount the light on the handlebar and the battery pack somewhere else on the bike. This made sense when batteries weighed several pounds but with modern lithium batteries there's no reason not to put the whole thing on the handlebar. There are plenty of $30 lights on Amazon that get the job done but they're about what you would expect for that price point. Brand name lights run $200 and up. I'd like to take the components from the $30 light, integrate the battery and the light into one package, make it charge via micro-USB and mount it to the center of the handlebar with metal quick-release brackets. Charging time via micro-USB will be 15 hours or so but that's not a problem if you plug in your light after your ride and don't use it again until the next ride. \n\nWhat resources do you suggest for proceeding with the design?

Also for more safer bet find some growth based mutual funds that are diversified.

(I lived about 20 minutes by highway from work so 90% of my driving was on the interstate). This data was confirmed by a fellow tech who also did his Nissan Altima at the same time. We both complained about it to each other and found it amusing that we had the same result. \n\nSome dealerships swear by a company/product called BG who makes [this](https://www.amazon.com/BG-44K-EPR-MOA/dp/B01CWNAADE/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465701663&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=BG) stuff. The ones we used at the dealership actually came with a can of [CF5](https://www.amazon.com/BG-CF5-Fuel-System-Treatment/dp/B005GDZPCY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465701695&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=BG+cf5) instead of 44k as the 44k is a stronger chemical for fuel cleaning and our BG rep said to use it for induction/fuel cleaning and the CF5 was for regular maintenance use but honestly both methods work. If you decide you want to use this stuff [this](https://www.amazon.com/Funnel-Fits-Bg44k-Quick-Clean/dp/B00KCX0NGQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465702372&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=BG+funnel) funnel is made to fit the cans and makes pouring the 44k into the gas tank way easier. Also that price for them as a set is what we charged at the dealer which after tax came out to roughly 42 bucks. Buying them on Amazon individually seems to cost way more for some reason. \n\nPoint of me telling you this is that what we did was use that red can (EPR) BEFORE we changed your oil and ran at idle for 10-15 minutes then drained the oil and replaced the filter. We added the Cf5 (or in the linked instance the 44k which actually works better) to the fuel system and when we refilled the oil in the engine we added the MOA(Blue can) to the engine oil accounting for the capacity difference in oil (it's 11 ounces of MOA which is roughly 0.3 quarts which really only matters for finicky shit like Fords 1.6 Ecoboost garbage). When done by us at the dealership and continued on a maintenance program BG actually warranties the engine against break down. They also have chemicals for all other liquids like brake fluid and trans and coolant and the like. My father used it in his F150 and his trans went out and they covered the replacement cost which was something like 2500 or so USD. Anywho long ass story short those chemicals I still use every oil change cycle in my own car and while I don't really notice and major performance difference I have noticed that that my engine runs very smooth and when I watch the data on my diagnostic tablet (Snap On Solus for those who are curious) everything is running damn near perfect still after 6 years and 80,000 miles and I still have factory everything inside the engine (including spark plugs!) except oil, coolant, and air filters and the like. You know shit you're supposed to change from time to time. \n\nBasically a lot of shit they offer I think is straight up bullshit (like getting coolant, brake fluid, and trans fluid swapped out way too often/too soon) but the BG oil change additive shit and the induction cleaning maybe every 30-40k or so depending on how you drive is something I do to my own car and if I do it to mine then I guess you can trust that I'm not selling you snake oil. Also fact check your dumbass service advisor. I had one who was notorious for selling power steering flushes on cars that don't fucking have hydraulic power steering! Dafuq yo? I've also had one that had this little old lady getting a fucking induction service with EVERY oil change. Worlds cleanest fuel induction system. We finally caught her because the lady came to another advisor and asked why we didn't recommend the \"flush thingy\".

{"id":"d460kpx","author":"AtomicManiac","body":"The first thing you need to decide on is your strategy. There's a few types:\n\n1) Long haul - You invest in a company like Amazon or Apple and hold it because you think their stock is only going to go up. \n\n2) Short term - You invest in a company with a hot new product, say Apple right before they announce the next iphone (probably in September) you ride the wave and then cash out when it starts to dip.\n\n3) Only in things you understand - Shaq invests only in things he understands. He turned down being one of the first investors in Starbucks because he thought \"Black people don't drink coffee\". Despite that he is a hugely successful investor with a number of restaurants and gyms to his name. \n\n4) Income investing - You invest based entirely on dividend payouts. The idea is to generate a stream of constant income from your investments. This is my strategy, it might not be the best, but I like getting those checks regularly. It helps keep me excited about investing because I'm getting money for doing basically nothing and that's very exciting to me.\n\n5) Day Trading - Don't do this. But basically day trading is buying shitloads of one stock on the back of some piece of information waiting for the stock to go up a few cents and cashing out. It really only works if you have a shitload of money to throw in, otherwise broker fees will eat you up. Also in the chance the stock dips a few cents instead of gains you're gonna eat a huge loss. \n\nOnce you decide that, picking the actual stocks becomes a lot easier because you know what variables to look at and can compare data sets.

{"id":"d461d88","author":"AronRo","body":"With a 1.5 gpm head, like the High Sierra showerhead that emiliomuzz mentioned here (which is highly rated on Amazon - people really like its spray, even though it uses 40% less water than a standard head), or any other top-tier, EPA WaterSense-certified 1.5 gpm shower head, you can typically save anywhere from $50-$150 a year over a standard 2.5 gpm head, depending on how much it costs locally for water (including wastewater treatment, elevation, etc. charges, if any) and energy (gas, electricity, etc. for heating the water). That's the very definition of frugality.\n\nTo put this in tangible terms, going from a standard showerhead that uses 2.5 gallons per minute to a high-efficiency low-flow showerhead that uses just 1.5 gallons per minute saves 1 gallon each minute while showering. If you have even one person using a shower, for 10 minutes a day (perhaps including the time waiting for the water to get hot), that's a savings of 10 gallons daily, or about 300 gallons a month. Since water weighs about 8.34 pounds per gallon, that's approximately 2,500 pounds of water per month saved - over a ton - each and every month. And that's just with one person, one shower per day.\n\nIn most places in the US, the resulting energy savings are substantial. That's because now you have over a ton of water - 300 gallons of water per month, per person - that your water heater no longer needs to heat up, from say, 55 degrees to 120 degrees. At least per my back-of-envelope calculations at https://gist.github.com/aronr/8190c532880064251e28, this represents a savings of about 1.6 thermal units (therms) of natural gas, or about 47 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity, each and every month.\n\nIf your water heater uses electricity, the current US average retail rate is around 12 cents per kWH, so that's a savings of $5.64 each month (over $67 annually) in electricity, for each and every person showering. Natural gas is dirt cheap as of this writing, at around $0.96 per therm, so if your water heater uses that, you'd save around $1.54 per month (over $18 annually), for each person showering. And that's just the energy savings - the water savings are a bonus.","name":"t1_d461d88","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-12 17:14:48","week":23}
