But now that I am churning, I see that Chase has alot of great cards. I don't want my amazon card to be the reason I can't get one more Chase card. Is it worth cancelling the card, or will it be unlikely that I will have 5 chase cards? I do plan on taking my time and planning out my churns carefully.\n\n","9":"[H] $50 Amazon [W] 85% Paypal","10":"So Tesla announced their stationary storage battery system today. [Here is the Press Kit](http:\/\/www.teslamotors.com\/presskit\/teslaenergy) and [here is the order page with details](http:\/\/www.teslamotors.com\/powerwall). Tesla has partnered with and\/or gotten endorsements from the following public companies: SolarCity ($SCTY), SolarEdge ($SEDG), Amazon ($AMZN), Target ($TGT), EnerNoc ($ENOC), and AES ($AES). How will these stocks react and how should they react?\n\nBy the way, the battery they announced is incredibly cheap: $3500 for 10 kWh, and $3000 for 7 kWh. This is a price of $350\/kWh and $429\/kWh respectively. This is incredibly cheap compared to Tesla's competitors. Aquion, for example, sells [this 2.4 kWh battery for $1,155 or $481\/kWh](http:\/\/www.altestore.com\/store\/Deep-Cycle-Batteries\/Batteries-Saltwater-Technology\/Aquion-Energy-S20P-Pre-wired-Battery-Stack-48V\/p11629\/?gclid=CjwKEAjw9uypBRD5pMDYtsKxvXcSJACcb9AY4u2A6eKp7PCGqEQGOOsWqXII6EAp_3JzAeejuQ3G2RoC_Gzw_wcB) and [this 28.4 kWh battery for $15,795 or $556\/kWh](https:\/\/www.altestore.com\/store\/Deep-Cycle-Batteries\/Batteries-Saltwater-Technology\/Aquion-Energy-M100-L082P-Pre-wired-Battery-Module-48V\/p11640\/_). This is really undercutting a lot of competitors, so it is disruptive to say the least.\n\nMoreover, a bunch of private companies also are involved, which shows that Tesla's product has intrigued many industries. The private companies include: TreeHouse, Green Mountain Power, Jackson Family Wines, Advanced Microgrid Solutions, OnCor, and Southern California Edison.","11":"I've had this social media business based around Texas pride (which is essentially like an oil well that never runs dry). Anyway, I have a social media brand called Texas Humor that has over 360k followers on Twitter, 92k on Instagram, and 53k on FB.\n\nWe started an e-commerce business around the account and when we launched couldn't find any fulfillment providers who were willing to take our business without any kind of sales data to back up how big of a client we would be. They all told us to come back in 6 months once we had some sales under our belt.\n\nWe ran it out of our home office, then garage, and now a 3,500 sq\/ft warehouse in south Austin. Along the way and through a trial by fire, we figured out a lot of efficiencies around doing fulfillment ourselves. Our store averages roughly 50-150 orders a day during the regular year and 500-1000 orders a day during the holiday season.\n\nWe now have a side business handling fulfillment for other small companies that were in the same position as us. We don't aim to be Amazon. Our goal is to help fill the needs of folks who are somewhere between \"Mom and Pop\" sized and big enough to need a major fulfillment provider.\n\nWe also handle customer service for our clients as well, so I've got some insight on that end as well.\n\ntl;dr We couldn't find a fulfillment provider for our fast growing business.

Internet marketers have reservations about revealing their sites, making it difficult to find actual examples. I will lift the veil a bit so you can take a peek at these sites, probably to the chagrin of the site owners. Here is some true transparency.\n\nTo be an Amazon Associate, you must place a disclaimer on your website stating that you are a part of their program. Many marketers put it in their *privacy policy* page. Amazon gives specific instructions on what to write, starting with \"*website name* is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program\". You can read the full guidelines [here](https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\/gp\/associates\/agreement\/).\n\nGo to Google and type in a search containing that exact string (within quotes) and then add whatever modifiers you want. For example, many Amazon affiliate sites like to use *&lt;product name&gt;-reviews.com* for their domain name. Here would be a good search:\n\n[\"reviews.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program\"](http:\/\/lmgtfy.com\/?q=%22reviews.com+is+a+participant+in+the+Amazon+Services+LLC+Associates+Program%22) or [\"reviews is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program\"](http:\/\/lmgtfy.com\/?q=%22reviews+is+a+participant+in+the+Amazon+Services+LLC+Associates+Program%22)\n\nIf you are looking for affiliate sites within certain niches, simply add a modifier outsider the quotes. For example, if the niche you are searching for is vacuum cleaners:\n\n[vacuum \"is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program\"](http:\/\/lmgtfy.com\/?q=vacuum+%22is+a+participant+in+the+Amazon+Services+LLC+Associates+Program%22)\n\nOnce you have found some sites, you will undoubtedly want to check to see how successful they are. The website http:\/\/www.worthofweb.com\/ will provide estimates for traffic and revenue. These estimates are usually pretty rough, so take them with a grain of salt.\n\nYou will notice that a lot of these sites look similar, are of poor quality, and are generally unsuccessful. They are good examples of what not to do.\n\n*If you don't want people to be able to search your affiliate site like this, move the disclaimer out of the 'privacy policy' and place it into a separate page called 'disclaimers'. Then add a noindex tag to the page. Do not noindex your privacy policy page, Google prefers to see this page indexed.*","43":"Looking to get some Amazon GCs or give me an offer in exchange for my steam games.

So far, most of my tasks (that I chose) have been surveys and transcribing text from pictures.  There've been a few audio transcriptions and short essays.  \n\nYou need to submit your SSN, be 18+ years of age, and reside in the US.\n\nStart now!  Only if you're interested.  It's a legitimate service owned by Amazon.  There's a restriction of not being able to cash out until 10 days after your first completed task, or HIT.  Do one now, if you get into it later you'll already have the delay-restriction out of the way.\n\nYou'll need to grind a bit to level up.  Many of the good HITs (tasks) require you to have a certain approval number.   That is, you need to do a lot of low-paying chump-tasks to be able to accecpt better offers.  Once you hit 50, 100, 500 and 1000 you'll be able to do better paying tasks.   I did a bunch of transcribing text from pictures.  This hurt me because 2 of them (30?)  were rejected.  This shot my approval raitng down to 92%.   Many of the good paying surveys require you to have a certain approval rating of 95%.   So, I've focused more on surveys and less on transcription.   Once I hit 100 or 500, I think I'll be able to do a wider variety of tasks without worrying of tanking my rating.\n\nI've done all of it on an Android tablet and phone (Nexus 7 &amp; 5).  There were only 2 (of 50) that I couldn't do (one was because Adobe flash was required).  \n\nAll in all, I'm happy.  I've given little effort, each task only takes a few minutes of my free time when I have it, and now I have a little more cash then I had before.

So along with a co-founder, I did just that. We wanted to launch something that had an incredible low barrier to entry. No coding necessary. So we came up with [LeanNews](http:\/\/leannews.io) - The daily email newsletter that summarizes trending topics in startups and tech. If you want to stay up to date on industry news and only have 5 minutes a day to do so, this is something you may like. Check it out.\n\nAnyways, having worked at it for about two months now, here are are 7 things I have learned as a 2nd time founder:\n\n**1)** My first startup took forever to go live, because at first I outsourced the dev work. Never expect anyone to do something for you when you start out. If you want to create greatness or value of any sort, build everything on your own\u2026 at least in the beginning. \n\n**2)** Be lean. Lean. Lean. Just test it. Don\u2019t spend too much time building anything. You should be able to launch (almost any) startup concept in less than a month. If you are taking longer, you are probably starting off wrong.\n\n**3)** You have to be ridiculously passionate about what you are doing. If instead of working you would rather go out and drink with friends, or sleep more than 8 hours (realistically more than 6 hours) you will probably give up eventually.\n\n**4)** Passion only takes you so far. Inexperience is the grim reaper leaking around the corner. Manage your expectations as there are things you won\u2019t know. Start small. My first startup that was supposed to rival the likes of Facebook and be bought out Amazon was way beyond overly ambitious. \n\n**5)** FIND HELP. Someone who compliments your skill set. Going it alone is another death sentence. It takes a rare breed of entrepreneur to be able to ride the roller coaster of emotions solo. At some point in my first venture I remember asking a wall what to do next\u2026 the wall did not respond. \n\n**6)** Have Family\/Friend Support. You will need it when your faith wanes. It will eventually. \n\n**7)** You have an awesome product? So what. We have over a 50% open rate... and that\u2019s ridiculously high. We smash all industry standards, but people dont just FLOCK to our newsletter. If you build it, they won\u2019t come. If you build it, people love it, and market the shit out of it\u2026 they might. \n\nThese are just a few things I wish I knew my first time outta the gate.

This allows me to have 5% back on restaurants 1\/4 the year and 5% back on gas 1\/2 the year. Is it worth it to turn one to Miles at all?\n\nFinally, any drawbacks to the Amazon card? I shop there probably 1x a month and have Prime. I get protein powder, electronics, etc from there so it's typically decent spending. \n\nLastly, how should I better utilize my cards?

Im making this video to hopefully save you from some of the pain and mistakes that I made on my journey. \nFlashback a two years ago when I got the idea to start a business. I did all the research and thought I was ready. I spent thousands of dollars on a flashy website that I didn\u2019t understand &amp; a bunch of information ebooks that were supposed to make me rich. Needless to say none of that stuff mattered when it came to making money.\nNobody was buying from me. I couldn\u2019t make a sale if my life depended on it. I used to get excited when more than 2 people would visit my site in a day. I was completely lost when it came to the process of generating income. I didn\u2019t know how to find the people who needed what I have to offer and organization skills were extremely poor. Anyway, right now I\u2019m making thousands of dollars every month, but enough about me, let\u2019s take a look at eCom Masters program.\nI had bought a bunch of similar programs but all of them were filled with fluffy information that is just useless. Ecom Masters program is something different.\nMy favorite part of the program is how it helps you identify your product and the best way to move forward with it. Tons of people get stuck when it comes to getting their product in people\u2019s hands. The program gives you current strategies that are easy to execute that help raise awareness around your product. It also helps you make sure you\u2019re not choosing a bad product or wasting your time on something that\u2019s not worth it. \nAfter the hours of videos, endless worksheets, checklists, software\u2019s &amp; tools you have no choice but to create a successful business. The program literally gives you everything you need; you just need to add the final ingredient which is hard work.\nEcom Masters Reviews | Does It Really Work?

Although it failed, it just fueled my entrepreneurial fire to launch another. So along with a co-founder, I did just that. We wanted to launch something that had an incredible low barrier to entry. No coding necessary. So we came up with [LeanNews](http:\/\/leannews.io) - The daily email newsletter that summarizes trending topics in startups and tech. Read Less Know More.\n\nHaving worked at it for about two months now, here are are 7 things I have learned as a 2nd time founder:\n\n**1)** My first startup took forever to go live, because at first I outsourced the dev work. Never expect anyone to do something for you when you start out. If you want to create greatness or value of any sort, build everything on your own\u2026 at least in the beginning. \n\n**2)** Be lean. Lean. Lean. Just test it. Don\u2019t spend too much time building anything. You should be able to launch (almost any) startup concept in less than a month. If you are taking longer, you are probably starting off wrong.\n\n**3)** You have to be ridiculously passionate about what you are doing. If instead of working you would rather go out and drink with friends, or sleep more than 8 hours (realistically more than 6 hours) you will probably give up eventually.\n\n**4)** Passion only takes you so far. Inexperience is the grim reaper leaking around the corner. Manage your expectations as there are things you won\u2019t know. Start small. My first startup that was supposed to rival the likes of Facebook and be bought out Amazon was way beyond overly ambitious. \n\n**5)** FIND HELP. Someone who compliments your skill set. Going it alone is another death sentence. It takes a rare breed of entrepreneur to be able to ride the roller coaster of emotions solo. At some point in my first venture I remember asking a wall what to do next\u2026 the wall did not respond. \n\n**6)** Have Family\/Friend Support. You will need it when your faith wanes. It will eventually. \n\n**7)** You have an awesome product? So what. We have over a 50% open rate... and that\u2019s ridiculously high. We smash all industry standards, but people dont just FLOCK to our newsletter. If you build it, they won\u2019t come. If you build it, people love it, and market the sh*t out of it\u2026 they might. \n\nThese are just a few things I wish I knew my first time outta the gate. I\u2019m sure I missed a ton of important tips that can help first timers increase their chances of success. Add them below! If you disagree with me well, then you are a commi.

But I think I need separate hosting.\n\n-**Ecwid**, I built a shop easily.  Prices seem on point.  Have an interview scheduled Monday.  Still think I need separate hosting.\n\n-**Stripe**, successes?  complaints...?  \n\n-**Selz**, looks new, although looks like it could work.\n\n-**Shopify**, only accepts credit card as payment from the merchant, so No.\n\n-**3dCart**, looks promising, do I still need separate hosting?\n\n-**BitPay**, definitely going to add this to the shopping cart I choose.\n\nI have hosting through Namecheap.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR**  There are too many payment processors for me to understand which one fits my business plan.  I need help.\n\n**UPDATE:**  For those interested, I have chosen to go with Stripe\/Ecwid as my payment processor\/shopping cart.  I have been in contact with a childhood friend who now works in the webdev industry and has helped build many major corporate websites for the outdoor gear industry, and he gave my rough draft site a run through and says everything is smooth, legit, and PCI compliant.  So, at least I got that going for me.  Once I launch the final copy, I will update again.\n\nOh, and, we're using Square for in-person transactions.

That amount also doesn't include any additional business expenses you may have. More likely, your expenses for 600 orders break down something like this:\n\n**Sourcing:** $1 per book = -$600  \n**Fees:** $810 + $900 = -$1710  \n**Shipping:** $1.81 (USPS bulk media mail 1lb, 5-digit) = -$1086  \n*This does not include cost of shipping materials (mailer, labels, tape, etc).*\n\nSubtotal: -$3396  \nGross: +$6000  \n**Approximate Net: $2604**\n\nThis new calculation brings us to an approximate net\/gross of 43.4%. \n\nMikegio1054, 36% is not all that bad, especially considering it's your first month on FBA.","138":"You can't sell beats on Amazon.

We transferred to a Discover It for 16 months 0% interest, and solely use that for balance paydown. During the month of January, wife and I earned over $350 in bonus points for just doing grocery shopping with it, rather than our CC. Budgeting the money in YNAB for spending that we were going to pay with our Debit card allowed us to get benefits for grocery shopping, as well as discounts at the gas stations, because we used the CC to buy Shell Gift cards, and got 4x fuel points for the gas card purchase, plus 6% CC rewards, and $0.10\/off at Shell station.

Do you know how easy it is to combine Avios if we don't get that pass, or would we need to book separately? \n\nMy other cards for us to go for are the 100k MR business card (hopefully my fiance and I can sell some of our books on Amazon; would that count?) and the EDP to get the grocery and gas bonus, which we are severely lacking on right now. 30 transactions would be easy to hit as well. The MR transfer 1:1 to both Avios and Skymiles, which would give us some leeway to find award flights. Plus, you can buy AirBnB gift cards with MR too. \n\nThere are definitely a few hotels in Ireland that we could transfer to rewards programs in the major cities like Dublin, but we would like to stay somewhere very nice for a few nights at least like Dromoland Castle, Adare Manor, or Ashford Castle. I don't think any of them are part of a chain. Adare Manor is available through the Chase portal though.

Think about Larry Page and Sergey Brin's patent on their \"PageRank\" Algorithm, an idea that took years of work in a Stanford Phd program, and without which their would be no Google.\n\nRemember, patents exist to encourage innovation.  Patent trolls and other frivolous patents actually do the opposite. \n\n\n\n\n","190":"The comic book industry is significantly different than other types of business, even regular book stores, because of the direct-market distribution model they employ.  They're not primarily book stores, they're periodical stores, and every week brings along with it a slew of new releases that owners have to figure out a number to order (with varying rates of discount and returnability)...   The upside is that Amazon isn't in the weekly comic book business, so brick and mortar stores can remain competitive... but the margins are still wickedly thin.  ","191":"For me it isn't that much work. I don't thrift or go to stores, I'm 95% online and I buy quantity.

As I said, the official\/legitimate stuff is mostly for promotion, not to provide an extensive music streaming service.\n\n&gt;They own the content and they do it for promotional purposes only so consumers will watch the video and decide to go and buy the music from iTunes or Amazon, etc.\n\nYes, I mentioned this in my comment.","193":"How many employees does a comic book store really maintain?\n\nWould paying them a few dollars more per hour *really* raise his overhead to be more than his profit? And why should we care?\n\nThis isn't about minimum wage, it's about brick-and-mortar stores of *all types* no longer being competitive with, for example, Amazon or other online retailers. Why pay for the store's rent when you could just have the comic book mailed to you?\n\nThis isn't about wages being too high, it's about one idiot not realizing that his business model is obsolete, and then him whining to keep his business solvent at the expense of the human beings who need to be able to *eat*.","194":"I think it's actually $750 monthly for Amazon (err, uhh, \"bookstores\"). Even better!","195":"Boxes can be found for free at home depot, Walmart, or other big box stores in the mornings. If you are really strapped, check dumpsters of hardware stores. You will find plenty of boxes. Pack it up with paper or bubblewrap, if needed. You will have to buy shipping tape. Go to an office supply store or Walmart, you will get the best price there. If you buy it at the post office, you will be overcharged.\n\nWhen someone orders from you, either eBay or amazon will email you. Print out the label on your home printer. If you don't have one, save the file to your phone or tablet. FedEx and staples both have mobile printers in their stores that will print out the label and packing slip. The post office is the cheapest for small packages. UPS and FedEx are more pricey. If you are selling thru FBA, you can ship thru UPS at a reduced Amazon rate. Good luck. It's easy once you get the hang of it.","196":"So...

A flight to Europe would've been more fun than whatever I bought at CVS. \n\n2) Signed up for the Amex Everyday no-AF card right away. Missed out on bigger bonus offers and\/or free Amazon Prime and the points sat in my account until the 40% BA transfer bonus anyway.\n\n3) Booked roundtrip international United airfare without fully grasping the rules.

I can label a 500 unit shipment in well under an hour, excluding poly bagging multipacks that need it.  I buy bulk like you.

For a while I switched my bed to the living room area because it was much quieter there as the windows didn't face the street. A basement would be really quiet too!\n\n--Blackout curtains: blocks light, sound, and heat.

My co-workers speak highly of the Bucky Blinks eye mask.\n\n--Cool air tower fan: it tends to be warmer during the day and that always made it harder for me to sleep and stay asleep. I sleep with the air blowing on me. It's cheaper than cranking up the AC and more direct since I point the fan at my bed. Mine also has a \"white noise\" setting but really it makes some pleasant white noise on any setting.\n\n--Melatonin: I use a combo type pill that has Valerian root, melatonin, and chamomile in it. This helps me stay asleep the whole day but I only take it as needed (usually once a week).\n\nEdited to add:\n\n--Set your phone on the \"do not disturb\" setting because your contacts don't know or understand that your days are for sleeping.

YMMV. \n\nhttp:\/\/fbaforward.com\/foreign-ein\/\n\nIt's very easy, and for me, took less than 10 minutes. No hold time. The relatively friendly rep said it's best to call in the evenings. They give you the EIN # on the phone.\n\nNote that this will obligate you to file US Taxes. You **can** do this business without an EIN because Amazon has you file form W8BEN--this is a form that says essentially \"I am not an American and I should not need to file US Taxes due to the tax treaties with another country\"\n\nHowever, if you register for an EIN you will partially void that form and need to file taxes. You should not OWE US Taxes, because of tax treaties between the US and Canada, but unlike Canada the US requires you to file a return even if there's no tax owing.\n\nThe trouble is if you do not have an EIN your dealings with US Customs become pretty legally gray. They require the receiver of the packages to have a Tax ID (your EIN), and Amazon will not let you use theirs. I've successfully imported without using my EIN, but I would not recommend doing that. If you plan to do this more than just a once off hobby, get registered.","246":"Tiger, again, thanks for the helpful comment! \n\nMy initial plan to sell this put was to profit the $0.8 premium and get out of the position when AMZN staying above my strike.

What I usually do is find a lot set online so I can pick through to add to my collection (1050 at last count). The doubles are put aside to either piece out or as a lot. Right now, this inventory owes me nothing. My usual resale methods have been facebook or Kijiji, but it seems hit n miss most of the time. Would I have a better chance of reselling them on-line?\n\nAny advice would be super appreciated. \n\n","291":"Amazon would be the best venue. But DVDs that list over $25 are now a gated category. I've heard it's very hard to get approved too. ","292":"A lot of the thrift shops are now selling the better items on Amazon \/ eBay. Also you will find many people with smartphones and barcode scanners snapping up the good stuff thee minute it hits the floor, also reselling it online.","293":"Having a credit card doesn't automatically mean spending beyond your means - you can use it to buy what you already buy (like groceries and shopping on Amazon) and then pay it off each month with the money you have. \n\nIt IS tempting, though. So no matter what people say, if you don't think you can handle knowing you have an 1800 dollar limit without going out and maxing it out, wait til you are mature enough to handle it. People told me to get a card around your age - so I got a couple. Next thing I knew I had maxed out several cards buying stupid shit, telling myself I was \"building credit\" because I just couldn't resist. There's nothing wrong with waiting - I think having no credit until you're able to use it responsibly is better than bad credit because you weren't ready. ","294":"I have many friends and business associates who do this kind of thing. Since the SEC cracked down on credit card auto-rebills about 5-6 years ago it has become hard to be profitable. This sort of thing is still paying me 7 years later so I would be a hypocrite to tell you to run screaming, but do as much research as you can. \n\nLately I have been passively collecting checks while letting borderline email spammers (they are double opt in can spam compliant yadda yadda) use my Amazon AWS account   ","295":"Would the end result for my clients being brought through to their page to purchase the product?\n\nInstead of being shipped to their product on amazon?\n\nOr would be it something entirely different.\n\nFor the last year I've been on an Amazon only mindset, knowing one day the inevitable would happen.

Affiliate marketers are not taking advantage of this behavioral marketing practice as much as they should. For this reason, I started searching to find a way on how I can retarget these people. I searched over the net and I found a solution that will help me to retarget affiliate offers. \n\n\n\n**What is Retargeting?**\n\n&gt; Retargeting is a cookie-based technology that uses simply a Javascript code to anonymously \u2018follow\u2019 your audience all over the Web. Here\u2019s how it works: you place a small, unobtrusive piece of code on your website (this code is sometimes referred to as a pixel).  The code, or pixel, is unnoticeable to your site visitors and won\u2019t affect your site\u2019s performance. Every time a new visitor comes to your site, the code drops an anonymous browser cookie.  Later, when your cookied visitors browse the Web, the cookie will let your retargeting provider know when to serve ads, ensuring that your ads are served only to people who have previously visited your site.  \n\nSo to find out how to retarget visitors from a page that I don\u2019t own, I decided to create a mini 10 pages kindle ebook that has to do with business. I called it: **\u201c12 Distinctive and Innovative Ways of Starting a Business\u201d** which took me 5 days to complete. The next step was to list it on my Amazon seller\u2019s account. \n\n[Check the screenshot](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Tyrot2x.png)\n\n\n\n**The Main Plan**\n\nIf I give away free copies of my Kindle ebook via Facebook ads, lovers of internet marketing niche will download my book but at the same time I will collect them using a retargeting pixel code so I can remarket a related Amazon ebook after but as an affiliate. Retargeting on Facebook can be an effective way to reach a targeted audience of users. Facebook retargeting works the same as a traditional retargeting \u2013 when a visitor comes to your site and leaves before converting, that same visitor can see your display ads on Facebook later \u2013 helping bring them back to your website or affiliate offer.\n\nRetargeting is so effective because it focuses your advertising spend on people who are already familiar with your brand and have recently demonstrated interest. We also all know that Facebook works best as a platform to gather people who might want what you are selling or offering, engage with them and get them into a sales funnel with a free giveaway. This is just a sport many savvy internet marketers and even firms are playing every single day. I have done a lot of giveaways in the past and every time did work great. \n\n\n\n**The Problem**\n\nRetargeting can be awesome BUT the problem most affiliates run into is that you cannot place a retargeting-code or pixel on a landing page that is not yours! Affiliate marketers are not taking advantage of this behavioral marketing practice as much as they should.\n\n\n\n**The Solution**\n\nSo before I started Facebook ads and advertising the ebook by giving it away to business people, I decided to create a tool that combines an affiliate link, retargeting pixel code and domain that I own. This way, I will be able to retarget people from a website that I don\u2019t own like Amazon. The tool is designed to easily retarget any promotion and all the traffic I want. It installs the retargeting pixel into a link which is the link that I used for Facebook ad campaign.\n\n\n\n**The Process (Retarget Link \u2013 Facebook Ads)**\n\n* [First I added my Amazon link into retargeting engine](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lnbZXIV.png)\n\n* [Then, I placed my Facebook retargeting pixel code](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Ea4hvUC.png)\n\n* [I chose the domain that I used for the facebook ads](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/r8q26MP.png)\n\n* [I grabbed the created link with the retargeting code and I started facebook ads](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EASh6aY.png)\n\n\n\n\n**The Results**\n\nThe first day of the free giveaway of the kindle book resulted in 35 downloads. The second day of the free giveaway of the kindle book resulted in a huge spike in ranking across all the major Kindle Store and the result was 127 downloads. The fifth day the result was 1,894 downloads. To get these results, I have managed to target a very passionate audience which helps you to find \u201chidden\u201d interests that many advertisers have never touched in the past.\n\nThe final result was 8,452 downloads in 10 days with ad spent 558$! The retargeting pixel showed 16,500 people.\n\n[Check the screenshot](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dG1M3P7.png)\n\nI managed to collect **16,500 custom audience** with a website that I don\u2019t own and after that I was finally ready to promote related niche Amazon book but this time as an affiliate.\n\n\n\n**The \u201cBIG\u201d Profit (Amazon Affiliate offer using FB ads)**\n\nThe next move was to create one Facebook ad campaign for a related Amazon affiliate offer I chose the ebook [\u201cLaunch: An Internet Millionaire\u2019s Secret Formula To Sell Almost Anything Online, Build A Business You Love, And Live The Life Of Your Dreams\u201d](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Launch-Internet-Millionaires-Anything-Business\/dp\/1630470171\/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) by targeting the custom audience that I collected during the giveaway. I know the Amazon affiliate commission isn\u2019t big but my target was to sell at least 1,000 ebooks with these audience.\n\nIn order to promote affiliate offers via Facebook fan page, you have to have really good engaging content in it and to have your native advertising work efficiently. I need to engage and pre-educate my market so the audience can trust me.  I always use native advert sponsored post \u2013 Great copy that is compelling and engaging. Sometimes I need to ask questions in the native advertising so you get people hooked and they stop and think .\n\nI also tell them that its an \u201carticle\u201d that they will read. If you target your audience properly and understand the psychology of your market then this audience is educated and always reading up on the latest marketing news. So from the native Facebook advert sponsored post they get driven to the blog so they get the first part of the information that they clicked on, and you further increase the engagement. \n\nI provided the content with a engaging banner ad that backs up what I said in my sponsored ad and carrying on the conversation on the blog and by giving them the steps on how to get the best business\/marketing tips in this e-book. I used a very effective strategy. I created a high quality blog post and my Amazon CPA offer is embedded in the post using this simple tactic:\n\nStep 1. do this, step 2. do this\u201d and makes it stand out for the call to action to happen .\n\nIn my landing page there is no pop ups, pop unders, exit pops and I always include TOS, earnings, privacy policy, phone number etc because I want Facebook to approve the page and let me run traffic to it.\n\n\n\n**The Stats**\n\nAd spent was **$155.67** for this campaign, it brought 3,656 sales from 16,548 people. The net profit of this campaign was 3,656 sales X $1,36 (hardcover, paperback, kindle edition, audiobook) for each ebook sale (8% affiliate commission) equals $4,972.16.\n\n[Check the screenshot](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7Abf3OJ.png)\n\nThis confirms the belief that people are on Facebook to buy and shop products, and affiliate marketers should come close from thinking about promote affiliate offers for example e-books. In this case, the best way to use Facebook Ads is not for direct selling but to get books in the hands of people who will love to read them without involving them to buy anything and then retarget them by selling them related e-books.\n\n\n\n**Action Steps**\n\n* Step 1: Identify an audience you want to penetrate, create a 10 pages e-book, list it on Amazon and then give it away using Facebook ads.\n\n* Step 2: Before create an ad, visit [Resocially](http:\/\/www.resocially.co\/early_bird) or [SocialSpyAgent](http:\/\/socialspyagent.com) and create your custom link with the retargeting pixel inside. Use that link on your Facebook ads. *These are the only softwares that i have found for this reason, to install the retargeting pixel in any website or offer I promote. There are exact the same but the first is much more cheaper.*\n\n* Step 3: Search for hidden interests on Facebook using TargetInterests (For those who are looking hidden facebook interests this tool has [free access](http:\/\/www.targetinterests.com\/special_trial)) and create your ads. Make sure that your ads are very targeted to your audience. Leave the ads to run for 10 days with daily ad spend $10-$50 depends on your budget. Let the retargeting pixel to collects all the traffic you send.\n\n* Step 4: Create your landing page by knowing better your audience interest so you can design the content to attract and engage.  Design compelling, engaging, and pre educating content and pay for your retargeting advertise. Three performance indicators that you want to be aware of Performance, engagement, awareness, results, monetize.\n\n* Step 5: Keep all ads and funnels congruent all the way through so it makes sense to the user and they get a good overall experience so you have a better or higher quality click that converts.\n\nI hope this case study to help you out. \n\nSee you all next time!\n\nThanks.","330":"[H] Amazon [W] Paypal","331":"2x$5 Amazon for $8.50 PP.\n\nRep: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/32mxa9\/urotanev_gcx_rep_profile\/","332":"[H]279$ Amazon [W]Paypal","333":"[H] $8 Paypal [W] $10 Amazon.com","334":"[H] $9 Paypal [W] $10 Amazon.com","335":"I got bad feedback on Amazon because my game \"didn't come with an online code.\" This game doesn't HAVE online.

With reports that the revenue and net income of Netflix, essential for a growth stock such as this particular, increased to substantial levels, many purchased shares in the company, thereby pushing \n\nLost in all of the mania that seems to befall institutional investors and their individual clients is that, while it is true that the company has grown in the past decade, the rapidity of the stock has grown at an even faster rate, propelling the stock to levels not seen since the days of AOL and Yahoo a generation prior.  If the price had grown at a modest pace, investing long-term into Netflix would have been a sound and rational move.  However, at the current price of $571.55, as of April 17, 2015, the value of Netflix is too high.  \n\nTo start, it is important to note that in the world of investing, nearly any stock is worth some sort of price.  The question most investors should ask in a two-part process is: what is the value of the company, and is the current price trading at a bargain of the value?  \n\nCurrently, as of April 18, 2015, the share price of Netflix was $571.55.  With an earnings of $4.32, the P\/E ratio of Netflix was 132.30, an astonishing number in a comparatively high, but modest (compared to 1999), market. With a book value per share of 30.75, the P\/B ratio of Netflix was 18.10.  From the get go, compared to the S&amp;P 500, which possesses a P\/E ratio of 20.34, and a P\/B ratio of 2.82, Netflix is an overvalued stock.  It is true that in the short-run, Netflix may seem like an undervalued stock due to the market\u2019s psychological need for purchasing shares of technology stocks during times of economic boom.  However, as a long-term stock, the purchasing price currently imposed to potential investors is one that is too high.  \n\nTo start with, rather than establishing a monopoly over other technologies, thereby increasing the worth of the brand, Netflix is becoming more-and-more dependent on other technologies and brands, thereby putting the blossoming companies life in the hands of other, more advantageous, ones.  \n\nGradually, as time went on, more-and-more emphasis was placed on streaming over DVD-by-mail membership services. In the 2014 10-K of Netflix, the company reported a decrease in American DVD revenues, stemming from a 16 percent decrease in DVD paid memberships.  Interestingly enough \u2013 one that should raise a red flag for investors \u2013 is that despite a clear decrease in the revenues of DVD membership, the company added $71.49 million in amortization of DVD content library, compared to $71.33 million in 2013. While it is sensible that amortization of streaming content library increased in 2014 compared to 2013, this was due to an increase in subscribers for the streaming section of Netflix. \n\nIronically, one of the boasting points behind Netflix and their rising stock, one involving additional cash, hurts the company due to the method to which they obtain said monetary funds. In the 2014 10-K, Netflix reported that they earned an additional $408.1 million compared to 2013 ($1.6085 billion in 2014 vs. $1.2004 billion in 2013).  At first, this sounds astonishing considering that Netflix in 2012 possessed $748.1 million in cash.  In other words, in a mere two full years of business, Netflix was able to double their cash holdings.  However, during these two years, Netflix issued heavy debt in the form of convertible bonds and high-yield fixed income notes.  By issuing 8.5 percent bonds, Netflix issued corporate bonds on par with amounts one can generally expect from casino companies.  While Netflix has additional cash, the same company also has additional debt, which must be paid off through either interest or conversion into common stock.  \n\nWith regards to short-term investments, Netflix is also hurting their long-term value of current assets. Netflix has $111.76 million in money-market funds and $3.6 million in CD\u2019s, ones that could potentially yield a lower rate than the U.S. interest rate.  In other words, once Netflix pulls out their money from a money market fund, they will find that said money is worth less than when they put their money in the fund.  Netflix has $295.50 million in corporate bonds, and $168.75 million in Government bonds.  Although these bring higher-yield than money market funds and CD\u2019s, many of the corporate bonds fail to have a steady risk-to-return ratio; and in the case of American Government bonds, while the risk is lower, so is the return.  \n\nIt is important for Netflix to use their short-term cash because in their 2014 10-K, Netflix announced that they had a negative cash flow of $126.70 million.  Compared to 2013, Netflix in 2014 lost $81.3 million in cash from operating activities due to attempting to purchasing content for their subscribers.  Further hampered by purchasing $69.72 million in property and equipment, Netflix in 2014 had a Non-GAAP FCF of -$126.70 million. In other words, Netflix has no spare money to pay off future debts from the bonds that the company has issued out in recent years.  This puts Netflix in a pickle. Since Netflix does not have any cash to expand, it must issue debt.   However, while in the short-term, Netflix has cash to expand internationally and domestically, it must pay off their debt with future cash flow.  This is problematic, since Netflix does not have any positive cash flow.  Thus, to survive, Netflix must incur further debt through bonds in order to expand and pay off past debt.  Netflix has plans to pay $9.8 billion in future streaming content through money that is non-existent.  \n\nThe situation involving negative cash flow brings up a delicate situation for Netflix.  The streaming-media giant is one that uses Amazon Web Services in order to receive essential services, such as data processing, storage capabilities, and cloud computing software and hardware.  In order for Netflix to switch over to their own home-grown service, the company would have to temporarily suspend operations since their entire operations involves computing systems.  This creates a snowball effect of losing customers, revenue, net income, share price, and market capitalization. Furthermore, by depending on a rival streaming service for the maintenance of their service, it would be equivalent to RCA (Radio) depending on Consolidated Edison (ED) towards the development of radio stations during the 1920\u2019s, or Yahoo depending on AOL during the 1990\u2019s.  Netflix attempts to quell the weariness of investors by assuring them that Amazon will not strike against the company, noting that, \u201cwhile the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.\u201d  However, Netflix cannot be fully sure of this, especially since Amazon\u2019s streaming service is supplemented by their Prime service.  If Amazon was to offer a subscription service that competed with Netflix, to further enhance their competitive nature, Amazon could remove Netflix\u2019s service, thereby ruining the media-streaming giant. \n\nCoincidentally, by gaining a dependence on Amazon in terms of software and hardware, Netflix is also dependent on Amazon in the investment market. If Amazon was to decrease tremendously in value, the stock\u2019s decline would influence Netflix to decline in value as well.  Likewise, by being dependent on Netflix as a source of revenue, the decline of Netflix would mean the decline of Amazon\u2019s market capitalization.   These proposition, mind the reader, are a long-term one and not a short-term one.  Despite the rapid short-term fluctuations of Amazon\u2019s stock, stemming from a loss in earnings, Netflix is steadily rising in price. \n\nHistorically, the connection between Netflix and Amazon is not new.  In the previous generation, when the dot-com bubble reached massive proportions, one would see a similar connection with AOL and other internet companies. During this time, AOL looked for additional streams of revenue in the form of advertising.  Meanwhile, burgeoning internet companies were looking for advertising that would increase their viewings, thereby increasing their share price in the form of irrational exuberance. By brokering a deal between Pets.com and AOL, for example, a dependence was set.  The survival of Pets.com depended on AOL using ad space for the pet-oriented company.  Meanwhile, AOL was dependent on the canine-friendly brand as a source of revenue, which at the time was the main factor in investment by speculators on the market.  If AOL decided to take away the ad space of Pets.com, for example, and replace the ad with an ad for Priceline.com, Pets.com would have lost an important stream of profit, thus killing the company.  Likewise, if AOL abandoned their arrangement with Pets.com, the founder of \u201cYou Got Mail\u201d would lose revenue, thereby losing a part of their bottom line. \n\nTL;DR:  The company is too bloated with debt and overvaluation that the company should not be bought.  Sell now and reap your rewards. \n\nCritics of the proposition argue that unlike Pets.com, Netflix is \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d  However, in the previous example, one must note that AOL, a much larger company during their heyday, collapsed under the circumstance of being too dependent on other companies as a source of success. AOL depended on smaller internet companies with their gullibility as a source of revenue.  When AOL lost these companies due to the early stages of the dot-com bubble bursting, AOL lost revenue, creating a snowball effect that eventually led to the demise of the company in its\u2019 original form. \n\nIn short, Netflix is a fundamentally unsound company.  Like many technological companies that have come before Netflix, the media streaming organization is stuck in a rut.  Speculators purchase the stock due to perceived unlimited upside potential in the future.  In the short-term, the company is valued higher than CBS because of the rapid growth in the company.  However, because Netflix is starting to lose money despite gaining money, Netflix as a large brand will eventually shrink in size, both in price and value, when the next correction occurs.  This is important, since the goal of our research team is to make sure that we do not purchase at an overvalued price. \n","375":"[H]$500-2500 Amazon GC(s) [W] 90-95% PayPal","376":"[H] 40\u20ac Amazon.De [W] 32\u20ac Paypal","377":"My GCX profile [Here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2jsadk\/udethzero_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n\nHave\n\n~~x1 $25 Amazon GC~~\n\n~~x1 $5 Amazon GC~~\n\n~~x1 $1 Amazon GC~~\n\nIf they are not crossed out they are still available","378":"[H] \u00a330 Amazon GC [W]PayPal","379":"[H] Amazon GC $25 [W] 85% Paypal!","380":"I recently quit my job and wanted to open something of my own with my dad who sadly has been unemployed for 3 years.\n\nOne of the things that could possible be in my budget is a little store in the biggest mall in my country.

Musicfromeverycountry.com\nI planned to make money through Amazon affiliate marketing but its been difficult with the model I'm using . In theory I've created content that is interesting and sharable and i figured people would be interested but its been difficult driving traffic. \n\nso I guess what I need help with is , would you suggest i try a new approach?  do drop shipping? Make an online affiliate like store? or what?  \n\nthanks in advance!","395":"[H] $20 Amazon [W] $18 BTC","396":"Hey guys, I would just like to introduce a new website which has great pay and has not been mentioned here.\n\n**How to make money?**\n\nAt YourVoice, you can make money by completing surveys. A point is worth 10 cents, and minimum redemption for PayPal is $20. Minimum redemption through Amazon is $5. Keep in mind that although they say they're going to pay you $6\/hr of survey completing, you can brush through $15 worth of surveys per hour. The time limit is very warped, so don't worry. Everyday, they will give you $10 worth of surveys to complete, and it takes only 40 minutes to complete. This is important for your daily routine! It is a part of mine.\n\n**How is this better than any other survey website?**\n\nFirst of all, PayPal payments are instant. That's right, instant. When you hit the payout, just type in how many points you want to redeem, and then sign in with your PayPal (look out for the green PayPal bar), and then payment is instantly made. Amazon payments are also instant. All payments are instant!\n\n**Where is it available to?**\n\nThis website is open to Australians only. It's great to have a website just for us Aussies!\n\n**Payment Proof:**\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/B1izTYH \n\n**Referral Link:**\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yourvoice.com.au\/general\/recruitment\/RAF?Referer=IQxv1D_81liNYH2f7yEVmhR7vsA14o5H\n\nThis referral link gives you a bonus 10 points ($1) upon completing your first survey.

So I thought I'd share my story.\n\nI'm not an \"expert\" affiliate marketer by ANY sense of the word. I just read a LOT of blogs, started experimenting building some of my own niche sites, focused on creating great content and gray-hat link building, and was always ready to change my approach with Google's latest update.\n\nOver the past year, I've done over $32,000 in Amazon affiliate income with simple niche websites:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nichesiteazon.com\/32k-12months\/\n\nI put a ton of work into that post, it's over 6,000 words long, so it's impossible to give the full story here, but here are some of the highlights:\n\n* Niche sites still work very well, and Amazon is the best affiliate partner you could ever ask for.\n\n* I started out as a complete novice. Reading blogs like Smart Passive Income and Niche Pursuits expedited my learning curve tremendously.\n\n* Niche selection: how I choose which product-categories to enter, and why more expensive items are a good choice to promote.\n\n* Keyword research &amp; competition: what I look for in a profitable keyword (search volume, buyer's keyword), and why I'm not terribly afraid of a little competition in the SERPs.\n\n* How I create and build-out my sites: nice-looking themes and quality written content (reviews) are the drivers.\n\n* Link-building: PBNs are still working extremely well. They're risky, as is all link-building, but they are definitely still working.\n\n* Dealing with the inevitable Google penalties. My most profitable site was hit with both Panda and Penguin back to back, and this month it's on track to clear ~$2,200 or so (and that's just one site).\n\nAnyway, that's generally what is covered. Again, I can't rehash the entire thing here, but I'm happy to answer any questions.\n\nI'm still earning well with Amazon. This month, I'm on pace to do just a tad over $3,000 with very little work involved.

I just wanted to share my experience in this as it will probably help some of those of you out there who are thinking about starting an affiliate site.

From my readings, it gets significantly easier after you get the ball rolling and that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for.

I am a recent convert to \/r\/personalfinance, and have been reading every post, as well as the \"before posting, please check out\" posts. I (think) that we are in reasonable shape, but could use any suggestions that could be made. There are a few key areas that I'd like some feedback on.\n\n1) Overall budgeting suggestions \/ distribution (below)\n\n\n2) Considering further education\n\nI work on a pay schedule, where I can tell (roughly, barring contract changes) what I'll be making year to year. Getting a master's degree pushes me over on the pay schedule, to a higher column, so the earlier, the better, as far as that goes. I've never taken out a student loan before (scholarships, and then worked my way through school for the rest), so I don't know how this works for graduate degrees. What I'm mainly looking for here is any suggestions for a way to look at my pay schedule, and then get a ballpark idea on how to calculate loans + interest vs payoff, to figure how long it'd be to break even. Excel setup? Something else?\n\n\n\nHere is my current situation:\n\nI'm 26 years old. Renting an apartment, married. Neither my wife or I have any outstanding debt (no student loans, no auto loans, no credit card debt). Own outright a 97 automobile, good condition. Current emergency fund at $8,000, building it up. I use Mint to track personal finances. My wife is currently looking for a job, and having some difficulty, as transportation is an issue. (She is required to take public transit, cannot drive, for medical reasons), so that limits where she can work a little.\n\n - Around ~$35,000 in Roth IRA\n\n - Monthly Income: $2,450 monthly, after taxes, + $400 - $600 Mechanical Turk (varies month to month)\n\n- Expenses: \n\n- Rent: $800, which is good for the area we're in. \n- Phone: $97, in the process switching to Straight Talk sim, so I can keep my current phone.\n- Gas: ~$150 a month, I carpool, and have a 35 min commute.\n- Food + personal hygiene: $400 for the two of us, includes 1 night out a week, and we cook the rest.\n- Savings: $400 monthly + anything left over each month, into our emergency fund.\n- Entertainment: Amazon Prime + Netflix + Internet: $70\n- Retirement: 10% of paycheck deducted into state managed retirement system (not planning on it being around by the time I retire, sadly). Putting as much \/ close to the max as I can into a Roth IRA. I got married last year, so we haven't started working on one for my wife, which I think should be a priority.\n\n- Any other expenses are taken care of from money from Mechanical Turk, with any surplus added to savings (Pet expenses, dates, hotel rooms for trips, etc)\n\n\nThank you very much!","476":"[H] 100$ Amazon GC [W] Up To 90% Paypal","477":"[H] Paypal (85%) [W]40$ Amazon GC","478":"Jet founder, Marc Lore, plans to take down Amazon with an online version of Costco","479":"If you shop on Amazon, here are 15 ways to save money.","480":"I'm the one who budgets for the household.

Give us your elevator pitch.**\n\n We\u2019re Sol and Pablo, founders of [Raizana Tea Co.](http:\/\/raizana.com) We\u2019re a family (wife+husband) company that hand-crafts tea and wellness blends. We love what we do: we believe in simplicity, integrity, and healthy living. Our Tagline is \"Sip To A New You\" we create non-traditional tea blends with a healthy purpose; be healthier while treating yourself to something you really enjoy.\n\n**2) What motivated you to start a business?** \n\nAfter we had our daughter Sol suffered from insomnia. She was too sensitive to prescription and OTC sleep-aids so her mom reminded her of some herbal remedies used in Mexico and suggested she take some valerian (Sol is from Villahermosa and Pablo is from Mexicali, Mexico btw). The problem is that valerian smells like old gym socks. So Sol used her culinary background to blend the valerian root with other herbs\/flavors to make it more palatable. \n\nHer night-owl friends (retirees and other apartment complex neighbors who also suffered from insomnia) noticed she hadn't been hanging out at night with them and asked where she had been. Sol told them about her tea and they also started trying it. Pretty soon she became the \"sleppy tea dealer\" and they encouraged her to make more of it. \n\n**3) How long have you been working on your startup?** \n\nWe set up the LLC in 2009, trying out recipes through customer feedback at farmers markets\/swapmeets\/anywhere we could get an audience. \n\nWe started selling through our website and  [Amazon.com and the FBA Amazon](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;me=ACJCJMAEYVG3P&amp;merchant=ACJCJMAEYVG3P&amp;redirect=true) around 2011, and this really increased the online sales traffic.  But we really started working on the wholesale side of things when we signed up as exhibitors at a regional (Central CA) Food Expo. This forced us to look at our products in terms of wider commercial appeal, calculate COGS, margins, wholesale pricing, etc.\n\nIn 2013, we decided to sign a lease for a manufacturing space (until then we subleased commercial kitchens to batch produce). We found an affordable inspection-ready food facility at a [historic theater in downtown Fresn](https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/0_KuR3CXkP\/)o . Our goal was just to sell online but soon after we [built a tea bar](https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/yu6qqjiXio\/) after people came by asking if they could buy a cup of brewed tea. \n\n**4) What is your 6-month plan? Your 1-year plan? Your 5-year plan?** \n\nOnline: We have plans to start listing our products on Amazon Japan, Europe, Canada and see how they do. We currently sell on Fancy.com, Amazon.com, and sold through redditgifts before they ended the program.\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar: The first tea bar was a bit of an afterthought. Last month our neighboring tenant moved out and we were offered the retail space. So we jumped on the opportunity and we're expanding and building a dedicated retail tea shop. We plan to open in June.\n\nWholesale: We shipped our first order to the local Whole Foods store, so we hope to cultivate that account and be able to expand regionally.\n\nExport: We currently private label one of our teas for a Japanese customer. We have been attending food trade shows and meeting with international buyers and we are currently researching how to export to Mexico City Superama and Canadian independent grocers. \n\n**5) What have been your most memorable positive and negative experiences.** \n\nPositive: We try to strike a work\/life balance. We've decided to do this while we enjoy it. Its A LOT of work, and some of the daily questions\/problems to resolve can be at times overwhelming. But we are also LEARNING SO MUCH. Way more than at undergraduate\/masters business school. We meet people that genuinely want to share their business tips and experience. And at the end of each week we feel that satisfying sense of accomplishment. We still love what we do and it's not that we're making huge money, but  We actually like interacting with our customers, and learning.\n\nNegative: The first IRS letter we got with a ~$2,000 fine for not filing our fisrt LLC returns on time. Our hearts just sank to our stomachs. That was SO MUCH MONEY. We tried to resolve it by writing a letter to IRS explaining  that we were new to the business and lost track of the filing requirements. It was a long shot but amazingly IT WORKED! They wrote back saying that the fees were waived and to keep track of filings in the future. We have kept track of filings since.\n\n\n**6) If you could travel back in time, what advice would you give yourself?**\n\nKeeping track of Product, People, Procedures are the most important factors. \n\nProduct: Know your numbers\/costs\/prices of products. Seek many suppliers, backup suppers. We focus on high-quality but want to be able to have a margin, or be able to quote \n\nPeople: Focus on having the right team, meeting the right people, finding the right customers.\n\nprocedures: have a system early on to keep track of tax filings, lots when manufacturing, receipts for accounting, emails for customer service follow-up ...\n\n\nThank you and apologies for the long read. Hope to have sparked some curiosity and motivation to embark on your own entrepreneurship goals. Feel free to ask on any topics and we'll try to elaborate.\n","493":"I have 2 x $25 Amazon Gift Cards that I'm trying to get rid of together.\n\nRep: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2yzw0t\/ueskodhi_gcx_rep_profile\/\n\nConfirmed traders will be preferred.

","497":"This is the first website\/entrepreneur related thing I've done (17y\/o) I discovered affiliate marketing\/adsense here and I wouldn't have learned all that I have or even initiated anything if it weren't for this subreddit so I figured I'd give some advice that I learned along the way and am very open to any suggestions you have. The website and facebook page:\nhttp:\/\/www.breadwinnerlife.com\/\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Breadwinner-Life\/1595714267342927?ref=aymt_homepage_panel\n\nI'm pretty proud about the facebook cover photo; it's a great concept and I found the picture on 123rf.com. I'd appreciate some ideas for the profile picture though which I bet you noticed isn't up to par. As for the website, I plan on placing ads in between posts, maybe 2 per 15 posts. This will make it seem like I have more content. The theme is great for ads, I'm expecting a high click-through rate.\nThe reason I'm doing a dinky affiliate marketing website is to raise capital for a larger start up (FBA and day trading). It's a great form of passive income and if it doesn't work out I can hold onto the website and sell it since it isn't a bad name at all, it'd be great for a wealth-building niche. What advise do I have\/what did I learn?\n\n* Any website name you're surprised isn't taken yet must be bought ASAP. Even if you don't monetize it, it will be indexed by google and broken in. Since it's a good name someone will send you an offer to buy it some day, so make sure you include contact info.\n\n* Forget affiliate marketing. If you have the funds capitalize on the new world of e-commerce. It's never been easier to be rich. Again if I had the funds I'd be selling you something on Amazon prime right now. The people who are making real bank right now are the ones that I'm listing on my website.\n\n* Don't read books if you're limited on time and don't enjoy doing it. The internet has everything you need to know about everything and is normally short and to the point like this post hopefully is. Time is money.\n\n* You don't need to know how to code. If you're using that as an excuse then you better get started.\n\nYou can shoot me some questions about anything and suggestions for the website.","498":"Find what their biggest specific attachment to cable is. Is there a show they watch? Do they like just \"having it on?\" Can you tempt them with promises, like, \"If we switched to Netflix we could afford to go watch a movie in theaters twice a month and still save money!\" Or, as others have mentioned, look at different content providers like Hulu+ and Amazon prime, maybe that would increase the offerings enough to be a replacement. \n\nGood luck!

If you buy a pot with a timer, you can set it the night before and forget about it. I think that's the best option for the student with little time.\n\nRegarding beans: beans are fresher when you grind them right before brewing. You can buy a little automatic grinder off of Amazon to do it, or you can just not care and either a) buy ground coffee or b) grind them at the grocery store\/coffee shop.\n\nAfter graduating and getting a job, I decided to start experimenting with different processes.

I was just curious. \n\nI do have one more quick question if you don't mind. When finding a product, you mention:\n\n&gt;Luckily, Amazon has a ranking system. Additionally, you may want to make Google Trends your best friend. To find products past the 100 BSR mark use this search string: [\"Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #200 in Kitchen &amp; Dining\" :Amazon.com] Use Google Replace the number you want Replace the category you want as well Sometimes the number you want won't come up, the results will jump around, this is because of Google's algorithms concerning traffic for the most part. Any product that is in the 1-1500 range is good.\n\nHow exactly are you going about this? Are you just inputing that string into google search?

I also signed up for an Amazon seller account when I was 16 or 17. All of this was 3 years ago, I just turned 18 around 4 months ago, so can use everything legally. \n\nWhat was I doing with the sites? Selling miscellanous stuff, and pokemon cards. I'd typically just take my friends collections, or buy a few online and sell the cards individually that had value. I would also sell random shit like old video games (gamecube, ps2 etc), books, and even candy works well. \n\nWould I recommend others do the same? I'm not sure I can. It's a risk, and it definitely paid off for me. \n\nNow, you said you need to submit information to create an Amazon seller account, but that's only kind of true. Once you sell over 50 things in a year, or over $2000 (I think that amount is correct), you must submit information (for tax purposes), and you cannot sell more until you submit this information. So it'll still work up to 50 items a year (I'm not sure if you'll be able to get FBA to work though, you have to self-ship, which is what I did).\n\nAs for Ebay, there is also a limit to the amount you can sell before you are required to submit information proving your identity. The amount is much greater than Amazon though. Something such as $3000 a year. I reached the limit the last 2 years, so was forced to stop selling after just a couple of months. \n\nWith Paypal, I actually made my account when I was 14 and have been earning money on it since without issue (Probably excess of $6000). The account did get locked because I received too much money last year and they required information be sent (however I was 17), so I just waited until around a week after I turned 18 and submitted the information, and it got unlocked without a problem.\n\nEverything I did was fairly illegal. My parents knew about it and knew that it was technically illegal, and were prepared to help me out if I ran into trouble. I did have trouble with one buyer on Ebay once where he somehow got my house number and called to complain and it shocked me (Ebay buyers can request your number from Ebay for any reason). Just so you know. Make sure you're careful if you do this.\n\nYou mention \"EU Law\", making me assume you live in Europe. Just for perspective, I'm from the US. I'm not sure how things are different. I'd take note of what Richard_Brother said though, I'm not sure how you found a chinese distribute to sell to you for much lower than retail. I did tons of research into the same thing a year or two ago but couldn't find any way to purchase product in a way I believed was safe and profitable. Please be careful. There's a lot of problems when purchasing in bulk from china that you may not know about (such as possible import taxes, etc)\n\nIf you have any others questions feel free to ask.

No commercials, choosing your programming is much better than the \"I've got 800 channels and they all suck,\" phenomenon, it saves hundreds every year.\n\nI cut the cord 2 years ago.

This is about half of what I spend on Netflix. I'm now spending $4\/month of TV instead of the $30 I spent with Verizon.\n\nSince discovering \/r\/frugal, I've found the value in quitting the mainstream consumer lifestyle.

It's time to get control of your money, not the other way around.\n\nIt's a hard thing to do to come to grips with what is causing you to have the money issues. First thing is to find out where your cash flow is. Obviously, you know it comes in, but where does it go? Go to www.youneedabudget.com, and install the software. It will help you get a picture of where your cash flow is.

First bill to cut for us was cable TV. An HD antenna picks up over 30 HD channels in the area. Sure, it's the networks, but they're all free, and mainly, I get my info on the 'net.

We got over $350 in UR with our Chase Freedom cards this way in 1 month.\n\n* How to get started, and regain control\n\n\nWhen we started YNAB, we had multiple payments for loans that were hard to keep up with. It made sense to consolidate them into one payment, so we took a portion of our tax refund, and went to the local credit union. We talked to the loan officer there, and explained our situation. We put some money into a 24 month CD, and took out a loan against it to pay off the 3 bills. 24 months later, we had gained a little bit of interest, and redeemed the CD. We actually did the same thing for another bill that had come up, and it was great to be able to pay off a shed that we needed for storage that we got on a lease-to-own. All the while knowing that if something were to happen to either of us, the shed was still paid for, and we wouldn't have to worry about defaulting on the loan.   \n\n* Reap benefits from consistent payments to one creditor  \n\nBy doing this, our credit went up over 200 points. We always paid in cash prior to doing this, therefore our credit was pretty much non-existent. It was over 20 years since I had a CC... when we finished up with the first loan, I applied with the CU, and got a 1K card off the bat, with no pull on the credit reports. The loan officer knew us by name, and we had no problem.\n\n* Develop a game plan   \n\nGo to www.vertex42.com, and get the debt reduction calendar spreadsheet. This is a neat way to help you amortize your debt snowball, and help you determine which debts you need to pay off first, and give you a game plan on how to attack your debts. I literally found out about this yesterday, and it's going to save my ass from having to pay some interest on promotional purchases that have 6 month 0% financing on projects and purchases that we made since December, and I had been haphazardly paying what I thought was enough to about 8 different merchants, trying to make sure I met the 6 month payment deadline, and not be whacked by missing the payoff deadline.\n\n  \nAs a bonus, my wife's student loans were put on the vertex42 spreadsheet, and what Navient said would have a final payoff around 2024 will now be paid off by Jan 2017. Hell yeah!\n\nI hope this helps you out.

And there is plenty of room for more trading platforms aimed at small businesses.  Yes, small companies can build their own websites within minutes to sell their wares. Yet the success of an online marketplace stems from the fact that it is a venue people flock to if they have a general idea of what they want, but no idea where to buy it from. That mentality will be around for decades to come. The only threat I see to this thinking is a better search engine. But, I think brand recognition (I want to buy some glasses for my dinner collection: think Etsy, Amazon, EBay) will hold out for a better part of this first half century. \n\nAmazon and EBay were founded at about the same time and developed into huge behemoths that are unyielding on seller characteristics. You'd think that after EBay and Amazon, a newer e-commerce platform will have a much harder time muscling into the space. But we saw Alibaba do really well--mainly because of oversees popularity. I believe Etsy can do the same--with a more versatile website that focusses on its sellers instead of shareholders, at least in the next few years. Etsy does and has been doing better on this for the last 10 years (commission, visibility, building a strong community of loyal followers in handicrafts, etc.). Yes, they have been losing money, but so did EBay and Amazon post-IPO. \n\nHere is more interesting analysis: http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/3055176-ipo-analysis-etsy-is-not-the-next-ebay \n\nEtsy will be able to upstage Amazon and Ebay by learning from their past mistakes. For example, they will be able to hire away key executives that know how this industry works, and build a better community focused website.

They are looking to cater to the group of sellers who want to sell handicrafts and smaller home made articles (e.g., self-published childrens'  books). I dont think Amazon or Ebay do as good a job of giving visibility to such sellers. Of course, overnight Amazon could overhaul its small business site to directly provide services in this area.

That was also one of my worries; I didn't want my parents' to start having to pay tax if I ever did make substantial profit. Obviously I could pay them those taxes but it could essentially mess up their work. One of them is self employed and the other is a freelancer. So I think it could just get awkward if I used eBay or Amazon. But, everything is online these days: I doubt I'm going to be able to walk around in the streets and sell my items. Thanks, though!","588":"Please use the newbie thread for these types of questions. Also, the wiki and the Noob guide are valuable resources that will address this questions and more.\n\n(If you're serious about selling them, I would recommend searching for each individual one on eBay, looking at the completed listings, and seeing about how much they go for. Alternatively, Amazon may be a good resource for these.)","589":"I have been cable free for about 5 years. I recently had it for about 6 months mainly so I could play with the Xbox One and its tv control features which were pretty cool.\n\nI got rid of it though because really, between Netflix and Hulu Plus we can see all we want. This can be an issue when things like Superbowl comes around, but the NFL seems to have made streaming it a must do.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that some channel based apps, like ESPN etc will require an active cable account with the channel on the subscription. So you cannot rely on those you need to check the ones you are interested in.\n\nNow as for the boxes, I have tried most of the major ones.\n\nXbox One\/PS4 - If you are a gamer then this is a no brainer. They have the Netflix and Hulu apps as well as many others. For second, third or kids room TV's then the boxes below are cheaper alternatives.\n\nAppleTV - If you are an Apple household then continue the tradition. The integration with your devices is nice. You can easily beam video from your iPhone or iPad to your AppleTV. While there are solutions to do this to other brands it can be a pain to get to work at times. I have i devices, but I don't need that feature so it did not matter to me. the biggest draw-back for me on this device was it was too slow. I have Apple tablets and phones, but the performance was too poor for it to matter to me. I am impatient and so are my kids. :)\n\nAmazon FireTV - If your an Android house already, then this being Android based may fit in better. Especially if you have other Amazon tablet's and phones. This is what I ultimately ended up sticking with but not for that reason. There were two main reasons for me:\n  - Quad-core processor makes it really fast. There is hardly any waiting for things to open. Netflix opens faster than on any other device or smart tv I have tested. This means less waiting which is nice.\n  - It can play games, a lot of them are available and most android games will work on it. While I do not play them, my kids love it. You can get a controller for it that is a lot like an Xbox controller so the kids enjoy it. With so many free games this was a big plus for me. That fast processor comes in handy here.\n\nRoku - I like the Roku as it is simple and has more apps than most as it has been on the market for a long time. I found it faster than the Apple TV (I had the Roku 3) but not nearly as fast as the FireTV. It was reliable and the performance was acceptable. They do have an app you can install on your phone that makes working with it better. Thought it could use some improvements.\n\nTL;DR: I prefer FireTV because of performance and gaming\n\nAppleTV was the slowest to me and most limited in functionality.\n\nRoku: Nice if you don't care about performance or the gaming aspects of the FireTV. The app makes it a very strong contender. Lots of information online about them.\n\nGaming Console: If you game and only have one tv.","590":"Sallie Mae Barclaycard gives you 5% back on up to $250 of gas station purchases, $250 of grocery purchases (walmart and target sometimes count, but usually not) and $750 of bookstore purchases each month (which includes things sold by Amazon, but not things sold on Amazon by third parties, but you can buy an Amazon gift code for 5% off and use it for the third party stuff).

It generated $1.57 billion during the first quarter, which is inline with most analysts' projections, and it's pulling in about $6 billion per year. \n\n&gt;AWS is also profitable. It kept $265 million this quarter and it's on track to hit $1 billion in annual profits.\n","642":"There are three main methods of avoiding the monthly service fee for Serve. First, you could have any kind of direct deposit service to Serve each month. This could be a paycheck or, as you do point out, PayPal is recognized as direct deposit by Serve (Amazon Payments is also counted). Just because of the logistics, I'd say it's easier to go with the other two.\n\nYou can add at least $500 to your account each month. Given that you'll be paying monthly bills, I would assume that this would be feasible for you.\n\nThird, an option that's not advertised, but if you just keep a balance of $0 in your account, Serve won't charge the fee. I don't know when they poll your account for the $0 balance to assess whether or not to charge you a fee, but I would guess it's at the beginning of the month. Thus, if you load less than $500 each month and don't have a direct deposit, just make sure to drain your Serve account each month before the start of the next.\n\nAnd despite what NoonRadar said, I still think that Serve is very useful. If you have a third party American Express card, you'll still be able to earn points. I mean, the prepaid REDcard would allow you to earn points on a credit card faster, but Serve can definitely still be useful. Also, there is a little bit of a conflict of interest considering that he's advertising for himself. I'm not saying that anything he said is wrong, but still, you know.

If you can't create it yourself, dont hire it out. Learn it! Only delegate it once you understand it and can do it yourself. Make sure the content is focused on the user and helps them. If an image or graphic helps your reader understand, add the image. Dont be lazy. Make it high quality and you will be rewarded.\n\nDont worry about SEO. Create good content and Google will find you.

OCF is low, but that's calculated after paying creditors. It absolutely has money to pay off creditors. Equity holders are another story.\n\n&gt; Since Netflix does not have any cash to expand, it must issue debt. However, while in the short-term, Netflix has cash to expand internationally and domestically, it must pay off their debt with future cash flow. This is problematic, since Netflix does not have any positive cash flow. Thus, to survive, Netflix must incur further debt through bonds in order to expand and pay off past debt.\n\nYou're calculating cash flow to equity holders, not to creditors. Also, they have $1.5B in cash and marketable securities against long term debt of $900M and interest expense of $50M.

I got a proper server for WordPress and made sure my page load times are under a second, keep a decent blog with no copy\/paste content, and it gets the best results for me.\n\nCL, not going to happen. Even if a piece of software took your listings and put them on CL your listings would get ghosted as you're most likely posting more than once per account every 48 hours or so. CL you're best using automated posting software and getting\/making a whole ton of verified CL accounts, then post a generic ad for your company rather than trying to multichannel list items to them. Doing CL ads well is an entirely different ball game.","695":"better yet walk in with a madeup business card and website and tell them youre collecting unused\/unwanted books to recycle.

This seems like an over reaction and Twitter is not going anywhere anytime soon. ","698":"I use both of my accounts for Amazon gift cards, just because I order pretty frequently. I use one account only on my personal computer, and the other account only on my work computer. With multiple accounts, you have to be careful with IP addresses. I also have them both using the same mailing address (since you can have multiple per household), but different names, birth dates, email addresses, etc. Many people have five accounts, but I'm sticking with two for now!

It's great as now when I do my weekly shopping I can shop almost exclusively at the grocery store as I need so few household items that its not worth going to Target or other places that'd sell them cheaper.","702":"you can absolutely FBA fakes. and just because they are from Amazon warehouse doesn't mean that aren't fake. \n\nBasically, Amazon Warehouse is selling all the damaged box items. So seller A sends in fake Beats, 10 of them are damaged in the warehouse. So Amazon reimburses Seller A and then sells the fake Beats on Amazon Warehouse.\n\nNot saying this is what happened, but COULD happen. So if you got in on this deal, just double check before passing them off as real.\n","703":"I got the Amazon visa card. I rack up points super easily. It's probably the best one I've found. ","704":"To an extent, but not really. For example AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, FB all have singular primary products, but they're far more difficult to replace for various technical reasons. NFLX is especially difficult to replace, despite the lack of alternate in house products, this is mostly because no studios would allow another NFLX to rise without being heavily invested in them and we all know how that worked out for them. \n\nMore importantly though, all of these companies, excluding NFLX, have massive enterprise arms that are a completely separate class of product. Primarily cloud services with massive clients or at least significant client volume. How much total % of revenue these arms make compared to their primary products, I do not know, but likely significantly less. It doesn't really matter though, because Apple has significant backend infrastructure, but leverages it primarily to run its own services. It doesn't offer tools for serious cloud based computing or similar services. They have their ecosystem and the health of that ecosystem is, for the most part, entirely dependent on the iPhone being used at a massive scale. Take the iPhone away and you're left with what, macbooks\/desktops, iWatch, iPad, etc. No one really wants just one of these things, because they all were together to create a coherent system. Remove the primary mobile aspect of that system and the value of the overall system is significantly diminished. Not to mention the app store as an ecosystem starts to encounter serious issues at that point in attracting new devs etc.\n\nI guess you could consider the education arm of the iPads similar to these other enterprise products, though it really isn't comparable because education generally gets a discount and GOOG has chromebooks that have been rapidly taking market share that a couple years ago the iPad would have locked down. ","705":"You are correct that the cost of production will fall as more and more people create legal grow operations however the thing about it is there is a massive amount of capital spent in the black market on marijuana and the \"legal\" market does not yet have the mechanisms or the infastructure in place to service that market in a consumer friendly way.  Most people do not want to sink $300-$500 into a home grow operation they would rather spend $20 and get some pot for the weekend.  Just like most people are not going to brew their own beer.\n\nThere are also home delivery services, mobile pot menu apps, and pot-infused food and beverage products that have not been tapped because when it was illegal there was no market for such things. \n\nThe fact is if people are going to spend a healthy amount of cash sustaining their habit, then newly legalized markets are as emerging as they ever will be.  People will get rich off of weed, but you are correct to say that this start-up project is overestimating the overall volume of the web market for marijuana.  Marijuana SEO, apps, and automation of grow operations will be a thing tho.  Who knows, maybe there will even be a weed-based version of Amazon for online orders one day.","706":"Not investing in a scanning app is like saying \"I have feet, why would I ever need shoes?\"\n\nIt's an absolute joke.\n\nIf you want to make serious money at flipping you need a reliable application. The Amazon Seller App is useless for serious flippers beyond checking restrictions.\n\nI use Inventory Lab for accounting, which comes with their Scoutify app. I've used about every Amazon-centric app out there and this is a winner.\n\nAll the third party apps use the exact same data. It boils down to cost and who you want your money to go to. I dislike Profit Bandit personally - and Scoutify is free with an IL subscription. Regardless of the two, pick one up when you decide to make real cash.","707":"It was done over Amazon Mechanical Turk, and filtered out people who didn't read the instructions clearly or were insane (e.g., offering to pay $100 and expecting to only have to pay $80 afterwards). \"The participant was asked to imagine that they were organizing an elegant fundraising dinner for a nonprofit organization and were negotiating with a caterer over the per-person price for the event.\"\n\n&gt; After reading this scenario, participants indicated their assumption of their counterpart\u2019s reservation price (\u201cWhat is the least amount [in dollars per person] that you think the caterer would agree to?\u201d), their counteroffer (\u201cIf you were in this situation and had to respond with an offer of a single price, what offer would you give to the caterer?\u201d), and the predicted settlement (\u201cWhat final price do you think you and the caterer would most likely agree on if you were to reach an agreement?\u201d).\n\n\n | $100 | $100-$120 | $90-$110 | $80-100\n---|---|----|----|----\nReservation price | $77 | $83 | $79 | $68\nCounteroffer | $73 | $77 | $74 | $65\nAnticipated settlement | $84 | $89 | $81 | $73\n\nThere were additional surveys, such as a salary negotiation one from either the hiring manager's side or the applicant's side, which was much more complicated and included the relationship component. (Participants rated their counterpart on a scale for each of: stubborn, assertive, reasonable, obnoxious, flexible, confident, aggressive, weak, and game-playing.)\n\nAnother examined range width, and found that offering \"$80-$120\" and \"$80-$100\" both made the listener think that $68 was the actual minimum number and $65 was an appropriate counteroffer. They did think that the wider range would result in a slightly higher final settlement ($79 vs. $74). On the other hand, a wide range meant that people felt it would be less impolite to undercut it (equivalent to undercutting a point offer). \"There is likely limited gain in making them wider than a normative range (perhaps 5% to 25%)\u2014and they bring no benefits when the number beyond which they bolster is already an extreme offer.\"\n\nThey concluded by confirming the research via another Amazon Mechanical Turk survey involving a live chat between role playing participants, including a prize drawing for those who got particularly favorable deals. That produced similar results.","708":"Ah man, that first link doesnt work. Ill look into it though. Sounds cool! Buying less from Amazon first is a good idea. Ill give it a shot!

It's a straight cash back credit card, and you can have the rewards be directly applied to your Sallie mae loan to pay it off. If you don't have a Sallie mae loan, you can still get the card and just get regular cash back rewards.\n\nGood call about not accruing interest, btw!

Google and Facebook make their money off of advertising, like almost all of it.  Netflix relies on subscriptions but is increasingly seeing value created through original content and the studio side of it's business.  MSFT and AMZN do actually have somewhat diversified revenue businesses but cloud services are still a rather small fraction of that, even for Amazon which is the largest cloud services provider out there.\n\nTake away advertising and Google and Facebook make no real money.  You mentioned chromebooks.  Google has horrible margins on Chromebooks and they're the exact kind of easily commoditized product fodder that another competitor can easily displace.  It's the same for Android, it's a free product that's only value to Google is to give them the same kind of platform and App store control that Apple enjoys.  Google has it's finger in a lot of pies but makes next to no money off of most of them.  They operate solely in an ancillary capacity to funnel advertising to consumer and analytics data back to the Google in order to improve the effectiveness of their advertising products.\n\nEven Netflix which has a pretty good position has Amazon nipping at it's heels with their prime video service, which has the advantage of being integrated into Amazon's own Fire ecosystem.\n\nApple does have a highly centralized revenue stream, but so do a ton of other companies, especially in the tech space.  These risks are very real for Apple but they're also very real for companies like Netflix and Google.  For some reason though Apple seems to be the only company that gets scrutinized so heavily for it.","718":"This. I ordered a like new TV from Amazon Warehouse as the seller.

Especially if it's something cheap, like a book.  Just make sure the conditions match.  \n  \nAlternatively, you can just cancel the order with some bullshit that it was an error in inventory or something.  Most people don't bother leaving feedback on Amazon, but if you do go this route you are risking getting bad feedback.

Even staid old Microsoft trades at 20.\n\nSo I'd say if you're buying or selling at today's prices, you're not fooling\u2014or being fooled by\u2014the market with hidden knowledge.

But one universal thing seems to be, \n\n&gt; if the HR people are toxic, the whole damned place is rotten. And a rotten \n\n&gt; employer doesn't do a damned thing to build your resume. Sometimes their\n\n&gt; reputation is so bad that other places won't want to touch you.\n&gt;   \n&gt; I remember one place I heard of called Intermec, on paper, a good employer, \n\n&gt; but every person who worked there in the past was spooked, like they'd just\n\n&gt; snuck out of Gitmo. In some ways they were MORE unemployable than someone\n\n&gt; who just got out of prison, because nobody wanted to work around someone\n\n&gt; that was messed up and traumatized.\n&gt;   \n&gt; People tell me Caterpillar is that way now, Amazon, Bank of America, and various\n\n&gt; other ones. Glassdoor, many times they snip out bad reviews if a place has 90%\n\n&gt; rotten reviews, and 10% marginal. So that's not really reliable either.\n&gt;   \n&gt; Toxic HR, and people in the lunchroom who look like they're about to punch   \n&gt; each other, that's a good sign you don't wanna work there. :D   \n&gt;\n\n----\n\n^(I am a bot.

The prevailing sentiment is that we can just plug all these terms into equations and models, and do the math to sort everything out. If we analyze each term independently, then we discover that is not the case.\n\nSo, what is an interest rate really? Interest rates denote the scarcity of a given resource. There is only ever one thing with many possible buyers. If there are two possible buyers, then the thing is sold to whichever buyer is willing to pay more for the thing, that is the buyer that is more *interested* in buying the thing. The more possible buyers there are, the higher the interest rate is, the more the thing will ultimately sell for to the most interested bidder.\n\nWith this understanding of interest rates, it is revealed that artificially lowering interest rates has the effect of increasing the relative value realized by past winners and decreasing the relative value of future winners, all to keep treading water in the present. This is why we see dramatic asset inflation and no real planning for the future (yet).\n\nThe joke is that if rates stay negative long enough, then it becomes profitable to level the rocky mountains for the marginal fuel savings. On the counterparty side, it starts to make sense to build new rocky mountains to increase profits from your car repair and maintenance service. If rates stay negative for too long, you will see crazy destructive projects emerge. Much more silly things like those Amazon Dash buttons.\n\nWhen a consumer goes shopping, the consumer is searching for surplus value. If there is no surplus value to be found at the market, then the consumer isn't really 'shopping' in a technical sense, we'd have to call it something else. The same applies when capital goes shopping. If interest rates don't reflect a proper index of the value created and exchanged during a trade, then they aren't interest rates proper according to the meaning we understand. That is, we can't change the premises of our theory but continue to use the terms the same way in our equations.","762":"I don't think Amazon Warehouse can sell fakes though.

I no longer have to buy starter packets.   \n\nSeriously, if you think about it, preppers and the ladies of the Mormon church have got it right.  Be prepared for three years worth of food in your pantry all the time in case of disaster or loss of job or income.

Your county agriculture extension office may also have instructions on food safety with canning and what to look for if suspect of food spoilage. Also can teach you how to date and rotate your stock.    \n\nMy pantry:\n     Spring water filtered and distilled at home, stored in clean plastic one gallon containers.    \n     White vinegar in jars.  Those jars can be reused in a pinch for other things like cleaning materials. \n     Dried ingredients are kept in 5 gallon cleaned buckets with plastic bag  lining and a moisture packet and vacuum sealed.  you can purchase a mason jar and lid vacuum sealer on Amazon.   it's a pump with a plastic tube leading to the insert that goes on the lid and removes the air after you seal the bucket.  \n   \nI also purchased a mill grinder to grind grains to make flour.   You can't toss the flour back into the bucket because once you grind the flour, any moisture in the seed will contaminate the whole container of  flour and encourage spoilage.  yOu have to use what you make fairly quickly and store any excess in cool, dry area of the pantry.    \n    I never buy premade combination products at the market unless it is sealed in plastic from the manufacturer and has a shelf life over one year like peanut butter and most jellies. Macaroni and cheese is an exception as we go thru that regularly.\n     \n     My pantry:    grains, seeds, barley,oats, rice, corn, beans, dehydrated milk and eggs, coffee ground in #10 cans which I reprocess at home a second time and add carob and cinnamon to the grounds along with ground barley to extend the coffee.  Dried pastas with no specialty additions like sun dried tomatoes or spices, just plain pasta, crushed tomato in a can, baking soda, baking powder, meat in cans, dehydrated potatoes.  \n     We home dehydrate and can garden vegetables and my sons collect wild growing berries for us when they go hunting or fishing.

It will require a lot of very authoritative backlinks to outrank them. It's not impossible, but it's resource-intensive.\n\nThe secret is to find a nice balance. I like to promote products and target the \"best [product-category\" and \"[product-category] reviews\" keywords. For example, \"best microwave\" (note: this is just an example of a keyword, not one I would actually target; it's much too difficult). \n\nThen, run your keywords into the Google Keyword Planner tool. I like to see local monthly searches of at least 1,500 for a keyword like that, but usually 3,000 or more.\n\nPrice of product also comes into play. If you're trying to build a site around a $10 product, don't bother -- the commissions will be so small there's no way you can make it up in volume. So I like to look for items that are at least $40 or more, preferably $100 or more. My most successful site, the products range form $50-$300+. \n\nOf course, you need to analyze your competition. There are paid products that do this very well (Long Tail Pro), but you can simply google your phrase and take a look at what's on page 1 of the search results. Is it all authoritative sites like Good House Keeping, Consumer Reports, and The Wirecutter? Then it will be very difficult to outrank them (though possible).\n\nIf, however, Page 1 includes 5 other affiliate sites, well, then you are on to something.\n\nI just published a huge blog post about this very topic and how I was able to earn $32k in 12 months with Amazon niche sites.

You have a lot to learn if you are just entering affiliate marketing. You are going to benefit more from getting your hands dirty than from picking the perfect niche.\n\nMany marketers (especially new marketers) target product keyphrases containing \"best\" or \"reviews\" or \"guide\" for their websites. These sites can work well, but it limits the content you can create. Plus, these types of sites have been overdone and are starting to have a bad stigma attached to them. \"Gurus\" have pushed them in guides to new marketers entering the business. As a result, they all look the similar and have the same type of content. It seems they all use the same template. Most use WordPress, and for a theme an unmodified thesis or genesis framework. This is because the \"guru\" gets affiliate commissions for recommending these themes. In addition, these types of sites use exact match domain names, which immediately cause suspicion. It is better to create a brand for yourself.\n\nI prefer to target a problem. Then you can build the site around the problem and offer products that fix the problem. This allows you to create a comprehensive resource guide with many useful pages for users, instead of just product reviews. As a result, you will be unknowingly ranking for more longtail keywords, not just the product keywords. As your site gets visitors from these longtail keywords, users may drift over to your pages focused on keywords which are harder to rank for. Over time, this can increase the rank of the bigger keywords without you doing anything. Plus, identifying a problem is the first step in sales copywriting.\n\nFor example: *How to destroy a hard drive*. This is a keyphrase focused on a problem. It is an evergreen keyphrase and gets 3000 searches every month of the year. Competition is low. The problem with this keyphrase is it lacks a diverse range of products to sell, which is why I mentioned it here. If someone is clever enough, it could be extremely profitable I am sure. An example of a brandable name is HardDriveX.com or something like that. Ideas for content aren't hard. Example pages: \"do magnets actually erase hard drive data?\", \"how to disassemble a hard drive\", \"does water ruin a hard drive?\", \"why its important to destroy your hard drive before throwing it away\" blah blah blah. There are probably hundreds to thousands of pages that could be created.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with targeting products less than $10. Many marketers claim this is a waste of time, but I have tested it. It works fine, because people on Amazon will add other items to their carts to increase their purchase price to the point where their shipping is free. These cheap products also have less competition than more expensive items.","816":"I work for Target, and we double check on the tablet because we'll price match with multiple places including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.. We want to make sure we're getting you the best deal possible.\n\nJust yesterday I price matched something that was $151 in Target stores, the customers wanted to price match Amazon for $127, and when I checked on the tablet Target.com was selling it for $112.

I'm much younger than you think, but there are economic realities Im more aware of from my career path that you're not considering when you bemoan one service or another buying the show you want to watch.

To store all that data on 2TB harddrives would cost you $4,870,000.\n\nEach of that 32.3% of users will spend 86 hours watching Seinfeld to get through the entire series, 90 hours if you include the 4 1-hour long episodes, equivalent to if instead, the entire user base watched 27 hours 47 minutes and 4.56 seconds of Seinfeld.\n\nA Hulu subscription is $7.99 monthly or $95.88\/year. Considering it only takes 90 hours to watch the entire series and there are approximately 5840 waking hours in a year, it only takes up 1.54% of your year, or 3.08% of your year assuming you have a 9-5. That leaves you with another 2830 hours left over to watch Hulu after work, with the time watching Seinfeld costing approximately $2.95, which takes a little less than 24 and a half minutes to make on federal minimum wage. \n\nSource: I am a bored college student who just got back for the summer and is waiting for my parents to go to sleep so I can go outside and smoke weed.","833":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

So frequently, in fact, that I've made a fun little copy-paste response for them:\n\n\"Excellent! Another entrepreneur\/developer that probably won't deliver on their promises.\n\nBasically what we want is an app that makes flipping super easy for us, but not for anyone else so that it doesn't flood the market. What's been mentioned before is a Google-glass app where we have to do zero work what-so-ever, and we can just walk through aisles of stuff and it would just tell us what's profitable. Of course if everyone has it, then it will be less than useless, because everyone will be using it and saturating the market. So just make it for us... maybe a total of 10 licenses. Also make it free, because we're cheap as fuck.\n\nSorry for the sarcasm, but we've been down this road several times before. I don't think that making an app to make an already pretty simple process even simpler is your key to riches (because many have tried, and many have failed). Personally, what would be of value to me is an app that makes my book-keeping easier. I know that receipt scanning apps already exist, but what I'd like is one that makes it seamless to attach information from the eBay, Amazon, or Craigslist listing\/sale to the scanned receipt. It would make my least favorite part of this business much easier. The plus-side of this is that there exist APIs for all of the major selling platforms. The negative side of this is that this is probably a limited market. I, personally, would pay good money for an app like this to make life easier... but most people here are indeed cheap as fuck. It's a byproduct of spending our days in thrift stores, auctions, and secondary markets. Additionally, eBay, Amazon, and Craigslist book-keeping apps already exist... just not with that handy feature. You might be ripped off immediately if it takes off.\n\nIf you're serious about this (and I mean REALLY serious, not 'flash-in-the-pan' serious), I'd be happy to work with you on this. I have experience in software development, software quality assurance, business, and flipping.\n\nIf you're not that serious about this...

You may do everything right, get on the 1st page, but you get stuck at like #6 in the SERPs and just can't get any higher. Or you're ranking higher, but the traffic\/revenue isn't just where you thought it would be. So instead of a site you were hoping to make $2k\/mo on its own, it's only making $500\/mo. \n\nAlso, it takes at least 4-6 months to get a new site ranking and earning. And setting up a PBN network for each site (at least 20-25 PBN domains per money site), is costly, complex, and time-intensive.\n\nI also have a full-time job :) ","869":"I'm not on earnhoney so this might not be a helpful answer, but I know that I still run Perk and Swagbucks videos which are also passive.\n\n15 cents doesn't sound like a lot, but for people that have been doing this stuff awhile we understand how things tend to just add up.

My technique is to look for value, and when I see these companies, with infinite P\/E's or non-existant P\/E's or no financial statements at all (penny stocks) I just don't know how to value the company. These stocks move based on how many articles are published about them a day, and I don't like that because I can't constantly decipher what is true, what's not true, and I don't know how other people are feeling.\n\nIn the solar sector, I know what people are feeling. People are feeling scared. Simple as that more or less. When people are scared, it drives the price down and they become cheap. I see a cheap stock, with a product pushing parity with fossil fuels and a 1% market penetration rate (infinite room to grow) and that's a risk that I can take. \n\nAgain this is just for me.

Martin - Game of Thrones: $300 (also signed so worth more than that)\n\nThese sales aren't actually fill a bag sales till the last day but I went to the previews to get the good stuff while it was still there, at .80c to $1.50 each it was definitely worth it.\n","910":"Just out of plain curiosity, when you say flipped them within days on Amazon do you mean FBA or Merchant? \n\nI'm still learning, and I am wondering if you are just really quick with sending out your packages or do merchant fulfilled.","911":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I did not buy deep OTM puts because they're usually just hail mary gambles. Put the options on about 2 days ago and the futures about 1.5 weeks ago (with an additional NQ short thrown on after NQ got driven up sky high). Unfortunately the NQ\/TF spread was still put on too early though.\n\nOh and to be \/r\/investing compliant: You should never do any of the above and only invest in passive Vanguard funds. The market never goes down and you can never call a top of a bottom.","913":"See if any companies deliver groceries in your area: Fresh Direct, Amazon, Stop and Shop or other local grocers with online shopping. They aren't always more expensive. Also I agree with others - go early or late at night","914":"Haha that's hilarious. I thought I was the first!! Should have searched.\n\n\nUnfortunately I don't know anything about receipt scanning, I guess it would have to be a mobile app using the camera on your hone, but it would be fairly easy to make a database that downloads your ebay sales and then has an option for you to attach an image like a scanned receipt to it.\n\nAmazon transactions as well, Craigslist doesn't really have any way to do that you would just have to enter the transaction manually since they are all conducted offline anyway.\n\nMy programming skills are all for web development and using the ebay\/amazon api's.","915":"So what I'm hearing here is that it's not worth the risk of being assigned and just take the loss..Im in the same sinking boat with Amazon after today's market drop toward end of day, my short 425 leg is ITM, Amzn closed at $421.78.  Except it's going to be a $2500-$2800 loss if not more after opening tomorrow.","916":"Amazon is one of the most unresponsive web account setups ever! Even after faxing the documents they requested of me, only a man or woman can require anything of a man or woman which Amazon Payments Account Specialist is not a man\/woman but a person, they still continue to send me the same email response asking for the same documents over and over! I even talked to a Amazon call center representative, who was very helpful, and even after he notified the Amazon Payments Account Specialist concerning my documents the Account moderator has not verified my fax for the last several days now! These current Amazon Payments persons need to be replaced with more helpful and passionate persons, seriously.\n\n","917":"Potentially, but I'm being cautious about overspending. You can make some dumb decisions when all of a sudden everything in the store is half off. Actually more than that as $600 was at 5-6% cash back.\n\nBought a new AC at Amazon, home improvement stuff at Home Depot, bringing Starbucks drinks to a (barely) reasonable cost. My sister kinda resells Sephora, and its been very good for her.\n\nI did screw up with one card that wasn't registered. I never actually tweeted the hashtag. I figured that out quick and registered 30min after. Will be interesting to see if it still goes through, or if they'll manually honor it. Fun accidental experiment.","918":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Those are the ones where you have history. Lenders not only look at score but how long you have carried your positive standing with your open ones.\n\nI closed out my smaller cards in favor of my large ones with perks (Amazon \/ Capital One). Yes it can hurt your credit score temporarily however, in my experience the scores went right back up to where they were previously after a couple of reporting cycles.\n\nIf you choose to keep them, select a few you will use regularly and put the rest away in a safe.
