{"id":"499nqr","author":"0ddmanrush","body":"So, recently while browsing my local used book store on my lunch break, I came across a few guitar tablature books. They were only $2.00 a piece, so I figured it would be worth picking them up and seeing what I could throw them up online for.\n\nI specifically came across a Seether guitar tab book, scanned it with Amazon and the lowest price available was $75.00. So, I decided to list it for 59.99 and it sold in about 10 minutes and before I got back from my lunch break.\n\nSo...I'm hooked.\n\nI've bought a few books here in the past, and flipped them for decent profit, but nothing like this.\n\nThe opportunity I have here is that the books in this store sell very cheap...75 cents for paperbacks, $1.50 for hardcovers. There are just so many genres and books to choose from, that I don't know exactly the best spot to attack with my Amazon barcode scanner.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions as to being more efficient in regards to locating profitable books quicker?","name":"t3_499nqr","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-07 00:05:49","week":10}

{"id":"49gcg1","author":"SonicMetalics","body":"25 year old male, just graduated college here in the US, and I've been working at my dream job since August. I decided I needed to start building credit/credit history so I went out looking to learn as much as I could and I found a lot of great information on here as well as places like credit karma, and from my bank USAA. I decided I should start with a credit card as that seems to be the easiest way to establish credit. Through USAA I was able to get a Visa Platinum unsecured card with a $500 limit in January. As a member of USAA I'm eligible for a free credit monitoring through Experian. After only one billing cycle on my Visa card I already registered a credit score of 688, I was shocked at how fast it was generated so I signed up for a credit karma account to check a different source and credit karma had my other two scores at roughly the same area, 690 and 678. \n\n1. I've heard that it takes 6months to a year to have any kind of credit score so I was shocked at how quickly it appeared and how high it was. Does anyone have any feedback as to why it was so instant and what determines where the score starts out? \n\n2. I want to continue building credit, so should I apply for something like an Amazon store card, or various other cards through places like Citi or Chase? \n\n3. Credit Karma offers a tool that explains why your credit is looking bad or good, for example credit utilization of 1-9% is excellent. In the category of accounts open I have a Poor ranking because I only have one account open but in order to be ranked excellent I must have 21+ accounts open. Isn't that an insanely high amount of accounts open?!\n\n4. How many card accounts should I try an open at this point? I have no need for credit cards and would only use less than 10% utilization in order to keep building a good history. \n\n5. Will potential credit card lenders even consider my credit score relevant given that it only has a one month history?\n\n6. Should I also do something like buy furniture or a TV on store credit (those 24months 0% financing deals?) in order to help build various types of credit or does that not get reported? What about a small personal loan from my bank? \n","name":"t3_49gcg1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-08 03:52:54","week":10}

{"id":"49grgw","author":"Legoracehorse","body":"I'll post as much detail as I can at the moment. My take home is roughly $2,300. Rent its $645. Car payment is $268. Auto insurance is $90. Cell phone is $40. $1,200 worth of two medical bills get $50 each. Subsidized Stafford loans ($3,000 originally) get $50 a month. Utilities average $50 a month (electric only, gas not available). Cable is $47 a month.\n\n\nCell phone is after stipend. Medical debt has $1,050 left on it. Stafford loan has $450 of principal left. \n\nHere's where things get tricky, and where I start rounding. I have $17,200 in credit card debt, regardless of whether the numbers below correlate. Bank of America CC has $8,300 on it, 15% interest and $10,000 limit. Amazon CC has $3,500 on it with 19.5% interest and $4,000 limit. Chase CC has $950 on it with 23% interest and $1,500 limit. Wal-Mart CC has $1,300 on it with 23% interest and $1,900 limit. Wells Fargo CC has $3,300 on it with 27% interest and $4,000 limit.\n\nI'm currently putting $1,050 towards all of the cards, but am quickly losing ground. Wells Fargo offered me a personal, unsecured loan for $17,200, which would pay off all my credit card debt. The terms were 60 month at 14.5% fixed interest and $404 a month. I figure that $404 monthly is better than $1050, and if I double the monthly payment, I can pay it off in half the time, and use the extra money to replenish my saving accounts and start my retirement investing back up. \n\nI've asked advice from several people both personally (my HS math instructor) and personally (an economist and  statistician). Both agree that this is the best solution available to me. I'm curious to see what your thoughts are on the subject. \n\nTo head off questions, the debt occurred in the wake of my father's death. I was adopted, and there wasn't enough time to update his will to include me. When I was kicked out of his former house I had nothing but clothes and my dog. I had to buy things like a bed, shelves, table, etc. I was also hospitalized twice and had to pay rather high deposits as my \"landlord \" was no longer alive to speak on my behalf of my good \"rental\" history.\n\nI also have a budget and stick to it. Allow $50 monthly for food and $20 monthly for gas. No other expenses are allowed.\n\nTl;dr: Is this debt consolidation a good deal?\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone and glad to see I'm on the right track. As for my nutrition, I'm on a medication that curbs my hunger as a side effect to it helping my sleeping disorder. At two meals a day I strive to eat healthy and bulk buy things like ground beef (40# boxes from the university, which used it to let their meat sciences students learn with), pasta, frozen vegetables, etc. I have a mandated yearly checkup too, and the doctor thinks I'm doing great, so no worries!","name":"t3_49grgw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-08 05:33:35","week":10}

We did some digging and realized that they're still using SUPER primitive methods to recruit these participants. \n\nOne of the most common approaches to finding participants is to post about the study on Craigslist:\n\n[example #1](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/cpg/5481410584.html)\n\n[example #2](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/cpg/5481038600.html)\n\nWe saw an opportunity, so we built and launched a site called User Interviews (http://userinterviews.co) It's a web tool that makes it way easier for market researchers to quickly find and schedule qualified participants for their studies.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* A researcher creates a project, specifying what type of audience they're looking for.\n\n* A screener survey gets emailed out to members of our database, who can fill it out to indicate their interest in the study.\n\n* The researcher reviews the surveys responses then approves everybody that he/she wants to interview. The approved candidates are then allowed to sign up for an interview session.\n\nResearchers use our platform to recruit for both in-person and remote studies. The payouts can range from $15 (for a 15 minute phone call) to $250 (for a multi-day diary study). Another benefit of participating in studies is getting to see &amp; influence new products before they're available to the public.\n\nIn the last 6 months, our clients have paid out over $65,000 to participants - and about half of that in February alone. We pay most of our participants through Amazon and PayPal, but we're planning to integrate with something like tangocard.com in the near future.\n\nWe're planning to start ramping up our sales, so I thought now would be a good time to share the opportunity on /r/beermoney. The next few months will probably be the best time for participants to make the most money on our platform.\n\nIf you're interested in signin up, here is the link:\n[http://userinterviews.co/hello](http://userinterviews.co/hello?referrer=rbeermoney)\n\n^ When you sign up, we ask for basic demographic info because that information is often required by the researcher. It also helps us limit the surveys that you receive to ones that you may qualify for. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them throughout the day today.\n\nThanks!\n___\n\nA few notes:\n\n[1] Please don't try to game the system (e.g. using multiple emails, misrepresenting yourself on a survey). We're regularly adding new checks for fraud, and we will ban your account if we see suspicious activity.\n\n[2] Because the studies on our platform are often looking for very specific audiences &amp; behaviors, you may need to fill out several surveys before qualifying to participate in your first study. Our hope is that over time, we'll be able to improve our targeting so we don't waste your time with surveys for studies that you won't qualify for.","name":"t3_49j16j","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-03-08 16:44:20","week":10}
{"id":"49je9t","author":"Cruxling","body":"I know iPads are overpriced, however I am still interested in getting one so I can access Apple/iOS only type software. I already have a windows PC and an Andriod phone, so I'd like having the option to use iPad/Apple exclusive software and aps. My android phone is fairly old at this point and already can't handle a lot of current aps, so having a newish iPad or something would be nice to have access to that market again without having to upgrade my phone. I also have never owned a tablet.\n\nI would be using it primarily for my Square card reader, gaming, wifi, and watching movies/shows while away from home. \n\nI'm looking for tips or recommendations for what I should be looking for when buying my iPad. I don't really know all the differences between the different variety's and generations either, so help in that dept would be nice. Ideally this tablet would be something I could use for the next 5 years, so a really old model might not be able to handle a lot of modern or upcoming software/requirements I imagine. \n\nIs buying used from a pawn shop a good idea for things like this? I've mostly had good luck when buying from pawn/thrift stores, however I've never bought anything this high end from one of those types of stores. How about craigslist or eBay? Or should I stick with a more official method like a refurb from Amazon or something? \n\nAny help, tips, or advice on this matter and things I should watch out for would be greatly appreciated, especially as a first time tablet buyer!

{"id":"49k1vt","author":"U62conanthelibrarian","body":"Help me out guys, I need some outside opinions. Semi-throwaway for reasons.\n\nI’m nearing 35 and I feel like I’m still living like a college student. I’m barely able to save and I want out from under my debt. House someday would be nice. I read about these people here who pay off $50k in three years or something on my salary and it drives me nuts. Hoping you guys can tell me what my best strategy is going to be.\n\n**Assets:**  \n$36k/yr steady salary ($2,100/mo take-home, paid monthly). Job is new (started in September), former job paid about $33k/yr.  \n$550 in savings.  \n$17k in retirement account (Teacher Retirement)  \n700+ credit score.  \nCar is a hybrid, and is paid off and reliable. (My old car not so much.)  \nMotorcycle I’m willing to sell (Bought many years ago for cheap to supplement unreliable car)  \nNo kids, no plans for kids.  \nGenerous amount of weekend/evening free time.  \nLive in suburban Texas, CoL is generally lower here.  \nLikely 3% raise this year.  \n~~Holocaust cloak~~  \n~~Wheelbarrow~~  \n\n\n**Liabilities:**  \n$12k in student loans @ 6% (graduate school)  \n$9k in CC debt. Card 1 has 7k @ 11%, Card 2 has $2k @ 0% for the next year. Debt is medical bills, vet bills, repairs for old car, and accumulated small personal spending (&lt;$50/mo).  \nWork in academia, so raises are scarce and bonuses/overtime nonexistent.  \nSeveral chronic medical conditions which cause pain and fatigue and require daily meds, doctor’s visits on average once a month, and very strict diet.  \nLong commute, city has substandard public transit.  \nMotorcycle I’m paying insurance on because I haven’t sold it yet.  \n\n\n**Monthly bills:**  \n$930 for rent and water. (Planning to move in September, max budget is $750/mo.)  \n$400 for medical expenses (Average for last 12 months. Some months it’s just $30 for meds, some months it’s my $2,000 deductable...)   \n$200 for pets (Average for last 12 months. Food and medications are $100/mo, plus occasional emergencies)  \n$70 for internet and Netflix  \n$10 for phone (on a family plan)  \n$100 for insurance (car, motorcycle, renters)  \n$100 for electric  \n$300 for groceries  \n$150 for student loan payments (repayment plan that will cost me the least in interest but means slightly higher payments.)  \n$180 for CC payments (minimum +$30 for Card 1, $50 for Card 2)  \n$30 for gas and tolls  \n$25 for savings  \n\n\n**Monthly other:**  \n$100-$300 misc. shopping (clothes, books, movies, hobbies)  \n$50 for restaurants  \n\n\nSlight twist: One of my many lovely chronic health problems comes with a side helping of impaired memory and impaired impulse control; sticking with a budgeting system isn’t *impossible,* but it is objectively more difficult for me. I have tried YNAB and I found it surprisingly unintuitive and hard to use. I have been using the “Win the Day” spreadsheet for the last couple months, but I only remember to input spending a few times a month. My bank has nice clear itemized spending reports for me for each month but again, forget to use them. \n\nI *feel* like I’m living frugally but the numbers don’t bear it out. I’ve never spent more than $200 on a “splurge” in my life, and that’s happened maybe once in five years. Most of my overspending is of the $20 here, $40 there variety, and I don’t notice (see above re: memory). I shop at Walmart, IKEA, and thrift stores. I don’t have any ridiculously expensive hobbies. I want a house but I feel like that may never happen; I can’t afford to save $25 a month, how the hell am I going to save up tens of thousands?\n\nI’m just not sure what wiggle room I actually have here. My medical problems preclude me from freezing bulk meals or using a slow-cooker (affordable, non-perishable, won’t kill me; pick two). Can’t get rid of the pets (well technically I *could,* but I’m one of those assholes who talks about them when people talk about their children.) I like my job and my field, even though it’s generally not a high-paying one. I do make a few bucks here or there from eBay/Amazon/Etsy sales or MTurk, but that is not stable and it’s rarely more than $100/mo.\n\nSo, deluded, wasteful idiot or just someone in a tight spot? Any ideas are welcome.\n","name":"t3_49k1vt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-08 20:17:54","week":10}

{"id":"49khyf","author":"Aim-For-The-Bushes","body":"So I've been solely an ebay seller for years now, because I was sourcing items that really couldn't be sold on Amazon (used musical instruments). Recently I started a new endeavor and am sourcing large quantities of new items that I've began selling on Amazon. I'm pretty convinced, thanks to this community, that FBA is the way to go to sell most items, but my issue is that the large portion of my current inventory are large and heavy (window A/C units). I got these A/C units for significantly less than wholesale, but when using the FBA calculator it looks like I'd be cutting my margins by more than 50% if I was to use FBA. I'm okay with this, if I knew they would actually sell. Just for background, all of my inventory is currently listed as the lowest price and my current feedback is 2 at 4.5 stars. My questions are this: if I was to FBA these A/C units what are the chances I'd get the Buy Box, given my small feedback count? How much faster do items sell in your experience using FBA? In your experience, do expensive items ($400+) sell better or worse when compared to cheaper items when you have the Buy Box and/or are using FBA? If I was selling small $20 items, I'd definitely be using FBA, but I'm not too sure when it comes to my larger, expensive inventory.","name":"t3_49khyf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-08 21:49:07","week":10}

{"id":"49kuvr","author":"SonicMetalics","body":"Hey r/personalfinance, just graduated college here in the US, and I've been working at my dream job since August. I decided I needed to start building credit/credit history so I went out looking to learn as much as I could and I found a lot of great information on here as well as places like credit karma, and from my bank USAA. I decided I should start with a credit card as that seems to be the easiest way to establish credit. Through USAA I was able to get a Visa Platinum unsecured card with a $500 limit in January. As a member of USAA I'm eligible for a free credit monitoring through Experian. After only one billing cycle on my Visa card I already registered a credit score of 688, I was shocked at how fast it was generated so I signed up for a credit karma account to check a different source and credit karma had my other two scores at roughly the same area, 690 and 678.\n\n1. I've heard that it takes 6months to a year to have any kind of credit score so I was shocked at how quickly it appeared and how high it was. Does anyone have any feedback as to why it was so instant and what determines where the score starts out?\n\n2. I want to continue building credit, so should I apply for something like an Amazon store card, or various other cards through places like Citi or Chase?\n\n3. Credit Karma offers a tool that explains why your credit is looking bad or good, for example credit utilization of 1-9% is excellent. In the category of accounts open I have a Poor ranking because I only have one account open but in order to be ranked excellent I must have 21+ accounts open. Isn't that an insanely high amount of accounts open?!\n\n4. How many card accounts should I try an open at this point? I have no need for credit cards and would only use less than 10% utilization in order to keep building a good history.\n\n5. Will potential credit card lenders even consider my credit score relevant given that it only has a one month history?\n\n6. Should I also do something like buy furniture or a TV on store credit (those 24months 0% financing deals?) in order to help build various types of credit or does that not get reported? What about a small personal loan from my bank?\n\n","name":"t3_49kuvr","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-08 23:07:51","week":10}

{"id":"49tzg7","author":"Rabedababe","body":"I am 23 years old, currently living in LA working as a film editor, cutting feature film trailers and TV spots. I am married and we recently found out the we are going to have a baby in September. I am going to try and explain the rest of my situation as efficiently as possible, but will answer any and all questions. Thank you for any help in advance\n\nI started working for the company I am working for in January 2013. I was told to register as an \u0010LLC and to bill them with invoices for 750 a week (39k a year). Fast forward to January 2016, they gave me a raise to 950 a week (49.4k a year), with one raise halfway in between to 850. Up until this time on my tax papers, I would show that I basically didn't make anything that year by writing everything off, and pay very little taxes. \n\nThen mid February 2016 hit and they told me that I am going to be made an employee, so taxes would be taken out of my check, as well as insurance. I didn't think much of it until yesterday when the insurance man came to sign us all up for insurance. Total insurance and taxes that will be taken from me monthly are $1510 (EDIT: 710 Insurance, 800 taxes) a month. That is pretty much half of my paycheck every month and would make my take home money less than 30k a year. There is literally no way I can afford to live on that kind of money in LA with a family. Our rent is 2100 right now in LA.\n\nAs of right now, the only option my wife and I can see is to move to AZ by the end of the month. My wife's family have a house that we can rent for $600 a month, which they would probably let us live for free the first couple of months to get back on our feet. But that would basically mean career suicide for me because there is no film industry in AZ. I am ok with that, because I believe family is most important and it will be nice to have the support, but it sucks because I love what I do.\n\nWe have a little debt (after writing it all out it is more than a little), about $9000 CC and $4000 in Amazon no interest loan (200$ a month to pay off before interest kicks in). Also have a motorcycle payment and a leased vehicle. We figured if we pay minimum of everything and the 600$ rent in AZ we would need about 3200 a month to get by comfortably. We have about 5k in the bank right now, and my wife's income fluctuates (last month she made about 8k, this month has only been about 1k) so that will be incoming as well as my second check for the month on the 15th which will be 1150.\n\nIt has been pretty frustrating because I feel I have worked really hard and shown a lot of dedication over the past couple of years to this company. I even finished 3 TV spots of my own for a pretty decently big movie this January (if you are not in the industry, you won't understand what this means). I guess I am just trying to see if there are any other options I am not seeing, but to me the only option is to move to Arizona and drastically reduce our cost of living.\n\nAny and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read and have a great day.","name":"t3_49tzg7","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-10 16:52:38","week":10}

{"id":"49y4dw","author":"walled","body":"I had a call with a mortgage broker who was trying to \"educate\" (his words) me on the existence of soft and hard pulls when I was inquiring if getting a quote would result in a soft or hard pull. He condescendingly said he usually has to educate his clients that soft and hard pulls are consumer terms and the industry doesn't distinguish between them. In fact, there's no such thing in \"the industry\" he claims and they don't use these concepts.\n\nMind you, this was a Wells Fargo employee, which shouldn't be a surprise here given their reputation on these forums...but to hear those words coming from him was like hearing global warming doesn't exist (okay, maybe a bad analogy). \n\nA hard pull is like the number one concern us churners and MSers are deadly worried about.\n\nI let him have his moment and politely ended the call after that because no amount of reasoning could sway his conceited attitude. The guy was flaunting his mortgage license like it was some kind of PhD and he was the law on this matter. Best to leave and wish him a good day.\n\nTo give you my background, I've been in the churning game since Amazon Payments kicked off and try to contribute as much as I can here while also helping friends and coworkers with their credit and finances. I keep a good points portfolio and am very aware of my credit (800+). Nothing to show off here, but in my experience and from very credible people and sources I've encountered over the years, every financial institution distinguishes between these two types of pulls. They may not use the layman's terms in-house, but they would be incredibly incompetent and go against regulations to not make this distinction.\n\nWhat's wrong with this guy?

I have a full time job that I work 40 hours a week at, plus on average probably 16+ hours of overtime every month.\n\n I have paid for my college totally out of pocket thus far (will probably need to change that once I get accepted to the university vs the local college I am at now, but that's for another time).\n\nThe only thing I am paying off of on a loan right now is my car. I live with my parents. My only expenditures right now are the following:\n\n* school (classes, books, etc.)\n* car (monthly payments/insurance/gas)\n* food (groceries/eating out)\n* occasional leisure (steam sales/other video-game stuff, events, some travel, but nothing *unusually* extravagant, Netflix/Amazon Prime)\n\nI'm also a flight student that hasn't flown in 8ish months because I'm being a little tight on savings until I feel like I have enough to pay for that outright.\n\nI may be getting a side gig - though that is not finalized. But if that does go through, I'm going to be needing a new computer/tablet to help me be more mobile when working remotely, as all I have is my custom build PC, and that is tethered to my parents house with shitty internet until I can move out, and I'm hoping to do so within the year. And this got me thinking: should I just buy what I want, or should I make the purchase with a credit card? (Which I don't have)\n\nThe thing is I've been winging it almost entirely up to this point, and I know very little about financial planning, credit or anything financial related to be completely honest.\n\nI *need* to start building credit, right? That's important? I can't just keep paying for things out of pocket?\n\nI know this post is totally ignorant, and I probably sound really affluent, but I'm not. I'm just really frugal, and have been very efficient because I don't have to pay for housing and all of the things related to that. \n\n***Please***: Ask me some questions, start guiding me in the right direction, and I will hopefully be able to get something out of this rambling post.","name":"t3_4a3jou","subreddit":"FinancialPlanning","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwze","created_utc":"2016-03-12 12:42:38","week":10}

{"id":"4a5kgm","author":"Chronic_Apathy1","body":"I couldn't find anything in the guides, so hopefully this isn't too common a question. A few years ago, I was stupid and opened PayPal Credit account and Amazon Store Card accounts I've been making minimum payments (with the odd late payment due to forgetfulness) since around 2010. At the end of this month, I will have both completely paid off, and I'm cancelling my PayPal Credit account entirely (keeping the Amazon card because I use Amazon quite a bit for any shopping that isn't groceries; note that it isn't a full Amazon credit card - I can only use it with Amazon).\n\nSeveral months ago I had applied for an actual physical credit card, only for use in an emergency, since my two current credit accounts couldn't be used to pay for gas or anything like that. It was some student card (I can't remember exactly, but it was highly recommended here in /r/personalfinance; I think it was a Discover card), and I was denied because I had too much outstanding debt.\n\nI have three questions:\n\n1. After I get all of my credit card debt paid off at the end of this month, how long would I need to wait before I can apply for a physical card again? I still want to have a physical card for emergencies.\n\n2. I know that after seven years late payments fall off my record, but does a late payment six years hurt me as much as a late payment yesterday?\n\n3. I'm in my last year of college, and I have a lot of student loan debt. How badly does this hurt my credit score, and does it specifically hurt me when it comes to things like credit cards?\n\nI'm sorry if any of these questions are common or if I should have looked harder.","name":"t3_4a5kgm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-12 22:24:24","week":10}

{"id":"4a6j70","author":"BoogieBear21","body":"T-Mobile has a Buy One Get One free promotion for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. It requires buying two phones and receiving a rebate for one, in the form of a prepaid mastercard, and using the [EIP](https://support.t-mobile.com/community/billing/equipment-installment-plan). What I'm thinking is opening a new plan with two phones, wait like a month, then cancel them, pay for the phones in full, then sell one of them. That way, I'll get my money back in cash and with the rebate card, and get the Galaxy S7 for about $200, which would be the cost of the plan, taxes, and any difference between how much I spend on the phones. They come with free vr stuff and a year of Netflix per phone, so I might might even turn a profit. This plan requires being careful and paying attention, but I want to make sure that it's sound. The promotion allows two free phones per customer, so I could double this, and get two for a bit more. What do you guys think?\n\nEdit for the two of you that care: \n\nThere were a few hiccups, because T-Mobile accidentally shipped the phones to my billing address in CA instead of my mailing address in NY. That held up the delivery, but all in all, the plan worked pretty well. I got four phones, and they're all unlocked &amp; paid off, and my rebate was fast-tracked, so it's already on its way. I sold one so far for $800. One hiccup I didn't anticipate was that it's pretty hard to resell the phone at full retail price, especially since a lot of other people are selling it for $200 cheaper than retail. It's on ebay for ~$650 now. If I was doing this alone, I could have sold three other phones and actually made some money, so that's worth considering next time they have a BOGO. Amazon and eBay have online selling fees, and there are a lot of scams on craigslist, so you should keep that in mind if you would like to emulate this plan sometime in the future. I only activated one sim card, so I only paid activation for that one sim card. I'll use it for a few more weeks, then I'll cancel the plan. I'll add another update then.","name":"t3_4a6j70","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-13 02:50:42","week":10}

Provided I am on a visa (J-1) and will probably never ever set foot in this country again once I returned home?\n\nGreatly appreciate your help.","name":"t3_4aa809","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-03-13 22:54:51","week":10}

{"id":"d0qguv8","author":"stormfield","body":"As many others have mentioned the certificate is wrong. You can just link to the regular http site which loads fine, but you should fix it before running an ecommerce site yourself. \n\nI make liquor, so maybe my experience is useful here. We don't have the luxury of online sales though, I still have to sell through retailers. But some principles are pretty similar.\n\nA bunch of unorganized ideas you might want to consider:\n\n* Selling anything you eat or drink is hard to do online, because most people would want a sample. I'd offer a multi-pack that contains all of your products in one package (instead of a la carte) and push those -- if your stuff is good enough, people will talk about it, share it, buy more, etc. I assume that's why you're starting this?\n\n* Social media is not a great way for a brand to spread its message to new customers, however it is great for connecting with your existing customers who want to hear from you and are interested in what you're doing. On your facebook page right now, there are a lot of very similar posts that read more or less like an advertisement and a call for sale. A much better use would be a photo of some food featuring your product, a smiling person trying it for the first time, a sped up video of making a batch, whatever. You can also use it to feature (or ask for) customer-submitted recipes, etc. \n\n* Forget retailers. Sell to restaurants. They will use far more than any one person you sell to -- honestly most jars you sell (even if people like it) are going to sit almost untouched in the fridge. Best time to sell to restaurants is dropping in between 2-4pm when nobody is busy or by setting up a meeting ahead of time. \n\n* I think your prices are honestly too low. People will pay more for quality, and people *want* to pay more for quality. Food &amp; drink are affordable luxuries even for those on a limited income and high-income folks hardly bat an eye about price if it's something they want. \n\n* Maybe try pop-up tastings in local areas (farmers markets, whatever), sell your stuff there with a square reader, capture emails, send them a follow up with a discount code a couple weeks later. \n\n* Moving your products to Amazon or another major online retailer that generates its own traffic would probably be a good move. \n\n* Spending a few dollars on online ads in different areas (facebook, google, yelp, etc) and see which ones get the most results for you, if any. Figure out the cost per customer and cost per sale you get from those, if any. \n\n* Offer a jelly-of-the-month or some other subscription-based model.\n\n* Sponsor fundraisers and charity events with free product in exchange for handing out fliers, etc. \n\n* Food festivals and relationships with local media buy you exposure that advertising can't.

{"id":"d0qhk19","author":"jargoon","body":"As someone who has gone through a similar transition recently ($80k  to ~$180k in the last 2 years) and works in the tech industry, I think the biggest change is that you're going to be able to easily afford things you want but that aren't necessarily worth spending money on. One big pitfall (which may or may not be true in the Bay Area) is that you'll be able to cover your rent and bills with that first paycheck each month, which makes it much more tempting to spend all of your money every paycheck.\n\nI'd suggest putting together a budget with something like YNAB (allotting something like 10% of your income to a little reckless spending) and really sticking to it, which you will find to be a lot easier. Make absolutely sure to put money aside for short term and long term goals (emergency fund, retirement, house, etc.).\n\nYou may find yourself ordering a lot of shit on Amazon, but try to be disciplined about it and finish that book or game before you get the next one. Tripling your income has a good chance of giving you ADD when it comes to things you've purchased (i.e. using stuff once or twice before you buy some other shiny thing).\n\nAlso, if your new company is anything like mine, there will be a lot of happy hours, dinners, and other drinking involved, because everyone you work with can afford to do it on a whim. You definitely want to go if you can, because this is where a lot of information sharing and social bonding goes on, but try to limit yourself to a couple of drinks only, both so you don't spend too much money and also so you don't say anything or hear anything that could lead to a \"resume generating event\".","name":"t1_d0qhk19","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-07 07:06:46","week":10}

How to do this: search for the brand name. If the brand is \"Purple Pickles\" and the search space looks like [this](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=purple%20pickles), you're golden. This type of search space means that there's very little competition for the term and it is VERY EASY to rank for that brand just by titling your site \"PURPLE PICKLES STUFF AND SHIT\" and saying \"PURPLE PICKLES\" at the beginning of sentences. Don't bother including the brand name in the URL, it's not nearly as powerful as it once was. This is how OP is getting his traffic without pumping out content. If the brand search has 3+ ads on it, and that brand name bolded 50+ times on the page: move on cuz there's no room for you.  \n* Build Wordpress site with free extensions  \n* Insert products, images, and links to Amazon  \n* Guest post and/or put social links out there to build minimal credibility for search engines  \n* Do nothing for 1-2 months  \n* New ranking index comes out, you're ranking in the top 5 for that brand  \n* You won't get a ton of traffic away from the brand's website, but some. And it's free. And people don't have to buy that product specifically, just anything off of Amazon within 24 hours you get a cut of.  \n* Repeat 30 times in OP's case (there's are 10's of thousands of brands on Amazon)  \n* Profit  \n  \nWill this succeed for you? No. A resounding No.  \n  \nThe above takes OP ~10 hours a site. But you don't have a clue how to set up Wordpress, so that'll take you 30+ hours to produce a pile of unoptimized crap. Your SEO isn't nearly as good as you think either, and you'll pick bad brands in addition to messing up the on-page elements. So after several months of sucking, you'll give up. And even if you get the ranking and people on your site, your site blows ass and you can't get them to click on the affiliate links.  \n  \nTL;DR: Making money passively takes skill, and judging from these comments it's not present in this thread.","name":"t1_d0qjjtx","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-07 08:40:58","week":10}

{"id":"d0qode0","author":"invest_throwaway66","body":"Hello hello. Long time listener, first time caller. I'm about to revise my entire (taxable) portfolio, and would appreciate some critique. Short version: inherited 55k a few years back, dad helped invest it, did okay but high expenses, somewhat random nature and holdings overlap make me want to revamp. I've been reading here for the past month or so and tried to do my research. I'm 29, have a 401k that's doing fine and just opened a Roth last year (fully funded due to unexpected work bonus). I'm thinking I would use this money in 5-7 years for house down payment.\n\n[Link to new proposed portfolio](https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/4a1f5d)\n\nExplanation of choices: Had BRK.B for 6 years now and got 75% return on it, I have enough faith in them to keep some shares and see what happens. SCHB for broad market exposure. SDY for S&amp;P exposure and dividends. DODGX I've had for 2 years and it's currently at a loss because I bought at a high. They've done pretty well over most 3-5 year periods, I just had bad luck on the timing but they're coming back nicely this year already; plus I like the dividend yield and the expense isn't bad. (also this isn't buying more of them, that's the current amount I hold). SLYG gives me some S&amp;P small cap, with good dividend. XLP is a nice defensive sector in case other areas act weird. RYT gives me exposure to tech stocks, and I like equal weighted because otherwise funds are all heavily into AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and etc which have a tendency to swing heavily and are already represented in my other funds. PONDX gives me a relatively stable bond base with very nice dividends. Plus some cash.\n\nI think I might take the dividends (for the past 12 months it would have been ~$2,700 apparently) and make those my Roth IRA contribution, depending on how the account/market does overall. I don't think I'll be able to max that out otherwise.\n\nAnyway, would appreciate everyone's thoughts!

{"id":"d0rbcdv","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"The first one that I hit, there was a couple that was just pulling down entire shelves of media into a cart, about 45 minutes before the sale, so I just started grabbing everything that I could that had a bar code and something in the case.  The second one, had an extremely small media section (one 2 foot wide bookcase or so) which a guy stood in front of closely examining everything on it, so I just moved onto the other two that I could get to .. where I had plenty of time to sit and scan the entire rack.  I grabbed everything that scanned higher than 10c at those two.  I ended up with about 200 discs to send to decluttr, cost $10, should get back about $80.  Then I've got 20 discs that either didn't scan at all there, had missing components, or need further research to decide what best to do with them.  A couple of the discs appear to have really inflated Amazon pricing (like $200 inflated) so I need to figure out if they are something that can actually sell for that much.  Got one disc that has autographs from the band .. a few discs of software, music, movies for myself/family.. \n\nTook me about 3 hours I think to enter it all back into decluttr once I got it back home.. But I think I've got a better workflow for the next time they run this.. which will be, assuming I can scan in store..  Check case for contents, if contents are legit, then scan it.  The only problem with the workflow, is decluttr gets very very slow when the list gets big, so it becomes difficult to remove an item after entering it.  Another option would be to use a legit barcode scanner and a PC or tablet, instead of the phone camera option.  In any case, deciding that I DON'T want to put something into decluttr after scanning/entering it, really really slows the pipe down.\n\nAlso, next time, I'm going to probably just not even hit the one where that couple was at, unless i can get there quite a while before the sale starts.  In this case, the thrift store announced it about noon, starting at 5.. I showed up about 4:15, and they were already there.  \n\nAnother possible workflow, would be to just grab every damn thing that has a barcode.  That didn't work badly, but scanning did keep me from loading up dozens of discs that would've had zero return.  I only ended up with 1 disc with a 5c value, and 1 with a 1c value.\n","name":"t1_d0rbcdv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-07 23:34:46","week":10}

The basic idea is that you want to take advantage of the credit card companies instead of vice versa. We always have 2-3 cards in action at any given time:\n\n1)Amazon.com card - we buy tons of stuff off Amazon regularly so might as well get the pts for free stuff while we do. This card never carries a balance, I never put more on it than I can pay off at the end of the month\n\n2)An interest free card - 0% APR for 18 months - we use this for when we have big expenses that can't be avoided. For example, we had to move cross country last year so we put all those expenses on this card and then just slowly paid it off over the course of 6 months with no interest\n\n3)An awards card - totally depends on what you are looking to do...look at airmiles if you know you have an upcoming flight you'll need to pay for...others are cash back (i.e. spend $3000 in 3 months and get $500...this is the one I have currently). So I'll use this card for everything...gas, groceries, car repairs, restaurants, everything possible...I buy a pack of gum it goes on this card so I can hit that 3k minimum.

(It's a lot more hands on of an experience in my opinion than just a story)\n\n\nAlso local meet ups- sometimes organized by libraries, or by groups that meet at coffee shops, or even my university has had an event or two - for coloring could be a good place to look into.\n\n\nI think Facebook could be a valuable place to build a page or group so people can share their drawings. I saw a giveaway on r/coloring recently linked to joining/sharing on a fb thing and there seemed to be a lot of recent posts and new activity in it because of it, but I don't know if they were also running a lot of ads or otherwise promoting it to get that too.\n\n\nIf he has  a lot of coloring designs for his books, he might want to think about releasing an a coloring app. There are some simple app templates for coloring even, I think. I personally haven't found a coloring page -dedicated app I'm really happy with drawing in as an artist yet, so I think there's room for growth there.\n\n\nI'm hoping to start selling coloring books on Amazon soon too - though probably on a much smaller scale- so I've been trying to come up with different ideas anyway.

I think the Barclay card is no longer offered.\n\nTo really optimize, you'll probably need more than two cards eventually.  Cash back cards are more intuitive and better for general finance, but points will be more lucrative for your vacation planning.  Which card you want will depend on where you live and where you want to visit!  You'll probably want a general expense card then start looking at optimizing categories.\n\nIf you don't have it already, I always recommend the Discover It for a first card.  It has 5% rotating categories, Jan-Apr is auto (gas, maintenance, etc) for instance.  They always do 5% Amazon around Christmas which is handy.  Plus 1% on everything.  This is doubled at the end your first year so you get 2% on everything plus 10% on categories.  No fees or anything.  They'll also give you $50 or 100 with a referral code.\n\nBlue cash is great for groceries and pretty good for gas, only downside is Amex isn't taken in some places.  You'll also want a Mastercard/Visa since they're accepted pretty much everywhere, this will probably be a general 2% card or maybe an airline points card.","name":"t1_d0rgz94","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-08 01:57:08","week":10}

Primarily travel domestic within the US, mainly west-east coast flights, with occasional forays into Canada - doing maybe ~4-5 round trip domestic flights a year, plus once/year ish to Central/South America for vacation, am considering flying to Europe or East Asia for a vacation in the next couple years, but this is not an immediate goal.\n\nLooking for recs for next few cards. I just discovered churning as a systematic thing - have previously just got random cards because I saw the bonuses and went for them. Mainly deciding between Amex Gold, Citi TY Premier, Capital One Venture, British Airways, SPG. Open to other suggestions too (I don't have a business, although I guess I've never tried applying for a business card). \n- Currently leaning the British Airways since I have a sweet deal for a year where I have employer-owned housing that lets me pay my rent by credit card with no fee, making it super easy to meet min spends, but I only have the place for one year and I don't know when else I'd be able to put 20k easily on one card in a year to get the 100,000 Avios points. Only thing is I'm not sure how good Avios points would be for domestic flights from SFO... \n- Everyone keeps talking about SPG being a great deal right now with the 35k which makes me feel like I should get this one but... not entirely clear - is SPG really that great of a deal if you don't plan to stay in any hotels? I know there's the 1.25 transfer to airlines, but that makes it worth just over 40k airline miles, which is good but not exactly stunning compared to a lot of other cards.\n- Failing those above would just be to get the AmEx gold, TY premier, or something else along those lines?\n\nAppreciate your thoughts!","name":"t1_d0rj22z","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-03-08 02:50:42","week":10}

Since you basically created a SaaS (software as a service) for community colleges, you could now go in a lot of directions, including:\n\n1. Creating an e-course or another SaaS for the same audience, but based on a slightly different pressing problem. \n\n2. Replicate your success in another industry: Start from scratch by picking another target market, interviewing key players to find the top problem, and then programming for them a software solution. (You don't seem like you need help with this process, but if you want help, check out Dane Maxwell's and Rob Walling's materials.)\n\n3. Start a web development company specializing in web or mobile apps. Better yet, narrow it down to a specific target market too. (If you get tired of coding, take on the marketing, proposals, and project management roles and let someone else code.)\n\n4. Go into education: Teach others how to code/ how to replicate your success via an online course or coaching. (Personally, something like Javascript or object-oriented programming scares and confuses the crap out of me but if someone could teach it in a simple way I might be up for it. And on that note, a \"Non-Scary Javascript for Web Designers\" e-course that turns them into Front End Web Developers might have a market. See how skillcrush.com is tackling this too.) Or create a game for kids that will help them learn programming and launch it on Kickstarter like this: http://www.robotturtles.com/\n\n5. Go in a different direction entirely: Get into ecommerce and selling on Amazon.  \n\n6. Figure out how to turn programming into a \"productized service\" -  basically, instead of selling software on a monthly basis, package up and sell a well-defined \"done-for-you\" programming service and scale it up like Brian Casel teaches at casjam.com \n\nNote: If one or more of these interest you, let me know - I might have more resources to share or experts to point you to.","name":"t1_d0s1lms","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-08 15:26:05","week":10}

{"id":"d0tai9r","author":"DerekPadula","body":"I run a blog about the [culture and history of Dragon Ball Z](http://thedaoofdragonball.com/). I started it 8 years ago and I am now an authority on the subject. However, the site has never made a profit. \n\nI designed and coded the site myself, built on WordPress.\n\nThe main purpose of my site is to serve as an author platform for my books. I don't actually sell many books through the site itself, although the option is always there, and I'll make 1 or 2 sales a month. However, by having the site up 24/7, it creates a constant advertising and branding platform, where people can learn about my books and buy them elsewhere, such as Amazon. So it's an expense I don't mind paying, but I'd love for the site to at least break even, with a monthly hosting cost of $30.\n\nAt its peak I was receiving 60,000 unique visitors a month, but nowadays it's 30,000 because I don't post as much, since I'm focused on writing and publishing my books. I tried running AdSense ads in various positions, but nobody EVER clicked them. I've also tried running several different banner ads from different providers, most of whom generate a half a penny for every 1,000 impressions of the banner. It's ridiculous. At the moment I have two banner ads placed at the bottom of each blog post and each manga post, provided by Technorati Media, which are currently generating about 5 to 10 cents a day. Woohoo! So at the end of each month I make about a dollar. Only $29 more to go to break even.\n\nIn addition, I have Amazon Affiliate links peppered throughout my posts whenever it's logically appropriate to put them. As in, if I'm talking about an actual product, such as an anime DVD or a book, then I link to the product with my affiliate ID. This generates less than $10 a month. Usually $5. But in Christmas I can earn around $30.\n\nOverall, I have never found a way to make my site turn a profit. My target demographic of 18 - 30 year old males does not click ads, the banner ads don't generate enough revenue to be worthwhile, and I don't want to make a bunch of low quality posts filled with affiliate links. I've been writing about Dragon Ball for 8 years, and I'm at the point where I take my business more seriously. It's not just a hobby anymore, it's my main vocation. So if anybody has suggestions, please offer them.","name":"t1_d0tai9r","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-09 13:49:01","week":10}
{"id":"d0talu1","author":"ttimothyu","body":"I am going to be traveling to New Zealand in January of 2017 with my wife. I have the flights all taken care of. Now I want to get a card or two for my wife and I that can get us a few free hotel nights. After looking at awardmapper I feel like my options are limited, but I would like some advice on which cards I should prioritize.\n\nCredit Scores are in the mid to upper 700s. Shouldn’t be a problem.\nMost recent apps (No hotel cards yet)\nMe: CSP and United MPE approved on 12/7/2015 and AAdvantage on 1/13/2016\nWife: United MPE approved on 12/7/2015 and CSP &amp; AAdvantage on 1/13/2016\n\nThe best options for hotels in New Zealand seem to be either Choice Hotels or Best Western. There are also a few IHG properties as well. No Hyatts or SPG unfortunately.\n\nI already ruled out the Best Western cards. Have to meet multiple minimum spends throughout the first year. Not worth the effort IMO.\n\nI see barclay is offering this card for Choice Hotels for 32000 points for $1000 spend with no annual fee. Is this the best I can do points wise with this card? I don’t see it listed on the current credit card offers sheet? https://www.barclaycardus.com/apply/Landing.action?campaignId=2248&amp;cellNumber=6&amp;referrerid=PTRBACHH116\n\nAs for IHG I am thinking about that too because of Chase 5/24. I was thinking about signing up for the 60,000 +$50 statement credit and seeing if they will match to 80000 points.\n\nI also have about 1000 Hyatt points that are about to expire at the end of this month, but I don’t know if I want to get that card since I don’t really think I could fully take advantage of the offer. However, if I don’t try for it now I doubt I will ever be able to get that card. I just hate to let the points expire. :/\n\nFinally the 35000 SPG points seem nice, but no properties in New Zealand. I am not sure it is worth it for the potential 50000 miles for $5k spend.\n\nIf my wife get the Choice and IHG cards I would only need to make $4k in minimum spend. Shouldn’t be too hard. If I add the Hyatt I am worried I risk getting denied with Chase since we will then have 6 cards each with chase (Amazon, Freedom, CSP, United MPE, IHG and Hyatt). I sort of understand the excitement of SPG, but I don’t really get how $5k spend for 50000 airline points would be really worth it? I would only really consider the SPG for a possible future trip in 2018 so maybe I should skip?\n\nAnyways I have rambled long enough. What do you guys suggest I do?","name":"t1_d0talu1","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-03-09 13:53:26","week":10}
{"id":"d0tb1ur","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"I like Visa (V) more than Mastercard (MA), given Visa's scale. That said, I like both, I'm simply saying if someone asked me to pick one of the two, Visa to me is winning business (including Costco and a few others in the last year, such as Fidelity and USAA.) If you're a toll road business, you want as many people using your toll road as possible. Both Visa and Mastercard are growing their dividends and moving into China, although the latter will take some time. \n\nNike is not cheap, but rarely has it ever been. Still doing quite well. Maybe I'm crazy but I like Lowes better than Home Depot as a customer. As an investor, HD has certainly outperformed. \n\nI actually do like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) a great deal, as I think a lot of what is going on around the edges - self-driving cars, Google Fiber and others - is quite compelling. Google Fiber - if successful - can be a tremendous business as I think people are desperate for an alternative to Comcast. That, and I find infrastructure to be a highly compelling investment in an age where demand for data is growing exponentially. Google Express also has some potential in the ability to have delivery from stores like Costco, Walgreens and Whole Foods. In a world where Amazon is certainly dominating, the ability for retail chains to be a part of Google's platform and offer the ability to deliver items from local stores to users is compelling. Even the smallest aspects, such as Sidewalk Labs and its attempts to focus on seeking change in modern cities, including offering free ultra high speed wifi across major cities (http://www.wired.com/2015/06/google-next-moonshot-wifi-hubs-sidewalk-labs/, http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/12/29/googles-grab-for-the-sidewalk-has-begun-with-the-rollout-of-linknyc-free-public-wi-fi/#gref) has a lot of potential. I do think that the Alphabet of 5-10 years from now will look quite different from the Alphabet of today. \n\nApple (AAPL) is an appealing value play at this point, but I'd look at it more as a value play with upside if they make a significant announcement of something that will actually move the needle.\n\nI immensely like industrial conglomerate Danaher (DHR), which has a tremendous history of success - it's one of the best performing stocks of the last few decades. While it will likely not repeat the immense performance since its IPO, it still has all of the elements in place to be quite successful. It will split into two different companies later this year. \n\nEcolab (ECL), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brookfield Asset (BAM), Liberty Media (LMCA)/Liberty Ventures (LVNTA) and  Thermo Fisher (TMO) are other names that come to mind. Both Liberty Media and Liberty Ventures are doing two spin-offs each this year - the Liberty companies do spin-offs to shareholders rather frequently.\n\n\n","name":"t1_d0tb1ur","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-03-09 14:12:47","week":10}

Down-to-the-minute metrics means that the workers have to be on the go each second of the day, and are on the hook personally for stock location mistakes that they have no responsibility for; time required to jump through Amazon's hoops is not compensated; warehouses are very hot in the summer and chilly in the winter.\n\nFor management and technical personnel, there are of course differences between teams, but overall people speak of brutal hours and the expectation that you are on call 24/7/365 - for, again, marginally above average compensation.","name":"t1_d0tsc35","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-03-09 21:21:29","week":10}

{"id":"d0tsk5h","author":"jloome","body":"I'll qualify this by noting, first of all, that writing for newspapers for years allowed me to develop a certain fluidity of expression. It's a very different medium, but journalism is obviously related to storytelling, and it helped having that background. It helped a great deal.\n\nHaving said that, as you note, you have the technical background.\n\nSo I'd approach it in a few steps.\n\n1 Determine what you want to write. If you're doing it to make a living, consider whether you want to be populist or just stick to a narrow niche. \n\nIt's much easier to make a living if you respect that the average reader doesn't care about your education, your preferences, or the value of a dangling gerund; they just want characters they care about, and a good story. If you don't have that, your construction and turn-of-phrase can be truly beauteous, and most people will still, truly, not give a shit.\n\n2 Plan what you write. Research the average lengths of novels (Google is your friend!) and consider that those guidelines exist because readers like them in that niche or genre.\n\nWrite an outline. Consider when writing it that you want to scenes to work to the formula 'enter late, leave early' -- cut out the wasted words and don't include every split second of their day. We don't necessarily need the drive to the scene of the crime, for example; it might be useful for character development, but often this works better within the meat of the story. Start with their raison d'etre, not how they go there. That's the \"Enter Late\" part. \"Leave early\" is the second part. That means you leave them on a cliffhanger or unanswered question, something that will make them move to the next chapter in anticipation.\n\nDon't be afraid to plot forwards and backwards. Know what your blockbuster conclusion is, and work backwards into what led up to that. At some point, you'll have an idea for your opening scene or setup to the story; go back to the beginning and make it your starting point and start plotting forward to the stuff at the end that you already know.\n\nConsider pace; every third chapter or so, you need a tense showdown that includes some strong visual action. Add that to a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter, and you have an outline for how many writers keep people hooked.\n\n3  Write every day. I mean, every day. If you're stuck in an airplane washroom between Australia and Arizona that day, use toilet paper. If you can't write with the same speed and fluid ease that most people read something out loud, you're probably not going to be very good at it. Shoot for a minimum of 1,000 words a day to start, and up in to 2,000 words a day after six months or so.\n\n4  Learn the market. There are multiple markets for a fiction writer. Base your income around what you can accomplish, not the vague 'dream of being a novelist.' First, consider that the paper market is still very important, but it is harder to make money than if you self-publish. It is MUCH easier to get rich and successful in the traditional market, but it is still incredibly unlikely to happen. Self-publishing, I believe, offers an easier route to a living. \n\nTypically, if you submit a first novel to a small or large publisher now and it isn't already hyped on social media like Goodreads or Library Thing by people reading along for advice, they'll weigh it against competition in the market place, of which most genres offer a ton. They will offer you an 'advance' against royalties, usually of between $5,000 and $15,000, sometimes for just that book, sometimes for sequels as well. Typically, although not always, this is yours to keep even if the book doesn't sell enough copies to reach whatever 'trigger' is agreed in the deal before your royalties kick in. Given that most books don't sell, it is often the only payment you will receive other than very small residual checks.\n\nThere are massive benefits to going with traditional pubs: editing support and proofreading are the strongest reasons, but depending on their size and efforts, marketing and promotion as well. They have market contacts with bloggers, mass-market reviewers etc that you will never be able to make.\n\nHaving said that, unless they're utterly convinced of your worth because you've already sold some books for them (or it's selling quickly on its own) they will not spend any of that money on you. You have to build solid mid-market sales (25,000 plus of a title in a year) before they'll dump serious funds into promoting you. They like low risk.\n\nIf you self-publish, you will rely on Amazon.com for your income, and largely be at their mercy. But that's really not a lot different from contractual ties in a traditional deal, some of which (even from the big guys, believe me) can be pretty restrictive. You will be competing with four million other self-published authors, although the upside is that most are truly awful; if your work can stand out even a little, you don't get the upfront advance, but you keep a MUCH larger royalty, typically 65% of the book price, versus between 8% and 15% for a traditional deal. \n\nIf you can find the best promotional methods, hire a good editor, a good cover artist etc, you can develop a following or a series that pays pretty well. I started in 2012 and sold about 23,000 books last year. If you produce something I don't think is shit, I'd be happy to share my promotional methods with you, although frankly most of them can be found easily from online tip pages. Mostly, you find places to advertise free samples, generate reviews and that in turn generates word-of-mouth and sales.\n\nAvoid the temptation to buy adds or giveaway spots with the gazillion 'free book' sites that have sprung up; by my estimation, 98% have no value.\n\nHit me up if you  have any more questions.

{"id":"d0u7h16","author":"tcw87","body":"One of the things that I learned in a training session put on by my franchise's corporate office was their approach of pricing with employees. On each day's route sheet or work order app, the pricing for the job is listed right along with the instructions of how to complete the job. By understanding not only what job they are doing, but what it's priced, and a basic knowledge of why, they can effectively become salesmen while performing the job.\n\nOur salespeople and technicians are the face of the company; they deal with the customers daily and are an amazing resource for upsells and add-ons. I make sure all of my technicians feel comfortable giving out a price if a neighbor of one of my customers asks, and the only way to do this is to peel back the curtain and reveal why we price jobs. They even have a competition amongst themselves where the tech with the highest number of referrals and customers gained each month gets a $100 Amazon gift card.\n\nGranted, our average customer pays $69 for each service, and its very straightforward pricing based on property square footage. If our pricing were more complicated, this wouldn't be an option to empower our techs with this ability. In our situation, it really works well and makes my guys feel more ownership in what they do as opposed to \"working for the man.\" Sometimes they screw up and price a property too high, sometimes they may price it too low- but these mistakes provide opportunity to discuss the \"whys\" and learn from them, and most of the time they all work themselves out in the long run.\n\nYou don't have to give motivational speeches every week a la Wolf of Wall Street, you don't have to be a master teacher with all of the sales answers.

{"id":"d0vfxlm","author":"bpfergu","body":"For most affiliate sites SEO will be the top priority and where you will get most of your traffic from.  There are exceptions, but generally affiliate sites aren't very \"exciting\" so trying to garner a social following might be tough.  Do you really think people are going to follow you on instagram so they can check out your sweet Amazon product photos?  Or join your facebook page so you can pop up on their wall advertising pencil sharpeners and sticky notes?\n\nTo gain social presence you have to offer something that makes people want to follow you, and spamming thinly-described office products to them every day isn't going to do it.  Perhaps in-depth reviews, interesting articles, etc. could do the trick but again it might be very difficult to make office supplies an engaging topic.\n\nHave you considered what target keywords you are trying to snag?  You need to build your site around those types of keywords.  Simply posting a blog doesn't do the trick.  For example, if you want people to get to your site looking for funny erasers then you need to write engaging articles about funny erasers and optimize the content around that.\n\nAffiliate sites are progressing towards authority sites.  Gone are the days where you can find a random keyword and write 5 articles about it, slap it on a wordpress theme and watch the money roll in.  Google has straight up said that they are optimizing their search algorithms to prefer authority sites, even to the point where a site with a shit-load of valuable info can outrank a site that has thin info but a ton of backlinks.

{"id":"d0w2tcn","author":"josiahstevenson","body":"Abridged text/long TLDR:\n\n&gt;There's a perverse competition among some U.S. presidential candidates: Who can most loudly blame Wall Street for the problems of Main Street. They've got it wrong. Financial firms are doing more to help consumers, business and industry in America than they have in decades.\n\n&gt;Led by the Federal Reserve, they replaced incentives for reckless speculation with catalysts for old-fashioned credit creation backed by levels of capital that are unprecedented in modern times. Banks today are most willing to lend money since at least 1990\n\n&gt;All but ignored in the presidential debates this year is the record $1.06 trillion of loans to commercial and industrial firms by the largest U.S. banks, an amount that has increased for 21 consecutive quarters. That's a streak unequaled since 1985.\n\n&gt;If one excludes the period comprising the height of subprime lending, the financial crisis and ensuing recession, financing for consumers to homeowners is as good as it's ever been and getting better. Credit-card lines are increasing steadily while household debt payments as a percentage of disposable income have plummeted to 10.02 percent from 13.22 percent in 2007. The combination of healthier debtors while credit is expanding shows why banks are so willing to keep lending. \n\n&gt;The biggest banks today bear little resemblance to the risk-embracing juggernauts of a decade ago. The 24 big banks in the KRW index had the lowest total debt as a proportion of their assets since the data became available in 2002: 15.9 percent compared to 34 percent in 2004 and 30.6 percent in 2008. Estimated tangible common equity, the most conservative measure of a bank's capital, climbed to a record in 2015, says Alison Williams, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n&gt;If anyone wonders what all this has to do with Main Street, the answer is revealed in the success of companies selling consumer products to Americans. Sales per share of U.S. consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies are at a record since data became available in 1990. The additional sales of consumer discretionary firms such as Amazon, Nike and Netflix, compared to consumer staple companies including Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and Wal-Mart, is the widest since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That suggests American consumers are healthy and getting healthier.\n\n","name":"t1_d0w2tcn","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-03-11 17:09:59","week":10}

{"id":"d0w3exp","author":"zillegas","body":"First off, forget about Adsense being a significant moneymaker until you're getting a LOT of visits. I've gotten ~100,000 pageviews since my site went up in October, and it's accumulated into about $14. Until you're getting 1000+ visitors a day, you're not going to see much. It's nice to have on the side, but I would advise actually *expecting* anything from it until you're much bigger.  \n  \nAmazon is a trickier beast. I made around $150 the last two months (each), and it's due to a lot of factors. **My Amazon traffic is almost always correlated with my site traffic.** I have two types of traffic to my site--passive traffic, and social media traffic, which flows in when I post new articles on FB/Twitter/Reddit. The latter traffic causes a huge spike in viewership, and then promptly dies back into nothing after a couple of days. \n  \nThe passive traffic doesn't make much Amazon revenue. I've been SUPER busy this month and haven't touched my site, and this traffic has earned me about $14. A spike for an awesome article can easily bring ~$50 in revenue over a couple of days.\n\nHOWEVER, none of this matters if you haven't optimized your site for affiliate marketing. I'm lucky to be in a niche that's EXTREMELY well-suited for Amazon Affiliates, so I'm very optimistic about the future. I write a lot of articles with affiliate marketing in mind, and I have links all over the place on my pages. They're subtle and non-intrusive, but they point the reader in the right way.  \n\nIf you want, you can check out my site, [Board Game Resource](http://www.boardgameresource.com) if you're looking for some pointers. I don't make a TON of money, but I've been pretty pleased so far, and the site actually does very well when I'm constantly updating it, which, unfortunately, I haven't had a lot of time to do lately.","name":"t1_d0w3exp","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-11 17:24:23","week":10}

The smaller ones can give pretty remarkable quality but not the real thump you want for room-size music. \n\nI'm always making a nuisance trying the displays at Target and Best Buy comparing one to another. All of the Bose units sound relatively good. The TDK A33 stands out for sound, waterproofing and battery life (if you get the free battery replacement from TDK.) \n\nNext gift I give will be this one: Amazon \"B00MQDBRMO\" Polaris V8. For $50 it's a pretty good feature list: good sound, 4.5W X 2, FM-radio, Micro SD MP3 Player, NFC, LED Display and Removable 18650 Li-ion Battery.

Look up Amazon B00OQUV1QM , a portable BT transmitter and receiver that runs several hours on battery, or while recharging off a wall adapter.\n\nBe aware standard BT 4.0 is too slow for TV speakers. We had a hard time eliminating lip lag. It's why I recommend the $30 BT transmitter instead of a cheaper one. This model uses the APTX low-latency codec, and connecting two units with that protocol reduces the reponse time from ~250 to 80 msec. Lip lag is there but you have to hunt for it.\n\nLag time doesn't matter if all you're doing is music.

{"id":"d0x6ext","author":"_neminem","body":"\"But the only reason a person needs good credit is for going into debt.\"\nThat is not remotely true. Granted, the *biggest* reason you want good credit is so you can get the best mortgage rate, and that is technically debt, but it's debt that generally means you're doing *well*, not badly, that you have enough cash and enough stability to start building equity. Yes, buying a house outright would be even better, but most places people actually want to live, most people aren't going to have *that* kind of cash, so... mortgages are common. I hate debt, too, but a mortgage actually makes sense. \n\nStill, I take issue with your statement that the *only* reason a person needs good credit is for going into debt. Alright, technically a credit card is also debt, too, but... with negative interest, if you pay it back quickly, which of course you will. And having excellent credit qualifies you for cards with particularly good rates like that. Everything I put on a card, I get between 1.5% all the way to (adjusted) ~6% back, depending on the purchase category and the time I bought it. Actually, last Christmas I bought a thousand dollar laptop on Amazon, and got a truly massive *12%* back (ish - 10% back in points, but the points are worth ~20% more than their cash value if you spend them correctly). Though that was a special case. I think it's absolutely important to learn to never rely on debt... but I think it's also absolutely important, too, to learn that credit cards can be your enemy (if you can't resist spending more than you have), but they can also be your best friend, and basically give you free cash, if you can. :p","name":"t1_d0x6ext","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-12 15:53:08","week":10}

And they are the gatekeepers. The first ones you meet.\n\nThey ask you one question, that's it. Just one. If you have the right answer, that gate comes up, else __ well, does not look too bright.

Google Express is part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but it's a needle in a haystack. Google also has an investment in Uber via Google Ventures (again, very small part of larger company.) I thought Google Ventures was invested in Instacart, as well, but apparently not. Whole Foods has invested in Instacart (how much has not been declared), but Whole Foods is also currently working with Google Express.  Amazon also has Amazon Now.\n\nI would not focus on this as a primary reason for making an investment in the above companies. It's not that I don't think someone will make this business model successful, but that there have been definite examples of it not being successful in the past (Webvan, which Amazon started up again.) If Google can get massive scale in this and create a platform that attracts more and more retailers who see it as a way to get a delivery service that they do not have to create themselves, perhaps it will be successful. I do think there will be more and more retailers who will view local stores at least partly as \"warehouses\" to ship from and if people can get that order in an hour or two, all the better, but I think in terms of investing in Google (or Alphabet, whatever), that is not a primary reason to invest in it, it's more of a bonus kicker if they can make it work. \n\nThis article from a few days back gets into much more detail: \nhttp://qz.com/627605/inside-instacarts-fraught-and-misguided-quest-to-become-the-uber-of-groceries/\n\nThere's a lot of \"stories\", people have to really filter down and decide which \"stories\" are sustainable and which are not.

{"id":"d0yntbl","author":"raspberrytrufflelips","body":"You're can build credit with one. However, there are many benefits to having many. \n\nWhen I opened my first credit card, I opened a second one a couple of months later. That way, my longest and second longest credit lines are a couple of months apart - turned out handy because I had to cancel the first one recently. \n\nI have different cards for different purposes. The sign up bonus is great, but it's a one-time thing. \n\nI get 3% cashback on groceries with AmEx Blue Cash Everyday and with Blue Cash Preferred you actually get 6%.  BCP comes with a $75 fee after the first year. You have to know what the limit is, I think $1,500 per quarter, so even if you just max out the grocery limit every quarter, you can still make just shy of $300 a year on it. I don't have kids, and I mostly shop for myself, so I went with blue cash everyday and no yearly fee. \n\nBut that's not why I have that card.\n\nAmex is my go-to card for major purchases because of their purchase protection. If I drop my new phone/someone stole it within the first 90 days, they would replace it, all that on top of their extended warranty policy. If my memory serves me well they add an extra year onto the manufacturer's warranty. And of course they are the easiest way to replace a defective item if the seller/maker is being difficult - a lot of credit card companies do that, but from what I've seen around here AmEx is the easiest one to deal with. Hope to never have to find out :)\n\nAmex cards also have rental car insurance, 90-day return protection, baggage protection (if my airline lost my bags, they would pay up to $500 if I'm not mistaken, so I could replace whatever I need urgently - clothes, toiletries, etc.). \n\nDiscover It and Chase Freedom I alternate for the rotating categories.\n\nThen I have capital one Quicksilver 1.5% and city double cashback 2% for everything that doesn't fall in the categories, so most daily purchases. \n\nI got an Amazon store card because I do purchase a lot since I live in a remote location and Discover and Chase only have Amazon in the categories for the last quarter.\n\nI have two or three more, but I just wanted to give you an example of why people might keep a few. (That on top of the fact that many places don't take Discover and AmEx plain and simple)\n\nAs long as you're responsible, there's nothing bad about having multiple cards, you can only benefit.

{"id":"d0yo8tn","author":"redcards","body":"The past decade hasn’t been kind to devotees of legendary value investor Benjamin Graham. Value stocks, underpriced relative to corporate fundamentals, have trailed the broad market as investors embraced growth stocks, notably the so-called FANGs, or Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix , and Google, now known as Alphabet.\n\nThese highfliers powered the Russell 1000 Growth index to a 5.7% total return last year, nine percentage points ahead of the Russell 1000 Value index, marking the widest performance gap since 2009.\n\nThe growth stocks in the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks similarly bested the value stocks in the small-cap benchmark, in this case by six percentage points.\n\nEnlarge Image\n\nIn recent months, however, the market’s leadership has begun to change, as growth stocks have grown too rich for investors’ liking, and value stocks too cheap to ignore. The value stocks in the large-cap Russell 1000 are down just 0.4% this year, while the growth stocks in the index are off 2.2%. Three of the four FANGs are in the red. Amazon (ticker: AMZN) has fallen 15% after gaining 90% last year. Only Facebook (FB) is up. Among small-caps, value has a seven-percentage-point lead over growth names.\n\n“It has been a good month for value,” says Rich Pzena, chief executive officer at Pzena Investment Management, a New York–based value manager. “It’s hard to say if it’s the turn in the value cycle. We hope it is.”\n\nNearly all investors proclaim that their favorite stocks are value stocks. But traditional value investing—often focused on stocks with low price/book or price/earnings ratios—is due for a comeback. “We’ve had nine years of systematic value underperformance,” says Scott Black, president of Delphi Management in Boston and a member of the Barron’s Roundtable. “It has been the longest period of growth outperformance in my career.”\n\nBlack, a value investor, has been running money since 1979.\n\nValue managers are encouraged that prior periods of growth outperformance, including the Nifty Fifty market of 1966-73 and the technology bubble of 1998-99, were followed by strong periods for value investing, including seven straight years of value outperformance from 2000 through 2006.\n\n“Momentum stocks trade at an extreme premium to value stocks, with the valuation spread the highest since 1980, except for during the tech bubble,” JPMorgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote last week.\n\nMany momentum stocks, characterized by strong price performance, are also growth stocks, or shares of companies whose earnings are expected to grow at a faster rate than the market. Growth-oriented companies, from Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) to Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V), have delivered impressive revenue and earnings gains in recent years, notwithstanding weak economic growth. But profits of companies in the financial, industrial, retailing, and energy sectors often have disappointed.\n\nLakos-Bujas wrote that the momentum trade was “crowded,” due in part to the “proliferation” of passive quantitative equity-investment strategies such as “smart beta,” which often use a momentum approach. Smart-beta investors try to tweak benchmarks like the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index to outperform them. (For more on smart beta, see “Beating the Index,” in this week’s ETF pullout section.)\n\nTHERE ARE HUNDREDS, if not thousands, of value plays in the market today, ranging from individual stocks to mutual and exchange-traded funds. We’ve listed 12 stocks, two ETFs, and two mutual funds in the table nearby. The stocks include Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Time Warner (TWX), Intel (INTC), and Boeing (BA), and the ETFs are the iShares Russell 1000 Value (IWD) and iShares Russell 2000 Value (IWN).\n\nEnlarge Image\n\nAmong value-oriented mutual funds, American Funds Washington Mutual (AWSHX) and T. Rowe Price Value (TRVLX) are two of the largest, with the best five-year relative performance versus the S&amp;P 500, based on Morningstar data. None of the 10 best-performing value mutual funds has beaten the S&amp;P 500 in that span.\n\nA sustained period of strong relative performance for value might require more robust economic growth and higher interest rates. Financial stocks account for a big chunk of value indexes and probably need to do well for value investing to enjoy a resurgence. Banks would benefit from a stronger economy, which would improve the credit quality of loan portfolios. Also, higher rates would widen the industry’s depressed interest-rate margins.\n\nActive management, in general, is suffering as retail and institutional investors favor low-cost index funds and ETFs. Investment flows have been flat to negative for many asset managers, and most of the largest mutual funds, value and growth alike, have had steady outflows in the past two years, according to Morningstar. It hasn’t helped to be a value manager in this environment. Royce Associates, for example, which runs a group of mostly small-cap value funds, has seen its assets nearly cut in half in the past two years, to $18.5 billion. Royce is part of Legg Mason (LM).\n\n“Investors are now questioning whether value-based strategies can ever work with central bankers’ stranglehold on interest rates,” wrote Steve Galbraith, chief investment officer at Herring Creek Capital Management, a Stamford, Conn., asset manager, in late 2015.\n\nThe letter lamented that “our dyed-in-the wool value brethren are starting to abandon ship, espousing the merits of GARP [growth at a reasonable price] or finding tortured definitions of value to justify their investments.”\n\nNot so fast. Pzena argues that much of the commodity and energy-related weakness in the global economy already has been felt, and that amply capitalized banks will remain largely protected from sizable credit losses, which could bolster their shares.\n\nPzena likes Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America (BAC). All trade at or below tangible book value, a conservative measure of shareholder equity that excludes goodwill and intangible assets stemming from acquisitions. Citi arguably is the biggest value; on concerns about its global exposure, the stock is down 19% in the past year, to $42. It trades for about eight times estimated 2016 earnings and 70% of tangible book. Pzena notes the recent lows in bank valuations matched those in the financial crisis.\n\nBlack has bought depressed stocks such as Boeing, Intel, and Ralph Lauren (RL). Boeing and Ralph Lauren trade for 15 times projected 2016 earnings, and Intel’s price/earnings ratio is 13.\n\nValue investor Mark Boyar is partial to media stocks. He likes Time Warner, due in large part to its HBO franchise, and Discovery Communications (DISCA), which has a 10% free-cash yield. Discovery trades well below Boyar’s estimate of its private market value.\n\nAuto makers Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) trade for less than seven times projected 2016 earnings, with yields of 4.5% and 4.9%, respectively, amid concerns that the robust North American vehicle market is on the verge of slowing. But those fears seem overblown. Pfizer ’s stock (PFE) has been punished as Wall Street awaits the outcome of the company’s controversial bid for Allergan (AGN). Amgen (AMGN), another value pick, isn’t getting much credit for its drug pipeline and earnings power. Micron Technology (MU), at $11, trades near book value and at a deep discount to replacement cost.\n\nAfter such a long period of disfavor, value investing could be on the verge of a multiyear comeback. But it could require patience.\n\n“Value investing becomes easier when you go into each trade with the mindset that the stock is going to continue lower after [the] initial purchase.” That tweet, from Twitterer Brattle St. Capital, is good advice.

Things were well until I lost my job. Now I haven't made a car payment in 4 months, student loans took my entire federal refund, I have utility bills racking up late fees from my last apartment that I've since moved from, and I have medical bills and an Amazon bill that probably has over 300-400 in fees added.  \n&gt;   \n&gt;   \n&gt; The job is going to net me roughly 40k a year. I'm 23 years old if this is a relevant bit of information.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; My girlfriend and I are planning on moving out of her parents house after she graduates college in early 2017.  \n&gt;   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Here's what I owe:  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Car payment: $6,000  \n&gt; Old internet bill: $89 (last I checked, it's been several months)  \n&gt; Old energy bill: $550 (several months ago)  \n&gt; Amazon: ~$1200  \n&gt; Student loans: $3600 (after they took my $1200 federal refund.)  \n&gt; Medical: estimated to be a couple thousand.\n&gt;   \n&gt; My goal is to be completely paid off and have a good chunk of savings for when we move closer to my job.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; As of right now I have less than $100 to my name, and I'm going to be commuting  2 hours and 40 minutes round trip from work.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; I don't have any bills other than debt as her father is letting me stay rent free.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; My credit is also garbage now, mid 400s.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Is there any way I can get that back up to an acceptable level within the year?  \n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\n----\n\n^(I am a bot.
