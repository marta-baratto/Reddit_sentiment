{"id":"3uu20y","author":"clearelephant","body":"TThe app is called Whaff Rewards. It's for Android only. It's sort of like FreeMyApps, where you download an app, try it for a bit, uninstall it, you get credits. But in Whaff we have premium picks\n\nWhen you first open the app, you'll need to sync it with a Facebook account. I would suggest just using some alternate account, as I always would, but it doesn't look like they're doing anything fishy with the information. It doesn't ask for anything too extreme with its permissions. After that, you put in a referral code if you have one. If you have one, it will give you $0.30 and whoever the code belongs to will get $0.30 too. If this post helped you at all, please use my code, which I put at the bottom of this post.\n\n Explanation of screens: \n\nLucky Picks: It's basically a raffle for people who use the apps in the list. Don't do it.\n\nPremium Picks: Here you will be making the most of your money with this app. Each app in this list will have an Install Reward, a Daily Play, and Daily Reward. The Daily Play reward is the greatest thing ever, since you can just put your phone onto 5 minute screen time out, put it to the side while it runs, wait until the screen turns off. In 5 minutes, there's about $0.06 to $0.10 for you. If you do this with every app in the list, you'll be making about $0.60 to $0.80 a day. That, and it's guaranteed that you'll get credits for them.\nWhaff Picks: They're your typical \"download, install, use, uninstall\" apps.\nAttendance: It gives you $0.01, and you can press the button once every day. It gives you more Whaff Picks apps to choose from.\nUser Stream: A stream of other users earnings. \n\nNow, for other important details.\n\nThe minimum payout for Amazon or PayPal is $10.50, then next one is $20. This is likely to prevent people from getting the lower rewards and go up higher, because I don't know if they (the WHAFF team) keep the extra $0.50 for their own profit.\nYou can redeem your rewards for Google Play, Facebook, Amazon, Xbox Live, Steam, Playstation Store, iTunes, and Paypal.\nIf you're going to do any Whaff Picks, only do the ones that say \"Install &amp; open app to earn credits.\" or \"Download and START\". They seem to be less suspect of not giving you credits. Things that require you to sign up, get to Level 2, etc. seem to be the main culprits. \nI highly recommend this app. It requires little to no effort on your part.\n\n\nSo anyways, here's my invite code: **AH82006** I would really appreciate it if you use that code when signing up. You'll get a head start of $0.30, and I'll be a step closer to Fallout 4","name":"t3_3uu20y","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-11-30 11:01:15","week":49}

I am also a web dev and Business development consultant. \n\nmy 2 cents....\n\nOne month isn't a good enough indication of the future potential of your business especially if you are passionate about it. Give it a solid 90-120+ days especially if you haven't dumped allot of cash into it. It will take time, it will take energy and lots of ups and downs, and it will cost some money. After all its a business. \n\nHowever if you do give it a solid go and are investing money into it and aren't turning a profit then cut your losses quickly and move on to the next idea unless you want to stick with it for the long haul and rebrand yourself. \n\nAs far as marketing goes here are some suggestions:\n\nYou need to engage with people in various ways..\n\nTry Hootsuite to manage all your social media campaigns. They have a free version that allows you to run 2 campaigns for free and their next tier is like 9.99 a month. \n\nIts basically one dashboard that lets you manage all your facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, twitter, whatever else people use these days so you have consistency and the same message across all your social media and you can schedule your posts. It also lets you engage with your customers but you don't yet have any....still something to think about. \n\nhttps://hootsuite.com/\nhttps://hootsuite.com/plans\n\nget some newsletters or info out. They won't come if they don't know you are there. Give people some incentives to buy from you or to get to know you. Host some events, or go to some local meetup or fair and try to offer your products there. Find out what that would cost. \n\nYou need to be consistent in your messaging. \n\nYour facebook page I think is nicer than your Etsy store. it looks more like a company page. \n\nVisit lots of places/forums with people who might want to buy your products or who make handbags hang out. Both on handbag / fashion related sites/communities and adventure/travel/whatever places or places for designers. Share your ideas, ask questions and gugae interest in your products. Become involved answering questions and giving advice or posting so you get some reputation and can occasionally market yourself there (within their rules). \n\nMaybe where you are located its not the best place to market. In addition to what you are doing in your local area, seek out the type of people you think might like the type of products you make in specific geographic area that cater to adventure or nature. Do some data mining i.e. find out where these people are and what their email is and contact them. \n\nContact them with a simple email and a link to your store. Nothing long a sentence or 2 saying. Hi I'm so and so from TerraLura. We make awesome hand made bags for adventurous people. Xmas is coming up and maybe you might be interested in a gift idea for yourself or someone you love. Etc. \n\nAlso see out some local businesses or people who share the same ideas that you do in the same niche as you and put your business cards there, and talk to those people. Tell them what you do, and here is the most important thing - ask them if there is something you can do for them, and ask if they could carry your products or at least demo some of them or recommend your products or point you in the right direction etc.\n\nTry to also set up / book some office parties over lunch at local businesses. This would require you to bring some appetizers and will eat into your budget. You can also try the pottery barn/mary kay method of hosting parties at people's homes or your own but I don't know how viable that actually is. \n\nYou can offer some coupons or rebates or incentives for some of your products but that would require you to have pricing that covers all of that. \n\nIn the end you need to reach out to people. That is key. The idea of \"If I build it they will come\" never works. \n\nI can't really comment about your product as its not my forte and am not female, but I can tell you that as a designer you should strive over time to develop a consistent \"look\" and the better word would be \"style\". Just like an artist who starts out copying others, then over time develops his unique style that sets him apart from everyone else, so you too need to eventually develop a unique style but also one that has consistency across all product lines and offerings. Let that show through in your products so that you develop a following of people who like that particular \"style\" that you bring to the table that is unique. \n\nTell a story with your business and your products. People love to get behind an idea. Think Apple. What idea and message are you trying to convey. get people behind that message. Your bags aren't just bags they are gateways to adventure, or reminders of freedom and a traveler's spirit. See what did here? Tell a story and get people behind it.Get people behind your business because your business does more than just sells bags.  \n\nYou have a cool business name and logo (business identity). That's a plus. \n\nYour small bags are $5. Is that price enough to cover your labor costs and cost of goods sold? your marketing sosts, design costs, creation, shipping etc? I dunno so I am asking as it seems really low. Increase your prices like 4 times. People don't like cheap. Cheap = low quality. There is such a thing as perception of quality. Figure out who your target market is? Who are you selling to? Don't try to sell to everyone. If your goal is to sell to adventurous loving people set your prices comparable to what other companies, and boutique stores price their handbags, totes, wallets and stuff at. \n\nIf you want a real business, Etsy isn't enough. How serious are you about your business and what is your monthly budget? Eventually you might want to get a real store if you are serious about what you are doing. \n\nYou should set up an inline store on a .com like teralura.com or teraluraonline.com or teralurahandbags.com etc. \n\nEither your own site with a shopping cart or... \n\nUse a platform like Volusion or Shopify. \nhttps://www.volusion.com/\nhttps://www.shopify.com/\n\nThere are others. I used to run my store on Volusion. Its a complete retail business platform with tax, payments, customer management, rebates, incentives, marketing, web builder so you don't need to be a web designer guru etc. \n\nGoogle and do some research and budget to set up something like this which will give you greater legitimacy and options. If you can't or aren't ready to take this type of a step at least plan and budget for it for a future date. \n\nLook at whatever industry/trade journals are available to your business and join those organizations and read their material. \n\nGoogle where the next industry tradeshow, or outdoorsy trade show in your area is. Go to it and start to market yourself nad your \"brand\". \n\nDon't ask your family and friends for advice for 2 reasons. 1 they have no idea what your vision is but they mean well so they won't give you the right advice and 2 some of your friends might not want you to succeed because their lives suck and they would rather see you right by them then succeed, they won't be helpful either so don't bother. \n\nAsk instead on Reddit or poll your customers or people who you think are your target audience. \n\nIn terms of your Etsy store the images are ok but not what I would call \"store quality\". \n\nGet a lighbox and if you can't afford one you can Google how to make one yourself. Amazon sells different ones so look at a few and read reviews. \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/LimoStudio-Photography-Continous-Lighting-AGG1069/dp/B00DOGIED2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448843837&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=light+box\n\nuse your iphone/android or borrow someone's phone that has a GOOD camera. Put your bags in that box and take the pictures at the highest resolution possible. Make each image consistent for every product. So front, side, 45 degree angle etc, and then take a shot of you holding each bag or use some females that you know but have them standing in front of a white background devoid of clutter. What you want to achieve is consistency in your images so your products show off as quality. \n\nAs far as your product descriptions don't say \"\nI say \"we\" carry this or that or just say product is available in such and such. \n\nyou say for example - The first 3 photos are what I have in stock now. Your order will come with a random pick (unless specified). you don't need to reference yourself.  \n\nif you had your own site or were on some other platform then Etsy I would tell you to break out all your products into categories so they ar listed properly on the main page and to make it look better but its Etsy so you have to conform to their layout. \n\nGet an email address at a .com so yourname@yourbuisness.com not a personal one @gmail.com so later when you have to contact retail places, distributors, manufacturers etc you seem legit. \n\nGet an EIN or Tax ID number from the IRS. One day you will need one. \n\nLastly don't get discouraged. You have taken the first step to being your own boss and doing what you love for a living. That is a great thing! Now just remember that its sales and its never ending.  \n\n","name":"t1_cxhe3cj","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-11-30 02:27:40","week":49}

They understand HOW the bitcoins work, but not WHY it's (not) a \"currency.\" I suspect because they see how the internet has changed things, from social media to online brokerages, that naturally currencies should undergo the same, errr, \"internet-ization,\" if you will.

Well, that number is some combination of $2500 in groceries and/or $7500 in gas/department stores.

He then went through all the items and had me rank them of how important they were to me and make the hard choices of what was necessary and what things were the extras I *thought* I needed, along with what things I would no longer be throwing money away towards.\n\nHe started grocery shopping with me and pointing out the cost per unit on things, making me pay attention to value instead of just desire or overall cost. He also started clipping coupons with me, which is much more fun together than alone. He introduced me to thrift shopping and flea markets, two things I had been taught as a child were \"dirty\" and germ breeding grounds.\n\nOne thing my boyfriend said that really, really stuck out to me was that he wouldn't want a wife who was as spendy as I was.

{"id":"3uz2f7","author":"[deleted]","body":"I don't know if this is where to look for answers, but here's this deal:\n\nI ordered my fiance a guitar for Christmas through Amazon. It wasn't Prime eligible, so the suggested delivery window wasn't until next week (Dec 7). No worries since it's nowhere near Christmas yet.\n\nFriday (Nov 27) I found a \"missed delivery\" slip on the door from Company A saying a signature was required for my package and they would try to deliver again Monday (Nov 30). Sure enough, a truck arrived several hours ago and delivered the package. I opened it and it turned out to be... My fiance's guitar.\n\nNowhere on the packaging does it say it is from Amazon. The package slip lists it as a 3rd Party Seller (possibly Amazon), but nothing about the sender matches up with my invoice from Amazon.\n\nAmazon Invoice Details:\n\n- Arriving December 7th\n- Sent via  Delivery Company B\n- Amazon seller I bought it from isn't the name of the well-known music company on the packing slip\n- Was sent out on November 25 (the day before Thanksgiving, so there's no way it got to my door that quickly)\n- Was charged to my account on November 25 (day it was shipped)\n\nI am concerned that I've been sent two guitars instead of one. Right now, money is a bit tight from Christmas shopping, holiday travel, and first of the month bills. Do I need to worry my card is going to be charged again? If it is, I will end up being short with bills and/or overdraw my account (I don't have overdraft protection and the bank will close my account immediately if I overdraft, meaning all of my auto drafts will also default). Is there a way for me to protect myself from the worst case scenario?\n\nTL; DR: I think there was some miscommunication down the line and I've been sent two guitars; One has arrived and the other is scheduled to be here in a week. Do I need to worry they are going to charge my card again?\n\nEDIT: While I appreciate the help on how to return the second guitar, when it finally arrives, I still don't know what to do if my account is charged a second time.\n\nWill Amazon be responsible for compensating me for my bank fees as they are the ones that made the charge? Will I have to just eat the fees since I accepted the delivery yesterday not knowing it wasn't the one Amazon has listed on my invoice?","name":"t3_3uz2f7","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-01 08:52:19","week":49}

{"id":"3v037n","author":"rickvanness","body":"Itâs always fun to do something new, and I look forward to your questions here on Reddit.\n \nI teach common sense investing. I explain the Boglehead investing philosophy with short videosâwhat I believe everyone should learn about investing in high-school, but they donât. Nor do they learn it in their homes. Instead, everyone must fend for themselves against a gigantic industry that is trying to sell them something and for which they are unprepared.\n \nThere is a famous saying, âWhen you are ready, a teacher will appear.â  This month I bring together two of my most influential teachers in a brand new book: A 9-Step Path To Financial Independence.  You may have the PDF version free.\n\n- I met Vicki Robin 25 years ago and she changed the way I think about money, and helped me put all aspects of my life in alignment (work, health, spending, volunteering, etc.).\n\n- I met John Bogle more recently. In many ways he is the opposite; in many ways he is the same. But from him, and from generous people at Bogleheads.org who share their wisdom, I learned that smart investing is actually simpleâalthough not easy.\n\n- This link has a 2+ minute video overview and a free download of the 141-page PDF: https://financinglife.leadpages.co/nrm/\n \nI love using videoâI guess it fits my learning style (you may have seen my [Bogleheads investment philosophy videos](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy) in the /r/personalfinance wiki). And while I originally started giving free brown-bag lunch workshops at two Seattle universities, Iâve migrated to online video because I can reach many more people. Itâs all not-for-profit education and I even shun advertising. The only income I get to offset the direct expenses is from the books I sell at Amazon. While the PDF of my new book is free, you can also buy paperback versions of [*A 9-Step Path To Financial Independence*](   http://www.amazon.com/dp/1507818009) (just released) and my previous books, [*Why Bother With Bonds*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0985800402) and [*Common Sense Investing*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0985800410).\n \nSome tidbits you might find interesting about me:\n\n- I think frugality is a virtue.\n\n- I worked for a big electronics company for 27 years.\n\n- I admire entrepreneurs and have failed at my three attempts â but nothing compares to that excitement!\n\n- I donât hang out on social media or discussion boards because I like to spend my time outdoors and with my wife.\n\n- I love political satire, and musical comedies (and have even dipped my toe in a few times for fun)\n\n- I painted a wall green. Making personal finance videos is a fun way for me to combine creativity, technical skills, and financial skills.\n \nMy target audience are beginners who would find discussion boards intimidating. My goal is to teach them basic principles and point them in the right direction.\n\nAsk me anything!  Iâll be here answering questions beginning at 2:00pm Eastern time today.\n\n**EDIT:**  OK. That **was** fun! Thank you all for joining the discussion. I enjoyed all your questions and comments.

WARNING: This information is highly relevant for those selling physical product lines, rather than apps or raising money to open a brick and mortar business. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Internet is known for parroting information.  Essentially, many blog creators and people, who have just dabbled in a subject, basically copy the popular or most accepted information. They never test or take in to account this information is incorrect.  This is the reason why every crowdfunding post here at r/Entrepreneurship and on blogs pretty much says the same exact thing repeating the same tactics and tools.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI already introduced to the launch process used to get your Amazon product ranking. Well, you will be surprised to know you can use the same principles when it comes to crowdfunding.  Crowdfunding and launching an Amazon Product is more similar than you might think. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut first, I have to cover a several things, that I see you guys repeatedly messing up on. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLower Funding Goals\n\n\nI am so sick of you guys asking for $50,000 to fund your funky sock line.   You do not need $50,000 to scale/fund/create your sock line.  You should make your funding goal small I wouldnât make it more than 10,000.  âBut what if I need more?â You can utilize the media to reach your stretch goal.  You starting a sock line to save orphans is not particularly newsworthy unless you are already in the trenches within your community.  But your sock line reaching its goal in less than 24 hours is and you can use this information to leverage journalists. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nProject Presentation\n\nYou absolutely cannot be lazy with your campaign page.  You will need high-quality images of your product, your business logo, and possibly supplementary video showing off your product function and features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need good copy on your page.  You need headlines and some form of structure.  If your campaign page length is less than 4 paragraphs you are doing it wrong.  You do not need to pay someone to write it either.   Some key points you want to cover are your story (what were you doing before finding this product, what inspired you to create), the benefits of having the product, and your productâs specs (how long the battery last, how many megapixels? Etc.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCharity + Crowdfunding (the One-for-One Model Abuse)\n\nAnyone who has read one of my posts before, knows I am a huge fan of TOMS founder, Black Mycoskie. TOMs shoes popularized the One-for-One model of entrepreneurship of basically you sell one of your product and give another product away to charity.  Many crowdfunders are now turning the One-for-One into a gimmick to get funding.  People who run across your page are neither impressed nor engaged to your âcause.â  They see right through it, and do not donate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you plan on adding a charitable element to your business or crowdfunding effort, sincerity should be your number one objective.  You can start by relaying exactly how your product helps or does not help the receivers of your charitable effort. For example if you are doing the one-for-one model for your sock line.  List the real benefits of having socks for shoes (help avoid possible disease in donated shoes, comfort).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou have to get your audience to relate to those you are helping.   Mycoskieâs site and video explaining the reasons TOMs One-for-One model strives to help you relate to those who need the shoes even organizing events where people walk for a day without shoes to identify with their charity receivers.   He breaks down health and social reasons for needing shoes.  The absolute best stop in relatively is that his primary charity receivers are children.  A target audience for his brandâ¦ women, I see more women in TOMs than men any day of the week.  Women love children and Blake taps into this in his marketing, not only does Susy get to shop for a fashionable pair of shoes but she assists a child a world away. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Truth About Media\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but check this out. You do NOT need the media to cover your project to reach your funding goal. If you choose to use media (you should attempt to get media, but do not stress over it; donât spend all your time reaching out) find relevant journalists who have covered similar products already. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCheck out the article I linked at the bottom of this post, great real world application for reaching journalists through Twitter. (Iâm working on a time crunch.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Truth about your Campaign Video\n\nEvery crowdfunding video is telling you to blow almost your entire budget on a crowdfunding video.  If you need $10,000 to launch your product and spend $3000 on a video and just so happen to not reach your goal it would have served you better to keep it and hustle for the remaining amount of the money needed. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis campaign video is PERFECT, and made with a shoestring budget, the highest cost was time and probably the camera used.    Notice the product and the creatorâs story take center stage not fancy cutaways and an obsessive amount of B-roll. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jacksutter/tgt-tight-a-new-kind-of-wallet/description\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMake no mistake there is a direct correlation between how well the campaign video is done and how much money is raised.   You donât need a $3000 video to reach a modest goal of $10,000 but you will need a big budget video to reach a stretch goal of over $500,000 or more.  A high budget campaign video creates more consumer trust, but reaching your funding goal early is almost just as good.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFacebook and Google Ads \n\nDo NOT waste your time on a PPC campaign for your crowdfunding product.  Many fulfillments on a crowfunding campaign can take three to four months.  A consumer searching for a cool pair of headphones does not want them three months down the line they want them now.   This is the reason so many crowdfunders report having such poor conversion rate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHow to Reach Your Funding Goal\n\nThe secret to reaching a $10,000 funding goal: you combine renting audiences from Backerclub.co or Backershub.com (or both) with the support from the crowdfunding platform.  (It wonât hurt to reach out to your personal network and try to create an audience [i.e. email list] from relevant forums and social media preferably Facebook and Twitter a month or two in advance from your launch day) To reach any stretch goals you may have set, you then want to utilize the media and blog outlets.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBackerclub.co (P.S. you guys gave the founder of this site hell when he tried to promote here, even creating a post calling him a scanner, he now has the best promotional site for crowdfunding project, so kudos to him) and Backershub.com these sites will act as your launch service. For crowdfunders these are your Viral-launch.com and Zonblast.com.  So basically, prepare your campaign page, make it presentable and professional.  Then use these either site to blast your campaign page to their huge lists of early adopters.  Check out Backerclub.co for the type of results you can expect, with a small goal you could reach your funding goal with just this tactic.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nUsing these sites you essentially  reach the algorithm metrics necessary to inspire Kickstarter or Indiegogo to promote your campaign page from there.  Once you hit your $10,000 goal then reach out to blogs and say âHey my awesome product reached our goal in 24-48 hours, I saw you also wrote about product âxâ which is similar to my product, would you like to review/write about our product?â(slightly more professionally obviously)  The media coverage will help you reach any stretch goals you have set for yourself. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCampaign Mirroring\n\n\nThis tactic will serve you more than any blog posts, book, or service you can buy.  If there is a product that is extremely similar to yours and they were successfully crowdfunded.  They have given you a blueprint. Google Reverse Search their campaign link and see what media covered them, then proceed to go to their campaign page and see their campaign video structure, their copy, the images they used and âcopy what they did.â  Reach out to the exact same journalists they did. These past crowdfunders may still have an email list, ask/pay/strike an affiliate-type of deal to see if they will promote your product to their audience. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis couple used contacted several biking blogs to get crowdfunding for their new bike design.\nhttps://www.shopify.com/blog/36179141-how-one-couple-raised-over-500-of-their-crowdfunding-goal-on-kickstarter-in-28-days-without-an-audience\nNow if I was going to need to crowdfund my new bike design idea. The first blogs I contact will be the ones they did. \n\n\nA great site to find a similar product is Crowdcharts.com.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is basically the keys to how to launch your crowdfunding campaign.  The biggest mistakes most crowdfunders are doing are setting their goals way too high and not putting in enough prep time when it comes to building their own audience.  \n\nMy formula: \n\n\nLow Funding Goal + Presentable Campaign Page + Audience Renting =Successful Funding\n\n\nFor your stretch goals you want to then rely on the platforms promotional emails, media, and blogs. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor confirmation on everything I have said check out this article that came out literally three weeks after my course went live on Udemy. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tips-your-kickstarter-campaign-from-someone-who-had-idea-selin\n\nEDIT: Both Redditors and Amazon students asked so here you go \"Crowdfunding for Private Label Products\" priced at $247 discounted to $20 for Redditors: http://amzlaunchschool.usefedora.com/courses/crowdfundingmythbuster?product_id=43883&amp;coupon_code=TWO\n","name":"t3_3v1lpa","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-01 21:22:08","week":49}

I've been selling private label products for awhile, and decided to supplement that income with arbitrage purchases in Q4. So I put about $10k into inventory and thought I would track it closely to see how well it did. To me it seems like finding profitable stuff to resell is a cakewalk compared with trying to produce accurate figures on what you're really profiting. First hurdle was reconciling what I ordered versus what I was charged versus what I was shipped versus what the prep company claimed they received. At one point finishline.com shipped me $1100 of Nike shoes I never ordered, and searsoutlet.com charged me for $650 in coffee makers they never shipped.\n\nSo say I successfully build a list of my inventory and what I paid for it. After it is active, prices fluctuate constantly and fees are multivariable sliding scale. The daily gross sales numbers are exciting but not particularly informative.

{"id":"3v43nz","author":"importdojo","body":"Hey guys, \n\nMe again with another post in regards to importing from China. I've previously posted with similar subjects [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/38i1yq/alibaba_hacks_the_most_efficient_way_to_find/). \n\nI wanted to give you a rundown on the essential requirements &amp; regulations when importing electronics from China to the US &amp; Europe. \n\nI have recently been asked a few times to write about regulations for electronics and why I chose electronics. I choose electronics for myself because Iâve been in this category for nearly 17 years so I feel confident importing/exporting them. \n\nMany âgurusâ will tell you to shy away from electronics because of the regulations, high returns and what to do with defective items. While I do agree that a beginner should stay away from electronics I do encourage you to import electronics at one point because the margins are higher than your standard household product.\n\nEspecially if you have it OEM manufactured products (your own design/software/application). However manufacturing an electronic OEM item requires profound technical knowledge (or at least a knowledgable factory and engineers) and financial pre-investment in most cases.\n\n\nMost suppliers wonât offer free services to help develop the product unless you commit with a certain order quantity, have yearly agreements or previous (mostly large) business with the factory.\n\n\nWhy is it so difficult to find manufacturers who comply with regulations already?\nMost suppliers that develop a new product do not invest in the certifications in the beginning because they donât know yet if the product actually sells so why invest in certifications that can run into thousands of dollars?\n\n\nTry to work and find suppliers who mainly work with larger European and US customers or retailers that did the work for you already. Because when retailers look for electronics they will absolutely make sure that they comply with the law.\nYou will want to buy from factories that are either compliant already or are willing to work together with you to get the product compliant.\n\n\nDismiss suppliers who arenât interested in making the product compliant if the response is something like: âall the other buyers also donât need itâ. Ideally you can convince the supplier to invest his money into certifications and making the product compliant for different markets and regulations because it also benefits him. The more clients he can sell his products to (because they are certified) the better for him too.\n\nLets take a look at general regulations first.\n\n**EUROPE**\n \nEurope is generally stricter than the US and has a couple more regulations that are to be met if you wish to import legally to Europe.\n\n**CE**\n\nThe CE marking is a mandatory conformity marking if you want to import into Europe. It basically confirms that your product is manufactured according to certain European standards. It covers most standards and this is the absolute minimum you need to have when importing to Europe, no matter which product actually. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking\nRequired by law: YES\n\n**GS**\n\nGS or âGepruefte Sicherheitâ is a quality seal issued by a third party laboratory and mostly recommended if sold as a retailer or to retailers. It is voluntary and NOT required by law but it has been an established trust and quality seal commonly known by consumers, especially in Germany. The requirements to get a GS certificate is higher than the one for CE. GS is not available or doesnât make sense on several products such as battery operated items. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepr%C3%BCfte_Sicherheit\nRequired by law: NO, voluntary and used as a seal of quality for consumers. \n\n**R&amp;TTE**\n\nThis directive covers any radio-transmitting device and is usually already covered within a GS or CE certification.\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/electrical-engineering/rtte-directive/index_en.htm\nRequired by law: YES, any of the following products need to comply: WiFi, Bluetooth products and Radio-Emitting devices (Smartphones, tablets, smart devices)\n\n**LVD**\n\nThe Low Voltage Directive does not supply any specific technical standards that must be met, instead relying on IEC technical standards to guide designers to produce safe products. Products that conform to the general principles of the Low Voltage Directive and the relevant particular safety standards are marked with the CE marking to indicate compliance and acceptance throughout the EU.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Voltage_Directive\nRequired by law: YES applicable to products or electrical equipment with a voltage at input or output terminals between 50 and 1000 volts for alternating current (AC) or between 75 and 1500 volts for direct current(DC)\n\n**EMC**\n\nEMC or âElectro Magnetic Compatibilityâ regulates that the products may not interfere with other electronics products. Meaning that components of a product need to be manufactured according to several CE or GS standards to comply. If your product has a GS certificate EMC will usually be tested. Some CE certification and test reports include EMC testing. Make sure to check this in the report. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility\nRequired by law: YES but different nations can require compliance with different standards. In European law, manufacturers of electronic devices are advised to run EMC tests in order to comply with compulsory CE-labeling. EU directive 2004/108/EC (previously 89/336/EEC) on EMC defines the rules for the distribution of electric devices within the European Union.\n\n**ROHS Directive**\n\nRoHS or the âRestriction of Hazardous Substancesâ regulates the allowed content of 6 substances within the product. These are: Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Chromium, PBB &amp; PBDE. It is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods and is part of a legislative initiative to solve the problem of huge amounts of toxic e-waste. Most suppliers have at least a report for the incoming raw-materials that they later use for the final product. So while they do not have a RoHS certificate for the entire product they may have the material tested which is generally accepted by authorities.\nRequired by law: YES, however raw material report as opposed to full report is widely accepted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive\n\n**REACH Directive**\n\nMost suppliers have never heard of REACH altough it has been around since 2007. It is essentially the upgrade to RoHS but regulates more chemicals and substances. It has different phases that regulate the chemicals used in manufacturing and once in full force all importers need to comply (within the European Union). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration,_Evaluation,_Authorisation_and_Restriction_of_Chemicals\nRequired by law: YES\n\n**WEEE Directive**\n\nThe Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directive is mandatory to be fullfilled by the manufacturer. The marking needs to be on the sales packaging or product.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_Directive\nRequired by law: YES but different nations can require compliance with different standards.\n\n**Sub â Regulations &amp; Directives**\n\nEach of the above have several sub-regulations that have to be met. But generally if you buy a certian product from a supplier and it is say for example CE or FCC certified it should have automatically been certified by the sub-regulation.\n\n \n**UNITED STATES**\n\nThe US generally has âlooseâ regulations compared to the authorities in Europe. Having said that I do recommend that you comply to all regulations as you donât want to import a product that can cause fire or other hazards. âLoose regulationsâ also doesnât mean that they are actually loose because you still are required to comply but again, Europe is stricter when it comes to enforcing and checking at customs or at retailers. A FCC certification is usually obtainable for a couple hundred $ while a GS certificate can go into the thousands. Of course there are products that are highly technical and or pose a risk or hazard and are difficult to certify by FCC for example.\n\n**FCC**\n\nThe FCC basically regulates anything that is electronic including WiFi, Bluetooth, Radio transmission etc. You will want any device that you import that is electrical and remitting radio waves (in any way) certified by the FCC.\nThere are two regulations within FCC for both Intentional &amp; Un-Intentional radiators. Intentional radiators for example are: Bluetooth speakers, WiFi devices, radios or smartphones. Unintentional radiators are: Headphones, Earphones, power packs, PCBâs etc.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_Declaration_of_Conformity\nRequired by law: YES\n\n**UL**\n\nUL is a certification company that certifies your product according to several different standards. Say if you have a FCC certification you may still need to certify by UL, especially if you are a retailer. Itâs a seal of quality that consumers appreciate on certain products https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_(safety_organization)\nRequired by law: NO/Voluntary and used as a seal of quality for consumers.\n\n**RoHS**\n\nRoHS is also recognised in the US and widley available at suppliers. RoHS self declarations are generally accepted by authorities.\nRequired by law: NO\n\nFurther information you should be aware of\n\n**Full certification**\n\nHaving a full certification on a product is the best and safest way to go. What does that actually mean? Lets look at an example: You want to import a hair trimmer/clipper. The hair clipper itself runs on a integrated rechargeable battery. The battery is charged via a universal external charger/adpater with a plug. In 90% of the cases the supplier will only have a FCC/GS/CE certificate for the charger/adapter. Why?\n\n\nBecause the adapter can be certified with GS/FCC/CE easily and can be used on hundreds of different products that need a universal charger. So it makes sense for the manufacturer to certify the charger because he can sell it with different products and only needs to certify the adapter  once. He can also sell his charger to other suppliers who are in need of universal chargers only for their products. While the hair trimmer is a separate unit in itself and may not sell well. So why would the factory pay a lot of money to certify an entire product if they may not sell it.\n\n\nIf possible find a manufacturer who has a fully certified product. Those are likely suppliers who work with large western retailers. Having said that if say the charger has a full certification like GS/CE or FCC and the hair trimmer itself only has CE it is also acceptable to authorities. If you want to make sure that you comply or satisfy authorities you may ask the supplier to issue a Letter of Guarantee that the entire product has been manufactured according to standard or regulation âXâ. But satisfying authorities should not be your eventual goal. Your eventual goal should be to import a safe and reliable product that lasts and delivers good reviews or sales.\n\n\nA full certification is quite expensive and therefore not often found. Yet some markets like Germany demand full certification especially from retailers. If you are an online seller and your exposure to the authorities is minimal you could start by meeting only minimum requirements (CE, FCC for example).\n\n**Labelling &amp; Marking**\n\nThe following markings must be on the final packaging or box in which the product is sold to the customer where applicable:\n\nWEEE, FCC, CE, GS, Made in China, Recycle symbol \n\nI say applicable because as mentioned not every product needs to comply with above regulations.\nYou will also want to put all labels and markings of the product on the Instruction Manual. Electronic products usually have instruction manuals so youâll want to show in there what your product complies with.\n\nYou are actually required by law to mark all regulations met, either on the box of the product or inside the instruction manual (if there is no space on the sales packaging).\n\n**Returns and damaged products**\n\nUnfortunately returns of electrical products can be as high as 20% in some cases. That could be due to poor manufacturing, faulty components that didnât get checked properly, the client mishandling (or misunderstanding) the product and several other reasons. It comes with the territory when selling electronics and the only thing you can do as a seller is to take care of the manufacturing side and handle returns from customers with proper manner. Donât try to argue with customers and simply refund or exchange the product for a new one.\n\n\nHowever you should collect all data collected from returns and defects and claim the lost profit/money from your supplier when or if you re-order. Make sure to communicate the issues to the factory and have them deduct the total amount lost from the next invoice. Send all material that you can gather from your customers to the supplier to have a strong case against the supplier. If you arenât going to re-order (maybe because of the issues) try to get the defect/returned units replaced by him or even better a cash payment in the amount of your loss. The latter may be more difficult as suppliers will want to have you re-order before they give out any money for returns.\n\n**Self-declarations**\n\nIn some cases it doesnât make sense to certify a product because your quantities are low or the product is so cheap that the certification cost donât justify certifying it. In that case you may ask the supplier to issue a self-declaration which is in some cases accepted by authorities. Please note that you cannot issue a self-declaration, it has to be done by the manufacturer.\n \n\nYou would at least need to be compliant with basic requirements like raw material being certified or tested and according to regulations. However most countries in Europe only allow CE or RohS self-declarations for several items, mainly low voltage or battery powered products. Check with your supplier what he can offer you.\n\n**Lets take a look at a few examples**\n\nPlease note that the following are recommendations and there may be additional requirements for each country depending on your sales channel.\nI know for a fact that many importers ignore these regulations, hoping not to get caught.\nI am not telling you what you should or shouldnât do but many countries have lax enforcements so importers simply ignore it. I personally like to have everything in order and proper certification to avoid any problems in the future.\nItâs best to check with a third-party inspection company but this should get you started when sourcing for electronics:\n\n**Bluetooth Speaker (Low Voltage product)**\nEU: CE, REACH, ROHS, LVD, R&amp;TTE &amp; GS on the adpater recommended if product comes with a external charger (they usually come with USB charging cables)\nUS: FCC, UL recommended if you are a retailer\nNot to forget that you need to pay BIG (Bluetooth Interest Group) a fee of 8000US$ (4000$ if you are a member) if you are planning on private labelling your product. Prior to February 2014 private labelers were able to register their private label under the manufacturers Bluetooth chip license but BIG changed that and made it not possible anymore. I know that there are many small time buyers who donât care and risk it because its still a grey area but basically they are illegally branding Bluetooth products.\n\n**Solar powered garden lamp (Low Voltage product)**\nThis is a very simple product but highly competitive. The good news is that they are battery operated and low voltage powered.\nEU: CE self declaration, RoHs self-declaration\nUS: FCC self declaration\n\n**Vacuum cleaner (High Voltage product)**\nEU: CE, GS recommended, RoHS, REACH, EMC\nUS: FCC, UL recommended\n\nWired-Headset (Non-Bluetooth, no direct Voltage)\nEU: CE, RoHS self declaration\nUS: FCC self declaration\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\nMany small importers in Europe or the US illegally import products hoping not to get caught (or not knowing there are regulations to be met). Basically playing with fire just to save a couple hundred dollars on certifications and compliant products.\nAlso paying for a certification report doesnât mean your supplier can comply with the regulation. Before you place an order with the factory make sure to ask him that the material and components will actually pass a FCC or CE testing for example, otherwise you waste money on a certification and the product may not even pass the requirements.\n\n \nOne thing that I recommend beginners with electronics is to have the certifications from the supplier verified by a third-party. If you work with a third party inspection company like Asiainspection, TUV, SGS or others they are usually open to check certificates for you. That is if you already do business with them otherwise they charge a small fee. You can simply ask your contact at the third-party inspection company to look over the documents that the supplier sent you.\n \n\nDo not engage with a supplier or product that cannot comply to regulations otherwise your products might be seized by customs or even have to be withdrawn from the market if an authority finds out you do not comply with regulations.\n\n \nIf a supplier tells you he doesnât have the necessary certification and âits ok his other customers also donât need itâ stay away or be prepared to invest a couple hundred US$ for a certification (FCC or CE usually goes from 400-600US$).\n\n\nYes, it is sometimes a grey area, especially in the US if you ship things by Air directly to Amazon for example that you do not get caught, but I do not recommend going this way.\n\n\nIf a supplier doesnât have a certificate or is unwilling to invest in it move on to the next supplier. However if you are willing to invest yourself in the certification (make sure to ask the supplier if the product can pass first) I would recommend to do so. Furthermore if you invest into a certificate you will be the holder of the certificate and the supplier is not allowed to sell the product with certification to anyone else but you. This applies to all certifications.\n\n**Inspections**\n\nI canât stress enough how important inspections are, especially with electronics. You will want your goods to be inspected to avoid a high rate of returns,defects or not compliant manufactured products. Pre-Shipment inspections can save you a lot of troubles and are well worth the investment. The inspectors will not only test the product but they will also make sure that all is compliant with laws and regulations.\n\n**Product Liability Insurance**\n\nI also recommend once you import electronics in larger quantities that you contact your local insurance company and have a product liability insurance on your products. This is to protect yourself from any unforseeable issues.\nEven you may have manufactured a product to the best of your knowledge something can go wrong or someone mishandled the product but you may not proof it. For example a few years ago I worked for this large German retailer and we had a fan heater manufactured to all possible standards and regulations.\n\n\nOne day a customer hired a lawyer and sent a letter to the retailer explaining his house has burnt down because of the fan heater he bought from them and he is looking for compensation and a full law suit. Since the fan heater was manufactured in China and sourced trough the buying office I worked for I was put in charge of the situation. When I heard of the problem the first step was obviously to speak to the supplier, check the certificates and look at the Inspection. All was in order, the said unit was manufactured at the highest standards and we suspected that the customer covered the fan heater with a towel and thats why the unit started burning.\n\n\nHowever we couldnât proof that and the client won the lawsuit. The retailer had coverage from his product liability insurance and at least the financial damage was settled. The bigger damage was obviously the public problem they had but at least the financial issue was off the table.\n\n**Summary**\n\nSo what do you actually need for sure? Thats difficult to say as it depends on the product and ideally you will want the supplier to provide you all of the above. But realistically that never happens. In most cases suppliers do not even have CE certification which is actually easily obtainable. I can only recommend to have a supplier who has the minimum requirements such as FCC and CE certification.\n\n\nRoHS is also easily obtainable these days and if a supplier doesnât even have a self-declaration or certification for incoming raw materials look elsewhere. Unfortunately each product has different regulations however above general guidelines give you an idea what to look for. Also there is no website that tells you exactly what you need for which market (Business Idea??? :) ) and all is done trough research or ideally you speak with your third-party inspection company. In most cases they will charge you for giving out this information but if you work with them for a while already they might do you a favour and give you the information for free.\n\nIf you are interested in starting with electronics but not sure where to start simply message me or comment on this post and I will try to help wherever I can. [The original post can be found here on my blog](http://importdojo.com/a-beginners-guide-to-importing-electronics-from-china/). \n\nAll the best and happy sourcing :)\n\n","name":"t3_3v43nz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-02 08:12:59","week":49}

{"id":"3v5ef0","author":"jbkilluh","body":"Sorry, i know that we strive to somewhat avoid reoccurring datapoint threads on approvals and denials, and its one of the main reasons we started the Approval/Denial MegaThread (which i've added my datapoint to of course), So if this thread needs closing or moving or combining, i totally understand. BUT based on some of the more recent threads speaking about looong difficult calls and multiple denials with no hope of seeing the light of approval for the Ink+, i wanted to share the experience i had today to help show approvals are always possible if you play your cards right - however unlikely an approval might be.\n\nSome Background/TLDR:  \n\n* Chase Ink+ is my 16th Card **and** Approval since Mid-February 2015. This is my first Business Card.  \n\n* Currently (aside from the above Ink+) I have 4 Personal Chase Cards w/ a total CL of just over $31k  \n\n* Applied for the Ink+ Early November during an AoR along with 2 AMEX, and 1 Citi Card (all approved).  \n\n* Received Letter of Denial (did not call after pending screen) last night - nearing 30 days after I app'd.  \n\n* Called Recon this morning - Approved for $5k CL after 10min on the phone.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nIf you're interested in the details and how it went down, the story is below. I tried to keep it as abbreviated as possible, but I'm really horrible at keeping stories short.... \n\n\nSo per the above bullets, I applied for the Ink+ During an AoR in early November along with 2 AMEX Cards and 1 Citi Card - all approved. App'd for the Ink+ first and got the expected pending screen, then went after the others. Did not call based on fairly common results of approval when not doing so. After a couple weeks I figured denial was inevitable being that it would be my 16th card in 9 months. As expected, I got the denial letter last night. Reasons for denial included; pretty much the worst offenders - giving most people little hope of a successful recon call.  \n\n* Too many recent requests for credit or reviews of your credit *(15 new accounts total with 11 inquires on EX, 16/12 counting the Ink+)*  \n\n* Not enough time passed since last account w/ Chase opened *(CSP and Hyatt opened May 2015. BA Opened March 2015)*  \n\n* Insufficient Business Credit info on File  \n\n* Already have the max amount of credit Chase can offer.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nIt all went down pretty smoothly though.. I called bright and early at 5:45am PST and was cheerful with the rep right off the bat. I spoke with him like i would speak to a prospective employer during an interview - Playful, Chatty, Honest, Calm/Relaxed.  \n\n\nFirst question was of course, why so many new accounts this year. I replied honestly (albeit withholding the complete story) and said that i had had horrible credit up until February of this year and since then have become much more financially responsible and turned it around for the better. I received a lot of offers in the mail for new cards and opened the ones that seemed good to figure out which best matched my spending patterns. I made a point to say i applied for the Ink+ in order to get a jump on the new year and separate my personal spending from my business spending - furthering my financial success. plain and simple.  \n\n\n2nd question was about my business income/expenses. I told him that since mid-august I've made ~$4k in revenue to date, ~$2.5k of which was profit. I projected next years numbers to hold steady and estimated about $14k-18k revenue, and simply said i expect my profit to follow the same trend (i didn't give a specific number). He asked what i did and I told him buying and reselling. He asked for more specifics like what i buy, where i buy, and where i sell. I told him I sell mainly on eBay but have tried Amazon and of course CraigsList. That i buy from Yard Sales, Swap Meets, Goodwill, &amp; even Electronics Stores when i come across good deals like open box items - which i took the time to use and tell an interesting story of a recent great deal i found at Best Buy. All of this was true.  \n\n\nLastly he just ran over the details with me of my current full time job, position/title, length of employment, salary, and address - all typical stuff and we breifly talked off-hand about the company i work for since they've been in the news recently.\n\n\nAfter that he asked to put me on hold and came back a minute later with good news that he was able to open the line with a $5k CL and i would receive the card and welcome packet within the next week.  \n\n-----  \n\n\nAll in all it was painless and for the most part, effortless. The whole time I had been ready but never ended up needing to pull out the fact that they've been my main bank for about 8 years now ever since i opened my first personal account and credit card, and that i had hoped to do the same for my business accounts since they've continued to be great.  \n\nI'm more than happy to answer any specifics or questions if it ends up helping anyone get approved too!","name":"t3_3v5ef0","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-12-02 16:10:13","week":49}
{"id":"3v5fdn","author":"MB_Heytred","body":"Hey /r/beermoney,\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOwner of [CacheRewards](http://cacherewards.me) here. I wanted to let you know about the site and what we offer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCacheRewards is a reward site that is going into a closed beta period (more on that in a bit). As of right now these are some of the opportunities we offer:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* **Offer Walls**: SuperRewards, Adscend Media, OfferToro, and Persona.ly among others.\n* **Surveys**: SaySoForGood, GiveUsYour2Cents, Samplicious, Univox, and Your Surveys.\n* **Weekly Contests**: Referrals &amp; Offer Walls.\n* **CacheCard**: Visually similar to a game of bingo, the CacheCard has daily goals on the square tiles and gives out bonuses for completing 5-in-a-row or blackout.\n* **Advertising**: Easily advertise a 160x320 banner for your website using PayPal or points earned on CacheRewards to purchase advertising time. Other opportunities for advertising include running your own **CPA** (Cost Per Action)/**GPT** (Get Paid To)/**PTSU** (Paid To Sign Up) campaign which, again, you can pay for by using what you've earned on CacheRewards or by PayPal.\n* **Referrals**: Earn 10% of your referrals' points that they earn from CPA/GPT/PTSU offers and from all offer walls.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe plan on adding more in the near future. If you have any ideas or requests, head over to our [forums](http://cacherewards.me/forum/) and let us know more about your idea.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Closed Beta**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlright, so here is some information on the closed beta that was mentioned earlier.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* As of right now we are accepting users from the following countries: **USA**, **Canada**, **UK**, and **Australia**. This is because most of our advertisers only have offers for these countries. We are working towards expanding our offers to have a global reach.\n* **If you sign up, you must be willing to take part in the closed beta and report any bugs or errors found**.\n* During the closed beta period you will be able to earn and complete offers just like normal.\n* **To sign up**, simply register on the site and you will receive an email saying you have signed up to be in the closed beta.\n* We will slowly ramp up the amount of users in the closed beta. If invited, you will receive an email stating you have been accepted and that you can immediately login.\n* You can still refer people to CacheRewards during the closed beta. Even if they aren't accepted into the closed beta, they will still be your referral when CacheRewards is officially launched.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs compensation, and thanks, for those who are involved in the closed beta, their accounts will be considered **VIP** and will earn 10% more from what they earn (the 10% will not be applied to referral earnings) **for life**. If you sign up but aren't selected to be in the closed beta, thank you for willing to be a part of the closed beta but unfortunately you won't receive a **VIP** account.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs far as **cash out options**, we have gift cards from: **Amazon** (if you need Amazon from somewhere beside the USA let us know through a ticket), **Target**, **GameStop**, **iTunes**, **eBay**, **Playstation Store**, and **Xbox Live**. If you have a request for different types of cash out options, let us know in our [forums](http://cacherewards.me/forum/).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you have questions on what you can and cannot do, visit our [FAQ](http://cacherewards.me/view.aspx?s=faq) and [ToS](http://cacherewards.me/view.aspx?s=tos) pages.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**A few more pieces of info which are important.** \n\n* If you are planning on having multiple people in your household join CacheRewards, let us know at support@cacherewards.me so we can make the process smoother. \n* You cannot refer those in the same household as you. \n* We will complete ID checks for multiple accounts in one household.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor the best experience use a desktop/laptop to access the site.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you have any questions that weren't answered above, feel free to ask.","name":"t3_3v5fdn","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-12-02 16:17:20","week":49}

I wont be utilizing FBA at this moment (since i trade small phone accessories). When i've tried to register for the online account on the .gov site it asked me for a national insurance number, but i'm a bit stuck on how to proceed with it. \n\nIs there any roadblocks i should expect? and anyone that tried this know how long it has taken? \n\nThanks for any help or advice. \n\nJosh","name":"t3_3v8gdy","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-03 04:29:16","week":49}

They report to Robert Kyncl, another Netflix veteran who is now YouTubeâs chief business officer.\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/article_email/youtube-seeks-streaming-right-to-tv-shows-movies-1449104356-lMyQjAxMTA1MjAyMzMwMjMyWj","name":"t3_3v9o3i","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-03 12:09:46","week":49}
{"id":"3v9y7k","author":"EranF","body":"Mobile shopping is huge, which we discussed in an earlier blog post. But as it turns out, it is much bigger than previously thought, and it is continuing to grow with every passing day.\n\nMobile sales, reported by the 500 leading mobile commerce sites, are expected to reach $155 billion by the end of 2015. And by 2016, global ecommerce will reach $1,321.4 TRILLION (thatâs 12 zeroes). Thatâs a staggering increase of 67 % in just five years.\n\nThis astronomical figure exceeds the combined 2012 GDPs of Indonesia ($874.04 BN); Turkey ($789.26 BN) the Netherlands ($772.23 BN) and Switzerland ($632.2 BN) by more than 430 times!\n\nThe figures reflect the viral nature of online and mobile purchasing, and the fact that transactions can be done quicker, easier, more efficiently, and just as safely through digital methods. Consumers want instant gratification and results, so itâs pretty clear that shoppers prefer the convenience and speed of digital purchasing as opposed to physically going to a store and waiting in line.\n\nIn the UK, 59% of shoppers refuse to wait in a line\n32% would rather buy online if faced with a line\n18% would go to another store if the one they originally went to had a long line\nEvery year, lines resulted in $20.65 million of MISSED sales. Dramatically reducing lines therefore tops the list of retail action items.\n\nThe Growth of Mobile:\n\nOf all consumers, 21% are now M-Shoppers (mobile-assisted shoppers).\n\nIt is predicted that by 2017, there will be 9 billion mobile devices in circulation, and by 2018 nearly half of all ecommerce will be from mobile sales.\n\nMobile now accounts for 15-20% of eBay sales. Contactless payments enable consumers to make purchases using Amazon, Starbucks, PayPal and more. The use of mobile wallets is attributed to 74% convenience, 63% to time saving, and 58% to ease of use.\n\nFurther proof of the enormity of the mobile shopping scene emerged from a survey conducted by mobile loyalty company, SessionM, which recently surveyed 12,000 randomly selected US smartphone users about their mobile shopping behaviors. They found that 85% of respondents said their m-commerce buying was steady or had increased versus a year ago.\n\nMore than 90% of respondents said they had made a retail purchase in the past 90 days. While 73% of them had made those purchases in a physical store, an overwhelming majority said they used their smartphones in the store while shopping. The top activities on smartphones while shopping physically in a store were the following:\n\nPrice comparisons\nLooking up product information\nChecking reviews online\nSeeking coupons or deals\nDeals and loyalty programs are two reasons for shoppers to download a retailer app, which can then get them to opt-in to notifications. The availability of mobile payment systems is another reason.\n\nRetailers must also see in-store smartphone usage as an extension of the traditional retail experience and adapt their apps mobile sites to take leverage mobile shopper behavior, in addition to focusing on those who perform the entire purchase process from their mobile devices.\n\nWith all this evidence and these mind-bending numbers, itâs clear that the mobile retail shopping trend bigger than imagined!\n\nby Kate Gathii\n\nOriginally posted on the 3G DirectPay Blog:  http://www.3gdirectpay.com/blog/mobile-shopping-is-bigger-than-we-think/ on Nov.3, 2015","name":"t3_3v9y7k","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-12-03 14:08:16","week":49}

{"id":"3vffzy","author":"teho22","body":"#What is the /r/Entrepreneur low cost business startup weekend?\nThis post is follow up from [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3v55gy/rentrepreneur_low_cost_business_startup_weekend/) and will be used to form the teams for the /r/entrepreneur low cost business start-up weekend. The idea is to group up likeminded, entrepreneurial people and give them a chance to create something using a small budget of $10 per team member. This is a great way gain some experience in starting a business and allow you to network with other entrepreneurs.  Please donât hesitate to get involved or be discouraged to message people to join their groups, everyone is here to learn.\n\n\nThe $10 per member you will use to create your teamâs money pool to use on the expenditures of your business start-up such as web hosting, domains, advertising and stock. It is completely up you to decide what you do with the money and if you will decide to pool it together or have each member buy things separately. Hopefully the $10 investment will also weed out the people that would join groups then never come online again.\n\n\n#Protect your investment\n\n\nWhile this is capped at $10 investment per member to ensure that is a low risk investment, it would still be sad to see anyone get ripped off. Try to establish trust between your group members. A couple of examples of ways you could do this is to share Facebook details or have funds pooled on someoneâs account Paypal account that is somehow able to prove they are trustworthy. It should go without saying that you should be cautious of someone posted from a 1 day old reddit account. **Using bank transfers and Western Union is always ill advised as it is hard to recover stolen funds**. Please remember that it is entirely up to you to protect yourself and **I, /r/entrepreneur nor reddit take any responsibility for your losses**.\n\n\nThis is a great opportunity for us all to learn but it requires everyone to pull their weight and not abandon their team at the first hurdle. The project may not go as smoothly as planned but please try to at least see it through until the end and donât let your teammates down. Remember that you learn more from failure than you do success so you will just be better prepared for next time.\n\n\nWith that being said, we can get down to business. \n\n#So you want to start a team\n\nIf have an idea that you are dead set to work on you are probably better starting your own team than joining one but that does not mean having an idea is a requirement of starting a group. As a team leader it is your duty to choose the members that will make up your team. You are required to give a short pitch in order to attract people into joining your group. More information on some things you might consider discussing in this pitch can be found in the template that follows. \n\n\nPeople interested in joining are free to ask you questions as a reply to your post and you should be willing to answer them until your team is formed. **ONCE YOUR TEAM IS FORMED EVERYTHING ELSE IS UP TO YOU**. Please edit the first line of your post to state that your team is now full or delete it entirely. The next time the rest of us want to hear back from you is on Sunday where you have something to show and give a short report about your experience. \n\n\n What you do with your business after the weekend is completely up to you and your team.\n\n##Leader template\n\n&gt; \n&gt; **Team/company name**: *Donât worry too much about this as you can come up with one as a team later*\n&gt; \n&gt; **A short pitch**: *What are your motivations for starting the group? Do you have an idea that you want to work on? Are you looking to take control and assign people to tasks, facilitate the teamâs conversation or simply just find the people to form a team and then stand back to be an equal member? Have you decided upon a method of communication amongst the group? Will you be controlling the teamâs funds?  How many people are you looking to join your group? Will decisions be made democratically? You must let people know if everyone will be entering as equal partners or not. The questions are just some guidelines, donât solely answer them. If youâre not motivated enough to spend some time to write a good pitch, donât be surprised if people arenât interested in joining you.*\n\n##Looking to join a group post template\n\n\n\n&gt; **Skill set**: *Donât underestimate your abilities. Example skills: writing, sales, web design, research, languages, graphic design, marketing, social media. Give some thought about what you can bring to the table, you never know what niche skills people are looking for!*\n\n&gt; **Timezone GMT (+/-)**: *Refrain from writing PST etc as it is not immediately understandable to people outside of America.* \n\n&gt; **Availability**: Be realistic about how much time you can put towards your project between now and Sunday. \n\n&gt; **Additional information**: Anything else you would like to add\n\nOnce you have found a group please edit your post to clearly show that you are no longer looking for a group to join or delete it entirely. \n\n\nOne short example of how a group could form:\n\n&gt; âIâm Mr Thompson, an experienced web developer that believes there is a large market of mom and pop stores that would be willing to pay hundreds for a single page brochure Wordpress website. I could produce these in only a couple of hours but I lack the ability to sell so I am looking for someone with experience in sales. Also, while I have no problem making the website itself, writing isnât my strength so I am looking for someone to produce the written content required for these websites. My time zone is GMT + 6. Our pool will go towards web hosting, a domain and some Skype credit. We will do all of our communication in a Skype group chat. Any questions?â\n\n&gt; &gt;  âIâm Mr Smith and have 5 years sales experience and am confident to cold call but how will we get the details of these stores?â\n \n\n&gt; &gt;\tâIâm Mr Hank, an unemployed English major who would be happy to write content as long as Iâm getting $20 per 500 words.â\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\tâHey guys Iâm Jimmy and donât have any notable skills but a lot of free time. Iâm happy to find businesses that donât have an online presence for you but I would also expect a cut of the commission. â\n\nHere every role is clearly defined which wonât always be the case. You might just start a team by simply getting 5 random people and seeing what ideas you come up with and working on one over the weekend. It's all up to you, choose your own adventure.\n\nSome ideas of projects that should be easy make to reasonable standard over the course of a weekend:\n\n- T-shirt selling business\n- Amazon affiliate website\n* E-commerce (create website and business plan. Stock your goods after the weekend)\n* Subscription box\n* Youtube channel\n* Graphic design service\n* Custom PC building service\n* Drop shipping website\n* Online tutoring\n* Outsourcing any service\n* Virtual assistant service\n\n\nI donât expect there will be a shortage of ideas so I wonât go on but these are some common ideas I see on reddit that I think will work.\n\n# Resources:\n\n**[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com)** â One option is to create a business account and pool your money on there. I believe you dispute payments quite easily on Paypal which will provide you with some protection. Iâm not entirely sure though and you will be limited on what you can spend your money on so don't just take my word for it, do your homework.\n\n[**Shopify - How We Built an Ecommerce Business from Scratch and Generated $922.16 in Revenue in 3 Days**](https://www.shopify.co.uk/blog/34526469-how-we-built-an-ecommerce-business-from-scratch-and-generated-922-16-in-revenue-in-3-days)\n\n[**Google start up weekend**](http://startupweekend.org/) - Google host their own startup weekends, you might be able to learn something from here\n\n[**Some free Wordpress themes**](http://wpthememag.com/2015/free-wordpress-themes-2015/)\n\n[**Slack**](http://www.slack.com) - a team collaboration tool.\n\n[**Skype**](http://www.skype.com) - cheap calls around the world and easy to use group conversations.\n\n[**Top /r/Entrepreneur/ posts of all time**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) a lot of good detailed threads written by people have had success with their start-ups.\n\n[**Namecheap**](http://www.namecheap.com) - the most commonly recommended domain registrar.\n\n[**Google.com**](http://www.google.com) â the most important tool in your toolbox, donât forget it.\n\n[**Reddit thread on how people have made some money on the side**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tpnsy/how_do_you_make_money_on_the_side/) loads of good business ideas.\n\n**[teespring](http://www.teespring.com)** - cheaply allows you to start t-shirts without the need to stock anything.\n\n**[Printful](https://www.theprintful.com/)** - another drop shopping styled website that allows you to design and sale goods without ever having to deal with stocking or shipping.\n\n**[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)** - create online shop. 14 free trial.\n\n**[Shopify drop shipping guide](https://www.shopify.com/guides/dropshipping)** \n\n\n\nIf you have any other resources that you think would be helpful then let me know and I will edit them in. \n\nI won't participate this week but will stick around if there are any questions.

{"id":"3vfoc4","author":"rollmyheartup","body":"I've been using Instagc for a few months but have only ever redeemed for Amazon gift cards. I've got enough points built up right now for the minimum on a lot of streaming services, though, but I'm curious about how that works, for anyone who's familiar.\n\nWith Spotify, the redeemable amounts are $10 and $30, but I've heard that with standard $10/$30 gift cards, that's generally code for 1 month/3 months of standard premium service (i.e. I know people on student/family plans are unhappy not being able to redeem the dollar amount for extra months). If I redeem a $10 Spotify card on Instagc, will that get me one month of premium, or will I be ~80cents short because of sales tax? (I'm currently hitting the end of my one-month Spotify trial, so I don't have past receipts to refer back to, and I don't want to pay to re-up it right now unless this gift card would fully cover it.)","name":"t3_3vfoc4","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-12-04 18:03:29","week":49}

{"id":"3vgij6","author":"indigopurplekow","body":"Hello r/personalfinance, I currently use two credit cards for my everyday purchases, a Chase Freedom card for primary use and a Target red card for Target purchases. I opened my Chase card in mid August and my Target card about a month after. I make all my payments on time and never spend more than I have. I bike to work so gas payments are very minimal and I save a bit on groceries at the moment because my parents insist I share their joint Costco AMEX card (thanks mom/dad). \n\n\nI've been taking advantage of Chase's rotating categories so most of my purchases so far have been through Amazon, but I also like to shop there as it is convenient. \n\nHere are some of the options I was looking at:\nAmazon Visa - 3% from Amazon and $50 bonus. Awesome, Amazon is convenient for me to shop through. \n\n\nCiti Double Cash and Fidelity AMEX - 2% cashback for general everyday purchases. However, I'm weighing how long it would take me to spend $20k vs the immediate bonus of a Capital One card for instance. I'll break down my spending patterns below. \n\n\nDiscover IT - 5% rotating, but it seems to match Chase's categories as well. Has an insane cashback percentage through end of the year with Apple Pay though? \n\n\nCapital One Quiksilver - 1.5% cashback and $100 sign up bonus seems great as well as no foreign transactions (not sure if I'll be taking that trip though) \n\n\nSally Mae UPromise - what's the difference between this and the Barclays that everyone talks about? The Barclays was very interesting to me with the Amazon cashback but it seems this is discontinued and the UPromise is not as good. But I was reading the rewards and it honestly looks similar? \n\n\nAMEX Blue Cash Everyday - $150 sign up bonus right now and some decent cashback rates. Not seeing what the drawback would be here. \n\n\nAARP Credit Card - $100 sign up bonus, decent categories for cashback. \n\n\nVisa Signature by TruWest - $100 sign up bonus and 1.5% back on everything, mirrors the Capital One Quiksilver without the no foreign transactions fees? So Capital One would have more utility? \n\n\nDid a lot of searching on Reddit and NerdWallet to come through to this list, but I think my top considerations would be Amazon, Capital One, Citi, or Discover. Sallie Mae UPromise would be my choice, but it's different now? The others seem to be outweighed by others in the list unless I was missing something. \n\n\nSome of my spending patterns since beginning of September. A lot of dining purchases involved me fronting the bill and being paid in cash, but this would also be cashback for me. \n\n\nAmazon purchases - $450\n\n\nClothes (including gifts) - $860\n\n\nEating out - $1200\n\n\nFast Food (not a subset of eating out, I categorized this the best I could from sit down restaurants)- $300\n\n\nGroceries - $475\n\n\nThanks anyone for their input.

{"id":"3vkro9","author":"SuiteFreak","body":"Before ANYONE buys from Bulq.com, BUYER BEWARE. I just bought a pallet that cost me $1600 from Bulq.com. It was a Brand New pallet of toys. More than 42% were NOT sellable as new because they arrived in HORRIFIC condition - smashed in, OPENED BOXES that were torn and re-taped (THAT'S NOT NEW!), and almost ALL of the items were Amazon Warehouse Returns! Newsflash: In the liquidation Business, if it is a RETURN, then IT IS NOT NEW! I posted pics and my review in several Facebook groups. If you're thinking of buying liquidation pallets, you might want to consider joining this group of knowledgable people who share info on EXACTLY that: Liquidation. Lots of good info, and honest feedback. This will force the charlatans like Bulq.com to either up their game or go out of business! After I posted my review, several people commented on pallets they received in similar condition. BTW Their \"Guarantee\" is WORTHLESS!! They don't guarantee squat! They offered me a measly $200 in return for the unacceptable condition of this pallet (which really was a BAIT AND SWITCH). $200 barely covers the cost of shipping the pallet to me, and certainly doesn't even BEGIN to cover the financial damage I am enduring as a result of their bad business practices! Here's the link to the review. https://www.facebook.com/groups/productsourcing101/permalink/1667795083488345/ \nThe admin will have to approve you before you can read it, but trust me, the admin has spent YEARS in the liquidation business, and his sole goal is to help buyers and sellers of pallets and FIX what is wrong in the industry. Starting with HORRIBLE companies like Bulq.com.\nCompanies like Bulq and Optoro (Their parent company) need to go down. It is unacceptable for them to treat customers like this, and they give a bad name to every legitimate liquidation company out there! They say they stand behind their products and have a guarantee. They say on their website that their pallets are 98% accurate and if it's not, they will refund the difference! BUT They DON'T! It is a clever play on words that they use when they say they will refund the difference. What they mean is, like in my case, Ben said they will refund the difference in price from the items I purchased as NEW to as if I purchased Like New. And I told him, these are NOT EVEN CLOSE to being lIke new! When a box is smashed to hell, and re-taped closed, that is NOT Like New! That's a RETURN!!! I wouldn't even donate this stuff to charity, that's how horrible the condition is! I would be embarrassed! Nothing screams I got this at a discount, or I am re-gifting you with a used Returned item, more than packages in the conditions I described above. And if you are sourcing for Amazon or eBay, BUYER BEWARE because if what you sell from them is NOT Brand New, and you advertise it as such, you could LOSE your seller account! Is saving (Or in my case, LOSING) a few bucks worth that? No Way!\nHere is the link to my Ripoff report. If you have been burned by Bulq, or know someone who has been burned by Bulq, PLEASE go comment and share your story. I am fairly certain they'll come at me with both guns blazing and lie, cheat or steal to cover up their horrible business practices. Companies like this will only go away when people start shining a bright, burning hot spotlight on their horrid behavior and business practices! http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Bulqcom/Lanham-Maryland-20706/Bulqcom-Bulq-Liquidation-Optoro-optorocom-Bait-Switch-Sold-me-a-Brand-New-Pallet-1272192","name":"t3_3vkro9","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-05 21:07:16","week":49}

{"id":"cxj4lyd","author":"BizBuildr","body":"First off, there's really no need for the secrecy(or at least to make a huge deal out of it). No one is going to steal your friends qualifications, etc. Although I wouldn't share the website. \n\nI built and sold a 7 figure consulting practice from nothing. First off, I would find out what his customers want. That's the first thing you should do, do some customer development work(look on Amazon for books from Mike Fishbein, Steve Blank, etc). \n\nGenerally speaking ads aren't really going to be a huge revenue stream, maybe a couple hundred dollars a month. Compared to charging a couple hundred dollars an hour for consulting work, it's really beans. \n\nI'd try a couple of different things. \n\n1. I'd play with the price elasticity. Just because you charge $50/hr doesn't mean your clients wouldn't happily pay $100/hr. You don't know until you test. \n\n2. I would work on milking my herd more effectively. If you have 30 regular customers, are they buying as often and as much as they really need? How can you educate them? What can you upsell, cross-sell, down sell to them? (Kind of in-line with your drop shipping idea). \n\n3. Are you maximizing referrals? How many referrals from your customers do you get, and do you have a system in place to generate more referrals? \n\n4. Is it a one man shop, how can you do more work, and pay someone else to handle some of the grunt work. Here's an example: I owned a house painting business. I bought it for beans. When I looked at the way the business worked, it was a two man show. Roughly 3.5 hours were spent on prep work for every 1 hour that the sprayer was running. But the sprayer was what made money. So I totally revolutionized the way it worked. I took this two man business, and made it a eight man business. 3 teams of 2 guys for prep-work, and a 2 man team that ran the sprayer. If the sprayer is what makes you money, you can NEVER let it go idle.  So instead of doing one job a week or two, we started to do 6-8 jobs a week. Now, here's the important thing in this story. The guy who runs the sprayer is the only one with a ton of experience and he makes the most money, the prep guys are replaceable and low wages. The business went from making around $20k net on $60k gross, to about a million gross and $300k net in 18 months. So as a consultant you are constrained by your hourly rate, if you make $50/hr then that's about all you can make. But oftentimes there are other tasks(prep work) that you can hire out and leverage to make your job easier and better. If let's say even 20% of your work can be hired out, then that frees up 20% of your time for billable hours. And let's face it, it's a lot more fun to charge $50/hr for work that you're paying $10/hr for and doing nothing on than $50/hr for work you're doing yourself. \n\n\nNow I know that this isn't really what you were asking for, you were asking for how to help your buddy expand his business. From experience as a consultant I'm not sure you're looking in the right places. But you won't know until you ask your customers what THEY want and are willing to pay for.

{"id":"cxj7eer","author":"Sapphoof","body":"Essentially, Amazon has an army working for less than minimum wage scouring every marketplace for things that will be shipped to them for free, already processed to be entered into their already massive automated warehouse system. You have to also break up your merchandise into multiple mini shipments that greatly increase the cost of shipping on your end. Granted, Amazon will ship it out once(if) it sells using their discounted shipping rates. All the liability, the risk of investment, hours of research and shipment prep, and the costs are yours. And if it doesn't sell they charge you. But if it does, they'll take 30% after having nothing invested in it. They win either way and take more profits than you're making after factoring in the initial investment and shipping.\n\nAnd then on top of that you'll keep racking up mysterious fees. If you call and ask they'll immediately remove them, but it doesn't seem like an honest business practice. In my 2 months with FBA, they tried to rack up 70 dollars in fees for the 100 dollars of merchandise I ended up selling.\n\nI don't want to work for Amazon. I feel like eBay gives you back what you put into it, and you're working for yourself. \n\n\n","name":"t1_cxj7eer","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-01 17:06:13","week":49}

Around the holidays they offer exclusive discounts to prime members as well as additional deals and discounts and exclusive access to products and services.\n\nIs it worth it as a customer?  I don't know, you really have to gauge your market (and Reddit is likely not your market so I doubt anyone can give you a real answer).  You make a VIP program intriguing to your customers, you need to offer them a value that is greater than their investment.  Going back to Amazon Prime, in the US, we pay $99/year.  What we get is free 2 day shipping on many products, free same day shipping on some select products, access to free music and video downloads/streaming, free photo storage and free access to digital books. So far in 2015, I placed almost 90 orders with Amazon, assuming a very low $5 for shipping, the $99 fee saved me over $400, and that does not include all the videos and songs that I have watched/listened to.  If you assume $10 or more for shipping (I have ordered several large and heavy items), my savings is closer to $1000.  The ability to pre-order and access to limited editions may not be enough to entice them...while I love Amazon Prime, I resisted for many years because I did not see the value in it.  You customers will face the same challenge with your VIP Access.\n\nPerhaps you could offer a concierge type of service http://www.ibtimes.com/fashion-clubs-men-affordable-online-concierge-services-do-shopping-you-1591514  where you have access to a personalized stylist who gets to know you and your personality/clothing preference and they help pick out clothes/outfits/accessories for you, or  access to more personalized customer service.","name":"t1_cxjmvdt","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-12-01 23:05:33","week":49}

Most department stores will run sales on them this time of year, and you can find hem on Amazon. Buy one for $10-20, toss everything in, let it cook for however many hours the recipe says. It's impossible to screw up. You can make chicken, pulled pork, beef stew, etc. really easily. There's usually no risk of under or overcoming, as long as you take the pot off within an hour of the recommended time. \n\nIf you still want to try the stove top method, begin with chicken breast or fish. Choose filets of even thickness for fish, and puns he breasts to an even thickness for chicken. Salt and pepper both sides. When I started cooking those, I'd put a sautÃ© pan over medium heat, and pour in some oil. Once the oil is hot put in your meat. Watch as it cooks for a few minutes, until it looks opaque about half way through. Then gently slide a spatula under, and flip it. Cook for he same amount of time on the other side, until totally opaque. Don't lift up your meat a ton, but watch the edges at the very end to make sure the underside is getting golden brown but never black or charred. Take it off the heat, and slice in. If the meat is undercooked, just put it back over medium heat for about 60 seconds per side. Repeat until the meat is done but not overcooked. \n\nThe key is just to watch carefully-- recipe times aren't always accurate. If you focus on cooking meat properly the first few times, and give it 100% of your attention for the 20 mins you're cooking it, it will turn out well!","name":"t1_cxk106m","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-12-02 05:15:26","week":49}

There is an active community in the forums where people run ideas past each other, which can be helpful for learning. I used to read these forums often, but I've gotten lazy over the past few years and haven't tried very hard to replicate their research.\n\nThey definitely have a different investing philosophy than most places. In short, they take a very long-term outlook and aren't very concerned with valuation. They're concerned with finding the greatest companies of our time and holding their shares through thick and thin. One of their favorite examples is how David Gardner has held (and recommended buying) Amazon (AMZN) consistently since 1997, even through the dot com crash in 2000-2001 and despite it's sky high valuation for the past decade. \n\nThey like to think they're unique, but it's pretty much just long-term [momentum investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing). They advocate that you \"let your winners run\" and sell your losers. This philosophy can also bite them in the ass for their losers. When they do recommend selling a stock, it's usually long too late. For example, they also recommended buying Westport (WPRT) back in February 2011. These shares are down 86% since then, over a time period when the S&amp;P 500 is up 73%, meaning it's losing to the S&amp;P 500 by 159%. They still haven't said to sell, but rather recommend to \"hold\" it. \n\nI've found the biggest challenge with Stock Advisor is figuring out what to sell and when, because by the time they say to sell, it's too late to realize any gains.","name":"t1_cxkeefs","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-02 15:52:41","week":49}

Turns out it had subpar nickel metal hydride batteries prone to going bad in a short amount of time. It was probably just a few months and it would run for like 10-15 seconds before you could hear it slowing down. In hindsight, it may also have been due to over-charging? Either way, replacement makes more sense than buying a new NiMH battery pack.\n\n...but did I really NEED a new one?

Ebay/paypal does the same thing. Ever heard of a mall? Ever see a mall company such as Westfield actually sell something? No, they created a space where retailers and consumers come together. Ever heard of a barber shop or a nail salon? Guess what, most of the people that work there are independent, \"pseudo employees\" that pay the shop a fee to rent a chair to provide a service. The shop is facilitating a market, bringing service providers and consumers together under one roof. Do you have an Apple/Android device? Ever bought an app? Was that app created by Apple/Google? Probably not, but they did what Lyft/Uber did, create a market where consumers/buyers and makers/sellers come together under one \"roof\" to facilitate transactions and to make a market happen.\n\nLyft/Uber didn't \"validate\" their business model (what ever is meant by validate).

Per Blackguardly---access to the coveted Amazon box is unlocked through ratings. Low ratings can jeopardize you losing seller fee discounts on ebay.  These are just a few that come to mind. The buzz about ratings and how to protect them matter to sellers and to some buyers. Hope this helps.

From the actual distributors, I was asked to provide invoices, and I did. From what I gather is that Amazon wants DVD's sellers who sell a high level, not someone who makes a $200 purchase in DVD's from a \"distributor\" and uses their receipt as an invoice. I believe doing so, actually blacklists you once you are denied. Many people in the ScanPower group on Facebook were recommended to make a $200 MOQ purchase from an online authorized distributor for DVD's, a couple people claimed to have been accepted and more people followed. The main conclusion was that most, if not all, were denied and many people tried to appeal the decision but were denied. Some were even approved, but banned once they  listed and sold a DVD box set with a MSRP over $25.\n\nAmazon seems to be checking references and legitimacy of invoices. \n\nWith you being \"small time\" and new with only 2 months of experience under your belt, I wouldn't recommend trying to sell in the DVD category.

{"id":"cxlba3d","author":"madsci","body":"Really depends on what kind of labels you need.  If it's going on retail shelves you want to get that done right.  I've got some labels designed more for meeting Amazon's warehouse requirements and they're just 4x6 thermal labels with a barcode, description, and logo.  By the time the customer sees it they've already made the purchase, and it's not a thing that needs to look pretty.\n\nI've seen white Uline boxes with inkjet printed half-sheet labels for fairly expensive industrial sensor electronics and they looked OK - not what you'd put on the shelf in a store but passable for an industrial item that you don't want in a plain box.\n\nIf you're talking about labels that are permanently a part of your product,  you definitely don't want to do that at home.  Maverick Label is probably a good place to start.  I've got customized barcoded asset tags from them.\n\nOne of my electronic products has an inset in the case for the label and I use professionally printed and cut labels with Lexan overlays.  I shopped around a lot for those and wound up getting them from a place about a mile from me - B&amp;B Label.  They're wholesale only, so I buy them through the local copy shop.\n\nAnd that brings me to my main piece of advice.  Find a printing and copy place local to you.  Not Kinkos if you have another option - sometimes they've got good people, sometimes they're just OK.  You probably have one that serves local businesses.  Go in and talk to them.  It's their job to help you find a solution, so don't worry if you don't know what exactly you want.\n\nMy local place does minor design work for me cheap or even free if it's just a slight tweak to something.

{"id":"cxlrtbf","author":"jrossetti","body":"Challenge accepted.\n\nOkay, so you can't sell USED clothes, but new clothes, new shoes.  Those things will sell as good or better than Ebay for TONS of different reasons.    \n\nFIrst off is the market.  Ebay shoppers spend less, and for lower price points. You go to Ebay for amazing deals.  The amazon market is just bigger.   Its like selling in NYC vs St Louis.  You can do good at both, but you're probably gonna get better prices and more customers if youre in NYC.  Amazon has 244 MILLION customers with credit cards on file, that's more than double what Ebay has.  And we're not even talking the trust factor.  Simply put, if it can be sold on Amazon, it's almost always going to sell faster, and for a higher price point.  Then further, the difference between MF and FBA is also stark.  Higher prices for FBA sales (generally speaking), way faster sales, and way way way less work than MF.  .\n\nSo I had some shoes I had listed on Ebay for a year.  Got a few bites, but no hits.  Had em for a solid year.  I sold three of my 6 within 30 days of hitting amazon FBA.  THe other 3 are very odd sizes but will be nice when they sell.\n\nTHese were converses, and I got between 39 and 59 for them.  \n\nClothes?  I sold more in clothes my first month of ungating, than I did on ebay for all of the same items over the prior year.  \n\nDownsides?  Ungating can be a pain sometimes.  I got lucky and got in when they were almost automatically approving and didnt have to submit photos.\n\nHowever, it's worth it.  In retrospect, I wish I had ungated sooner. I could have been doing a lot more RA on shoes and clothing because I have sources for both.  \n\nYou also have higher fees, but they are split up two ways.  The first is the referral/sales fee for selling the item. THe second is the fulfillment fee which covers customer service, boxing, wrapping, shipping, insurance, no a to z claims, immune from item not received claims, immune to losses related to any amazon partner shipping carrier (I had an entire shipment worth 800 bucks get reimbursed because UPS lost the box) , and most importantly the postage and time to mail the item.\n\nOn top of that, say you want to keep your ebay listings, just because and someone buys it. You can go into amazon and say hey, this dude at this address just bought this.  And then they will wrap it, pack it, ship it, and it gets the same protections as if you were selling it to an amazon customer.  THis is also a sneaky way to mail christmas packages around.  I make new listings with boxes for each reletive, submit it to FBA, then fulfill it out to them.  Usually save 25-50% depending on how heavy it weighed.  It does take a few extra days, but planning!\n\nUpsides:  You'll get a higher price point, you'll get faster sales, you'll have a LOT MORE FREE TIME as you wont have to fulfill anything.  To really see this benefit, and I am dead serious...devote every single minute you used to send mailing customer items in to sourcing instead.  That's your bread and butter, and you can end up making more money with the same time, even though you're technically making less per item.  \n\nYou won't have to go to the post office, you wont have to handle customer complaints or refunds. You get more time for you, and you should either relax, or build your business more assuming you want to do that.  It depends on your goals.\n\nMy advice?  You get a month free on FBA.  Work on getting those two categories unlocked.  THen when both are unlocked, read up on what you are allowed to send in, and then send in everything you have at once.  Make sure your listings and keywords are set up great for any listings you create, especially if it's repeatable inventory.  Then sit back and wait.  Keep every ad up on both ebay and amazon, and just watch how fast it starts rolling in.  \n\nIve yet to find a single person ive convinced to hit FBA come back and say they were better off not using it.  I can send you at least 3 people, two of which are in this sub someplace.  \n\nYou can also note that no \"i hate FBA and you shouldn't use it\" type post exists in this subreddit.  Anecdotal for sure, but glaring in it's absence in world with many many views.  \n\nLast, if you want to be very very conservative and not do any work I'll do a one time test for you, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS OPTION as you can do all of this yourself, and ultimately you'll need to learn/ungate if you take my advice anyway.  \n\nGive me 10 new items that are already in Amazons catalog and I'll list em.  I'm ungated for both categories already and as long as they are new I can send them in and you can see how long they take to sell.  I would not want any money for this.   You can pay the normal amazon fees and then anything else i'll send back. I'm happy to help someone on their FBA path as a reward.  I love turning you MFers to FBAers.  \n\n","name":"t1_cxlrtbf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-03 17:25:22","week":49}

So you may have one box for all your stuff, or you may have several boxes, depending on where Amazon thinks they need the stock more.  For items that they have large quantities of in stock, they like to keep them spread across the country.  Most of my boxes go to Indiana, but I've also had several shipments where things went to California, Oregon, Jersey, others.\n\nThere is a service you can enable called \"Inventory Placement Service\", which costs around about $0.30 per item shipped in, and it attempts to get you to send in all quantities of individual SKUs to the same place, and then Amazon will separate them and ship them around to the FCs that need them, instead of you doing it.  While it DOES seem to almost always result in shipments of different SKUs all going to the same warehouse, it does not guarantee it.  Generally, if you have IPS turned on, your stuff will go to a single FC that handles distribution to multiple FCs.  It takes longer for your items to be in stock if you do this.  \n\nOnce you do have a shipping list for a particular warehouse, though, yeah, you absolutely can just cram a box full of everything.

{"id":"cxmjjqz","author":"colourofawesome","body":"All those forms of business you mentioned already existed before the internet - taking a cut of service/goods transaction, selling products, collecting consumer data and advertising.\n\nWhat you've pointed out are trends in how people exploit different methods of doing this using the internet, so in that vein I'd guess that the next \"thing\" is going to be an innovative way of spreading a business that essentially already exists.\n\nA couple things I wouldn't be surprised to see:\n\n* New ways of advertising involving brands connecting on a much closer level with customers.  We see this now on Twitter and Facebook to some degree, but considering how much people seem to stick up for smaller brands they really like I could see some clever marketing companies capitalizing on that.  We could see people voluntarily giving their information to an advertising company rather than it being completely behind-the-scenes.\n\n* Large marketplaces like Amazon and eBay consolidating to a smaller number of large sellers, and making the barriers for entry higher, resulting in smaller sellers finding new marketplaces to take advantage of, and the form those marketplaces take could be something completely new and innovative.\n\n* Groups of Apps consolidating into app networks that work together.  We're starting to see this already with things like ToDoist, Evernote, email and calendar apps all syncing together.  I think the degree to which apps work together will only grow.\n\n* One specific business I think will grow like crazy once the technology is there is personal health tracking.  It's already big I know, but consider all the science that's coming out about your personal gut-biome and the implications of there no longer being a \"one size fits all\" concept of health.  I think there's going to be WAY more potential for keeping track of what's going on in your body.  Imagine a Fitbit that can tell you \"You haven't been sleeping well this week.  Here's a juice recipe to fix that.\"  This may be beyond the 5 year point though.\n\n* I think there's going to be a new social networking company that becomes what Facebook started as.  Facebook isn't cool or fun anymore, it's necessary and your grandparents are on it.  It may be something completely different than what we consider social media now, but I have to imagine something that lets you share drunk pictures with only your close friends would do pretty well.\n","name":"t1_cxmjjqz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-04 04:57:39","week":49}

{"id":"cxmmy45","author":"redcards","body":"Okay, lets talk about AMZN and why its a revenue compounding, dubious, unsustainable business model...\n\nFirst, a note on free cash flow. AMZN generated $5.4bn in \"FCF\" TTM, and at the same time net cash on the balance sheet is +$2.bn. The company doesn't pay dividends, nor do the buyback stock (sharecount is +3% YoY), so where is all the free cash going if not to the balance sheet or back to debt/shareholders? Right back out of the Company's (Bezos'?) wallet to fund capital leases. The Company does loosely account for this though, and they've provided an adj. FCF number of $670m. However, once we factor in $2b TTM SBC, and the financing in the amount of $1.3bn/year, we can assume AMZN is actually generating negative FCF on a $28bn invested capital base and $290bn market cap.\n\nI know this board as a hard on for talking about AMZN's P&amp;L, and I am going to spend sometime talking about that, but before we do we have to understand the nature of their capital and financial leases.\n\nToday, AMZN has just under $3bn in capital &amp; financial leases for 2016 on their balance sheet. However, we need to break that number down to determine what % can be capitalized as with server/storage leasing and buildings/land for the rest of the Company's operations. The difference matters because servers and storage leases can be capitalized at 3x or 4x, while buildings and land are higher at 7x or 8x.\n\nSo as recent as 2010, forward lease commitments were $450m. We can assume that this was mostly all non-AWS, and if we double that, given the revenue growth from 2010-2015 at the retail business, we can back out about $1bn in leases for land/buildings and capitalize it at 8x. The other $2bn of leases we'll capitalize at 3x because servers burn out quickly (regardless of what some \"computer experts\" on here will argue). So combined, the debt from leasing that AMZN is carrying is about $14bn. Plus $8bn in financial debt = $22bn in debt. Contrast that against $3bn in net ST assets and $12bn in equity.\n\nOk, now that we've figured that out we can talk about the P&amp;L as we'll be referencing our invested capital base in that discussion.\n\nSpecifically, lets talk about AWS. Quarterly margins were 25%, but lets back out some SBC expense, and even with that you get 15-20% margins which are not bad. This argument is not that AWS is doing a bad job at generating profit. However, consider the capital base necessary to generate those margins - $20bn in net PPE - which is massive. AAPL, which is in manufacturing and does 2x more revenue than AMZN, only has $21bn in PPE. Okay, so lets consider something more \"utility\" like such as Con-Ed (NYSE: ED). ED is on track to generate $13bn revenue and $2.5bn EBIT, 18% margins, with $29bn PPE - sounds a lot like AWS numbers, no? However, ED is only $19bn market cap. Obviously AMZN is growing much faster than ED, so lets consider another example using the largest US utility by market cap - Duke Energy, (NYSE: DUK), $50bn market cap. DUK generates $25bn revenue and $5.5bn in EBIT, about 20-25% margins. Keep in mind, this is with $72bn PPE. The take away here is that $72bn PPE is A LOT of capital!. If AWS were to grow into their $100bn+ valuation, they would need to scale their capital base more efficiently or else AWS is going to have to get a $150bn PPE at some point. Which could be very interesting considering the largest PPE balance in the US is BRK with $140bn.\n\nSo the conclusion. This is not an argument that AWS is not growing its cash flow and profit. This is an argument that AWS's capital base is growing just as quick, probably faster, and not scaling anywhere near the levels most tech companies scale at under those capital inputs. AMZN's invested capital dynamic is more like a utility and less like a tech company.\n\nBut you won't hear anyone on the Street talking about this. They either think its completely irrelevant, or its because capital is practically free right now. Oh well, the ride never ends.\n\nI know Amazon makes up the A of the cool kid FANG stocks, but there is actually very little bite to Amazon's business model once you start breaking it down at a fundamental asset level and scrutinize the growth potential. \n\nTo answer your OP question, people invest in Amazon because the stock has gone from $300 to $600 over the course of one year.

Maybe in 2005 we noticed Facebook specifically, but we've had various social network paradigms going back to early 90s.  In retrospect, in a summary, this stuff gets boiled down to \"Year of Social Network\" but it is meaningless... knowing this is not exploitable.  \n\nHere is my point:  \n\nMost of the trends we watched happen day by day, year by year, and they happened so slowly we hardly noticed...

I want to say it's something Amazon has lobbied for since they have a very big interest in it, but I'm not positive.  The biggest problem with it is that it will likely require the cooperation of all the states and that seems almost impossible.  It might even require a Constitutional amendment - really impossible.\n\nSome states have no sales tax, some low, some very high. Some states have a single sales tax while others have local and regional ones on top of the state tax (Illinois iirc). And, some states have different tax rates on different kinds of items. Of course, as a small seller from one state, knowing what tax to collect for residents of every city in the country, depending on what was purchased is pretty much impossible.  The whole situation is a huge mess and mostly due to the fact that the laws were created before buying online became such a huge part of the economy.\n\nPersonally, I wonder if the states could just tax UPS, Fedex, etc to make up the difference.  The carriers would just pass the costs off to their customers and the net effect would be similar.

{"id":"cxn0kek","author":"redcards","body":"Consider that Amazon is a 20 year old+ business currently - at what point do you start to expect some hard profits from a business that has been operating for over two decades?\n\nAt its core, Amazon is a retail business that facilitates simple point and click transactions between customers and suppliers. Amazon has only been able to become so successful at this because they have a very large network of fulfillment centers and the Company doesn't mind taking a bath on the shipping cost. Aside from the fulfillment centers, the only reason Amazon is able to do what they do is because FedEx and UPS have the capacity and ability to make the same day &amp; two-day shipping offered with Prime a reality. Without FedEx and UPS, Amazon is nothing. \n\nThis means that if WalMart and other retailers can mimic the type of fulfillment centers that Amazon has, they will be able to offer the same type of low cost online shopping that Amazon does because they have access to FedEx and UPS too. \n\nAmazon's \"growth earnings\" are the potential that could theoretically be gained from idiotic ventures like AWS, the Fire phone, and now Amazon is trying to directly compete with Netflix by becoming an in-house producer. \n\nThe problem with Amazon is that they are, at their core, a retail shipping company that is trying to pretend it is a cutting edge tech company. I have no idea why they're doing this, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being the king of online shopping and spending your capex toward making prime shipping profitable (it is not, and never has been profitable) rather than embarking on weird business ventures just so Jeff Bezos doesn't feel left out of the tech crowd. It would make much more sense for AWS and the tech businesses to spin off and do their own thing. \n\nThats why the \"profitable in the future\" line has never sat well with me.

They already raised the fee once and if they keep doing that they'll start to lose customers.  I see no way for them to make it profitable.","name":"t1_cxn5i2i","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-04 19:01:32","week":49}

{"id":"cxncp5t","author":"KipperTheCat","body":"IDEAS. I am willing to help create any of the below and will add as I think of more. Please comment with how you feel you could help and which idea you would be willing to be involved with.\n\n1) Niche Website - If anyone wants to build a niche website and has a passion for something specifically, lets do it! I recently had a site that talked about new photography gear and it was making $250/mo but I stopped keeping it updated for 3 months and it dropped to $100 so I sold it for $600 to a friend, who then flipped it on flippa for $1400 (bastard!). I'm more interested in making sites that can link to Amazon products since they pay out good Affiliate pricing. Need active writers (I can usually bump 2-3 posts a week out with good content) and we would also need a targeted niche. Upfront costs would cover domain purchase and basic hosting.\n\n2) Website sales service: (odd this was in the description) I lack the time to search for clients and meet with them and try to sell to them, but I have the skillsets to build a very presentable 5-8 page wordpress site within a week. Need people who are good salespeople, copywriters (if you want to be involved), or even designers (for upsells) who wants to team up and help build a small marketing firm. The biggest thing upfront would be a salesperson. Payment could be in percentage of sales. If you are a designer, you could try sales and keep money from upsells of new logos (just an idea)? Open for this. I manage a marketing team at work right now so I am confident in producing the content, I just don't have the time to look for clients on my free time outside of building content.\n\n3) Job Forum website - basically I own a solid Wordpress theme that  allows me to create a job board site so companies can post listings as a basic post for free or pay for \"promoted\" posts. It works well, I (like it #2) don't have time to reach out to businesses to actually get promoting it between working on things. We can build a localized job board and need a salesperson to help promote to the businesses via email, press release, etc... help with promoting on social media. I can build a new site no problem and get packages set up, just need people ready to get it off the ground.\n\nBasically, I can do a lot of site setup and getting that side of things running. Just need help with pushing new content or reaching out to people. Open to working with another site developer comfortable with wordpress though on anything. Will update post if I see more ideas. Reply if interested and how you see yourself fitting (or PM).\n\nAlso, I am -6 CST timezone, 22, work until 5pm every weekday, but always contactable as I work on a computer all day.","name":"t1_cxncp5t","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-04 21:54:32","week":49}

{"id":"cxni4es","author":"joeredspecial","body":"The solution is actually pretty close to that.  It's the [Marketplace Fairness Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_Fairness_Act).  Something like this is inevitable, but the way Congress goes lately makes it seem like a pipe dream.\n\nI will say that I hate taxation in any form, but this is the true solution to this problem.  It's not a \"new\" tax like the opponents of the legislation say, it's simply allowing states to collect on what is owed to them already.  \n\nThe issue comes from the Due Process Clause and the (dormant) Commerce Clause of the Constitution.  I'll skip the history of both of those things, but the only case that matters is *[Quill v. North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill_Corp._v._North_Dakota)*.  The case was regarding mail order sales, which for all intents and purposes is what internet sales really are, and it was heard right before the e-commerce boom.  There are three big takeaways:\n\n1. The Court upheld the *Bellas Hess* test which required an actual, physical presence in a state before a seller could be forced to collect sales tax on behalf of the taxing state.  This does not include using the mail or another courier.  \n\n2. Up until this point, the due process and interstate commerce issue were treated as the same, but the *Quill* Court separated them.  The Court adopted the personal jurisdiction approach to satisfy due process, which was a much lower burden and would be met with pretty much any online or mail order sale.  At first you may think \"great, but who cares\".  The real importance is by separating these issues, the only remaining hurdle was the interstate commerce issue which could be solved by Congress.  If Congress were have passed some sort of legislation regarding this, they would still have a due process issue, which cannot be legislated away.\n\n3.  Now Congress was free to act, and the Court in *Quill* blatantly says it's their job to do so.  The dormant Commerce Clause is just a legal doctrine made up by the Court to prevent states from doing things that the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress.  It doesn't give the Court the ability to suddenly become legislators.  Interstate commerce is a congressional issue, the Court says something along the lines of \"they are better equipped to do so\".  That means, the Court isn't going to touch it- Congress needs to act.\n\nThe current way that Amazon laws are justified isn't right in my legal opinion.  The Supreme Court refuses to hear these cases because nothing except the economic implications have changed since *Quill*.  They realize that it's a band-aid to a problem and probably don't want to deprive the states of their chance at reclaiming the tax.  Plus, it's simply not the Court's job to solve this issue, it's Congress and the Court knows this.  However, in the Spring, Justice Kennedy in a concurring opinion about a CO Amazon law (which was just a legal question, not actually on the merits) said that there is a great injustice here to the states and he hopes they will be given a case to change this.  Do any of the other justices agree?  Who knows.  They were given the chance in 2012 to hear the initial Amazon law case and they refused to hear it.\n\nSo that's where we're at.  I'm excited to see what happens in the future.","name":"t1_cxni4es","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-05 00:17:11","week":49}

{"id":"cxnmkdj","author":"Cherry_Pie_Guy","body":"I totally agree with your above breakdown (probably the best I've seen) of Amazon's PNL and the \"blissful dollars\" that have propelled it. It's very similar to sports betting, the Cowboys can suck, but the ignorant bettors or people who just like the Cowboys constantly draw the line away from the other team.  But in response to your question about Amazon being a 20+ year old company and still not showing the hard profits you want, I'd say Amazon is in about a unique position as a company can be in. That's to say that Amazon's business model was ahead of the times, and by a lot. They are a 20+ year old company, but because the revolution this country has just started going through in the last 5 years with ecommerce is a major reason they are still a 20+ year old company in a large growth state. Think about it, the iPhone only came out about 8 years ago or so. Think about how much the online shopping apps have changed the complexion of shopping. So it is fair to say as an industry or product offering they are still very much in a growth stage, but I will revert back to your explanation of their magnitude of capital leases and agree stay away. When stocks and companies have absolutely plummeted, a very common factor is the company was very heavy in capital leases, PP&amp;E, and other factors preventing agility and the ability to be liquid the moment they really need it.","name":"t1_cxnmkdj","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-05 02:35:09","week":49}

{"id":"cxnxcic","author":"_imjosh","body":"It's a way to buy merchandise with stolen credit cards without having to walk into a store or have the merchandise delivered to you and then sell the merchandise to obtain cash.  \n\nThe slightly more complicated part is that the person with the stolen credit cards gets another party (the \"fall guy\") to list the stuff on ebay and take the payments.  The fall guy gets the innocent buyers money, keeps some of it as a reward and then transfers the rest of the money to the credit card scammer (most likely through an international money wire).  So the CC scammer is very well insulated and difficult to prosecute.  The fall guy... well, he's the fall guy.  The buyer gets the stuff he paid for and may never realize he was part of a scam.  Amazon (or whatever online seller that the CC scammer orders the merchandise from) eventually gets the fraudulent charges reversed by the credit card company once real CC holder reports the fraudulent charges.  So basically Amazon is the primary victim.","name":"t1_cxnxcic","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-05 10:21:35","week":49}

{"id":"cxo0vbg","author":"lvhardware","body":"I'll throw an idea in the ring, this came up in discussions with some friends here in Shenzhen the other night who all share this pain point.\n\n(Crappy) Name: Direct2FBA\n\nPitch: I've run into a number of people who are working on amazon or ebay businesses and sourcing from China. Those platforms have some restrictive labeling and shipping requirements. The business would be an operation that can receive your product and handle all the operations and logistics to get it ready and then stock it at any FBA warehouse in the world. We'd get you an ASIN, boxes, proper pallets, book the freight. Eventually we could expand into sourcing, inspection, and helping you integrate with other 3rd Party Logistics. Would probably base it out of China or HK.\n\nThis streamlines what's a very manual process (logistics in China) plus the annoyance of small volumes when prepping for Amazon. The MVP is basically a very simple online form where you can book using just your product quantity, delivery date range, box size, and pay with a CC online. We compare some things automatically against Amazon for sanity, then receive your shipment and send it out.\n\nAbout Me: Currently working as a freelance mechanical and manufacturing engineer. I spend almost all of my time in Shenzhen helping my clients develop products and get them made. I've met quite a few people who just need some basic logistics help to avoid the headache. I'm interested to see if there are any technical talents out there who might want to work on this.\n\nManagement: I have a good ground knowledge of what the product should do, so I would plan to drive most of the high level decisions. Technical and marketing stuff I would prefer to leave to competent team members. I generally use slack for communications and asana for project management. I can collect the funds and use them for domain and hosting or just as the \"seriousness buy in\" as I have a good hosting plan as is. If we wanted to start a new one I'd use namecheap registration and hosting.\n\nTeam: I'm on the ground in China and can set up and manage logistics from here. I'm looking ideally for the right technical mix to create the website (front end with a form and stripe checkout or something) and then the back-end application that will take the customer inputs and generate the outputs (box size and type, proper labeling, etc). \n\nI think that this would be a good group with myself, a back end engineer who's done some file output (eg automating creation of vector files like .ai or .svg, or alternately simple excel file since boxes are simple :D), and a marketer with some good front end and SEO skills for the basic pages.\n\nHappy to answer questions.","name":"t1_cxo0vbg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-05 14:47:06","week":49}

Mostly really really poor people now. No more middle class that was forced to go there because the recession made them. Walmart is not the store anymore that offers the lowest prices, it is also not the go-to place for all stuff since Amazon can provide everything other than food for a lower price and most of all it has gotten that image that only certain types of people shop there. If you think Walmart will go back to its old glory, I think you are mistaken and I think that was priced into the drop. \n\n=\nFurthermore I think the board of Walmart realizes that too, which is why they were pushing to change their whole image but I think their push comes too late.

{"id":"cxo7p9l","author":"Leviathan97","body":"The 35 delta call is just my rule of thumbâshamelessly stolen from Tom Sosnoff at [TastyTrade](http://www.tastytrade.com). I think it's a good compromise between allowing room for the stock to move in your favor before the call caps your profitability, and still collecting a nice premium in case the stock moves against you.\n\nAs far as weeklies, I will first disclose that I don't usually trade them. I reserve covered calls mostly for my 401(k) that only permits Tier 1 option permissioning, and I'm pretty much on a monthly program there, because it's such a pain in the butt to look at. However, in the case of the trade you're already involved in, here's three reasons why I like the weeklies:\n\n* **More Theta.** Extrinsic option premium decay accelerates as you get closer to expiration. You see the biggest gain from this (if you're short premium) in the two weeks preceding expiration. The tradeoff, however, is delta. As you near expiration, an ATM option will begin to fluctuate wildly in price as the underlying moves across the strike. I normally like to smooth out this delta a bit, so in my trading, I tend to open positions six weeks out and then close or roll two weeks out. I find that gives me decent theta decay while keeping delta under control. However, in the case of HPQ, what the low call prices are telling you is that the market doesn't think the stock is going to move much in the near term. You need to assume some added delta risk here in order to get enough theta to make the trade worth it. Let's look at the Jan 13 call (29 delta, which is closest to 35), as an example. That's right at 6 weeks out. It closed Friday at a mid price around 0.19. That's $19 over 42 days for an *average* theta of $0.45/day. (Note that this is an average over 42 days. Because theta will rise as expiration nears, the instantaneous theta is much lower, while in January it will be significantly higher, all else remaining equal.) If you instead go after the Dec 12.5 call (also closest to 35 delta at 40), you take in 0.18 for $18 in 13 days, for a theta of $1.38/day. Assuming you can repeat this three times, ending with Jan expiration, you have almost triple the premium intake of just selling the 35 delta call in Jan and waiting, over the same time period. But again, there's no free lunch, and the tradeoff is delta risk: if HPQ recovers too quickly, you'll lose out on the stock price appreciation.\n* **More Granularity.** Regular Jan has $1-wide strikes. If you're looking for 35 delta, your choices right now are 29 (the 13 calls) or 61 (the ITM 12 calls). The weeklies on either side have $0.50-wide strikes, giving you a more diverse selection to choose from, and you also get granularity in your choice of timeframe. (After regular Dec expiration, regular Jan will gain those $0.50-wide strikes, BTW.) You must be selective, though, as many stocks that are okay to trade in the monthlies have bad weekly option markets. Try to refrain from trading options where the bid-ask spread is more than about 0.3% of the price of the stock. So you're okay in HPQ with 3Â¢-wide markets on a $12.50 stock, and you'd be okay in, e.g., AMZN with $1.40 spreads on a $675 stock (*do* consider a 1-lot in AMZN to be the equivalent of a 50-lot in HPQ for position-sizing purposes, however), but stay away from stuff like FIT for now, where even the monthlies have 30Â¢ markets on a $33 stock (a 0.9% ratio).\n* **More Learning.** More occurrences means more opportunity to practice the mechanics and ponder what's going on. Six weeks from expiration is boring. Nothing really happens, barring a big move in the underlying. At two weeks, you start to see the effects of delta, theta, and vega intermingling. The more you watch this happen, the sooner you'll \"get a feel\" for how it all interrelates. It's hard to describe, but [the first time you \"sense\"](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/f/f2/Shii-ChoBlastDeflect.png) what an option's price should be before you look it up, you'll know you're getting it.\n\nThis *is* a good learning opportunity, and if you don't need the capital for something else, I'd encourage you to stay in this relatively cheap stock and roll those weeklies until you get back to even. You'll learn a ton.\n\nHowever, the real lesson here is to be selective in your underlying on order entry. You have complete control over what you trade, right up until the point that you establish a position. After that, you're stuck with the portfolio you've created for yourself, if that makes sense. HPQ was a bad choice not because it went downâcould've just as easily gone upâbut because the calls are so cheap. You need to collect more than 25Â¢ on a $14.00 stock. \n\nIn fact, I liked that P trade I pulled out of my butt as an example earlier so much that I put it on in my own accounts. However, I did the Dec 12.5 strike which was *neither* the 35 delta call, *nor* the 42-DTE series, simply because I'm not super-confident in the overall market right now, and because I'm just fine with being called away at 12.50 on a cost basis of 11.02. (Max potential profit of $148 on $367.50 margin required is 40.3% in 15 days, or 980% annualized).","name":"t1_cxo7p9l","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-12-05 19:02:21","week":49}

{"id":"cxoz2d9","author":"any022","body":"Hi,\n\nIm preparing to move soon so here is some of the tips i accumulated. I'm not sure if all of these tips will work for everyone\n\nTransportation: \ni'm not sure if you plan on driving to your new location, flying or whatever. If you are FLYING, i would NOT RECOMMEND you use the baggage check in option. Many airline charge 25-50$ for baggage and i have been told it is CHEAPER to get a box, those \"Space Saver Bag\" and ship a box of clothing. It should definitely cost less than 50$ and you can ship more [Clothes are not heavy they just take up alot of space]. Additionally, if you plan on bringing some books ship them via media mail at USPS. Just have SEPARATE BOXES one with books &amp; another with clothing and once you get settled down in your new location have your parents, friends or relative ship them to you and pay them back.\n\nIf you are driving the same tips apply but certainly try to fit as much as you can into the car BUT i would seriously not take books because it is infinitely cheaper to just ship them.\n\nBuying Things:\nI would not buy anything when you arrive, personally i use slickdeals and wait for discount on things i NEED but not immediately. For example there are always deals on clothing, electronics and basic things like toothpaste, razors and general cosmetic items. Certainly you can also use camelcamelcamel if you are desperate to buy things from amazon\n\nAMAZON PRIME\nAs a student you are entitled to a 6 months free trial period i would HIGHLY recommend you use it. You might be tempted to buy things you may not necessarily need so just keep an eye out on that.\n\nAs for mattress, bed frame and desk:\nThese items are typically not on sale, many universities have classified ads and depending on where you are moving many apartment laundry rooms have for-sale postings. Personally i would buy bed frame and desk USED but i would not recommend you buy a mattress used [haha im sure many adults can attest to what goes on when you are in bed]\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask!\n\nBest of luck!!!","name":"t1_cxoz2d9","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-12-06 10:23:09","week":49}

{"id":"cxp9tnb","author":"Leviathan97","body":"See [the chart](http://puu.sh/lKeD5/bf6b00da05.png) I posted earlier. The plot on the bottom is implied volatility, and earnings is marked by the red and blue icons. Approaching earnings, you see a rise in IV as uncertainty builds. After earnings, it collapses.\n\nTypically, one will look to sell premium just before the earnings announcement (as in the afternoon prior). That allows the strangle (in this case) to be put on at the highest possible IV level, thereby maximizing the premium collected. The hope is that, after earnings, the vol collapse is great enough to overcome any adverse move in the stock.\n\nIn this case, the OP has deliberately planned for an expiration prior to earnings, which will hopefully result in AMZN remaining between his strikes, as the possible big earnings move is after expiration. What /u/doougle is pointing out is that the volatility expansion in the weeks leading up to earnings is going to negate a large portion of that potential profitâpositive theta works for the OP, but negative vega loses money on a vol expansion, which is certainly going to occur. If the stock doesn't cooperate directionally, there's a potential double-whammy built into this position. (For example, see what happened during the August mini-crashâyou get unanticipated price movement *and* a vol expansion outside of earnings season, and, unfortunately, right before expiration. That sort of thing could devastate this position, especially if one were in it too big to ride out the undefined risk.)\n\nThat being said, [it's also been found](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/market-measures/episodes/long-straddles-into-earnings-07-14-2015) that the opposite tradeâbuying straddles or stranglesâin an attempt to capture the vol expansion leading into earnings is likely not a consistently profitable strategy, so I think it follows that what the OP is doing can't necessarily be considered to be reliably *un*profitable either.","name":"t1_cxp9tnb","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-12-06 19:12:15","week":49}
