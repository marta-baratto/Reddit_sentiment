{"id":"3d2j54","author":"35thArmorGuy","body":"So I started an ecommerce site 6 months ago. My niche is model kits in 1/35 scale. And as the title says, I've only made 4 sales so far. I'd like some input from you guys on how to get more sales, what I should prioritize, and any other ideas. \n\nFirst. Here's my site [35th Armor](http://35tharmor.com/)\nI'm using Magento. I'm not a huge fan of the theme, but I love that I have faceted navigation (honestly it's a must for these types of products). Many of my competitors just sort by company then scale, and then it's just a massive list of products in alphabetical order. So I think this gives me a leg up. \nI think the weakest part is the homepage. I'd like a better news section and a way to add other content, like product reviews, maybe even tutorials, get some content marketing in. \n\nThis would mean custom web development which can be pricey.\n\nSecond, I realize my inventory is pretty limited. Also a very pricey operation to expand it. \n\nI've run a lot of ads as well. Facebook ads seem to get the most bang for my buck, I've also run on Amazon, Bing, Google, and some regular banner ads on popular modeling sites. I've also got a FB page with 400+ likes, and around 50 newsletter subscribers on the site.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to ask is, what should I focus on first. Website work, increase inventory. Should I work on my marketing strategy? Something I haven't mentioned? I'm a little lost right now. So far I've put in about $3-4,000 and sometimes it just feels like I'm throwing money away. \n\nSo comments and crits are welcome, thanks for reading through my ramblings.

{"id":"3d3enm","author":"TGTX","body":"PSA to fellow BeerMoney users. I have not seen anyone else post this yet.\n\nThe Ride App on iOS used to be a very easy way to obtain gift cards. It was a perfect install and forget type of App. The app tracked where ever you went. Each mile earned you about 2 to 3 points. 20,000 points used to equal a $5 Amazon card.\n\nOn July 6th, Ride decided to reset point amounts on all accounts. Two weeks prior, they removed all rewards and only had sweepstakes, so basically you, as the user, only had the option to use your points for their stupid sweepstakes or else lose your points.\n\nNow, I received no notification about the potential point loss. No email or push notification went out like in the past. The last email I received from the Ride App was back in April. The only mention of the point reset was on their Facebook page starting June 21st which I do not check.\n\nToday was a big shock when I opened up the app and saw my point total at just over 1000 points. I lost over 18,000 points to their point reset. It's not worth running and draining your battery for this application. \n\nMake sure to leave a bad review of the app. Current version reviews are at 1 star on iOS.","name":"t3_3d3enm","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-13 07:11:47","week":29}

{"id":"3d46qz","author":"chbrules","body":"I run my own one man IT and web dev biz, but I've been really curious about trying out this sort of venture I see people in this subreddit posting about from time to time. My g/f and I are both young (22 and 29, respectively), and I wanted her to try her hand in something entrepreneurial. I agreed to help her take care of the technical and financing side, and split some business operations tasks with her. She's graduating this year with a degree in supply chain management, and I have a degree in info sys mgmt. I figure we could probably have some fun (and success) here. :]\n\nShe's identified an awesome market and product, and we're checking out suppliers on Alibaba. I've come across a couple points that I would like to know more about for this venture:\n\n1) How do you go about requesting samples from suppliers? Do they just charge you the full price of a single/couple item(s) and air mail it over to you on the cheap? Is this a good way people have gone about testing the market and showing people the products first before ordering 500+ of something?\n\n2) I see most suppliers are listing prices as FOB from China. I would be looking to use a freight forwarder to handle everything neatly. Does anyone have an itemized list of the costs they might charge? Could someone walk me through the detailed process of how it all works? How much shipping/insurance on something you bought was?\n\n3) I literally can see the port of LA out my window. I could drive over there to pick  up goods to save on shipping costs. Is that an option? Do they have to ship it to me from the port?\n\n4) Those of you that started fresh, how did you go about initially marketing your products? Did you sell from your own site, or did you go with a marketplace, like Amazon, Etsy, Ebay, etc? Why?\n\n5) Do you need a reseller's license when importing with the expectation to sell? Is that necessary in collecting sales tax on items sold in the state (CA)?\n\n6) Finally, does anyone have any recommendations on freight forwarders for the port of LA/Long Beach?\n\n\nI've never sold physical goods before. I've been selling my services/skills for the better part of a decade now, but that's a whole different ball game. I'd love to hear from people experienced in this area. Feel free to shoot me a PM too if you don't want to post info here.

We're only 16 and have been unsuccessful in getting jobs so I'm just wondering if any of you know any ways to make revenue around the Internet. I'm looking into the Amazon affiliate program cause I heard that reels in the dosh. I'm willing to make like an Internet business and commit to that and put the audio business on hold of that would work. \n\nI'm not an idiot looking for a quick buck, I'm willing to work, but haven't been successful in employment and was wondering if anyone knew of some good internet businesses and such. I'm willing to spend years making a business work to get this project going.\n\nAnd on a side note, we're in need of new driver designs and being 16 year olds, we have no idea where to find someone who works on these or where to start looking. If anyone has any idea on where to find such people (we're in Australia), also reply pls. Of course we would pay them, if we could find them.. \n\nTHANKS FOR READING!!

{"id":"3d4ngi","author":"jshrlzwrld02","body":"I have less than stellar credit at the moment. I made some very poor credit decisions between the ages of 17 and 21 and I'm beginning to get things straightened out. \n\nThe only hiccup that I've had with my credit in the past several years is last October/November I relocated for a job and got a new bank account, etc... and when I got that new bank account I forgot to change over my auto payment on Amazon and they tried to take money out of a closed bank account for two consecutive months and when they do that and fail to get payment they close your account. I paid off that closed account with my tax return in January anyway.\n\n--------\n\nAnyway, I think my credit is somewhere in the mid 600's right now.\n\nI gross about $2400/mo after all deductions including health insurance (+vision/dental), retirement, credit union savings, etc.\n\n* $475/mo Rent\n* $130/mo Utilities\n* $75/mo Cell Phone\n* $75/mo Auto Insurance\n* $35/mo Cable\n* $100/mo Student Loans\n* $20/mo Gym membership\n\n**Total bills (*not including auto*): $910/mo**\n\nAnd the kicker that I'm trying to get rid of\n\n* ~$385/mo Car Payment - 2014 Ford Focus\n\n**Grand total bills: $1285/mo**\n\nThis leaves me with about $1,100/mo to live off of. After miscellaneous spending I could probably save $500 or so per month but recently I've been a little loose with my spending and have had some dental work, work certification tests.\n\nI don't have all of the paperwork here with me right now but I owe something to the tune of $20k on this car that I purchased in October. I put nothing down on it because I had nothing at the time and I traded in a clunker  (literally on it's last leg) that I was paying on from a buy-here-pay-here place back home that was really lenient with my payments and did not report on my credit that ended up adding another $800 to the amount I financed. I also purchased GAP and one additional little coverage thing which replaces windshields/tires/rims if damaged. Poor decision at the time but it only added a couple dollars a month.\n\n---------\n\nSo my question is... **how can I fix this situation?** I really dislike this car and would love to get something 4WD like an SUV or an AWD car. I live in an area that is very mountainy and gets hairy when winter time rolls around. There were times this past winter that I struggled to get my Focus out of my parking lot (which is flat and right along the main road).\n\nWould it make be feasible for me to trade this in towards a lease and kind of start over in a way?\n\nShould I save up some cash then take this car and trade it towards a decent used vehicle that will be more practical?","name":"t3_3d4ngi","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-13 16:19:28","week":29}

Between the cell phone bill, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc., it's really getting annoying. I'd like to setup a joint account that links to all of our individual bank accounts, then setup a recurring monthly transfer to that joint account. That way, I (or any of us, for that matter) can login and make the bill payment from the joint account (which will always be funded through automated transfers each month).\n\nI spoke to an Ally rep and I was told that a joint account with Ally can only be linked with external accounts that are also joint, with the same names as on the Ally account. So if there are four people on the Ally joint account, the external account must also be a joint account with the same four people. Kinda defeats the purpose of going to Ally for this. The suggestion the rep offered me was that all four people open individual accounts with Ally, then open a joint account together. However, this creates an extra step of transferring the money from external-&gt;Ally individual-&gt;Ally joint. I don't want to force my family members to have an EXTRA Ally account they don't want to use.\n\nSurely there must be a simpler way to do this. Anyone have any ideas?

{"id":"3d74yi","author":"512Ish","body":"Hello, /r/smallbusiness, I am a prospective sophomore in high school and figured that I would ask this question to more experienced individuals. I recently got a job at a small perfume shop in a mall that is owned by a family friend. It is a very small business; I only work with two other people, the owner and another co-worker, and most of our time is focused on selling on Ebay/Amazon. Though I originally thought the job was going to be lame and was mainly going into it for the pay, I have come to realize that I actually enjoy working in a small business and would possibly like to run one on the side someday. However, I am mainly interested in building computers and selling/repairing customized PCs, along with selling tablets/laptops/iDevices on the side in order to bring in more profit. Setting up a gaming cafe off to the side wouldn't be bad as well.\n\nRecently, though, I have read that it is currently a bad time to set up a parts business due to the public transitioning to the mobile space and losing interest in buying desktops as their primary computers. However, on the other hand, leaps and bounds are being made on the desktop gaming front with GPUs getting faster by the year (ex. the freshly released, mid-range Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 is as fast, if not faster than the flagship GPU from 2-3 years ago, the GTX 680, but I digress). As a result, is it a good idea to start such a business in 5-10 years as a side gig, or even right now in high school if feasable? Mind you, I do plan on majoring in CS in college so I most definitely will have a source of income if this thing blows over.

Which the seven apps, I am set to make slightly over $300 a year.  With Slidejoy and Adme, this sum increases to nearly $400.On my computer, I have 3 apps which combined earn me about $100 a year. Most of these applications are data collecting apps and websites which means that they monitor which websites you visit and what you search for on the internet (its alright, everyone knows you watch porn). As others have said, Google and other corporations already monitor and record all of this information, so why not get money for something that would be happening anyway. The majority of these websites and applications are based on your IP address so you can’t have more than one device collecting data. An exception for this is ScreenWise Trends panel which of course asks for a tablet, a phone and a computer; Media Insiders also allows for more than one mobile device to be connected.\n\n \n\nData Coup\n\n[Link](www.datacoup.com)\n\nPayout: $1.01 per week, $52.52 per year\n\nCash out: Withdraw to a Visa or MasterCard debit card\n\nMinimum withdrawal: $1\n\nFirst up is a computer website. Datacoup asks you to connect various social media websites to it, which gives it access to information on the sites. For instance, once Twitter is connected, Datacoup gets your twitter hashtags, which device you are using and at what time you tweet. Most of this information isn’t difficult for one to get in the first place, so giving that information away isn’t that much of a problem, for me at least. The list of websites which you can connect is as follows: Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, FourSquare, Google+, Instagram, Tumbler, Last.fm and Meetup. The website also gives you the option to connect your debit card and credit card, and allow them to receive transaction data on your accounts, but I’m not willing to give them that. The cards are labeled as high earning, while the majority of other websites are either low or medium.  The website is easy to use and supplies me with a nice $1.01 a week, although you could arguably earn more if you connected your cards.\n\nScreenwise Trends Panel\n\n[Link](www.screenwisetrends.com)\n\nPayout: $1-3 per week, $52-156 per year\n\nCash out:  Variety of gift cards including Amazon.com\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $25\n\nThe second computer website is run by google and is described by them as a ‘market research panel that studies how people use the internet’. This website has one of the highest payout of all of the other websites if you connect more than one device to it. Screenwise trends panel allows you to connect a computer, a smartphone and a tablet to one account. The more devices you have connected, the more you earn.  When you first sign up your devices, you get $2 for the computer, $4 for computer and a smartphone or tablet, and $6 for all three. You have to download a mobile app on the tablet and the smartphone, as well as install an extension for chrome. When you first sign up, it might show no activity for a week or so.\n\n \n\nMobile Performance Meter\n\n[Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embeepay.mpm&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: $.70 a week, $36 a year\n\nCash out: A large variety of gift cards including amazon\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nThis application is fairly simple. You install it, answer a small survey and it automatically works in the background. The app also sometimes has surveys that usually payout around a dollar or so. I have noticed that this application does not affect my battery that bad compared to others such as screenwise trends panel. The point system works with you earning a set amount of points per day. I earn 10 points a day and since a 5 dollar gift card to amazon is 500 points, this translates to 70 cents a week since there are 7 days in a week. However, the earning varies on your location and phone so you may earn more or less than me.\n\n \n\nMobile Experience Meter\n\n[Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embeepay.mx&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: $.35 a week, $18 a year (this number can be greater if point booster is turned on)\n\nCash out: A large variety of gift cards including amazon\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nThis application is made by the same people that made Mobile Performance Meter. I got 150 points when first joining which translates to a dollar and fifty cents. This app however only gives me 5 points a day unlike Mobile performance meter, which gives 10. There is an option to turn on ‘Point Booster’ which could increase the points earned to 10 or 15, but neither me nor a large majority of the users on the google play store said that it works for them. Keep in mind that just like Mobile Performance meter, the points vary and may give you more per day, or none at all. This application took me multiple times of opening it for it to start working and accept my phone.\n\n \n\nAppOptix\n\n[Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sa.appoptix.com&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: $10 every three months, $40 a year\n\nCash Out: Amazon only\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $10\n\nThis application is fairly simple and as soon as your application gets accepted, and you complete all of the required steps, the app starts working. You must send them an email and hope that you get accepted (most people do, and mine took half a day to get accepted). The earning system is very simple and you earn $10 every three months. They send you a $10 amazon code to your email. You start off with 100 points for completing your profile and a $10 gift card is 300 points. This app uses very little battery and data and I don’t even notice its presence.\n\nSlidejoy\n\n[Web Site Link]( https://www.getslidejoy.com/)\n\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slidejoy&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: ~$4-5 per month, $48-60 per year\n\nCash Out: Paypal, Amazon and multiple other gift cards\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nReferral Code: www.getslidejoy.com/r/gbouslov.15266\n\nSlidejoy is a lock-screen app that shows a non-obstrusive add on your lockscreen. You can swipe left to follow the ad to the source, or you can swipe right to go straight to your phone. This works very nice with Adme and I don't have any issues with either. You can cash out to a multitude of sources including PayPal, Square Cash, Google Play and you can even donate your money. Usually, you receive the money within a day of asking for it. The catch is that you can only cash out the money you earned in a month, one month later. So if you earned $5 in June, you'll only be able to cash out in July. The app is optimized to spend as little data as possible and it typically spends 10mb or so every month. The UI is very clean and to be honest, it is a pleasure to use. I have cashed around $80 or so from this app since I started using it over a year ago.\n\nAdme\n\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.adme&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: ~$4-5 per month, $48-60 per year\n\nCash Out: Paypal\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $10, twice monthly\n\nReferral Code: 2QjRrcMgNZ\n\nAdme is a great lock-screen application which is easy to use and constantly has promotions for you to earn more money. There are three earning modes (from least to highest). The higher modes show more ads. Before your phone reaches your lock-screen, you see a picture ad which you X out of and a sliding page as well. Adme works flawlessly with other lock-screen apps such as Slidejoy and Fronto (don’t bother). You are able to cash out twice monthly, and I usually earn four dollars every month and can cash out once over 2 and a half months, this can be faster with their current referral bonus.\n\n \n\nMI Mobile\n\n[Website Link]( https://www.mediainsiders.com/index.php/memberlandingpage)\n\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teleca.sam.engine&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: $1.25 per device, up to 3 devices. $.50 additional if you run mobile VPN and another $1.25 for computer VPN\n\nCash Out: Perk points (amazon, etc.)\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $5\n\nThis app monitors your phone activity. It can pay well, but it does take up a decent amount of battery and data. For the full loyalty program, you need one record of watching TV per week. It records little bits when it catches on to phrases from its database. They have you use a mobile VPN on your phone th. After a month or so, they will offer you the computer VPN for additional earning.  **BE WARNED**: Mobile VPN’s will get you banned from perktv and swagbucks.\n\nNielsen Mobile Panel\n\n[Website Link]( https://mobilepanel.nielsen.com/enroll/home.do?type=load&amp;l=en_us&amp;pid=1)\n\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nielsen.odm&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: ~$4 per week, $50 per year\n\nCash Out: Gift cards from variety of places including Amazon.com\n\nThis application is similar to the other ones mentioned here because it is also a data collecting app. You simply have to make an account, fill out some information, install the mobile application and  as long as it says active on it, you should be good to go earning up to $50 a year. The application does not affect your battery life or devices performance, although the application will not work on some devices.\n\n \n\nSmartphone Mate\n\n[Website Link]( http://smartphonemate.mobi/us/)\n\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartphonemate.smglobal&amp;hl=en)\n\nPayout: $3 per month, $36 per year\n\nCash Out: Amazon Gift Cards\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: You don’t withdraw; you get the code emailed or texted to you\n\nOf all of the passive earners, this one seems to be the sketchiest to me personally. This is probably because of the websites ugly appearance. Some have said that this application works flawlessly, while others said that they have had some issues with it. The app sends out data twice daily without you having to do anything, and it must be active for 20 days in a calendar month for you to be eligible for the amazon coupons. Smartphone mate allows you to have only one device registered per user.\n\n \n\nVagex\n\n[Ref Link]( http://vagex.com/?ref=339950)\n\n[Non Ref Link]( http://vagex.com/)\n\nPayout: Run 24/7 on a computer could earn a couple of dollars per week\n\nMinimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nFirst off, yes I know it sounds like some sort of feminine hygiene product. With that out of the way, this is an old website, but could still be pretty good with referrals. The website works as follows, you install a program that auto surfs YouTube videos on your account, likes them and subs to the person. Each of these actions earns 1 point, with 60 second videos earning two points. They also have a Firefox add-on that you can run along side the program. You can leave the application running constantly as it is pretty stable. Their referral program is pretty interesting with every share to facebook or twitter giving you 1000 points (these can be posted daily). The referral link program is pretty interesting as well. If I refer you, you get 100 extra credits and I earn 1 credits for every credit that you earn. If done right, this website can be pretty promising. Vagex can also be used to get views for your youtube videos as well.\n\nFreeEats\n\n[Ref Link]( http://ftr.io/r/YF6XTX91)\n\n[Non-Ref Link](Freeeats.com)\n\nPayout: $1 for registration, $1 per text received\n\nCash Out: Paypal                                             \n\nMinimum Withdrawal: No withdrawal, gets instantly sent to paypal\n\nThis is a trustworthy app that sends you texts to your phone, and you get instantly paid to PayPal. You get a dollar for signing up and each text that you receive is worth $.25. Sometimes, texts lead to a survey which pays out $1 each or $10 if you are one of the first 25 to respond to it. The amount of texts that you get varies, but most people get a text a week or a couple a month. For following my referral link you get an additional $.25 and the referrer gets $1. Essentially, a very easy app that requires no work post registration.\n\n\n","name":"t3_3db5lw","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-15 00:24:48","week":29}

{"id":"3dbpu1","author":"Ddragon3451","body":"My situation: 2nd year Medical student, ~150k in student loan debt, never had a credit card, spouse makes 100k+ A year in the emergency room.  \nI just got off the phone with Barclays regarding my denial of the card. They said that, because I have no taxable income, I am not eligible for the SallaeMae card. I'm trying to build credit since I've always used debit, but they did note I have a good history of paying off debts when I financed my car(paid off now). They said despite this, until I have significant income, I'm not eligible. I do have some savings(emergency fund), and some small investments from awhile back, but I won't be collecting a paycheck until after 4th year.  \nHow am I supposed to become eligible for a student card if I can't work while being a student? Since my wife and I filed taxes jointly this past year, so filed a joint income, does that count? I did work last year before coming to school, so I paid taxes this past year on my income, but that doesn't count as current. They also said any money I get refunded from my loans can't be included. I was really hoping to start building credit, and this card fits what I buy perfectly. Groceries, gas, and Amazon are basically my only purchases since we rarely have time to go out. What should I do now? Wish I could refill out the application and put in a different income.

The most easily hackable one is Amazon.\n\nFor those who don't know... quickly... Amex is giving $10 back (once per account) on a few vendors who use their new Amex Express Payment system.  So you can buy a cheap ($0.50) item and get $10 back!  [Here is the post by /u/ajaxVP](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3cozlc/amex_launched_a_new_payment_platform_that_can_get/) who laid out all the information for us.\n\nSo originally I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3cozlc/amex_launched_a_new_payment_platform_that_can_get/csxkl0j) kindda as a joke, but it was actually popular.

That said it is arguably the top podcast and one of top 5 sites on all of crowdfunding.\n\nThe biggest challenge would be finding someone interested in the expert value play or lead gen, ie someone wanting to grow their reputation in crowdfunding growth space(VC, tech mag, crowdfunding agency etc) and then selling them on value of content over revenue because currently revenue is  weak as it is more about content, authority and lead generation. Emailed owners of major crowdfunding platforms, plus of course Jeff Bezos :) to potentially pit them against each other for content driven exposure for their platforms and educational material for their creators but I'd love to hear sugggestions or even talk further with anyone interested.\n\nImportant Stats:\n~5-10 highly qualified consulting request per month\n#2 and #4 podcast on iTunes for \"Kickstarter\" behind John Lee Dumas new show, #1 for \"Indiegogo\", #1 and #2 for \"crowdfunding\"\nRevenue(very weak, I haven't done affiliate anything really, was initially with my consulting but have since stopped that to focus on other things) - $300/month ads.

We applied to many places including Amazon and NONE of them have given us jobs (Amazon hired us but never gave us a start date). Our last apartment complex is 15 days late with our return deposit and we're starting to doubt its arrival at all. Our car is now leaking radiator fluid too. We are flat out broke now and can only wait for somewhere to give us a job hopefully. Despite paying off my car and paying rent for 3 years I have no credit for some reason so I can't get a credit card or a loan. I need help. There's no one to ask and we could very well not be able to pay rent in 2 weeks. I haven't been this scared in my life and trust me when I say my life has been scary as hell.

{"id":"3di93i","author":"moved_to_nyc","body":"One year ago I moved to Manhattan from a suburb of DC for my dream job.  A lot of commenters on this subreddit frequently warn against moving to areas with high costs of living, so I figure I'd share my data culled from Mint to give a good example of what such a move looks like, and exactly how much more expensive I've found NYC to be.  I've been using Mint pretty exhaustively to track my spending for the last several years, and while I may have missed a cash expense here or there (I try to enter them all using the mobile app), it's probably accurate to within 1-2% of my total spending figures.\n\nSo here is a comparison of my total expenditures for the 12-month period before I moved to NYC to the first 12 months after having moved here.  There are no moving costs because my employer paid to move me here, but that's a relatively common perk.  All figures are in annual post-tax USD; divide by 12 to get a monthly figure.\n\n\nCategory | $ Pre-NYC | $ NYC | Comments\n---|---|---|---\n**HOUSING** | 836 | 17,972\nRent | -- | 17,972 | I rented out rooms in my house before I moved here, which provided enough to cover mortgage and maintenance.  Rent in Manhattan is obviously expensive, and includes a broker's fee.\nUtilities | 836 | -- | Power/water/heat have been included in every apartment I've lived in in NYC.  We don't pay for cable TV, and my work pays for home Internet.\n**FOOD/DRINK** | 4,115 | 3,610\nGroceries | 2,202 | 523 | My new job feeds me for free every meal Monday through Friday, hence the much lower grocery expenses.  I know that this is far from typical and won't apply for most people.\nRestaurants | 1,044 | 1,259 | No surprise here that I've gone out more in NYC.\nBars | 552 | 1,117 | Going out drinking is a way of life in NYC.\nFast Food | 593 | 481 | Surprisingly this went down, even though I get fast food more often in NYC, especially on weekends.  I blame dollar pizza.\nLiquor/beer | 132 | 134 | Bought at stores, not at bars. Uncannily consistent.\nCoffee shops | 30 | 94 | Almost irrelevant.\n**TRANSPORTATION** | 8,361 | 593\nCar loan | 5,824 | -- | Huge savings right here.\nSubway | 1,000 | 180 | The prior amount is a guess (I was using pre-tax dollars to pay for my daily work commute, so this is that figure expressed in post-tax dollars).\nCar insurance | 981 | -- | And the savings continue.\nGasoline | 454 | 90 | Surprisingly not zero even though I don't have a car now; I usually pay for gas when on a road trip in someone else's car.\nMiscellaneous | 102 | 80 | License/registration fees, parking, etc.\nBike share | -- | 95 | Citibike is the best deal ever.  It amounts to 20 cents per ride or so based on how often I use it, and of course I don't have to even own a bike or pay to maintain one.\nTraffic tickets | -- | 82 | Somewhat ironically, I got my first traffic ticket in a decade only after I'd sold my car.\nTaxis | -- | 66 | I almost never take taxis.  I'd rather bike or take the subway.  Taxis are reserved for the end of a night when a date has gone very well.\n**SHOPPING** | 616 | 2,127\nComputers | -- | 1,351 | I bought a new Macbook Pro to use in NYC because I didn't have a laptop, and my existing desktops were not compatible with a small bedroom lifestyle.\nMiscellaneous | 294 | 259 | Hard-to-categorize shopping stuff, much from Amazon.  NYC figure includes a Craigslisted barely-used $140 bed.\nElectronics/software | 207 | 265 | Stuff like computer hardware, Steam games, etc. is included in this.\nClothing/shoes | 115 | 252 | I seriously think I spend way less on clothing than the average person.  The previous year's figure is probably undercounted somehow though.\nPersonal care (e.g. haircuts) | 68 | 132 | I must have undercounted the prior number or changed my categorization usage somehow.\n**TRAVEL** | 1,019 | 791 | Mostly plane, train, and bus tickets, and hotels and rental cars.  Travel costs went down because I don't feel as much of a need to go elsewhere in my first year in NYC.\n**MOBILE PHONE** | 720 | -- | My job pays for my mobile phone now (part of being on-call).\n**GYM/SPORTS** | 452 | 289 | Actual gym expenses this past year were $949, but work reimbursed most of them.\n**DOCTOR/PHARMACY** | 25 | 186 | I got sick a lot more often in my first winter in NYC.  It must be all the people in close proximity.\n**ENTERTAINMENT** | 218 | 229 | Includes movies, shows, and events.\n**GIFTS** | 220 | 218 | Uncannily consistent.\n**LAUNDRY** | -- | 185 | It sucks not having my own washer/dryer anymore.\n**TOTAL** | 16,582 | 26,200\n\n\nSo it looks like NYC is almost $10K more expensive per year, and if I hadn't lucked out with an awesome employer that pays for most of my food, my home Internet, my mobile phone, and most of my gym, I'd be looking at something close to a $15K difference in spending between DC and NYC.  That's in post-tax dollars.  It's obviously a very significant amount.  But wait, there's a missing piece.  I still own the house I was living in before, and am now renting it out.  That has to be factored in as well (otherwise the free rent before I moved here is cheating):\n\n\nCategory | $ | Comments\n---|---|---\nRental income | 28,800\nMortgage payments | -18,469 | This includes principal, but I was making some back in principal before moving here too, so we can ignore it for both.  It factors into the overall net worth calculation.\nMaintenance/repair | -1,995 | It was a rough year.  I had to replace a major appliance and have some plumbing/drywall repair done.\nTotal | 8,336 | This is still in pre-tax dollars though, so we want to convert it to post-tax:\nPost-tax total | ~5,000 | Assuming 40% total effective tax.\n\nSo add that figure in and NYC is only about $4,600 in post-tax dollars more expensive per year.  Not bad.  The increase in housing costs is mostly offset by the near total lack of transportation costs, and it's amazing to get eight hours of my life back every week that I don't have to spend commuting.  So I'd be willing to pay that $4,600 extra per year just to live in NYC even if I hadn't gotten a pay increase.  But, uhh, I did.  A big one:\n\n\nIncome Category | $ Pre-NYC | $ NYC | Comments\n---|---|---|---\nSalary | 100,000 | 122,677\nEquity | -- | 44,800 | My previous job didn't give me stock at all.\nBonus | 500 | 19,750 | The bonus at my last job was a joke, just a holiday bonus.\nOncall bonus | -- | 8,389 | I get this for being oncall periodically if issues arise.\n401k contributions | 1,000 | 9,000 | The previous job's matching was a joke.\nHSA contributions | -- | 1,000 | Didn't have an HSA at my previous job\n**TOTAL**|101,500|205,616\n\n\nMy total compensation for next year is on track to hit $230K, and once I get a promotion, hopefully at around that time, it should rise to $300K the following year.  I was pretty much topped out at my previous job, and could've expected to maybe reach $120K in another 2-3 years with steady raises or even a promotion.  I have most of my money invested in boring Vanguard index funds, and my net worth increased from $492K to $649K over the past 12 months, some due to stock market gains but most due simply to investing the majority of my income rather than spending it.  I'm on track to max out my 401k to the tune of $53K this year (my employer offers after-tax contributions with Roth conversions), my backdoor Roth IRA with $5.5K, and my HSA with $3,350.  So I've been able to save nicely and accumulate wealth even in the highest cost of living area in the nation, and who knows, I might eventually even be able to buy a condo here.\n\nSo anyway, that's why I don't think that worrying over high cost of living areas to the exclusion of all else is useful.  Yes, costs are more expensive.  It's still worth it if you get paid a lot more too, and that the average person is getting paid more is exactly what drives the cost of living of a city like NYC higher.  I doubled my compensation within a year and also have way more upside to grow into.  The job I'm doing here is not available at anything close to the same pay where I'm from.  It's more than about the money though; if you want to be at the top of a profession, you need to go to the center of it.  If you're a software engineer like me, go to San Francisco, New York City, or maybe Seattle.  That's where the good jobs are.  Salary gains comes from changing jobs frequently and being willing to move to wherever the best-paying jobs are.  Even if it's a wash in the short term, if you've created more future upside for your salary trajectory, then it's worth it.  Note: This calculus may be substantially different for people with kids, or for those unwilling to live with roommates and who don't have a similarly-high-earning partner.\n\nAnd to forestall the inevitable chorus of \"But you're not telling me anything; your 'solution' is just to make a shit-ton of money as a software engineer and then you can afford NYC!\", let me point out that most career-track jobs here pay significantly more than elsewhere.  Obviously don't move here if you don't have a high quality job lined up; you're going to get eaten alive by expensive rents if so.  But if you come here for a good career job, it's probably going to be worth the higher costs.  I have many friends who aren't software engineers who are also getting paid way more than they would elsewhere.  Lawyers, bankers, traders, project managers, media people, other sorts of engineers, and more are all making absolute *bank* in NYC.  And yes, I am paying a higher effective tax rate now, but it's only about 5% higher than where I'm from.  It doesn't come close to eating away most of the salary increase.\n\nOh, and as a final thought, I was shocked by how little money it turns out that I'm spending as a total percentage of my income.  I should probably be spending more.  You're only young once, right?  I need to go on more vacations, go visit more foreign countries, go see more plays and concerts, that kind of thing.","name":"t3_3di93i","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-16 16:14:05","week":29}

{"id":"3dj1kj","author":"JunkyTime","body":"Hi /r/personalfinance.  I need help with my planning out our family budget. I am a contractor and my wife teaches private music lessons.  We live in the Bay Area, and housing is really expensive.  We got lucky and put a down-payment on a small house with our savings last year and now we are paying less than we were when we were renting.  We also had a baby last year and have a cat and a dog and want to have another child.  My wife has been at home for the past year taking care of the kid.  We thought we would be able to have her be a stay at home mom and just teach private on the side for fun, but the reality of that plan isn't working out.  \n\nWould you guys be able to help me on fixing our budget?  I need some fresh perspective and ideas as I have been staring at the numbers and it feels like we aren't going to have enough if an emergency comes up unless we trim more, or my wife stops teaching and works full time instead of teaching and taking care of our child (both of which she loves).  I want to be able to support her but the numbers don't lie.  And if she went to work full time, she would probably only bring in $15 an hour, which would be $30k income, but most of that would go towards the cost of daycare.\n\nRight now we can't take a vacation unless I get another job on the weekends, or find a new line of work.  I don't even have a budget in there for new work clothes, or baby clothes at the moment.  If we cut all of the Discretionary Spending, that will save $302.08, but we use all of the things there all of the time.  It just seems a bit nuts that it is costing us $56,880 for just living.\n\nAny input and ideas on what to trim, optimizations, or suggestions are welcome.

She's only 22 but is already paying into an IRA, I on the other hand have not started an IRA or 401k of any sort. We are childfree so it's not like we are wanting to save our for our future family home or kids tuition.

{"id":"3dkf3b","author":"dbouslov","body":"I currently have 8 apps on my phone that earn me money without me having to do a single thing other than cash out. This number increases to 10 apps if I include Slidejoy and Adme which require me to slide an extra time when unlocking my phone (not a problem, and doesn’t really count as work IMO). With the eight apps, I am set to make slightly over $300 a year.  With Slidejoy and Adme, this sum increases to nearly $400. On my computer, I have 3 apps which combined earn me about $100 a year. Most of these applications are data collecting apps and websites which means that they monitor which websites you visit and what you search for on the internet (its alright, everyone knows you watch porn). As others have said, Google and other corporations already monitor and record all of this information, so why not get money for something that would be happening anyway. The majority of these websites and applications are based on your IP address so you can’t have more than one device collecting data. An exception for this is ScreenWise Trends panel which of course asks for a tablet, a phone and a computer; Media Insiders also allows for more than one mobile device to be connected.\n\n**Most of these are not available outside of the US**\n \n**Data Coup //\n[Link](http://www.datacoup.com)**\n\n* Payout: $1.01 per week, $52.52 per year\n* Cash out: Withdraw to a Visa or MasterCard debit card\n* Minimum withdrawal: $1**\n\nFirst up is a computer website. Datacoup asks you to connect various social media websites to it, which gives it access to information on the sites. For instance, once Twitter is connected, Datacoup gets your twitter hashtags, which device you are using and at what time you tweet. Most of this information isn’t difficult for one to get in the first place, so giving that information away isn’t that much of a problem, for me at least. The list of websites which you can connect is as follows: Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, FourSquare, Google+, Instagram, Tumbler, Last.fm and Meetup. I went ahead and made accounts for the websites that I didn't have accounts for, and the website registered them just fine. The website also gives you the option to connect your debit card and credit card, and allow them to receive transaction data on your accounts, but I’m not willing to give them that. The cards are labeled as high earning, while the majority of other websites are either low or medium.  The website is easy to use and supplies me with a nice $1.01 a week, although you could arguably earn more if you connected your cards.\n\n\n**Screenwise Trends Panel //\n[Link](http://www.screenwisetrends.com)**\n\n* Payout: $1-3 per week, $52-156 per year\n* Cash out:  Variety of gift cards including Amazon.com\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $25\n\nThe second computer website is run by google and is described by them as a ‘market research panel that studies how people use the internet’. This website has one of the highest payout of all of the other websites if you connect more than one device to it. Screenwise trends panel allows you to connect a computer, a smartphone and a tablet to one account. The more devices you have connected, the more you earn.  When you first sign up your devices, you get $2 for the computer, $4 for computer and a smartphone or tablet, and $6 for all three. You have to download a mobile app on the tablet and the smartphone, as well as install an extension for chrome. When you first sign up, it might show no activity for a week or so.\n \n**Mobile Performance Meter //\n[Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embeepay.mpm&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: $.70 a week, $36 a year\n* Cash out: A large variety of gift cards including amazon\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nThis application is fairly simple. You install it, answer a small survey and it automatically works in the background. The app also sometimes has surveys that usually payout around a dollar or so. I have noticed that this application does not affect my battery that bad compared to others such as screenwise trends panel. The point system works with you earning a set amount of points per day. I earn 10 points a day and since a 5 dollar gift card to amazon is 500 points, this translates to 70 cents a week since there are 7 days in a week. However, the earning varies on your location and phone so you may earn more or less than me.\n \n**Mobile Experience Meter //\n[Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embeepay.mx&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: $.35 a week, $18 a year (this number can be greater if point booster is turned on)\n* Cash out: A large variety of gift cards including amazon\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nThis application is made by the same people that made Mobile Performance Meter. I got 150 points when first joining which translates to a dollar and fifty cents. This app however only gives me 5 points a day unlike Mobile performance meter, which gives 10. There is an option to turn on ‘Point Booster’ which could increase the points earned to 10 or 15, but neither me nor a large majority of the users on the google play store said that it works for them. Keep in mind that just like Mobile Performance meter, the points vary and may give you more per day, or none at all. This application took me multiple times of opening it for it to start working and accept my phone.\n \n**AppOptix //\n[Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sa.appoptix.com&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: $10 every three months, $40 a year\n* Cash Out: Amazon only\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $10\n\nThis application is fairly simple and as soon as your application gets accepted, and you complete all of the required steps, the app starts working. You must send them an email and hope that you get accepted (most people do, and mine took half a day to get accepted). The earning system is very simple and you earn $10 every three months. They send you a $10 amazon code to your email. You start off with 100 points for completing your profile and a $10 gift card is 300 points. This app uses very little battery and data and I don’t even notice its presence.\n\n**Slidejoy //\n[Referral Link](https://www.getslidejoy.com/r/gbouslov.15266) /\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slidejoy&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: ~$4-5 per month, $48-60 per year\n* Cash Out: Paypal, Amazon and multiple other gift cards\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nSlidejoy is a lock-screen app that shows a non-obstrusive add on your lockscreen. You can swipe left to follow the ad to the source, or you can swipe right to go straight to your phone. This works very nice with Adme and I don't have any issues with either. You can cash out to a multitude of sources including PayPal, Square Cash, Google Play and you can even donate your money. Usually, you receive the money within a day of asking for it. The catch is that you can only cash out the money you earned in a month, two weeks later. So if you earned $5 in June, you'll only be able to cash out on July 15th or so. The app is optimized to spend as little data as possible and it typically spends 10mb or so every month. The UI is very clean and to be honest, it is a pleasure to use. I have cashed around $80 or so from this app since I started using it over a year ago.\n\n**Adme // Referral Code: 2QjRrcMgNZ /\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.adme&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: ~$4-5 per month, $48-60 per year\n* Cash Out: Paypal\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $10, twice monthly\n\nAdme is a great lock-screen application which is easy to use and constantly has promotions for you to earn more money. There are three earning modes (from least to highest). The higher modes show more ads. Be aware however, that if you decide to change to a lower mode, Adme will remove $.25 from your balance. What you see before you unlock your phone depends on your mode. For the highest mode, there is an ad as well as a sliding screen. Adme works flawlessly with other lock-screen apps such as Slidejoy and Fronto (don’t bother). You are able to cash out twice monthly, and I usually earn four dollars every month and can cash out once over 2 and a half months, this can be faster with their current referral bonus.\n \n**MI Mobile //\n[Website Link]( https://www.mediainsiders.com/index.php/memberlandingpage) /\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teleca.sam.engine&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: $1.25 per device, up to 3 devices. $.50 additional if you run mobile VPN and another $1.25 for computer VPN\n* Cash Out: Perk points (amazon, etc.)\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $5\n\nThis app monitors your phone activity. It can pay well, but it does take up a decent amount of battery and data. For the full loyalty program, you need one record of watching TV per week. It records little bits when it catches on to phrases from its database. They have you use a mobile VPN on your phone th. After a month or so, they will offer you the computer VPN for additional earning.  **BE WARNED**: Mobile VPN’s will get you banned from perktv and swagbucks.\n\n**Nielsen Mobile Panel //\n[Website Link]( https://mobilepanel.nielsen.com/enroll/home.do?type=load&amp;l=en_us&amp;pid=1) /\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nielsen.odm&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: ~$4 per week, ~$50 per year / 165 points per week, 8580 per year\n* Cash Out: Gift cards from variety of places including Amazon.com\n* Minimum Withdrawal: 700 Points\n\nThis application is similar to the other ones mentioned here because it is also a data collecting app. You simply have to make an account, fill out some information, install the mobile application and as long as it says active on it, you should be good to go earning over $50 a year. The application does not affect your battery life or devices performance, although the application will not work on some devices.\n \n**Smartphone Mate //\n[Website Link]( http://smartphonemate.mobi/us/) /\n[App Store Link]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartphonemate.smglobal&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: $3 per month, $36 per year\n* Cash Out: Amazon Gift Cards\n* Minimum Withdrawal: You don’t withdraw; you get the code emailed or texted to you\n\nOf all of the passive earners, this one seems to be the sketchiest to me personally. This is probably because of the websites ugly appearance. Some have said that this application works flawlessly, while others said that they have had some issues with it. The app sends out data twice daily without you having to do anything, and it must be active for 20 days in a calendar month for you to be eligible for the amazon coupons. Smartphone mate allows you to have only one device registered per user.\n\n**Panel App // \n[Ref](http://www.placed.com/panel/panels/711b0c40f1da/signup?rid=5dac46e5a7d9) / [IOS Nonref](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/panel-app/id564010216?mt=8) / [IOS Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sewichi.client.panel&amp;hl=en)**\n\n* Payout: ~1000 points per month, ~12000 points per year. ~$20 per year\n* Cash Out: Paypal or Amazon\n* Minimum Withdrawal: 3000 points - $2\n\nThis app is very simple to use and is almost unnoticeable on your phone. Although it isn't a fast earner, $20 a year for doing nothing is pretty nice to have. You get 33 points per day so around 1000 points per month. Panel App also has sweep stakes to win giftcards as well as short surveys that reward you with 33 points for answer questions about where you were during certain times of the day. You receive 10% of your referrals earnings, and 5% of the points your extended referrals earn(referrals of referrals). Overall, a simple easy to use app that pays.\n \n**Vagex // \n[Ref Link]( http://vagex.com/?ref=339950) /\n[Non Ref Link]( http://vagex.com/)**\n\n* Payout: Run 24/7 on a computer could earn a couple of dollars per week\n* Cash Out: Sell on Fiver\n* Minimum Withdrawal: $1\n\nFirst off, yes I know it sounds like some sort of feminine hygiene product. With that out of the way, this is an old website, but could still be pretty good with referrals. The website works as follows, you install a program that auto surfs YouTube videos on your account, likes them and subs to the person. Each of these actions earns 1 point, with 60 second videos earning two points. They also have a Firefox add-on that you can run along side the program. You can leave the application running constantly as it is pretty stable. Their referral program is pretty interesting with every share to facebook or twitter giving you 1000 points (these can be posted daily). The referral link program is pretty interesting as well. If I refer you, you get 100 extra credits and I earn 1 credits for every credit that you earn. If done right, this website can be pretty promising. Vagex can also be used to get views for your youtube videos as well.\n\n\n**FreeEats // [Non-Ref Link](https://www.Freeeats.com)**\n\n* Payout: $1 for registration, $1 per text received\n* Cash Out: Paypal                                             \n* Minimum Withdrawal: No withdrawal, gets instantly sent to paypal\n\nThis is a trustworthy app that sends you texts to your phone, and you get instantly paid to PayPal. You get a dollar for signing up and each text that you receive is worth $.25. Sometimes, texts lead to a survey which pays out $1 each or $10 if you are one of the first 25 to respond to it. The amount of texts that you get varies, but most people get a text a week or a couple a month. For following my referral link you get an additional $.25 and the referrer gets $1. Essentially, a very easy app that requires no work post registration.\n\n**Qmee // [Ref Link](http://qm.ee/4B136D78) / [Non-Ref](https://qmee.com)**\n\n* Payout: $0.01 - $.25 for simply clicking one link\n* Cash Out: Paypal\n* Minimum Withdrawal: None!\n\nThis is a very simple to use extension to your browser. After searching something, you may get a little bar that pops up to the left of your screen. It will have links for ads that you can click to follow and get money instantly added to your account. Following the links are completely optional and you don't have to do it. Sometimes these ads are helpful, for instance when I was searching for a car charger, a good deal came up and I bought it. I get a $1 or so a week for simply doing what I would be doing anyway. \n\n**With all of these methods, you should be on your way to earning ~$500 dollars every year without having to do a single thin other than cash out. If you enjoyed the guide, feel free to use my referral links.**\n","name":"t3_3dkf3b","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-17 01:59:50","week":29}

From my experience I might make the cut-off at 1 million on books.  What about categories for Home &amp; Kitchen do people just follow the top 5% or 1% rule?

{"id":"3dkmso","author":"[deleted]","body":"Currently I am receiving assistance with rent, car payments and tuition via family and student loans. For the sake of my planning I am not currently focussed on my student loans. I will save this for when I am gainfully employed as they are currently in interest-free status while I am enrolled.\n\nSome damage is going to be necessary for my current plan. I am looking to minimize my damage while focussing on what matters right now. (24/m/Canada)\n\nThat being said here are the expenses I am responsible for:\n\nGroceries/supplies/general expenses\nCar Insurance\nGas &amp; Car maintenance\nGym &amp; Health\n\nI use Mint.com and it is clear that 85% of my monthly expenses are:\n\ninsurance: $300 \n\ngas: $100-$200 (2-4 tanks of gas in Canada a month)\n\nGroceries/fastfood/supplements/toiletries: $250\n\nGym: $56\n\nRecreation: 0-$200+ a month (currently frugal, won't be when I am networking among my field in the fall) \n\nMisc: Just cleaned up all the body work on my car with some birthday money. Purchased all of my school supplies and expensive supplements for the next year... Clothes are needed.\n\nYou get the picture. I'm spending more than I'm making while not doing much. I can be more frugal and that's my goal.\n\n\nIncome: Depends on shifts I can get with an experiential marketing firm and freelance work I do related to my field. Usually less than $1000 a month and definitely will be once school is back in session. Likely &gt;$500 a month unless I pursue UberX like I've been eyeing.\n\nCash: $1500 in bank for Gym Payments, Insurance Payments and CC payments in the long run.\n\n**Now the reason I posted.** I have 4k in CC debt. Unfortunately I didn't understand credit cards well enough and thought that me having several lines of credit was counting in favor of my debt vs equity. \n\nI have 4k all on one CC, the Amazon Chase Canada card @ 19.99% and did not bother to accept the increase on my other Canadian Tire Financial Services card at 13.99%\n\nCurrent Credit Lines:\n\nAmazon Chase Canada, $4000/$5000 @ **19.99%**\n\nCTFS $0/$500 @ **13.99%**\n\nHBC Financial $0/$1200 @ **29.99%**\n\n\n~~(Student Loan)~~\n\n(Car Payment is not under my name)\n\n\nCash: $1500\n\nAsset: $10,000 car nearly paid off (family gift sort of, I did the down payment $5k)\n\nNow my very limited understanding in the short term and long term should be this. I am looking for assistance in evaluating my strategy.\n\n**Short term**: Stay in and remain frugal and increase debt slightly on CTFS to 30% of $500 (lol) rather than increasing Amazon Chase more than necessary. I called CTFS and they would not increase my limit. Should I not make the CTFS credit history ugly for $200? Should I open another card elsewhere? I am also going to look in to a better insurance rate now that I have a bachelor's degree, apparently banks care about that. Everyone keeps telling me mines insane (its been going down slightly..)\n\nSidenote: I read online a long time that you should keep your first CC a free CC and squeeky clean with a low limit that you use regularly and pay off for a good credit history in the future. My CTFS card is my first card. Is there any merit to this strategy? I'm assuming its BS if I'm just blowing up another card anyways.\n\n**Long term**: my understanding that a long term strategy would be to open a line of credit. I don't think any bank would offer me one. What is a more viable long term strategy? \n\nMy bank has offered me a not-so-low (13% if I recall) interest rate card with free transfers for a period but with only a 1k CC limit. I considered this method but am not quick to opening more credit lines until I am sure it is an optimal solution for the long run. \n\nBasically, debt is a necessity as I enter into an ultra competitive final year of school. Financial freedom is not my current goal. One year of crushing shit in my field, with debt, is my goal. I will be living close to campus. I am already looking at using their gym instead (for free/included) if it is good. \n\nWhat lines should I close? What, if anything, should I look in to opening?\n\nThanks for the help guys.\n\nP.S.

{"id":"3dlcy3","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hey guys, thanks for reading.\n\nI'm currently in a position in life where I have the opportunity to start moving forward from the stagnant point of life I'm in right now. I feel like minimizing my debt seems to be somewhere I can start to get there.\n\nMore relative to finance here's where my background looks like. I currently live in a communal house, no car payments, and am fairly stable outside of my debts. I'm not behind on anything in terms of not being able to make minimum payments or not being able to pay my bills but here's what the break down looks like.\n\nMonthly bills:\n\n$500 - Rent\n\n$200 - Phone bill (I pay for myself and my brother)\n\n$90 - Car Insurance\n\n$30 - Gym Membership\n\n\n\n\nDebts:\n\nAmazon Rewards Card - $800\n\nBank of America Credit - $5800\n\nAmerican Express - $1300\n\nChase Slate - $1000\n\nPayPal Credit - $2000\n\nCiti Bank Credit - $5500\n\n\nI made tons of uneducated decisions on my credit usage in the past couple years and I'm set on doing what I need to in order to progress in life. Certain cards I'm paying large portions of the balance while some I have to maintain paying the minimum balances. The PayPal and BoA credit lines are currently on 0% promos while the rest are anything between 11%-19% APR.\n\nI'm currently only working 20 hours at my current job making $35/hr and I'm struggling to make a dent at my debt because I'm making minimum payments for a lot of them.\n\nIs consolidating even an option? I don't know the process and am a bit intimidated to even look into it. Kind of at a loss to be honest. My bad decision making has led to me making minimum payments and strolling along life accepting those small payments as numerous small bills I just need to pay each month. I truly want to change things and I'm not sure where to start. Was hoping you guys could help.","name":"t3_3dlcy3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-17 07:12:54","week":29}
{"id":"3dli4f","author":"GreedyLiLGoblin","body":"TLDR: Cashflow is King! I messed mine up and need help restarting!\n\nHello all, I wanted to give a little insight to my online sales business based on Ebay &amp; Amazon. I was able to turn my life around from college dropout with $80K in debt to having a networth of $100K in 4 years. I'd also like to share my current struggles in the recent months and seek your advice on how to get out of my rut.\n\nI started by selling used smartphones on eBay &amp; Amazon. When I started in 2011 I was in debt and in trouble with my college grades. Then one day I received a call that my younger brother had totaled my car which was a disaster for me at the time. However the silver lining was the insurance company paid out $5k for the car. I took this money and bought a real old beater of a car, 97' Nissan Stanza, from my one of my professors for $500. \n\nWith $4K left after taking care of a view other expenses I was determined to start some kind of business. My business was a very simple one. I began by posting ads to craigslist stating that I was buying smartphones for cash and included my phone number where they could reach me. I would quote them based on 50-60% of the going rate for phones online. Once I bought it I would clean it up, reset it and sell it online. By offering immediate cash for a phone I was able to remove their risk of selling items online even if it meant they took less.\n\nMy first year I was able to do $100K in gross sales or about $20K in net profit. My second year I grew total sales to $500K but I saw a reduction in my margins and only netted about $60K. By my 3rd and 4th year I was able to grow that number to $1 million in gross sales each year. However my margins have shrunk even further to be about 8% over both years. This year, 2015, I have seen my total sales take a serious dive and I am on pace for less than $500k in sales and I may see margins of less than 5%. \n\nI will say my networth should easily be double the amount it is today but I have made a series of careless mistakes. Please learn from these so that you may avoid them.\n\n1. Laziness, I became too comfortable with buying phones. I stopped preforming full checks on phones before buying them. This lead to multiple expensive phones being sold to me with defects. Many of the other problems I list below are all related to this issue.\n\n2. Disorganized, I was able to get away with being disorganized from the beginning and this problem only grew as my business grew. Running before you can walk is a bad philosphy. Get organized and stay organized from the being. The extra accounting bills and late fees I have paid over the years amount due to this issue have amounted to over $10K. But worse than this is the time I've wasted from having things misplaced or redoing work.\n\n3. Lack of Planning, had a custom website built from scratch that ended up being a failure. The website was designed to allow customers to receive a quote online than print a prepaid postage label to mail in to me for a check. This cost me over $10K to be designed and I hadn't even thought about I would maintain it after it was built. I also didn't know enough about website building and programming which led to me receiving a poorly functioning product that I couldn't fix without spending massive amounts of money.\n\n4. Lack of Focus! This is my biggest mistake. I have constantly tried to do too many different projects at once preventing me from excelling at anyone task. I opened a retail store that sold pre-paid phones and plans in 2014 however I was still trying to run a full-time eBay &amp; Amazon business at the same time. The store itself was in great location and had the opportunity to be quite successful but me being split between running it and eBay caused it to fizzle out and forced me to close. Luckily the store did not lose money for me in the end. What I did after I closed my store was my biggest mistake. I began buying inventory that was completely out of my field of knowledge thinking I could resell. This included a wide of range of damaged freight goods that has mainly ended up as dead stock or caused me to break even.\n\nI have been extremely lucky to have maintained as much wealth as I have. However I still have over $30K tied up in slow or deadstock inventory. I am now losing money every day and need to find a solution to turn around my business. It is an absolutely terrifying feeling watching your hard work slowly erode. At times it feels as if there is nothing I can do to stop it. I have sacrificed way too much in the way of time, friends and freedom to give up now! I need your help in coming up with a strategy to turn things around\n\nI want to refocus and get back to what worked in the past. My plan is a follows: \n1. I am having an initial line up of 3 private label products produced specifically to be sold for Amazon FBA. This will allow me to scale by having a third party handle shipping and customer service. I can focus most my energy on promoting the product.\n\nTHIS IS WHERE I NEED YOUR ADVICE!\n2. I would like to get back to buying only smartphones for resale on Amazon &amp; eBay. I used to be able to advertise on craigslist to reach local customers, however craigslist has recently made changes. It prevents listings that post buying requests online in my area. I need help in finding new ways to reach potential local customers who'd be interested in selling their smartphones. All suggestions will be appreciated!\n\nSorry for the long winded story but I felt I needed to share. Please send any ideas about how to reach a local audience with the message of wanting to buy their smartphones. It is a very stressful time in my life but I'm going to keep fighting until I find something that works.\n","name":"t3_3dli4f","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-17 08:14:36","week":29}

{"id":"3dlyc5","author":"AmySharpton","body":"Fri, July 17, 2015: Today's free Amazon android app of the day is: Doodle God!\n\n   \n   \nApplication Description:\n   \n   \n Simple and intuitive gameplay\n   \n   \n How many elements and items can you create?\n   \n   \n With a name like Doodle God, you might think this is a simple doodling app. Wrong! In this game you mix fire, water, earth, air, and more to create storms, build armies, and grow civilizations. The graphics may be simple doodles, but make no bones about it--in this game, you are an almighty god!\n   \n   \n Gameplay\n   \n   \n \"In the beginning there was only Doodle God.\" This proclamation kicks off your adventure in godhood. The premise of the game is simple: mix the four basic elements to create new ones, then mix those together, and so on. For example, by combining fire and air, you make energy. Mix fire and water and you make... alcohol? Why not--you're a god, after all.\n   \n   \n Limitless Possibilities (Well, Almost)\n   \n   \n Keep combining because your first assignment is to create more than 100 items (dust, clouds, dolphins, etc.). The full app boasts almost 200 items and concepts, much more than the online game. Your ultimate goal? To forge your own complete world, right down to the insects and mud. Can you do it in less than seven days (or seven hours)? Doodle God dares you to try.\n   \n   \n It Can Be Punny\n   \n   \n Just to keep it fun, Doodle God throws in relevant quotes and maxims along the way. For example, when you mix water and earth to create a swamp, the app tells you a joke: \"What do swearing frogs say? Oh, bull frog!\" OK, we said they were fun, not funny.\n   \n   \n PLEASE NOTE: This app lets you purchase digital content using actual money. You can configure parental controls for in-app purchases, which will require your Amazon account password or a 4-digit PIN, by going to the Settings menu from within the Amazon Appstore.\n   \n   \n   \n from GeekExile: Free App of the Day from Amazon! http://ift.tt/1gEAbzU\n   \n via [IFTTT](http://ift.tt/16Xitlp)\n   \n   \n from Blogger http://ift.tt/1CKSPlS","name":"t3_3dlyc5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-17 12:01:58","week":29}

Yesterday i decided i'll just go for it and built a site from scratch.\n\n**The result is [MinecraftGifts.link](https://minecraftgifts.link/)**\n\n### Thoughts that ran into it\n\n* The internationalisation, at this moment the _shop_ tracks prices from 7 different amazons that you can switch between. I am not sure if i make proper language versions out of this mechanic in order to make it properly indexable by google, at the moment just the prices are different and everybody starts with the US prices (as the products are also most complete there).\n* I used Minecraft because i have already have on topic traffic for that. But i plan to _copy_ this site for other topics if it works out somehow.\n* Yes it is _yet another_ amazon affilate, without _real value_ that kind of copy cats this is why i am broke. But i did a bit of research and think on topic gift idea sites for specific fandoms could work out. Especially for ideas for parents.\n* There is a Twitter account bound to it [@minecraft_gifts](https://twitter.com/minecraft_gifts) that tries hourly with a 1/10 chance to post one of the current \"on sale\" items on Twitter.\n* It has all the SEO essentials plus Twitter Cards &amp; Facebook OG on products.\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* Sorting is more or better a joke currently as Masonry (the Pinterest style type wall) orders them like it wants anyway.\n* ~~I totally forgot about a search mechanic.~~\n* It produces some Error 500 once in a while when products keep failing to read from amazon for a few tries.\n* The style is a bit to minimalistic, to less _call to action-i_\n\n### Plans\n\n* Create/Get Facebook ad images and advertise there.\n* Write better product descriptions for Products that people are interested in.\n* Buy some Traffic trough Minecraft specific ad networks.\n\nI think like i am missing some basic marketing stuff here.

{"id":"3dmwbg","author":"simply_pixie","body":"I am trying desperately to rebuild my credit, in my late 30s, to position myself to buy a home as soon as possible [realistic timeframe for this goal is 3-5 years, hopefully sooner]. \n\nI have zero credit cards - just my bank account and my debit card. Oh, I also have the c/c that my school loads any overage of loans/grants onto - it's a Mastercard but acts more like a debit card. \n\nI took a year off from school [personal things] and plan to return in January, I plan to only go part-time and Pell should cover all that just fine. \n\nCredit info: I have a mid-600 credit score. \n\nMost recent/current credit/debt activity: \n* my car [loan origination was 2013 (with a co-signer); re-fied thru my credit union in March 2015 for $11k (on my own!)] \n* my son's birth [from 2010, $1,400] \n* school loans totaling $7k. \n\nPast debt: Everything else is old like anywhere from 7-19yo. My 'old' debt totals about $9k. One is from a gym from when I was 19yo, some smaller medical bills, &amp; a phone bill that I have no idea what it is regarding. \n\nMy current situation is: I work full-time [&amp; plan to go to school part-time again]. Income - $31k [bring home after taxes, 401k &amp; health costs is about $24k]. I don't want to count child support bc that is for my son &amp; I maintain all living expenses on my paychecks alone. Company-based 401k balance: about $900. Nothing currently in savings [boo!]. All monthly bills are paid on time or early &amp; paid to a zero balance every month.\n\nThings I would like to accomplish:\n* establish a 529 Savings Plan for my son, as soon as possible [could probably do that out of child support as it would be directly for him].\n* get those old debts off my record [can they just die already?]  \n* start saving for a house\n* earn my AA with minimal add'l debt\n\nI read/was told somewhere that a solid way to rebuild your credit is to get a small balance credit card, or two, and ask for balance increases when it's appropriate &amp; after good payment history is established. I am not super zestful about getting a c/c just bc I don't want to get too comfortable owning one however, I am not sure how to show revolving credit without one. \n\nHere are some of my options:\n* Get a $200 secured Discover It card. Pay on it perfectly for 12-16mos and then ask for non-secured Discover It card. \n* My credit union offers a $400 secured card as well but the rep stated that after 6mos of good car pymts [which could be Sept/Oct], I would likely be approved for an unsecured card. \n* apply for scholarships [plan to use FastWeb.com]\n\nI would plan to make small purchases, like gas or Amazon-spending, on the credit card. Small things that I could afford anyway [$20-40 here &amp; there] and then pay the balances before the bills are due. \n\n*I am at work and typing this kind of fast - if you feel I am missing pertinent info, just ask. The text window is 2\" big and I likely overlooked something. If my text seems jumbled, it probably is, just ask. :) I was exposed to minimal, even counterproductive, financial practices when I was younger and am just trying to accomplish things on my own so please don't flame me in any way. \n\nThanks in advance!","name":"t3_3dmwbg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-17 17:50:25","week":29}

{"id":"3drk6r","author":"Fishering","body":"It's time for another Amazon Gift Card Giveaway! And this time it's going to be a lot more interesting!\n\n### Amazon Gift Card Giveaway\n\nPlease upvote for visibility. \n\n**Hello once again! It's been a few weeks and I have a lot of amazon gift cards just sitting here. This giveaway will be seeing a lot more winners (maybe) than my other ones. Much like my previous giveaways on this site, this will be a test. Unlike my other giveaways which were just luck, this giveaway will test how greedy you are, because in this giveaway, you will be picking the prize.**\n\n&gt; **How it works:**\n&gt; **Once you get on [the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OozDbeIQyzJL4xNfRec6q2mboIxEgEwV-nUD7adb8kg/viewform?usp=send_form), you will have to make a decision. You can either pick $0.50, $1, $2, $3, or $5. Once the giveaway closes, the value that has the least total $ accumulated will be the winning number, and everybody who selected that number will get that on an amazon gift card.**\n\nNow to clarify how this will work, here's an example. If 5 people select $0.50, 3 select $1, $2, $3, and $5, the total for $0.50 is $2.50. Total for $1 is $3, $6, $9, $15. Since the lowest total value of $2.50 was the $0.50 selection, everybody who selected $0.50 will get a gift card worth $0.50. Hopefully that makes sense. \n\n&gt; **Rules of Entry**\n\n* Your reddit account must be at least 14 days old\n* Must have plenty of activity throughout reddit. (I will determine if you qualify).\n* You must not be on the [universal scammer list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalScammerList/wiki/banlist)\n* One entry per account (per person). \n\n**Reminder, I will manually be checking each account throughout today and tomorrow which takes a lot of time, so don't try to cheat the system. Thanks.**\n\n# [The Form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OozDbeIQyzJL4xNfRec6q2mboIxEgEwV-nUD7adb8kg/viewform?usp=send_form) \n\n**Please upvote this post for viewability.** This giveaway will end roughly 24 hours after this is posted, and must have atleast 100 entries. Whichever comes second. \n\n\n**Edit 1: Post has been up for not even 30 minutes and there are already quite a few entries.. As I watch these roll in I think it would be extremely fair to say that the results are quite shocking so far.**\n\n**Edit 2: 9:06 PM CST - Over 120 entries. I am now starting to manually approve entries... All I can say right now, is that this is the most pitiful giveaway I have *ever* done. Hopefully there's a lot more people to enter yet who can maybe turn this thing around. ;)**\n\n**Edit 3: 10:10 PM CST - To the douche bag who just did [this](http://prntscr.com/7ucfof), fuck you. But shoutout to /u/ThatArdvark anyways! *even though your account def. does not qualify for this giveaway. Sorry.**\n\nEdit 4: 4:43 PM CST (next day) - This is now closed! The results will be posted shortly!","name":"t3_3drk6r","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2015-07-18 21:44:33","week":29}

I released an eBook today and am offering it for FREE to those who are interested. I have seen a couple hundred downloads already and am the #1 bestselling book in multiple free sections on Amazon.\n\n\n[HERE IS A LINK TO THE BOOK](http://www.amazon.com/YouTube-Learn-YouTubers-Complete-Guide-ebook/dp/B011TI8ELI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437269216&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=youtubers+who)\n\n\nIf you are not from the US, search.... YouTube: Learn From YouTubers Who Made It - A Complete Guide on How to Get More Views and Make Money and you can find it.\n\n\n**Here is the description on the book**\n\n\nLearn from YouTubers who built their YouTube channel and following from nothing. Read the story of how they gained thousands of subscribers, millions of views, and so much more. In this unique guide, you’ll read everything from how to gain initial leverage, how to rapidly grow a channel, and how to keep viewers coming back excited to view more content. The approach from Brad and Brian Scruggs is bit unconventional and the tactics are not widely known by many people. It is surely worth the download.\n\n\nUnlike a lot of successful YouTubers who gained success, the YouTube team did not spend a single cent on marketing and did everything through hard work, dedication, and learning different marketing tactics. Because they are no longer active on YouTube and pursuing other dreams, they have written out all the tips, tricks, and secrets for you to benefit.\n\n\nTheir channel, FifaTipzHD, revolved around the popular EA Sports series, FIFA. Leveraging their acquired success, they were able to establish strategic partnerships with EA Sports and other companies in the gaming sector. Their popularity allowed them to acquire free products, be flown out on trips, and compete in tournaments with prizes in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\nThe information in this book is not only relevant for gaming YouTubers. The book is written in a way that it can be related to any niche. Information such as YouTube's algorithm and how to analyze your analytics is discussed in great detail.\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? The rest of the story and the secrets of how they did it are right at your fingertips.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nscruggs92","name":"t3_3dskyg","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-19 03:29:11","week":29}

Does anyone use this? My one year contract is about up, and I want to hear any other options. I already have Netflix and Amazon prime. I was planning on adding sling for the sports, and getting a high quality antenna for local options. Are there any cheap alternatives to record shows as well? My wife and I are out a lot and mostly watch recordings. \n\nWe will also be adding a third TV once our basement is done and adding that third box for a space that we won't use on a daily basis would be so wasteful in my mind. \n\nFor shows we love, Money suggested just waiting and buying seasons a la carte that aren't available through Netflix or other streaming services. Takes loads of patience and avoiding spoilers, but I want to reward good shows, and not download them. \n\nI've had cable all my life, I think it is time we change the way we watch TV and embrace this change. \n\nEdit: /r/cordcutters got it thanks guys. \n\nEdit 2: I get it, I also read, don't tell me you only read, I don't believe you.

{"id":"3dv2yd","author":"Bir5150","body":"For some background, my mother passed away in 2011. She was self employed, was a trained graphic designer and fanned out into designing books. She did book design for actual clients and then found a way to self publish books in the public domain through booksurge/createspace on Amazon. She got a decent volume of books out there in paperback for a decent price and maybe pulled in a couple hundred bucks per year for a short amount of effort. \n\nObviously when she died her business died with her except that her books are still available on Amazon and so I would imagine that income is being generated but no checks seem to come to her at her former address. Candidly when she died it wasn't on the top of my to-do list to track this down. \n\nBut now that some time has passed I stumbled on some papers in cleaning out some of my stuff and it reminded me. \n\nJust wondering if anyone has any thoughts on best ways to proceed. For more detail.. We (my father and I) handled her estate through probate without a will. Long story there but she did have a will but the names executor had since become someone with whom the family never spoke. Not sure it's useful to the story but just thinking that if I call up createspace and say \"hey I'm bir5150 and my mother left this publishing stuff behind\" they may ask for some court documentation on her estate. \n\nTL;DR: Late mother published/sold books through createspace, they are still being sold, want to get access to the income stream.

This generally was a bad idea, and I don't recommend it - probably 30-50% of the time I was unhappy with the quality.  I was trying to fill out an online store, so it wasn't a huge deal, usually.  And I was buying/selling cheaper stuff, so I generally didn't buy orders that cost more than a few hundred dollars.  Only once or twice was something completely unsellable.  And in my experience, forget about getting a refund or money back when you don't get what you expect (regardless of whose fault it is).\n\n2. I only did this once, and the total cost for the freight forwarder was about $700 for a pallet of goods from the Port of Seattle to my local UPS store (where I have my PO box).  If you are genuinely interested, I'll look up the invoice.\n\n3. I heard that this isn't possible - only approved/regulated carriers can go in the port, but I don't know for sure.

Amazon would take about $3.50 ea, leaving you a profit of around $0.60 each.  But 50 for $118, and the profit is instead around $1 each.  Buy 3000 and the profit is around $1.50 (or around $5000 if you sell them all).\n\n\nAlibaba claims to have manufacturers willing to sell them for as low as $0.10 each, but that doesn't include all the import costs, and you have to take listed prices with a grain of salt. Sometimes they are real prices, sometimes not.\n\nNote that the brain stress things listed above aren't actually a good idea to sell for a few reasons, that's just an example of my thought process when I was selling.

The average sales rank for that item is approaching 100,000 which means it sales about once every two days. That sale would be spread around between all sellers that are similarly priced.

The problem with easily available goods on Amazon is that once competition comes around, each person starts dropping their prices a couple of pennies at a time in order to be priced 1 cent cheaper than their competitor.

{"id":"ct1zbcz","author":"WaitForIttttt","body":"I find the opportunity cost is usually easier to see with time-saving measures rather than cost-saving ones.  For example, instead of (using this example) making my own soap, I probably could work overtime from home and make $20 in the same amount of time. The reality, though, is that I'm probably more likely to want some down time and kill some time on Reddit.  As a reverse example, slow cooker liners are one of my favorite time-savers ever.  If you buy in bulk on Amazon Prime, you can get them for $0.58/each.  It saves me about 3 minutes that I would spend trying to clean my slow cooker (mine is really heavy and slippery) and eliminates the water/soap I would need to do it.  Worth it for me.\n\n\nThat said, it's all relative.  There will always be people whose situations give them more time to do things that even save small amounts of money and there will always be people whose situations allow for them to pay for goods/services that would cost a lot more than DIY/cheaper options.

{"id":"ct1zm7n","author":"garageprofits","body":"Hello, I am new to Reddit, but I have been doing this sort of thing for a while now. \n\n1.  I usually start by negotiating a price on the full order, so they know whether or not to take you seriously. Then, request they send you a sample.  I usually pay the same rate I would for the full order, but shipping can certainly add to the cost.  If it isn't overly large or heavy, the sample might add $20-30 to come by air. Another option for samples is to start on a site like AliExpress. They are setup to sell single items to the US market.  Many times I have started with AliExpress, then negotiated a bulk rate after I receive the sample product. \n\n2. The first time I imported, I paid the shipping charges and cleared it through customs myself. The second time I used a Broker/Forwarder.  Since they combine all their customer's shipments into one container, it actually cost me LESS (including their fees) than it did to just pay shipping. Much less of a hassle. I highly recommend finding someone that can combine the shipping and handle the customs brokerage. (see answer to question 3) Be sure to pay attention to the import duty when calculating your total cost.   You will have to pay this no matter how you bring in the goods. Here is a handy calculator: https://www.dutycalculator.com/  I am happy to walk through this in more detail. \n\n3. Whether or not you can walk it through customs yourself depends on the value of the goods, and frankly on the friendliness of the customs agent you encounter.  I think the advantage of being so close to the port is that you will save on shipping.  If you find a local broker, chances are they have a warehouse near the dock. I would make a few calls and ask them to break down their fees.  Here is a list of brokers that serve the LA ports: http://apps.cbp.gov/brokers/index.asp?portCode=2704\n\n4. I do all of the above.  My own site, Amazon, Amazon FBA, and eBay, along with some niche sites. I actually started by selling my samples to make sure the market was there!  Most of this is just experimentation and scaling up what works. \n\n5. I am in Utah, and I needed a sales tax account setup so I can collect and pay sales tax to customers in Utah.  Probably the same in CA, but I am not sure. \n\n6. no personal experience, sorry!\n\nI hope some of that helps.

{"id":"ct2qaj5","author":"mysliceofthepie","body":" Okay. I am a baby money saving pro. \n1) start buying diapers now, with coupons. A sack of nb, two size 1, fpur size 2, and then lots of 3 and above. You will undoubtedly need more of the smaller sizes but you never know how many. Size 3 is when babe starts to fit them longer. If either are diaper snobs (I am, no shame) look into bundles offered by the company or a carrier like amazon or diapers.com. Do the math though, you may wind up spending a little more with a bundle than you would on your own. You could also consider cloth diapering. Even if it's only one diaper a day, it adds up.\n2) clothes: look for hand-me-downs, shop thrift shops (particularly ones in affluent areas... you will find a lot of nice/new stuff in those ones) and get on buy/sell/trade pages for baby stuff. Cheap clothes on there, plus what family and friends buy you, you'll rarely have to actually buy anything full price.\n3) skip the crib and cosleep. Look up the rules for responsible bed sharing and follow them. It reduces the risks of SIDS and increases bonding/ease of infant night care. If bedsharing is too much, then just get a pack n play for the room that has a higher and lower bottom setting for when the baby is a nb and then when they are bigger. You can even \"convert\" them into a toddler bed by cutting the netting off one side so they can let themselves in and out. By the time they go into their own room, they can have a big person bed. Skip an actual toddler bed too, those and cribs are, the biggest waste of money.\n4) BREASTFEED. Also increases bonding for mom and reduces SIDS for baby. Tell mom to spend a lot on a pump. You really get what you pay for. I am also a Breastfeeding Counseling student in need of free counseling hours logged before I can get certified, so if you want free help, hit me up (seriously). Also, she doesn't need to buy expensive nursing bras. Maybe a few that give good shape when needed, but stretchy sports bras from Walmart are much better and waaaay cheaper.\n5) Do your research on products that are staples, like baby carriers and diaper bags. If you can't/won't log hours reading reviews, at LEAST look at the \"Best of 201X\" lists some baby sites compile. You'll more likely end up with something you like more at a price you enjoy more if you just scroll through a stores bags, open tabs to what you like, and then narrow based on price and reviews, but it's your call. On major items like a baby carrier, breast pump, stroller (or as I call it, my personal shopping cart) you shouldn't be super stingy. Be frugal, but if the reviews point you in the direction of a stroller that is $100 more expensive than the cheapest one, trust it. That $100 will be well spent when you have a quality product that works well, is safe for your kid, and doesn't break on you ASAP, forcing you to buy yet another. \n6) speaking of spending, buy an All-in-one car seat. They tend to start at $150, but they are Worth. It. Why would you buy an infant seat for $80, a 3-in-one for $120, and then a booster for $40 when you can shell out $150 right away and get them all, for cheap and forever? Personally, I have the Graco 4ever and I recommend it hands down. It's about $250, before BRU coupon, but I have put my daughter in a cheap seat and the difference is amazing. She is much happier and more comfortable in that seat. At the very least, make sure your car seat COMES WITH neck pads to pretect their little necks from belt burn. Do NOT just buy separate pads and affix them to whatever seat. They are not crash tested or safe.\n7) download the apps to your frequent baby stores (mine are Target and Babies R Us) and always check the online price of whatever you are going to buy. This alone has saved me hundreds. Target also has a coupon app called Cartwheel, and you should check Amazon too. Especially if you get/have prime, waiting two days for something you don't need immediately while saving money is no big deal. \n\nIf I think of anything I have missed, I will tell you. Also, pardon any typos as it is very late here.","name":"t1_ct2qaj5","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-14 10:46:21","week":29}

Hopefully you have a good eBook cover for each one, as this truly matters when it comes to selling eBooks.\n\nBack to your original question. I don't see why you wouldn't be able to do this for the $500 as I suggested. Find a woocommerce template on ThemeForest that fits the look/feel of what you have in mind and start from there. \n\nTwo i found that are related to selling ebooks/books: \nhttp://themes.crunchpress.com/?theme=book-store-wp\nhttp://themeforest.net/item/papirus-ultimate-wordpress-book-store/full_screen_preview/7970443\n\nMake sure your eBook product pages are descriptive and have as much information about each eBook as you can have without giving away the meat of the eBook. It will help your SEO. Again, having a good ebook cover for each one will help *dramatically* with sales.\n\nTo to summarize: \n\n1 - find a good ebook selling theme, probably wordpress/woocommerce as many developers are very familiar with this platform\n\n2 - Make sure all products have solid descriptions for product pages. Use amazon as a guide - http://www.amazon.com/E-book-Sell-Your-First-Million-ebook/dp/B00OF9L7NG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436894993&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=e-book\n\n3 - hire a coder for $250 or less to install everything and even upload products. \n\n4 - Spend $100 in adwords (find a $100 coupon too, they're still out there. Maybe in your cpanel) and target your audience carefully and track your results.\n\nGo from there. \n","name":"t1_ct34zhy","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-14 19:32:29","week":29}

All that time I was afraid he to ask him to split the money because he would feel I was judging him because I ACTUALLY WAS JUDGING HIM.

I admit calling his issues \"a little phase\" was extremely unfair out of context. But he was genuinely just stressed out, not depressed. I take depression VERY seriously. He had already expressed to me that he needed a pause and some space to recharge himself. He is MUCH better now and has taken back over some of the parenting duties. He has made the same considerations for me when I'm overwhelmed. \n\nFor what it's worth, he has started spending his \"fun\" money on extra groceries (nice cuts of meat) which I happily cook up for him.

{"id":"ct363ea","author":"[deleted]","body":"Buy a cheap microwave and crockpot from Target, Costco, Amazon, where ever.\n\nCostco sells a 5lb and a 10lb bag of thin sliced boneless skinless chicken breasts. You can defrost 2-4 of those chicken breasts in the microwave for 10 minutes. Then throw them in the crockpot with some type of liquid. I've done hot BBQ sauce, water, chicken broth, etc. Add some spices after the liquid: garlic, salt, pepper, basil, whatever. Let it run over night or while at work on low. The chicken should be moist. You can google chicken crockpot recipes and find one you like. \n\nYou can cook those chicken breasts on a skillet with olive oil or on the BBQ as well. The thin slice means they cook faster and more evenly. \n\nBuy some frozen bags of veggies from costco. I like their big bag of broccoli because it's like 6 or 8 small bags of broccoli. This makes it easier to portion out. I'd recommend the veggie melody and crinkle cut carrots as well. \n\nYou can add some potatoes, rice, or whatever kind of carb you want to the meal. I prefer russet potatoes diced and fried in a pan with a little olive oil, garlic salt, basil, and pepper. I tend to fry them until the potato dices are soft and turning golden brown. Flip them constantly with a spatula. \n\nChicken, veggies, and a carb will be super cheap and easy to meal prep with. Target and amazon has some cheap plastic containers that are easy to re-use and clean. \n\nI'd recommend also buying rolled or instant oats - not the prepackaged kind. Cook a bunch of oatmeal and portion it out for breakfasts. In the mornings reheat the oatmeal and then add some walnuts, raisins, and dried cranberries to the heated oatmeal. You won't need additional sugar and it's really tasty. \n\nKeep things simple then experiment. Stay away from chip bags, sodas, cereal, diet foods, etc. as much as possible. You end up spending more money and snacking more. Which will cost you in the long run. That said, don't be guilty cause you bought one of the above. I personally love the Stouffers Meat Lasagna.

If you can get someone to have loyalty to your company and purchase everything from you that is a customer you want.

{"id":"ct37tdp","author":"TheRealAntacular","body":"I'm not going to lecture about how the Amazon hiring is already priced in, so I'll just directly answer your question with some personal experience:\n\n1) Some foreign companies that trade in American markets have [American Depository Receipts (ADRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt). There are unsponsored (which trade OTC) and sponsored (some are OTC, others, such as Sony's SNE, aren't). Companies that have ADRs will usually have a ticker symbol that ends in -Y (I.e. Nintendo's ADR is NTDOY, Tokyo Electric Power Company's ADR is TKECY). \n\n2) Then there are foreign companies that trade on other changes with their actual shares (i.e. Tokyo Electric Power Company's ticker on the Tokyo Exchange is 9501, they also have non-ADR shares that trade OTC with the symbol TKECF). In the case of IBDSF, these are the actual shares that trade on the Madrid Stock Exchange (Ticker IBE), they're not ADRs.\n\n\n3) Of the 2 brokers I've used for foreign stock purchases, eTrade and Merrill Edge, neither have charged any fees for both ADRs and F-shares beyond their regular commission. However, apparently some brokers such as IB tack on extra fees for F-shares. Iirc it's about $60 per trade (on top of the regular commission). So I'm sure there are other brokers that have the same practice. But as far as TradeKing goes, you might just have to switch brokers or open up a new account if you want to be able to buy foreign shares.\n\nProTip: If a company has both F-shares and Y-shares, ALWAYS buy the one with the greater liquidity. There can be HUGE spread between the two. If you want an example, check out the volume difference between [this](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=tkecf&amp;ql=1) and then [this.](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=tkecy&amp;ql=1)","name":"t1_ct37tdp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-14 20:37:51","week":29}

There are a lot of sellers on Amazon, and at any given time, one seller who sold for cheaper can be out of stock, which defaults you to the next seller with stock and a higher price. Or one seller who was out of stock adds stock for the lower price and you default to that.\n\nPay attention to which seller was offering that price when you added the item, and which seller you would be getting it from at the current price. If it's the same seller increasing prices, perhaps they've seen an increase in demand for the product and feel they can charge more. And have every right to do so. It's all business, and $2 for an item isn't necessarily a lot without knowing the base price of the item in the first place ($2 to $4, or $68 to $70).\n\nAnd perhaps they ARE raising the price before the sale.

{"id":"ct3f04e","author":"InvestingAdvice4Free","body":"Hey gang - Thanks in advance for your help! For years now, I've taken a very passive approach to investing. Some may argue it's not an \"approach\" at all. I aim to rectify it ASAP. I've spent the last 19 years largely giving of myself. I did Peace Corps. Worked for 4 different non-profit organizations (for non-profit salaries). I helped Latino kids get off the streets and out of jail/courts. I saved protected areas and the endangered and threatened species that inhabit the Amazon from disappearing. It's been amazingly cool work, but it's also stunted my personal financial growth in some ways. Just something I agreed to long ago. Now that I'm 40 with a young family and some debt, I'd really like to shift from a passive to an active stance. \n\nHere are my details:\n-Age: 40 y/o\n-Employed: earning US$72k/yr in Washington DC Metro area. Wife makes ~US$95k/yr and we file jointly (yes, she owns more than me. yes, I'm fine with that. ;P)\n-Objectives: 1) To pay for our 2 kids' undergraduate education and 2) To retire simply, but comfortably. Kids are 2 and 6 y/o.\n-I'm starting from scratch, got nothing to lose, to be honest...so comfy with accepting risk right now.\n-Current holdings: 2 previous employers' 401k's. One with ~$5k and another with ~$20k. Neither is optimized and I know that I NEED to make this happen, but am utterly ignorant about investment and am unsure what to do. Current employment is brand spanking new. New job started a month ago. Current employer match &amp; vesting looks like this: 50% of the first 4% of compensation (so they match for only 2%);3 year graded vesting...1 year – 34%, 2 years – 67%, 3 years – 100%. To be honest, I have no idea what this vesting stuff even means yet. That's my current portfolio. I've thus far blindly accepted the 3rd-party administrator's \"do-it-for-me\" investment option. I chose an Aggressive lifecycle option: 8% Bond, 92% Stock. Happy to share more, but not sure what specific you might need.\n-Assets: Not sure what info is helpful. My wife &amp; I have a home we are paying off. We bought for $212k 4 years ago. We still owe ~$190k to lender. Our single car gets us where we need to be with few repairs. May need a replacement in ~5 years.\n-Time Horizon: Kids are 4 years apart. Oldest will enter undergrad in ~2027; youngest in ~2031. Retirement around age 65 would be nice, so roughly ~2040. I'll likely keep working beyond retirement though. Perhaps just reduce my hours. Idle hands...yada yada. \n-Big debts: My wife and I each have around $6k credit card debt. So $12k total credit card debt. We have the house, on which we owe ~$190k. We both have education debts from grad school: Mine is ~$38k. Hers is ~$50k.\n\nI'm fully welcoming of whatever advice may come and truly appreciate your help and suggestions. Paying off debt is likely going to continue to be our #1 priority, I know - but I am eager to get smart and better invest and see this as something that should happen simultaneously. \n\nThanks again for your help, guys and gals of Reddit!","name":"t1_ct3f04e","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-14 23:30:19","week":29}

You could get an alert that the price of an item increased by $2 and you could sign on to a 1,000 different accounts and see that for every account it is the exact same price because again, having it in your cart or in your saved for later section has no influence on the price.

Amazon has gotten praise from their email marketing efforts, so you could have a look at them.

If it's just a ton of numbers with no identifiers (I count less than 10 possible things to google in your pictures, and most have identifiers), you should just start Googling all of them. In your case, literally the first number in the first picture was enough to find the model numbers. Some acronyms you'll need to know:\n\nP/N is usually \"part number\". It's a pretty useful thing to look up.\nS/N is 'serial number'. If there is no part number, but there IS a s/n, go to the manufacturers website, and look for a chart to identify the models of an item based off of it.\nFCC ID: Pretty much worthless.\nUPC: Usually worth looking up if it's there. Scan it with your eBay or Amazon app. If it's not there, just Google it. It should show 95% of the time this will yield a result.\n\nIf none of the numbers are labeled on a unit, just Google all of them. It takes 2 seconds to search for something on Google, it's worth the time. Generally, I'd even to the Googling while I'm at the store, before I make the purchase, because the part number or model number is enough to make or break a profit margin.","name":"t1_ct3jl2a","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-15 01:33:15","week":29}

Namely their mortgage refinance processing guys were and I assume still are horrible. \n\nBasically I filed to refinance my home in WA for a VA loan refinance which does not technically require a home valuation. USAA demanded one anyways, they had some \"go to\" appraisers in the area and their services were used at a cost of around $300. \nThe appraisers did a straight out piss poor job at the evaluation... cherry-picking the lowest value homes in the area that were 300 off sqft smaller than mine with less rooms and amenities. Then \"scaled up\" their evals to the larger home.. which led to a appraisal of over $30k under the actual value for similarly sized homes in the area. \n\nI appealed the appraisal and submitted a mountain of evidence to point out how inappropriately it was performed.. the rest of it went very much to the same way OPs situation above. Layer one of their customer service states that \"they have no access\" to anything and can only refer call back requests tot he departments and managers who deal with the stuff. These managers never call back or they do and once you pickup they hangup further noting on to the account that \"issues were resolved over the phone\"... the BS and lack of professionalism gets worse from thereon out. \n\n[Some Reviews of that service on their own site... ](https://reviews.usaa.com/4914/bank_loan_new_mortgage/brand-bank-loan-new-mortgage-buying-a-home-home-loans-and-mortgages-reviews/reviews.htm?sort=rating&amp;dir=asc)\n\n\nEdit: it seems like the services which USAA outsources to other firms that will operate \"in their name\" seem to be less than what is the standard for in-house operation for the company.

{"id":"ct4coq0","author":"AaronGerry","body":"Hey /u/AnonJian,\n\nThanks for the detailed response and feedback. Happy to answer your questions.\n\nHelpful input. We find that people's understanding of what a 3PL is varies, so I wanted to keep it more high level. But you are correct, we are a 3PL that helps product companies fulfill product.\n&gt;Start by posting this handy piece of text \"3rd Party Logistics, meaning a fulfillment warehouse outsource partner.\"\n\nI'm glad that your transition was smooth, it's certainly not the case for everyone. We've heard from countless companies who had a hard time just finding a warehouse (one found their warehouse on Craigslist), have difficulty identifying quality partners (and end up dealing with poor customer service, delayed shipments, price gouging, etc.), or use services that are overly complex or too expensive for their needs.\n&gt;I didn't. Explain.\n&gt;We're a startup that makes it really easy to start outsourcing your fulfillment (we began the company out of personal frustration and because we saw how much our friends were struggling with it).\n\nAmazon is a strong partner for particular type of businesses (say if you're also selling through Amazon or if you really want to reach Prime customers). However, they can be cumbersome to set up with, [have notoriously poor customer service](https://www.quora.com/Shipwire-vs-Amazon-FBA-Which-is-better-for-someone-that-sells-both-on-Amazon-and-on-their-own-ecommerce-site), ([it can be very difficult to even hear from someone](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=3252837)), if you don't adhere strictly to their packaging requirements, will charge you up the wazoo, and they move your product around for the sake of minimizing shipping rates (without your consent, but I understand their reasoning), and then charge you fees for doing so. Saying all this, for particular businesses, and if you're supremely detail oriented, it's a strong option. They are a very operationally sound business and have a huge reach.\n\nOn our end, our ideal customer is looking for their first fulfillment partner (hence the focus of the post), or they are frustrated with their existing 3PL. Our aim is to provide transparent pricing upfront, we do not require a long-term contract, and we have a pay-as-you-go pricing model, so you only pay for what you use (there are no fees for maintenance, tech set up, on-boarding, etc.). More so, we are your partner, walking you through the process to help you understand how it all works, or we can just do it for you, which frees you up to focus on what you do best (say product development, sales, etc.). Let's be realistic, if you have $500,000 worth of inventory on hand, you're probably too big for us *at the moment* -- your specific needs change as you scale.\n&gt;Amazon as the 3PL of choice and emerging game changer in the category. Compare and contrast your competitive advantages insuring when the smoke clears I don't have a half million dollars of inventory stuck in a boarded up facility.\n\nI got the photo from DollarPhotoClub, so I really don't know what warehouse it is.\n&gt;The photo you use is of Amazon's facility, isn't it.\n\nI answered some of this above. Our goal: To be your partner now, and to help you scale. We focus on customer support (such as having a dedicated team member in each warehouse to help receive your product, and make sure it's set up the right way the first time), easy integration with your existing systems, and ease of on-boarding.\n\nFor warehouses, we work with partners that have a strong reputation among emerging product companies, have a technology backbone (so that we can easily integrate our API, giving you real-time insight into the warehouse), and because of our relationship, we fast-track the on-boarding and set up process.\n&gt;\"Select\" meaning ... just Amazon's warehouses, because you're essentially ... what? A fouth party 3PL? What is your value added over going through Amazon directly? What do you actually do that isn't taken care of through Amazon?\nWere you frustrated with Amazon? How so? Why use Amazon then? Are there other warehouses? What is the criterion for making them select? Aside from the blizzard of logistics detail what is the actual payoff, the benefit? Do you work with clients to design the OOBE?\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or would like to chat further. \n","name":"t1_ct4coq0","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-07-15 19:27:49","week":29}

{"id":"ct4fvxt","author":"BroasisMusic","body":"Like Markus mentioned, the shitty pictures probably helped engagement because it made people click through to get a better look. In this case what matters most is the content. It's shocking how often in real life a \"designers\" preference for something won't work nearly as well as something uglier and less refined. Amazon still looked like a website made in the 90's for most of the 2000's, but they grew like fuck during that time. Pretty != functional. And in many cases, marketing and design / ux are pretty hard to reconcile. If Markus would have had designers working for him, bet your ass they'd all be pushing for crisper images, responsive design... everything they *believe* the user wants, but could actually massively hurt the bottom line.\n\nNot to get off on a tangent, but this is the biggest beef I have with many designers in general. They don't seem to understand that they're designing for an *objective*, and that objective is rarely \"having a pretty site\". It's increased engagement, pageviews, revenue, etc. Another good example I read recently compared hamburger menus vs normal menus on mobile apps (read [here] (http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945)). Not surprisingly to marketing folk, the hamburger menu killed engagement. But I can almost promise you the reason they tested it was because \"it looked cleaner\". As a business owner, I don't give two shits how my website \"looks\" so long as it \"functions\" properly. Design takes a back seat to revenue objectives *every* time, and it's a tough pill for designers to swallow. Want to be your companies favorite designer? Develop for revenue and user engagement, not prettiness and subjective design fads.","name":"t1_ct4fvxt","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-15 20:45:26","week":29}

{"id":"ct4v36f","author":"colourofawesome","body":"For sure.  This is just my opinion from what I've seen in my own experience though, not based on actual studies.\n\nProbably the two biggest things, aside from Canada Post sucking, are geography and more indirectly, our reliance on American exports.\n\nThe US has a lot of major metropolitan areas with high population density (and so does Japan, Korea, most of Europe and other places where eCommerce is better, but I'm using the US as my example).  Just look at the eastern seaboard.  Because of this it's easy to have distribution centres in multiple convenient locations.  In Canada our metropolitan areas are dense, sure, also surrounded by huge rural expanses.  So logistically it makes less sense to have DCs in every major Canadian city unless you're selling a LOT of volume.  A DC in New Jersey can easily ship to Pennsylvania, Maine, wherever, but a DC in Winnipeg can't move product to New Brunswick as quickly or cheaply.  Target, for example, failed up here in part because they did a bad job of figuring this out.  \n\nThat all just contributes to the higher cost and time involved in ordering online though.  And while that's important (I'm not going to wait 2 weeks for a keyboard to ship just to save $3), it's not as important as my second point, in my opinion.\n\nIt's kind of a joke in Canada that we basically get the light versions of American services and stores.  Our Netflix has a fraction of the movies American Netfilx does, for example.  Major online stores like Amazon didn't take off here as much because Canadian Amazon kind of sucks.  It's getting better, but for the longest time it had a fraction of the inventory and comparatively worse prices.  The same is true for other companies - Canada is kind of a pain in the ass to deal with because of our low population density, and because of copyright and licensing restrictions a lot of American businesses either don't bother or do a half-assed job.  For example I've tried to order something online and not been able to simply because I have a postal code, which is 6 characters and wouldn't fit in the 5-character Zip code box.  I recently tried to order a standing desk, but at checkout realized they only ship the frame, not desktop to Canada.  THEN you find out that the thing you just ordered from the US has to wait at the border waiting to clear customs for the next week.  A lot of little things like this over time just sour your experience when buying online, so a lot of us just say fuck it.\n\nActually as an interesting aside - I live in Vancouver which is really close to the US border.  What a lot of people do here is order stuff online from American sites to save the money and have them shipped to a PO box just across the border, then drive to get it.  Two towns, Point Roberts and Blaine, have cottage industries accepting shipments for Canadians to come claim. \n\nOne thing I can tell you which is actually based on research is that it is finally catching on and Canada's eCommerce industry is growing fast.  We're growing faster than the US in that regard, and growth is projected to speed up in coming years.  The Canadian dollar right now is tanking relative to the US dollar, so fewer Canadians are going to want to buy from across the border anyway, so despite all the issues I think there's a ton of opportunity up here for businesses who are able to offer a reliable, cost effective service.","name":"t1_ct4v36f","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-16 03:33:47","week":29}

I also read skimmed through the Import Dojo and I am currently working with my supplier to get my first product out, hopefully by the end of this month. \n\nAnyhow, I was wanting to add value to my product. It is a very popular product with a high BSR just as you instructed in your book. I have already added some differentiation from the competition, such as adding some accessories. I wanted to maybe add a free ebook to my product, something that gave instructions and ideas on how to use the product. \n\nIs this something worth doing? I have no experience with writing e-books and most likely will have to hire somebody. I think it can add some value to my listing, but perhaps the cost-reward won't be worth it.

I've got a sense of which ones are 1p on Amazon and I can replace if need be at little to no cost.  Living in London means moving around every few years and every time I've taken big stacks away to the charity shop or put them on Amazon. A result of that is most of the books I have left are nice academic books that aren't in print or they are good editions or they have my notes in them, which I need for reference. Most of the novels I've assumed I can find in used book stores in the states if I want to read them or have around.\n\nThanks though. I went through yesterday and pulled a few out, and will probably do it several more times before I pack them up. The company I linked in the OP estimated it would come to £300 door to door, meaning I'm paying a little over £1 a book.

{"id":"ct5c250","author":"epistle_to_dippy","body":"Not sure if this helps, but I am an American that just started selling on amazon.ca, so here are some things to investigate...\n\n[Non-Resident Importing](https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/197/kw/non-resident%20importing/session/L3RpbWUvMTQzNzA1Mzc5OS9zaWQvQ1BVcVF2cm0%3D/suggested/1)\n\nIn CA, I had to get a business # and a GST/HST account. I do not think that you would have to do this coming into the US. However, since our state sales tax laws have started to cover online purchases, you need to look into the issues involved in selling to consumers in each state from where you ship goods. If you only have product in one Amazon warehouse, then you would have to remit sales taxes for purchases made by consumers in that state. \n\nRight now I only have stock in Ontario, but will ship to BC... the added shipping costs hit my margins, and eventually we will stock in BC, but we're just starting out... this would be the same for you if you were to stock in NYC and ship to California... but with the US, there are more centralized Amazon warehouses. \n\nYou will most likely need the expertise of a customs broker. We used [Pacific Customs Brokers](http://www.pcb.ca/) importing to the US from China, but then switched to AN Deringer for importing into CA (based on a recommendation from our LTL guy). \n\nFrom what I see on Amazon currently, they are really pushing listing product in both US and CA sites, and have integrated both sites onto a Seller's dashboard. The US marketplace is 10x the size of the Canadian marketplace, so if you can find the right products, then selling in the US is a *real* good thing!\n\n","name":"t1_ct5c250","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-16 15:55:39","week":29}

Just the +$100 billion club that comes to mind at the moment: Microsoft, Apple, Google, Intel, Qualcomm, and Facebook (all firmly making big profits) - and Amazon (who \"reinvests\" most of its potential profit and has a substantial shareholder base happy for them to do that indefinitely - not that MSFT, AAPL, INTC, GOOGL, and FB don't reinvest huge sums of money that they could realize as profit).\n\nAnd its not like most of those names are valued at extreme multiples of anything. Amazon and FB both have pretty reasonable excuses that are not \"we are in a new normal.\" Amazon has a strange capital allocation philosophy. And facebook is still demonstrating tremendous growth in its core business and acquiring ton of optionality that has everyone excited (huge writedowns might one day be in its future, maybe not though). FB will one day get religion just as Google slowly is. \n\nAnd then you have a huge tier of tech companies that are sub $100 billion in market cap, but have been huge successes for all of their early investors. Whether they get bought out or go public, it is undeniable that tons of wealth has been created. Has there been excesses? sure, but there have also been bargains: Instagram and YouTube would both be worth many many multiples more than what they were acquired for.\n\nBut the biggest reason I don't think you will see an end to the \"current tech boom phase\" is because a lot of people with money want to make a ton of money AND make the world a better place to live and building revolutionary technology is seen by many as the most effective way to do that. Largely because of the success of the aforementioned companies. I certainly hope people's enthusiasm to invest in making things better, faster, and cheaper doesn't just magically vanish.

{"id":"ct5osnf","author":"PM_ME_YOUR_RATTIES","body":"Here are a few ways to min/max things:\n\n**Rewards Programs - General**. Most rewards programs will have a Challenge or Match offering (or a Match/Challenge offering) that will let you get status quickly. Challenge is usually \"Stay X nights/have X stays in two months and get Platinum\". Match is \"You have Gold with Delta? Here, have Gold with us to fly with us instead\". Challenge/Match is a mix- \"You have Gold with United? Here's Gold with us...and you have to fly X miles/segments in the next two months to keep it.\" Figure out which applies and take advantage of them. Your workplace may also have special deals to give you a one time status upgrade, giving you Gold for a year or similar. Ask around.\n\n**Hotel Rewards - General**. Pick two (2) chains. These are now your best friends. You may prefer Starwood (SPG), but have to go to somewhere without one (say in Albany, NY) or may not be allowed to book the rate offered (hello, $600/night rates). Depending on your travel level, you can have 1-2 major chains you focus on and maintain high level status on each; it's possible to maintain top on 3 chains, but you basically are never home in that situation. Generally speaking, SPG has some of the best perks in the industry, but there aren't a ton in non-major cities, so have a fallback. I'm SPG/Marriott, but I'd probably tell my younger self to do SPG/Hilton- similar availability stateside, but better international options by a little bit. Also to note, SPG and Marriott (MR) both have lifetime status available after a lot of spend/nights, no other chain does at present. Look up the details and pick your rewards programs with care.\n\n**Hotel Rewards - Credit Cards**. Get credit cards for your main two chains. These cards will help you in your status quest and also maximize your rewards for each. Use only these cards at their respective properties unless you have a card with an outrageous cash back return on hotels at that point in time. My SPG and MR cards basically give me a 3%-5% return going by the generally accepted value of the points in question, and I usually do better than those returns by booking strategically. You'll need to have some awesome cash back rate to justify not using the linked credit card for a given chain. The annual fee is usually steep for a very light traveler, but not bad for a business traveler- hell, the MR Black card comes with a free Cat 1-5 hotel night each year, and I've never failed to use it. That alone is worth the annual fee.\n\n**Hotel Rewards - Promotions**. Maximize your promotions. For example, Marriott just had a MegaBonus promo that was every stay got you 2,500 bonus points. SPG had a promo that gave you extra points based on spending when you stay two consecutive nights or more. I was traveling four nights a week, so for each week I lined up a night in Marriott, two in SPG, one in Marriott, maximizing my points return (and also minimizing my headaches for customer commutes, but that's a different aspect). Pay attention to current promotions and don't be afraid to switch between your two major chains based on the promo value.\n\n**Airline Miles - General**. Pick one airline. Stay with that airline (or it's alliance) whenever possible. Having Gold status with United does you little good with your JetBlue fight, but does help with your Lufthansa flight.\n\n**Airline Miles - Credit Cards**. I don't advocate getting an airline linked card in general. You don't get a huge benefit from it, since the credit card benefits are basically superseded by Silver status for most airlines, and since you aren't buying your own tickets you don't get bonus miles from that. If you spot a good deal to churn a card, go for it; otherwise, leave these money sinks alone as they aren't worth the annual fee.\n\n**Rental Cars**. This is one you may be more limited on- a lot of companies force you to use a single chain, or \"strongly recommend\" one. Get your elite program, collect the points. Don't expect this one to really move the needle for you no matter what chain you have (though you will love showing up in a resort location with low elite travelers and getting your rental- I've almost always had massive upgrades- like my \"Ford Fusion\" becoming an Infiniti Q70).\n\n**Credit Cards for Everything Else**. Go check out /r/churning. It's extra effort, but you're spending rate will likely be high enough to let you churn 1-2 cards/year without really impacting the rest of your rewards schemes. Beyond that, I have one staple card that gets me good restaurants/gas rewards (in my case it's the Chase Amazon card, but a lot of people like the Sapphire- just make sure it's no fee or the fee is worth the extra perks), and two \"Quarterly category\" cards (in my case, Chase Freedom and Discover). These cards have great returns when the categories cycle around to where you need them- I maxed my 5% cash back on food from Discover in a month, and maxed the 5% category on rentals almost as fast. Even better, these cards will sometimes compete on categories where you really spend a lot, like restaurants, so you can get a nice $75/quarter from each with only a little effort to remember what card to use.\n\nBeyond the above, welcome to your new home- hotels and airplanes. It can be a bit rough on your family life, but it's a great place to build some long term benefits (like a giant stack of points to take vacations with). Hope you enjoy your ride and the perks that go with it- odds are good you won't want to be on it for more than a few years, so use them while you've got them.\n\nSource: I've been in a very similar situation for the last six years (slightly higher meal budget, otherwise pretty much an identical breakdown). It's a blast, but realizing you spent 2/3rds of the year in a hotel can be a drag.","name":"t1_ct5osnf","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-16 21:12:49","week":29}
{"id":"ct5pb7i","author":"Emmylu91","body":"I wonder if where you live is a factor. I live in a town with like 1200 people so the nearest UPS and fed ex locations are like 30-40 minutes away. Even with USPS, when I lived about 20 minutes from where I do now, but in a bigger city, I could always count on packages getting to me within 2 days after the tracking number said they entered the state boarder. Now that I live in the tiny town i'm a bit closer to the state boarder but it takes a third day for packages to get to me after hitting the state boarder - I assume because it has to be sorted through one additional post office. \n\nI have prime but my packages arrive on day 3 more than 1/2 the time. I've only contacted customer service a couple of times as a result of things being late (when they didn't come at the end of day 3, once when I paid for 1 day shipping and it didn't come on time, and once or twice when it was just 2 day shipping and day 2 but I needed the item right away), I've had prime for 3 years now and I've never been offered a free month extension of prime as a result of something being late. When I've paid for 1 day shipping and it didn't show up on time they did refund the amount that I paid for 1 day shipping but that was all i've ever been offered as a \"make it better\" compensation.\n\nI blog for a living and sometimes get paid in amazon gift cards by brands who pay me to promote their product or items on my blog and/or social media accounts. I easily spend over 1k on Amazon a year as a result of getting those gift cards regularly so I wonder if its not just about how much you spend on amazon but perhaps they also are just aware that certain areas suck at 2 day shipping because they're too rural so they don't want to have to \"make it up to you\" over and over when you just live in an area where they can't fulfill their agreement. \n\nTL;DR maybe they decide whether or not to give you an extra month of prime based off whether you live in an area that \"should\" be able to get 2 day packages. For people who live in rural areas maybe 2 day shipping isn't as realistic so people like me don't get those offers as they'd have to give us a free month every time we ordered something.

{"id":"ct62e8b","author":"foggyepigraph","body":"Okay, I know this is only tangentially related to your problem and is certainly not a solution, but...\n\nBecause Amazon is not the shipping carrier itself and uses third parties (USPS, FedEx, UPS), there is always some question about whether the third parties can game the system.  Answer: they try.  The carriers get some extra money for faster deliveries.  Of course, if they can get the money and not strain themselves to guarantee every single fast delivery, that works well for them.\n\nSo, last year, I went through about two months in which every single two-day Prime delivery coming through USPS was a day or two (or even three in one case) late...but it was always marked delivered *on the day it was due*.  So after the first couple of times I reported that my shipment had not arrived to Amazon (on the day it was due and showed \"delivered\"), they started telling me that \"sometimes the tracking systems will indicate an item has been delivered up to 24 hours in advance, so just wait 24 hours and see if it shows up\".  Umm, two day delivery doesn't mean that you tell me it's delivered in two days regardless of reality...but since the tracking system said it's delivered, it becomes my word against USPS.  Anyway, I complained a few more times to Amazon and that issue has magically (mostly) stopped.\n\nIn any case: Sorry about your 2-day delivery issues.

As it plans to spin off the fast-growing payments unit on Friday, the e-commerce company may wish it had held its ground.\n\nThe company’s second-quarter results, its last as a united entity, tell a story of two online giants headed in seemingly opposite directions. While PayPal can point to double-digit revenue growth and a slate of recent acquisitions, eBay is beset by shrinking sales and is jettisoning assets.\n\nEBay on Thursday also said it was selling off its eBay Enterprise unit for $925 million, less than half the $2.4 billion it paid for the division four years ago, while its core marketplace posted sales below PayPal’s for a second straight quarter.\n\nIndeed, when the e-commerce company re-emerges as a stand-alone company on Friday it will more closely resemble the eBay that bought PayPal in 2002 to help accelerate growth. But today it faces the ever-growing threat of Amazon.com Inc., as well as new e-commerce upstarts.\n\nDevin Wenig, eBay’s incoming chief executive, seemed to acknowledge the company’s challenges in a call with analysts, pointing again to lasting effects from a 2014 data breach and a change in how Google Inc. shows search results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis counterpart, Dan Schulman, meanwhile was setting a lofty goal to effectively quadruple use of the PayPal app.\n\n“EBay has faced a number of issues that have led to growth challenges, including the Google demotion,” said Carlos Kirjner, a Bernstein analyst. “The key is whether they will be able to recover; they need to find new ways to bring in new users.”\n\nRELATED\n\nEBay Nears Deal to Sell eBay Enterprise Unit for Around $900 Million\nEbay Will Get Along Without Its Pal\nEBay’s Enterprise Unit Takes a Hit Amid Sale Talks (July 9)\nOn Thursday, eBay posted a 6% sales bump to $4.65 billion, including results from the Enterprise unit, and a profit of $83 million. Excluding items, the company’s earnings beat analyst expectations. In 4 p.m. trading, the shares were up 3.4% to $65.59 on the Nasdaq.\n\n‘We made solid progress but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay’s significant potential.’\n—Devin Wenig, eBay’s incoming CEO\nIn eBay’s core marketplace, which comprises mostly eBay.com as well as ticket-seller StubHub, sales fell 3% to $2.12 billion, the second straight quarterly decline after five years of increases. A year earlier, the division posted a 9% sales increase. PayPal’s sales grew 16% to $2.26 billion.\n\nEBay pointed to currency fluctuations as a primary reason for the sales shortfall. Without that impact, the company said marketplace sales would have increased 5%.\n\nEBay’s 6% increase in active buyers, to 157 million, was less than half the rate of last year’s second quarter. PayPal’s growth, too, slowed to 11%, or 169 million accounts, from 15% in the year-earlier period.\n\nEBay will mark its 20th anniversary later this year. ENLARGE\nEBay will mark its 20th anniversary later this year. PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES\nNearing its 20th anniversary later this year—a mark celebrated by Amazon this week—eBay presents a starkly different profile than its larger Seattle rival. While it has tried for years to shed its reputation as a repository for one-off items, eBay has had only mixed success in convincing brands to sell their new goods on the site.\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, has a massive network of warehouses from which it ships many new products, a growing Prime loyalty program and nearly 280 million customers accounts.\n\nAmazon is expected to approach $100 billion in sales this year and commands a market capitalization of $221 billion, whereas eBay’s sales—minus PayPal—will likely fall under $10 billion this year with a market cap of about $35 billion, based on early market indications.\n\n“We made solid progress but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay’s significant potential,” said Mr. Wenig. “Our absolute priority is to improve our competitiveness and drive more stable profitable growth.”\n\nAs the PayPal spinoff nears, eBay has been cleaning house. In June, it sold back to Craigslist Inc. a 28.4% stake it had held in the classified-ad site since 2004 for an undisclosed amount, while also settling remaining litigation. Earlier this year, eBay pared about 2,400 jobs, representing roughly 7% of its workforce.\n\nWhat remains is primarily eBay.com, a mix of fixed-priced items and auctioned goods, as well as StubHub. EBay still relies on its millions of sellers to ship their merchandise to customers, which over the years has yielded inconsistent shipping speeds and reliability.\n\nSome analysts have speculated that eBay could be an attractive takeover target by bigger rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., or private-equity players.\n\nMr. Wenig on Thursday said he would focus his attention on small- and medium-size sellers, who bring “a mix of inventory, from unique items to discounted and seasonal inventory to liquidation goods.”\n\nEBay said it expected revenue growth in its marketplace division to be between 3% and 5% next year, not including the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, updating a previous expectation with a low-end of no growth.\n\nNotably, eBay’s gross merchandise volume, the amount of sales it helps facilitate, fell 2% to $20.1 billion, though it would have been up 6% without the impact of currency fluctuations. PayPal’s net payment volume, by contrast, jumped 20% to $65.9 billion.\n\nPayPal’s Mr. Schulman recently oversaw the planned $890 million acquisition of Xoom Corp., and said on Thursday he hopes to compel users to open the company’s primary mobile app two to three times weekly, compared with that amount per month today. “That is a significant stretch goal for us,” Mr. Schulman told analysts.\n\nCorrections &amp; Amplifications: \nA previous version of this story incorrectly said eBay reiterated an expectation that marketplace division growth would be between flat and 5% next year, not including foreign currency fluctuations. EBay updated that expectation to say the low end would be 3% growth.\n\n","name":"t1_ct65wk6","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-17 05:11:08","week":29}

For paypal you need a bank account. I don't know if banks are different in Canada, but I am pretty sure you can set up a highschool checking account in your parents name. It's pretty simple, I recommend going to a chase bank. It takes 40 mins give or take.\n\n* Ebay is the most simple; Link paypal, post item, learn how to ship items and its done.\n\n* There are also other shop websites. Amazon, and etsy. Etsy is a website where handmade items are sold, I highly recommend making an account on there and posting your product.\n\n* Then theres a store on a website you make. This can get more difficult down the line and theres a lot to learn. [This](http://websitesetup.org/) website will explain the basics easy, its a quick read too. To outline it: Buy a domain (your website URL), find a hosting site (who puts you on the database basically), and get a template using wordpress.\n\n\nI can tell you more.

And while our general thesis might be the same, there are significant differences between the argument now and in 2000:\n\n- Were much farther along the curve of internet adoption and tech sophistication, so the magnitude of implied value is far less and our evaluations of these companies are more informed \n- Companies ipo much mature than they did in 2000\n- Relating to the two points above, since orders of magnitude more of the world's general activity involves software/the Internet, there's that much more competition, and companies that make it to the finish line (ipo) are inherently \"vetted\" to higher degree. The ipos in 2000 were ridiculous by any standard.\n\nI have a feeling most people who predict a 2.0 crash are older and don't quite grasp the nature of the sub-30 human (in a developed country). Literally their entire life has involved tech/internet, and that dependence grows every year...and will never stop growing. The sector will eventually surpass all others, and the SP500 will slowly revolve into the tech500. I know you can still believe this yet also think tech stocks are currently way overheated, but compared to the rest of the market, they're perfectly fine, in fact probably undervalued as we've seen huge Amazon and Netflix run ups in the last 6 months. Like, these are huge companies that have been around for a while now and yet we see 50-100% gains. There's still significant misunderstanding of the evolution of these companies and the legitimacy of implied future gains.

{"id":"ct7qxc0","author":"TheOutlier1","body":"For all of your questions: It depends on so many factors. You'd be better off putting SOMETHING together, testing that, and either using an optimization approach to improving your results, or bring it back to get critiques. Your questions are so vague that it's difficult to give you a good answer. Here's why:\n\n- Where exactly did the visitor come from? For instance, if it's a keyword, what phase of the buying cycle are they in?\n\n- What is your offer? Does it even match what the market wants? Does it match what the visitor wants? Is it ACTUALLY good? Unique?\n\n- How good is your sales copy? If you don't know much about e-mail marketing, I'm going to assume it's not optimal. And that's probably a very good reason why you didn't make sales with your previous tests.\n\n- Cold traffic is going to convert much lower than if you have a chance to warm it up through content, e-mail, partners, etc. Especially if you have no brand equity. Your sales message has to be strong and speak directly to the customers problems or frustrations. If not, it doesn't matter if you deliver the message in an e-mail, video, or sales page... they simply won't care.\n\nLastly, who cares what you feel about long form sales pages? The fact is, they work. And they continue to work. Don't believe me? Check out Amazon's Kindle sales page: http://i.imgur.com/ZlodDFC.jpg\n\nTo be honest, if your results haven't been good (which you say they haven't), what makes you think your insight on how something should be is important?

{"id":"ct7ydx9","author":"sun_wyvern","body":"Ok just dug around in the FAQ.  This is their quoted information:\n&gt; When Paribus succeeds and stores issue your price adjustments, money is typically refunded directly onto your original form of payment with the store.\n\nWhen I went to de-link one of my cards (the only one attached), it alerted me it can only offer adjustments with cards linked.  Given you can link multiple cards, it suggests the following:  ~~They can only pursue adjustments to cards you link with their service.  So if I purchase from Amazon from Cards A-J, but I only link Card C to Paribus, then Paribus can only pursue purchases from that card.~~\n\nYou can manage which cards they get the right to dig through via their dashboard.  They advertise they use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to issue these adjustments to you and the site has McAfee icons throughout.\n\nOf course, I haven't really gotten to test this for sure that's what they mean, and there doesn't seem to be anywhere on the site I can probe them to know more.  Hope that was helpful sleuthing.\n\n**EDIT:  The alternative idea is that the vendor adjusts to your card the full amount, and then Paribus \"bills\" you the finder fee via the card attached, since they know what adjustment you received, they calculate out 25% of that to invoice your card.

{"id":"ct7znda","author":"CryptoJunky","body":"I feel as though, for a lot of cryptocurrency users, it has become somewhat more difficult to participate in the cryptoconomy.\n\nLet's take typical (but made up) bitcoin user Bob for instance.\n\nBob got into Bitcoin a couple of years ago by mining with his home gaming PC. It used to be that Bob would regularly convert his mining power and some electricity into Bitcoin.\n\nOnce stores like BitcoinStore or Bitcoinin started popping up Bob would spend some bitcoin that he earned mining at them.\n\nHowever, years have passed and now Bob does not have a regular stream of Bitcoin coming in as he no longer mines. If Bob wants to buy something in Bitcoin he now has to convert his fiat currency, we'll say USD, into Bitcoin and then use the Bitcoin to buy something.\n\nSo even though Bob can now use his Bitcoin at a huge number of retailers, especially big ones like Overstock and Newegg, he no longer regularly receives Bitcoin to do it.\n\nWhile it is possible to make the conversions, they require some time and effort and it is usually just easier to order something on Amazon with one click than to convert to Bitcoin and order on a Bitcoin supporting retailer.\n\nWhat's more is that Bob is mostly non-technical. Sure he can setup a gaming computer but we'll say Bob isn't an accomplished developer, more of a tech enthusiast. \n\nSo what is left for Bob to do in the new cryptoconomy? He doesn't have the technical skills to develop cutting edge tech, mining is out the window as it isn't profitable, using Bitcoin while easier than it used to be is still much more difficult than fiat, and even running a full node requires him to run is power sucking gaming PC 24/7.\n\nBob has essentially been pushed out of the cryptocurrency market by a number of different trends and forces. If cryptocurrency is going to gain more users we need to find a way to bring Bob back into the fold.","name":"t1_ct7znda","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","created_utc":"2015-07-18 22:34:08","week":29}

Buyer got my phone number from eBay and called me six times from 11pm to 3am leaving voicemails, demanding I refund him immediately because the item was late. Item Not Received case opened the next morning and eBay sided with me because the tracking showed the item still in transit, but it still gave me a defect.  \n\nNext day the item is delivered and the buyer immediately opens Item Not As Described against me, once again demanding an immediate refund. I accepted the refund and told him I would process it as soon as I received the item back in the condition it was sent. Of course, I got the item back and it was a dirty, broken version of what I had sent him (he swapped it), as well as negative feedback from him about how awful I am for delaying his package. Second defect for the INAD case.  \n\nI went from 90% eBay, 10% Amazon last year to 99% Amazon, 1% eBay this year and not only have I been making a lot more money... but the customers are just so much better and my return/scam rates have both dropped tenfold.","name":"t1_ct85m7g","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-19 01:57:48","week":29}

In my opinion, you see price history more accurately on eBay, as you can see prices items sold for, didn't sell for, and what prices are currently being asked. On Amazon, you can use third party tools to show asked prices and sale rank history, to paint a similar picture though. \n\n2. I believe what your talking about here is a pro merchant account. It's a service Amazon offers which offers great benefits towards Amazon sellers. Some of the benefits include buy box eligibility and saving $1 per item sold, as well as lots of data about your sales snd items. This costs $40 a month. However this can very quickly and easily pay for itself if your selling 40 or more items each month.  \n\n","name":"t1_ct8bto9","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-19 05:48:57","week":29}
{"id":"ct8c58f","author":"Grandmacartruck","body":"I've taken a 5-day GreyWater Installers Course with Laura Allen through Greywateraction.org. I've done two laundry to landscape jobs and am in the middle of doing my own house where I'll be reusing all the laundry, bath/shower, and bathroom sink water. \n\nI'm in California so it's a big issue right now.\n\nThe laundry to landscape systems are pretty easy. The important points are that the washing machine pump can assist the water getting to your plants but you have to be careful to not put strain on it. Don't go more than 50', and not uphill more than a foot or two. You need a three way valve that switches the greywater from the landscape to the sewer whenever you use bleach or the ground is saturated with rain. Detergents are harder to find but Amazon makes it easy. Use bio-compatible, not organic or bio-friendly or bio-degradable. Bio-compatible means it's friendly to plants. Bio-degradable means it will break down over time but these use salts to clean and salt breaks down soil structure. The ones I've found to use are: Oasis, Biokleen, LifeTree, Vaska Perfect, and Bio-Pak. Within each brand you have to find the one(s) that don't use sodium. The water has to be released in a mulch basin 2\" below the surface. The water should spread out in your mulch without pooling on the surface. When watering a tree, make the mulch basin below the tree's outer branches. The water should also drop out of the pipe 2\" so that roots can't grow into the pipe end.\n\nThe next step up in complexity is the system I'm making for myself. All the greywater goes to a surge tank in the crawlspace under my house which has an effluent pump in it which will push it out to my yard.\n\nFiltering Greywater is possible and done in some circumstances but it adds a lot of cost with minimal benefit. The two systems I described are the best options for the frugal homeowner, in my opinion. The second option requires messing with existing plumbing so you need a plumber and permit to do legally, at least around here.\n\nHope that helps.

{"id":"ct8ef1z","author":"dashfinn","body":"Dear septicman,\n\nIf you want real help for your situation, you unfortunately have to plow through this ginormous comment of mine.\nFirst listen and re-read the tips /u/Fuddling is giving to you. He’s helping you stand out with phone calls and shows how important it is to blow everyone away in order to earn those critical referrals.\n\n## **I’ve got a few things to add.**\n\nThe fact that you’re getting this kind of responses tells you everything you need. Your customers are trying to tell you something. They say: \"No thank you, and we get dozens of these kind of emails every month”. \n\n**You need to wake up.** Right now.\n\nShift your focus from yourself to your customers. Why do you think they say that? Are you asking them what specifically in your emails makes them read just like everyone else’s? \n\nIf not, you're missing the opportunity to improve your business. Start asking them when they bring this up and take notes.\nPeople don’t care about you. They care about themselves. If you’re hearing this for the first time, it sounds really bad – but it isn’t.\n\n**You customers don’t care about getting your web dev services.**\n\n* They care about saving in expenses.\n* They care about getting more clients.\n* They care about making more sales annually.\n\n## **Approach that helps you the most**\n\nSo how do you do this? You can approach them with an email something like this:\n\n----\n\n*Hey Person MacPerson,*\n\n*I’ve noticed that your website loads in 4.65 seconds. I can show you how you can drop it down to 2.3 seconds and add ~15% more clients in the next 90 days.*\n\n*Call me if you’re interested.*\n\n*– septicman*\n\n----\n\nEven this short and kinda shitty email **shifts the focus fully on the client and shows that you’re ready to offer them something really useful.**\n\nYou can take this approach even further with a different email:\n\n----\n\n*Hey Person MacPerson,*\n\n*I’ve got 3 way you can cut 20% in your current marketing while adding 30% more customers before October.*\n\n*1. There is this new exciting technique called “static websites” instead of dynamic what you’re currently using. By cutting down the page load time by 60%, you’re able to add 15% more customers in the next 90 days. Here’s a PDF that gives you the exact steps to make this happen with your site.*\n\n*2. Biggest wastes for many businesses of online marketing strategy is useless social media presence just for the sake of it. In your case I can save you somewhere between $10,000-25,000 this year alone. I’ve put up a free report that you can take a close look at: http://septicman.com/free-report*\n\n*I've got the third way… but to be honest it's too damn good to give away in an email. And, I don’t even know if this got to you.  If you’re actually reading this, give me a call and I’ll give it to right away. HINT: It’s a piece of custom software that moves your search rankings  permanently to first page in less than 90 days, adding you at least 15% more customers in the process.*\n\nCall me anytime this week:\n123-456-789 / Septicman\n\n----\n\n**Open rates are might tell that you’re doing something in the right direction. The problem is that open rates don’t pay your bills. New customers do.**\n\nThis may sound harsh but is this a business you want to be in? If you do, you need to start showing some completely different effort.\nThis applies to everything: from making phone calls like nobody else, giving useful help to clients for free like nobody else, and so on. It's a cliche but if you want to be the top 5%, you need to stuff that the other 95% isn't willing to do. \n\nWithout seeing the emails you send to people, it’s impossible to offer any help for improving them. But there’s one thing that have massive leverage (80% of the results) in your situation and it’s likely **studying copywriting**.\n\n## **Books to help you**\nThe books you can pick up in the next 3 weeks (1 book per week, shouldn’t be difficult):\n\n1. The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert (available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Boron-Letters-Gary-C-Halbert/dp/1484825985) or for free [on his website](http://www.thegaryhalbertletter.com/Boron/BoronLetterCh1.htm))\n2. Advertising Secrets of The Written Word by Joseph Sugarman (if not available, Google for summaries/reviews and take notes)\n3. Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy (you should already have this book considering your field of business)\n\nThere’s so much else you could also focus on. But you don’t need to worry about that right now. **Focus on getting really good at providing massive value to your customers from the get-go.**\n\nAnd I mean massive. Here’s a benchmark for you to aim at: make the stuff you give away to your clients better than the stuff your competitors charge their clients for. \n\n* Also, learn how you can communicate that your emails answer their needs and desires. Study what their biggest challenges are (form relationships! the 2 email examples are just a starting point for that).\n\n* The books I recommended show you that and give you timeless methods you can use in the next 2,5 or even 10 years to grow your business.\n\n**Good luck with the business and hope this helped you.**","name":"t1_ct8ef1z","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-07-19 07:37:04","week":29}

{"id":"ct8x7pd","author":"iSanddbox","body":"In poker your hand is the equity you have, and you win by correctly knowing the real value of your hand given the information you've received.\n\nThe difference with the stock market is that you're not randomly given a \"hand\", you choose your hand by deciding where to put your money. Because everybody else is playing the game, stocks on average will be priced to represent their value. Imagine if you could \"buy\" your starting hand in poker, and everything was priced according to what everyone else at the table would pay for it. As a natural result of each player trying to maximize their EV, strong hands like KQs would be more \"expensive\" than a hand like J4o. Similarly, a great business like Coke will be naturally weighted by the market to be more expensive than a business like AMD.\n\nAnd as difficult as it is to correctly know the value of a poker hand, it's far more complex to know the value of a business, so there's a lot more uncertainty about the value of a given asset.\n\n&gt;I've read that when you sell your stocks, someone has to buy it. But how do you profit from that? The general rule in trading is \"buy low, sell high\". Who will buy an expensive stock? A stock market fish?\n\nWhen other people are buying a stock that you're trying to sell, they're taking an opposite view from you. You believe the intrinsic value of the stock you're selling is currently *less* than its market value, whereas they believe the value of the stock exceeds its price. The difference with the market is that you can have extended periods of the entire market as a whole acting like fish by purchasing equities far above their intrinsic value (look at, say, the Dotcom bubble). A lot of people don't even understand the game they're playing, and just buy sexy companies like Amazon or Google with no regard to the stock price and no actual estimate of the true value of the company. Those are the truest fish you'll ever find in the stock market.\n\n&gt;So does the stock market need to have a steady supply of fish to be profitable?\n\nIn a bubble, yes. But remember that stocks represent an actual piece of the corresponding company. So if the stock price of a company has dropped far below its intrinsic value, every time you buy you're making a +EV decision. Whether you have to wait years for the market to realize that and bump up the stock price, or whether the stock is paying an immediate dividend that makes you happy to hold it, eventually you're going to see a benefit from your decision.","name":"t1_ct8x7pd","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-19 22:06:35","week":29}
{"id":"ct8y66y","author":"FlippingCurmudgeon","body":"I stopped doing this very thing 4 years ago, because of fellow scouting competition and the vast majority of bookstores still being in business having listings online as well. Not to mention the bottom of the used book market dropped out about the same time. I could once easily find $60+ books in the sciences and sell them within a month on Amazon. Now you're lucky to find $10 books that take a year or more to sell.\n\nI wouldn't do it as anything but a very small side business in your normal travels, and wouldn't go out of my way to try and expand your purchasing areas.

{"id":"ct8z6ep","author":"seattlemama","body":"You are right. Your primary responsibility is to your family. End of story. Talk to a bankruptcy attorney. Talk to two or three if you can. They will be able to give you more details on how bankruptcy will impact your specific situation. \n\nPersonally I filed 4 years ago after enduring more than a decade of mounting medical bills, and never being able to get on top of it. I applied for my first new credit card less than a month following my discharge, and got my credit score over 700 within two years. If you make a concerted effort at improving your credit after bankruptcy you will be FAR better off than trying to chip away at it for years on your own. The bankruptcy is still the only neg on my credit report, and the older it gets the less it impacts my score. Yes, there are some cards I would not be able to get with it on there, but I have plenty of cards with low interest rates and high credit limits with no annual fees now. Lots of creditors don't care. I started out applying for lots of store cards; Amazon, Target, Penney's. I used them any time I shopped those places and paid them off promptly. Pretty soon I started getting credit card offers that weren't total crap and was approved for most of them. \n\nFiling for bankruptcy isn't a personal failing. It's a strategic financial move. Your creditors will never hesitate to use the existing laws to their financial advantage. They would sue you for the money in a hot second if you quit paying. Why should you be held to a higher standard? Bankruptcy laws exist for a reason. They don't care if your family eats, has a place to live, has an emergency fund. You have no reason to feel any sort of obligation towards them if it's just going to make things harder for you in the long run. Do what is in your best interest.
