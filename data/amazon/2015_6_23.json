I've had my eBAY account for many years and remember the times before fixed prices when it was just auctions. \nNow it seems like a lot of the auctions end pretty low and there isn't that much activity on them . I'm guessing a lot of this is because people have become used to getting things now or quickly. Amazon prime shipping and all that. Not too many people want to wait around for a 7 day auction to end I guess. \n\nI'm guessing that a lot of items might just not get a buyer unless there is the best offer option perhaps.

{"id":"385pj1","author":"HatFullOfGasoline","body":"**tl;dr: Should I apply for both the Freedom and It cards for the promotions they're running? If so, should I do it right away or wait towards the end of the promos? Does it matter in what order and how close to one another I apply (considering HPs and potential rejections for too many inquiries)?**\n\nFirst of all, thank you guys. I got the Amex Delta card in January, which allowed me to book a free roundtrip flight to Japan this summer. And I'm currently finishing up the minimum spend for my Arrival+, which will be done by the end of this month, allowing me to redeem the bonus plus regular redemptions. This sub is really wonderful and you've been so helpful.\n\nI've been planning on switching to a new daily spend card once my Arrival+ minimum spend is satisfied in a few weeks (still planning to use it for 2.2% redemption on travel expenses). With all the great offers that came out today, I want to make sure I take advantage of them and do it properly. \n\nFor months I've been considering the Citi Double Cash, which never has a bonus as far as I understand, while waiting for the Chase Freedom and Discover It cards to advertise bonuses. Seems like both of those cards' new offers are no-brainers, with the only possible issue being the weak bonus for Discover ($50 amazon gift card). This makes me think I should jump on them and hold off on the Citi card.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the benefits of the Discover and Chase cards are:\n\n**Chase Freedom**\n\n* $200 bonus after $500 spend in 3 months (primary reason to get it)\n* 1% generic cash back (useless?); 5% on gas, then Amazon through the end of the year (don't spend that much on either)\n\n**Discover IT**\n\n* doubled rates = 2% cash back and 10% rotating categories (are home improvement stores an opportunity to buy gift cards?)\n* DoC says it's a good card to use in Japan (where I'll be for two weeks in August) and China (where I go usually every year)\n* no minimum spend to worry about\n\n**Both**\n\n* 0% APR\n* no annual fee\n\nMy monthly spending is normally around $2000-2500, and I'll be spending an extra $1000/mo for the next year, so ~$3000-3500/mo. The rough monthly break down:\n\n* $1500 rent\n* $250 groceries\n* $250 bars and restaurants\n* $20 gas\n* $50 amazon\n* $50 cable and utilities\n* $200-500 misc\n* the extra $1000 will go to a tattoo studio\n\nGiven these categories of spending, is there anything I'm not considering? Should I space out the applications? Should I apply for one before the other? Any other timing considerations?\n\nThanks so much, once again.","name":"t3_385pj1","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-02 03:10:32","week":23}

{"id":"386xv6","author":"leightonward","body":"Hi guys. I've been making a decent amount of money over the past 11 months simply by playing mobile games on my iPhone. I've made anywhere from $600 to $2000 per month depending on the amount of time I put in. I'd say I average around 10-15 hours a week though. I'll go ahead and highlight the important aspects of this method and how to maximize your earnings.\n\nBefore we get started let me go ahead and point out that this is NOT one of those 'download games for like 25 cents a download' guides. \n\nThe game platform I am referring to is known as Skillz [(company website)](http://skillz.com/), a real money e-sports platform. They are a new company but have already raise $13M in funding and have payed out over $10 million to players.\n\nI play the game Strike! Real Money Bowling on iOS [(found here)](http://goo.gl/JVxoJJ) which is essentially a virtual bowling game where you enter a tournament for a set fee and try to score higher than your opponent to win the total prize. They have games ranging from a $.60 entry fee to a $30 entry fee. \n\nSo, how do we monetize this?\n\nStep 1:\nDownload and install the app on your iOS device. Simple\n\nStep 2: \nCreate an account and either play some practice games to get a feel or throw some real money on and start entering tournaments\n\nStep 3: \nGet better! Winning games is obviously the key to success. Thankfully in all Skillz enabled games there is a matchmaking system that matches you against opponents of a similar skill level. This is nice when you are just starting out. Though it can get frustrating once you master the game.\n\nOther ways to earn money:\n\nEvery game on the Skillz platform features a daily leaderboard. The top earners in that game receive a cash prize added to their account at the end of the day. For example, on the game I play the leaderboard averages around $550 for first, $330 for second, $220 for third. This means as long as you can break even (or lose less than your leaderboard prize) you'll still earn money.\n\nAfter you start playing a decent amount of games you will receive an email inviting you to an exclusive weekly VIP leaderboard. There is bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and executive with bigger prizes and smaller fields as you move up the leaderboards. This week I am competing on the executive leaderboards amongst 10 other players with several thousand dollars in prizes. The benefit to these leaderboards is your winnings from all Skillz enabled games count toward your total ranking.\n\nVIP Points (aka Ticketz): \nEvery time you enter a tournament you receive ticketz. You earn more ticketz for playing games with higher entry fees, and for having a multiplier which is achieved by entering a lot of tournaments. You can cash these ticketz in for a variety of prizes ranging from in-game cash, amazon and walmart gift cards, electronics, or even a Porsche boxster. I average about $30-50 a day in Amazon gift cards from my ticketz.\n\nResources:\n\n[Strike! Real Money Bowling in the iTunes Store](http://goo.gl/JVxoJJ)\n\nStandard promo code to receive an extra $20 to your initial deposit ($10 minimum): WINNER\n\nMy promo code to receive an extra $20: 1DMLM \n\nNotes: \n\nMy apologies if this guide was really brief, I just wanted to share the method. If you guys would like more insight into strategy, maximizing profits once you understand the game, or have any confusion please let me know below so I may fill you in and update my original post to further help people.\n\nPayment Proof:\n\nMay 2015 withdrawals:\nhttp://cl.ly/image/0d3y2Q3A1L3D/IMG_0220.PNG\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1l2V080e2b0O/IMG_0219.PNG\n\nMay 2015 Ticketz bonuses: http://cl.ly/image/3r1p112z2p3I/Image%202015-06-01%20at%204.22.48%20AM.png\n\nFound old check, from my first withdrawal when I started playing last summer http://cl.ly/image/1P3Y192h2J3P/photo%202.JPG\n\nHave fun and win some money!","name":"t3_386xv6","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-02 10:00:24","week":23}

{"id":"387ef4","author":"citg0","body":"I make $32/hr as I finish up my Bachelors. I currently have two cards: my local CU Visa and my BCP AmEx. Both are paid off monthly. I practically live off of gift cards to reap the 6% cash back that the card gives when buying cards from a grocery store. Gas, food, Amazon, etc. \n\nI cap my VG (2060) Roth IRA, and contribute to my employer's Fidelity (2060) 401k max match (6%).\n\nI have a car payment of $550/mo, rent of $1k/mo, and with the remainder, I tuck away some money every month for emergency funds, save for the future (masters degree and a kid, namely) in a moneymarket account, and do try to enjoy myself, despite being the type to be willing to eat hot dogs and Ramen for a new set of wheels on the car (I'm a fanatic, and my car is far above and beyond what I needed. It's my one area of financial irresponsibility that brings me joy enough that I don't feel immensely guilty splurging). \n\nI'm getting married in Sept, but we are keeping it frugal, because neither of us has it in mind to start off our marriage in debt, plus we both see the ceremony as more or less a formality, at this point. My fiancée (24) is a nurse and makes roughly the same as me, though, admittedly, works much harder for it. I'm rubbing off on her with my frugality, and we are both on the same page with working hard and saving now to have a more enjoyable future. \n\nI guess I just want to thank you all for instilling me (us) with the vision... But what now? What is my next move? What could I be doing better? Is there a better card (SMMC)? Could I be doing more with my savings than sitting it in a MM? Are there other options for savings (similar to my IRA and 401k) that will keep me away from my money? I don't have a kid yet, so I guess a 529 is not on the table yet... Dunno, just sort of scattered with how to make my leftovers work harder. A friend recommended doing a bond rotation (ie: buy bonds in such a way that (eventually) every year, one will come to term, and you just replace it with a new bond of the same amount and pocket the gains). \n\nIt's early morning, and I'm on my phone and rambling by now. :)","name":"t3_387ef4","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-02 13:34:25","week":23}

{"id":"38bqwh","author":"iumichael","body":"I'm looking at buying a very small grocery store in a very small town.  Although the town is tiny (~800 people), the next nearest grocery store is 9.3 miles away.  The cost of the building and equipment is reasonable, as it should be for such a small town. The previous owners had about $600k in annual revenue, so assuming 25-30% gross margin the numbers work out ok.\n\nMy main two questions I'm fumbling with are finding a suitable POS that can handle WIC, EBT/SNAP, etc. I'm tech savvy, would like to handle my own hardware set up.  But would like a POS to tell me details about what is selling, when it is selling, etc. Probably only need one station, two at the most.  Not wanting to spend an obscene amount of money if possible.  $2000-$3000 at the most.  SMS by LOC is one I've looked into, but don't know the cost.  Read a little about PC America, but don't know how good it is for groceries.  Any input on these or other grocery POS systems would be appreciated.\n\nThe other question is about sourcing products.  I know a bit about the wholesale grocer who supplied the store previously, but I also know there are many items that can be purchased cheaper from Amazon/WalMart than from the wholesaler.  Any opinions on buying from Amazon to resell?  With subscribe and save, some things come cheaper from Amazon than Walmart prices, which were already cheaper than the wholesale grocer prices.  \n\nI think I had read somewhere that using prime 2-day shipping for reselling was seriously frowned upon by Amazon and could get your account banned - but what about Subscribe and Save?  Or just choosing the no rush shipping instead of the 2-day Prime option?  Not all items would be available via Amazon, so I'd still need to maintain a relationship with the wholesaler, but saving money when possible by purchasing from Amazon would only add to the margins it seems.","name":"t3_38bqwh","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-06-03 06:48:15","week":23}

This was my appeal letter,\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDear Amazon Performance Team,\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to respectfully request a repeal on a suspension that was placed on my account on 05/31/2015.\n\tMy account was suspended due to a defect ratio surpassing the 1% mark. I recognize that before the suspension of my account I was unfamiliar with the rules set by Amazon. It was due to my lack of understanding of these rules that some of my customers were dissatisfied with what they received. Amazon’s suspension of my selling privileges has helped reveal to me the mistakes made. I have created a plan of action to prevent these problems from occurring again and are as follows.\n\n1. Describing items. I will accurately inspect all items that are received. I will thoroughly inspect ALL items for stains, tears, rips. Any items with the slightest defect will NOT be sold on the Amazon Platform and discarded immediately.\n\n2. Photographs. All photographs will be taken with a brand new 2015 Cannon Rebel T5 (SLR) $500 camera (specifically purchased for this incident). Having  detailed pictures will provide my customers with a high quality resolution pictures of the product they are receiving.\n\n3. Customer Complaints. If an error occurs and a customer receives an item with a problem, I will issue a prompt refund without requiring the customer to return the unwanted item first. I will address all customer complaints promptly and to the customer’s full satisfaction. (the two negatives I have on my account have been address and already removed. I am back to 5 star rating).\n\n4. Message response time. I will check my amazon inbox twice daily. I have also installed the Amazon Seller App on my cellular device and have notifications activated.\n\n5. Prohibited items. I have read and familiarized myself with the Amazon “Seller Guidelines”. Specifically I will not sell batons on the Amazon platform. I will follow all of the Seller Guidelines rules and regulations.\n\tI would also like to Move more orders to FBA. I believe moving more items to FBA will drastically reduce other problems that may occur to due my recent growth and expansion.\n\tI am very embarrassed by recent account suspension. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused Amazon. I respectfully request that my account be reinstated. These beginner seller mistakes will not happen again.\n\t\tRespectfully Submitted,\n   \t\t\t  MrChris13\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHowever I just received a reply from amazon stating that it was not accepted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello, \n\nWe appreciate the information you have provided.

{"id":"38jzg0","author":"MannaFromEvan","body":"With the recent wedding budget post, I thought I'd share mine just for fun.\n\nOverall costs were in the neighborhood of 6k. We had roughly 200 guests, provided appetizers, a meal, dessert, wine, and danced for hours. We had two priorities, that our ceremony be very personal and meaningful (we have degrees in philosophy and religion so had a lot to draw from) and that the reception be one big ass party. Anything that didn't contribute to one of those two things just wasn't worth it to us, and we probably didn't even think about it.\n\nHere goes:\n* Venue: Free- We got married in a round barn in Indiana. I know, I know, but this was concrete floors, two levels, with a parking lot, and surrounded by mown grass fields. It is used exclusively as an event space/wedding venue. The woman that owns it never charges anyone. You just put your name on the list and show up that weekend to decorate. We also had the ceremony on the lawn under a giant old tree.\n\n* Officiant- Free. A friend and his wife performed the ceremony.\n\n* Invitations/Programs/Stamps- $300. Graphic design friend made the invitations. Printed them somewhere online. Did an online RSVP to save on return postage. Also provided a number to call as another option (wife's grandma). She's mostly at home and loved having friends and family call in. Kept a list by the phone of who was coming.\n\n* Clothes: $150. She bought a beautiful white bridesmaid dress from ModCloth. I bought a nice shirt and pants.\n\n* Rings: $600- This includes the engagement ring. Hers is antique style white gold with a synthetic stone (I don't know anyone who is a geologist, so no one can tell the difference). Mine's titanium- $10 on Amazon. \n\n* Chairs and Tables: $1200- rented and delivered. We set up. Got 200 chairs and used them for both the ceremony and reception. Just had the young folks stack em up and move them into the barn. Took 15 minutes while everyone else milled around, had some appetizers or took pics.\n\n* Bathroom rental- $300- No bathroom at the barn. We got two port-a-potties. They were delivered clean the day before, and were the nice kind. Warned the grandparents ahead of time.\n\n* Catering- $2200 A friends mom does catering on the side. She's a great cook. We did a buffet of grilled chicken salads. Lots of toppings and excellent home-made dressings (Easy and cheap in large quantities). Bonus: didn't need a vegetarian option. Veggie-lovers just didn't add chicken. Bonus 2: she had linen tablecloths we could borrow.\n\n* Wine: $200 of box wine. Low quality sure, but there was plenty of it. And let's be honest, that's what people want. (We put it in serving bowls, we're not that tacky.)\n\n* Dessert/Tent: $200- A friend made homemade cupcakes. She loves to bake. We paid for the supplies and should have paid her more for her work, but she didn't want us to. I needed to buy a small pop-up canopy for the caterer's to use. Afterwards, I told her to take it home as a thank you. She's been selling her goods at Farmer's Markets and I knew she'd get more use out of it than we would have.\n\n* Rehearsal Dinner: $200-$300 Grilled out at our church and had my mom make my favorite desserts.\n\n* Cigars: $100- Not everybody likes to dance, and it sucks when there is nothing for you to do. I set up a cigar bar across the field. Didn't spend much time out there, but about 30 people spent all night hanging out and talking, with the music quiet in the background. Actually got people from different cites talking and getting to know each other. People told me it was the most fun they had ever had at a wedding. Also told certain friends to bring yard games, and set them up for another non-dancing option.\n\n* Decorations: $300 sourced from garage sales and craft stores, and glass canning jars from my grandma's house.\n\n* Photography: $600- A professional photographer friend insisted that she wanted to shoot our wedding even after we told her we couldn't afford her. We actually would have just hired an art student for a couple hundred so we ended up paying more, but in the end it was worth it and a great deal for us.\n\n* Flowers: $100 Bought from a roadside stand. Beautiful giant bouquets for $5 each. Would have easily been 2k from a florist and they wouldn't have been as colorful or varied. \n\n* DJ: Free- Got a friend who loves to spin. He works at the college and takes out the sound equipment and lights if it's not in use.\n\n* Cigars: $100- Not everybody likes to dance, and it sucks when there is nothing for you to do. I set up a cigar bar across the field. Didn't spend much time out there, but about 30 people spent all night hanging out and talking, with the music quiet in the background. Told me it was the most fun they had ever had at a wedding. Also told people to bring yard games, and set them up for another non-dancing option.\n\n* Gifts: $500- I love gift-giving and am great at it. I bought gifts for everyone who helped. If your friends are saving you hundreds or thousands of dollars, you out let them know you appreciate it. Bottle of scotch is a great idea if you're stuck.\n\n* Party Favors: $300-400- Checked out all the thrift/discount stores throughout the summer and bought up classic books, or books that have been meaningful to my wife and I. Stories are important to us, and our people are a part of our story. We ordered a stamp online and stamped the inside of each cover. Everyone took a book home. Mostly classics, or YA fiction, but everybody found something they didn't have or had somehow never read but always meant to. It was fun.\n\n* Send off- $100 paper lanterns. Kind of unneccessary and I didn't think we needed them. Plus it's basically littering. But it was so dark out there, they looked amazing. Big highlight.\n\nTime/Stress: We did a lot of set up at the venue the day or two before. Not gonna lie, it was some work. As much as our friends helped out the day of, we did most of the stuff on the front end ourselves (both our family's lived out of town). Other than the books, we didn't really craft. Too much work, for little payoff, and it doesn't make a party great- that's what cigars, wine, food, and music are for, and that's where we spent our time/money. \n\nMost importantly, what made it a great wedding, was our friends and family. We're lucky enough to have 200 people that we love spending time with, and who love giving back to us. If you add up everything they did for us, it would easily have been twice as expensive. Of course, if we didn't have those friends we would have eloped. Remember, a reception is a party. Your friends should be excited about it, and it shouldn't be about \"you\". I don't think we cut the cake, tossed the bouquet or did any of the traditions that have no meaning for us. IMO they break up the flow of the party. The ceremony was for my wife and I. That's where we were in the spotlight (and I can provide more details on it if anyone is interested). The party was a party. And the easiest way to screw up a party is to make it all about you.\n\nEdit: Some photos of the venue are hosted [here.](http://rachelskyepd.blogspot.com/2013/08/eclectic-boho-wedding.html) Apparently we're boho in wedding industry terms.

{"id":"38k2eb","author":"SKINNYFATTIES","body":"My quest to prioritize mental energy.\n\nWhen I start my day, I spend 40 minutes getting ready in the morning. I shower, get dressed, then head back to the restroom to put the final touches on and I’m out the door. When I get to my office, I have to make tons of decisions. I’m answering to our customers, staff, and outside contractors for matters ranging from creative direction, to legal/financial matters, to product development — it’s all my call. One small miscalculated decision could cost us tons of money, lead us to a dead end, or break a fragile partnership we’ve worked so hard on. It’s important that I’m on point and ready to answer like a boss.\n\nNaturally, as a start-up CEO, I experience decision fatigue, which according to becomingminimalist.com, refers to the “deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a long session of decision making”. I feel mentally drained by the end of each day — I can’t even decide what to watch next on Netflix.\n\nWhen the idea to wear the same thing every day entered my mind, I tossed it around with friends (most said I was nuts). I later did a quick Google search and found that I wasn’t alone in this logic. As a matter of fact, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Albert Einstein, and Barack Obama all wear/wore the same outfit every day.\n\n“It’s the same willpower that you use to be polite or to wait your turn or to drag yourself out of bed or to hold off going to the bathroom,”\nsays Roy F. Baumeister, a psychologist who studies decision fatigue and a co-author of [Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength](http://amzn.to/1AF5CVX).\n\n“Your ability to make the right investment or hiring decision may be reduced simply because you expended some of your willpower earlier when you held your tongue in response to someone’s offensive remark or when you exerted yourself to get to the meeting on time.”\n\nI was sold on the lifestyle. I decided on black shoes, black pants/shorts, and a white long-sleeve/short-sleeve button-up oxford shirt — always tailored to fit my body. This style pairs nicely with my [SKINNYFATTIES](http://www.skinnyfatties.com/) tie, the one thing I want people to take notice of. I took things a bit further and gave my barber a visit for a simple buzz cut.\n\n**Bottom-line: No more outfit-picking decisions each morning or time spent forcing my unruly colic to comply; more time and mental energy spent focusing on the success of my team and growing company.**","name":"t3_38k2eb","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-04 21:05:22","week":23}

{"id":"38keea","author":"[deleted]","body":"I was looking around on the App Store and found a new (to me) app. \nIt's called \"Cash Reward, Free Gift Card.\" (Link at bottom) It seems very shady at first, but I've had it for about 10 minutes and am already at 60 coins. \n\nThere are a few ways to earn.\n[option 1](http://i.imgur.com/5K5AdAn.png)\n[option 2](http://i.imgur.com/v6RU4l1.png)\n[option 3](http://i.imgur.com/8mRwa2d.png)\n\n**Option 1:** This is a Wheel Of Fortune type of thing, where you spin the wheel and get any of the amounts shown on the wheel. The ones that say \"luck\" just mean zero. The ones with a ? and a gift box, I haven't gotten yet so I couldn't say what that does. This option does **NOT** cost any coins to do. However, there is a \"Cooling Time\" that it takes before you can spin again, but it's only a couple minutes.\n\n**Option 2:** This is a slot machine. What it does is lets you bet a certain amount of coins, (not sure how they decide how many) and you spin the slot machine. If you get 2 of the same icon, you get double your bet amount, and if all 3 match, 4 times your bet amount. This one has the advantage of NO COOLING TIME, but also is the least lucrative in my opinion.\n\n**Option 3:** This one is a Scratch And Win. How this one works is you pay 5 coins to play, and then scratch off the block of green in the middle. Quite self explanatory. However, the big pro with this one is it pays out almost every single time. I've gotten as low as 2 coins, and as high as 24. There IS COOLING TIME with this one.\n\nI also took advantage of [this,](http://i.imgur.com/KA64A81.png) which, once you've got 50 coins, will let you \"deposit\" 50 of them and doubles them for you to take back in 24 hours. **NOTE: This is a one-time only thing and can only be done within 3 days of sign up!**\n\nThis app is not passive, per se, but definitely takes very little effort. The app is iOS only however, and it doesn't seem they will be rolling out an Android version.\n\nRewards you can earn are Amazon/Paypal $1 for 600 points, Amazon/Paypal $2 for 1200 points, Amazon/Paypal $5 for 2900 points, and Amazon/Paypal $10 for 5500 points\n\n[link.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cash-reward-free-gift-card/id980806674?mt=8) There are no referral programs. It also says it's a 17+ app, but that doesn't really matter unless you're on family sharing\n\n**BIG TIP: This app looks incredibly shady, but I don't believe it is due to Apple's extensive security checks for the apps it allows onto the App Store. It also has a 4 star rating on almost 50 ratings.**","name":"t3_38keea","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-04 22:09:26","week":23}

I've worked at a variety of food service jobs.  I've absolutely hated them all.  People talking down to you like you're to stupid to make a sandwich and such.\n\nIn my spare time not working I would often buy things at garage sales and sell them on ebay for beer money.  For instance, I bought a purple rain 8 track for .25 and sold it for 12 dollars.  That's beer for the entire weekend.  Started to seem like there might be some serious money in it when I bought a 2 dollar slide show set that sold for 50 on ebay.\n\nAs I started to go further and further down the flipping rabbit hole I discovered Profit Bandit and this thing called retail arbitrage just a few days ago.

It's a pure pass-through. And, if I put the expense in any budgeting software it will want me to add \"income\" to cover it. This makes my budget not match my paycheck/W2 (although it does match my bank account).\n\nFor category #2, I might buy something for my son on Amazon (because he doesn't have an account). And, because he got good grades, I might have him only pay for half of the item.  \n\nIn final tally, the budget would show a $50 expense (allowance), $50 expense (amazon item), $25 income (cash from kid).

{"id":"38pstv","author":"CaliforniaGiant","body":"Unfortunately a lot of frivolous spending, poor decisions, ignorance, and procrastination has led to me piling up quite a bit of debt. I have been making about 32K a year and just recently got a raise that should net me at least $700 more per month. I'm finally thinking enough about the future to get my butt and gear and get this to go away as painlessly with possible. \nI am just wondering what the best way to go about this (whether its contacting a debt consolidator, trying to transfer to one card, taking out a loan at a certain interest rate, or whatever). I currently bank with Chase and have been wanting to switch to my local credit union that I also have a car loan with if that helps.\n\nMy credit card debt are as follows:\n\n$1,601.60 at 22.9% Capital One Visa\n$1,946.72 at 15.24% Costco Amex\n1,243.85 at 18.24% Amazon Chase Visa\nand 1,345.17 24.9% Chase Visa (previously mastercard)\nfor a grand total of $6137.34 at this very moment\n\nI also have two open cards with a furniture store and Kay jewelers but both those have been paid off in full.\n\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated.","name":"t3_38pstv","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-05 22:30:32","week":23}

{"id":"38q8us","author":"BeerMagic","body":"Hello /r/pf, \n\nI am looking to get my life turned around with my finances. I'm 22, I live on my own and make just *Barely* enough to survive on. \n\nI work for an IT-service desk. I make $14/ hour, full time 2-11pm with a 401k and other health benefits. \n\nAfter taxes and benefits (benefits don't cost much) my paychecks are $790 and some odd change.\n\nMy expenses are as follows:\n\nRent(due at first of month): $440 - I am usually always late because my pay periods never match up with my rent due date. They add about 80 dollars worth of late fees by the time that I'm able to pay it - and they will not work with me, instead, they will file against me on court the monday before the 21st. Then make me pay court filing fees on top of my rent owed - no matter the amount remaining.\n\nConsumers energy - The amount varies, but due to struggling to make payments I'm banned from any payment plans. I just paid $440 dollars to cover past due balances...\n\nCharter internet: Not a big deal of a bill, $60 a month, but I am behind a month always. So 120 to be actually caught up, only to be behind again.\n\nGas: I work about 40 minutes away from where I live. $20 of gas gives me about 3 round trips to work. *If I go absolutely nowhere else* Full tank is about $40, and lasts me a week to 6 days, again if I go no where.\n\nFood:  Ibuy enough groceries to last me a week or two -Hopefully-, depending on what I buy, I try to stick to non perishables.\n\nCar payment: I have $240 a month going to the bank. $120 out of every paycheck up to 2 times. and then I have $200 going to my father to pay him off. I owe him about $3000. I try to make every payment on the 20th. But again haven't been able to..\n\n\nAll my bills are out of sync - None of them will work with me. I am constantly juggling bills and have not been *on time* with a payment - especially rent, in a year and 3 months. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBILLS THAT I HAVENT PAID IN OVER 2 YEARS:\n\nThankfully this list is small, but not very small in terms of expense.\n\nAmazon: I have an amazon store care bill for $1000. Initially it was only $600, but I haven't paid it in over a year, so add $400 of late fees and interest....\n\nStudent loans: only about 2k, but again, I've never made a payment on them since I quit school over 2 years ago.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI have nothing to sell. - My hobbies don't yield any profit because no one wants to buy anything. \n\nAll I have is old MMO-Gaming accounts that I do still play when I have a tiny bit of cash to pay for them.\n\nI don't have any consoles outside of a WII that I can part with. \n\nand the only thing I have in my apartment that would be worth really anything is my computer - That again, I couldn't part with. \n\nI'm also trying to not eat out - I've been struggling with depression and stress eating - I don't order expensive meals, but the little dollar menu purchases add up.\n\n\nAny advice that you have would help a lot.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n- BeerMagic","name":"t3_38q8us","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-06 00:24:48","week":23}

{"id":"38v5my","author":"moorcacas","body":"In this post, I will be going through how you can leverage existing online opportunities to bootstrap your project, using less than 100$ to launch and validate your idea. In concrete, I'll have a look at 3 main categories: Domains, Web Hosting and Marketing.\n\n\n**Domains**\n\nUsually, this category will represent a big slice of the total costs. I will admit that this is the one area in which I struggled to cut expenditure and did end up buying a .io domain from namecheap (at around 30$). However, I'd recommending trying the following before resorting to this:\n\n1- Browse [flippa](http://www.flippa.com) for cheap domains in your niche. You'll sometime find acceptable domains for under $10 by people who tried to get a similar project off the ground but failed.\n\n2- Register a free .tk or .co.nr address. These domains aren't brilliant, but might just be enough to validate your idea and make some revenue to fund a new domain.\n\n\n**Hosting**\n\nOnce you have a domain, you'll need to host the actual website somewhere. Once again, this will probably represent a huge percentage of your costs, so any savings you can do in this category will be golden. Fortunately, I've got some tips:\n\n1- Get free 1000$ AWS (Amazon Web Services) credit . Amazon offers 1000$ in AWS credit through their AWS Activate program. If you manage to get accepted into it, you'll have enough credit to survive at least a few months. This is actually how I'm funding this project. I didn't apply for the program though, I was lucky enough to spot that [MITx is offering this 1000$ credit to whoever pursued their entrepreneurship MOOC](https://www.edx.org/AWS-activate) (which costs only $50). This way, I get to list this MIT course in my CV and will be able to keep this project afloat for a while in a highly scalable environment.\n\n2- Get up to 750$ of Microsoft Azure credit every month for 3 years. Similarly to AWS, Azure offers free hosting credit and support to a select few startups and projects. [You can apply here.](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/)\n\n\n\n**Marketing**\n\nAlthough I'm a big believer in organic marketing, specially for bootstrapped projects, taking advantage of coupons and promotions by the big platforms can always help. Here are a few that are pretty much constant:\n\n1- [Spend 25$ in Google Adwords, get 75$ in free credit](http://www.google.com/ads/adwords-coupon.html). This is another promotion I'm using and can honestly say that has been extremely useful. Search queries can be a major source of traffic so kickstarting your SEO efforts with an Adwords campaign is a great idea.\n\n2- [Get 50$ in free Bing/Yahoo!

{"id":"38wl9k","author":"geebseytwo","body":"I own a very small business (net profit for the year is about £7500). He wants to invest just under £10,000 into it (sort of). It's an online sporting goods website, and we also sell on eBay and Amazon. I have never received investment before. \n\nThe plan for the money is to buy stock. We generate enough traffic to our website and our sales on eBay and Amazon don't require any marketing.\n\nWhat we wants to do is to buy the stock, and then, as we sell it, he gets the cost of buying the item and a little extra back. He will do this for each item. So, for example, it costs £10 and we sell it for £50, he'd get back £10 for the cost of the item, plus another £20 as profit. This would leave us with £20. (This is purely an example to demonstrate how it would work).  He basically wants 50% of the net profit of the item, for every item sold that he paid for. As it is a limited company, he would like some shares. The company will not give out dividends, and they will be redeemable non-voting shares. What percentage is reasonable? I was thinking around 30%, based on the value of the company and the investment.\n\nThere is no risk to us this way. We already sell all of the items but we have to buy them through a third party on a much smaller scale, and we also can't buy the quantity we want because our supplier never has enough for us to buy. By going directly to the manufacturer we are able to buy more at a lower cost, as well as ensuring our best-selling items are always in stock. In the event that we get some dead stock, he will have to bear the brunt of that. But, as I said before, we already sell all of this stuff and it not selling is unlikely. \n\nHow does this sound? Please bear in mind I have no experience in this area.","name":"t3_38wl9k","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-07 15:16:01","week":23}

All the surveys are very easy to qualify for and pay from $0.50 to $3.00+ on occasions.  The site is very well put together and Ghostery is only showing they have 3 tracking cookies, 2 from Facebook and one from Google Analytics.\n\nRight now I have $34 survey dollars which are equivalent to USD.  I stopped responding to surveys for about 4 month because I was lazy and didn't feel like committing the 5-10 minutes each survey requires, but I recently started up again.  The only caveat to the site is that the minimum cash out is $50, but once you reach that threshold you can cash out directly to a bank account, prepaid Visa, or Amazon gift card.  Referrals net you $5 each, so that's a quick way to boost your balance.

I primarily use two business credit cards (which I don't prefer, even though I don't carry a balance) and I'm starting to use more of the cash/profits just to reduce overall risk.

One of the products will sell through in ~1 week and the other which is a higher-end product will sell through 50 units in about ~2 weeks.\n\n4) With my lax logistics efforts it can take about 2-3 weeks between ordering, receiving, prep, pickup, delivery, check-in for sale. Some of this is waiting for the cash to get things paid off before reordering.\n\n5) Amazon pays out every 10 days or so I believe but you can request a manual payment anytime.

This has a few perks:\n\n- You can easily track all of your purchases\n- You have a safety net for losing a wallet/purse (cancel card) and dealing with a bad transaction/service (charge backs)\n- You can get cash back for price reductions (some cards have a feature where you can get the difference refunded to you on an item if the price drops within a certain number of days after the purchase)\n- You can get cash back or rewards points on items you already 100% would spend money on (like gas, your cable bill, etc)\n\nNaturally, there's a bunch of other card-specific perks, but the catch is you have to pay the card off in full, so it takes a bit of thinking ahead and self control, but you don't get these benefits above if you pay cash (I assume you do since you're collecting change as time goes on).\n\nAs someone who may or may not but definitely did recently lose a wallet out of his backpack on his motorcycle, cards vs. cash has saved my bacon a few times, and it's good to get money back for other purchases with my Amazon card for things I'm buying anyways.\n\nYMMV, and either way you clearly know what you're doing and are on the right track, so congrats!","name":"t1_crs5efa","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-01 21:23:04","week":23}

{"id":"crscv3y","author":"radioactivesheep","body":"Depending on the exact specifications that price might be a bit steep. But a system like that is not going to be much cheaper.\n\nIt's quite specific so there is (virtually) no ready-made software available. A piece of code (software) of which you can sell thousands (or millions) of copies will be much cheaper than a custom item since the development costs are spread over more customers.\n\nAlso I'd like to mention that you compare the cost of the system to the revenue of your business. That makes sense, because this is an investment for your company. However, the price may not be unreasonable. Possibly a such a price is a reasonable price for the work involved and a system like that might currently only be available to larger companies. Extreme example: my neighbors' local bookstore would love to own a website like Amazon, but with its comparatively small revenue a system like that would be far out of reach.\n\nIt's sad that even though I.T. systems become increasingly affordable, some (relatively basic) technology is still out of reach for SMBs. I believe there must be a profitable way to build custom, modular systems at an affordable price.\n\nLastly, I only mean to offer some perspective. Maybe I am being altruistic. I wonder if the price surprised you because it was so high compared to your revenue, or if you were surprised because of the absolute value of the price (i.e., you expected a system like that would be easier/faster and thus cheaper to build)?","name":"t1_crscv3y","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-02 00:40:49","week":23}

There's a difference in a testimonial saying \"This product WILL make you lose 25kg in 6 months\" and one saying \"This could help towards losing 25kg in 6 months\".\n\nThen there's the laws which prevent you claiming a testimonial from someone who has not agreed to it or provided one, like fake celebrity endorsements. You can't buy a celebrity workout tape, copy all of the contents and then use their image to advertise it saying that \"this celebrity uses these exercises\".\n\nMost of all, if a company cares about what their customers think of them, they shouldn't use false reviews, because the second someone finds out that the reviews were false, all credibility, and often business, is impossible to recapture.","name":"t1_crsy9e4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-02 15:42:18","week":23}

I tried A levels at 6th form. Got kicked out because they couldn't understand that I am disabled and sick, not stupid.\n\nI started an eCommerce site just after I was kicked out of 6th form. My initial investment was £500, I could of invested more but I needed money to fall back on in case it failed.\n\nI am now turning over a million a year in sales through the eCommerce site, eBay and Amazon. I am still a sole proprietor and have a grand total of 0 employees. I do pretty much everything myself, except for the odd person I temporary hire on a contracted basis to do customer service for when I am travelling and at peak times like Christmas.\n\nMy business is fully automated except the customer service side. All orders are transferred straight to the fulfillment centres. Stock is re-ordered on an automatic basis depending on how much stock is left, and is delivered direct to the fulfillment centre.\n\nIf I could, I'd automate customer service. But alas, I am stuck doing customer service because I can't be fucked going through the hassle of employing someone.\n\n--\n\nI also do housing lets. I started investing the money from the eCommerce site when I was 18 into housing. I buy houses normally around £100-150k, and convert them into studio flats which rent between £85-£110 a week depending on the area. I get around 7 flats per property so £30k-40k return on each. They're then rented to those on low income, homeless etc. I get the rent paid direct to me from the government.\n\nOnce again, no employees. I use contractors to convert the flats, repairs etc. I very rarely visit them myself as I am normally abroad and most of them are over 200 miles from my home.","name":"t1_crt12e4","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-06-02 17:06:11","week":23}

{"id":"crtgb6r","author":"Gunshot_glitter","body":"I had to deal with this when I was given Amazon gift cards that I couldn't use because I was overseas. \nMake a new Amazon account under a pseudo name and add your gift card balance there.  On your normal account, make a seller profile if you haven't already, and list an item, such as a used high end computer, which will total (with shipping) at $1500. Then, buy the item with your gift card from your other account. Make sure you are buying from the correct seller under the \"other buying options\" page. \nIt's important to purchase the item from the new (fake) account, as Amazon will verify that the sale seems legit. When entering a shipping address for the \"seller\" (you) use any address not associated with your main account.  On your seller account, you will have to verify that you have shipped the item, and then amazon will eventually deposit the money into the bank account that you linked with the seller account. This takes awhile, but you get the most money this way. \n\nAmazon takes a small percentage of your sale, but it should be nothing compared to selling the gift card somewhere else.

{"id":"cru5jgs","author":"nichesiteazon","body":"If you are aiming to create a true \"authority\" site, then I recommend following Humblesalesman's advice below.\n\nIf, however, you are interested in a (mostly) passive income stream of turning this into a simple \"niche\" site (that can still earn well), then you need to focus really on two things: content, and backlinks.\n\nFirst off, what are the top 2-3 keywords you are trying to rank for? I would assume \"best drone\", \"drone reviews\" and some variation of those?\n\nNext, I would concentrate on creating ONE EPIC REVIEW PAGE that features reviews of the 5 best drones on the market today. With ALL 5 reviews on the SAME PAGE. \n\nIt's been mentioned, but your \"reviews\" are WAY too short.  Each individual drone review should be at least 750 words. So if you do 750 words x 5 drones you're at  3,750 words already. You would also need sections on this page such as \"what to look for in buying a drone\", \"advantages of having a drone\", etc. (I don't know anything about drones, but you get the idea). Each of these sections should be at least 500 words. Add an intro and conclusion, and you're well over 5,000 words on one EPIC page.\n\nThis is the page you want to rank for!\n\nForget about \"news\" (no one cares), forget about the blog -- these will never rank for anything, and won't generate any money, because they won't see any traffic. \n\nRemember, this is if you're going the niche site route (not authority). \n\nSo how do you get 5,000 words of review content on a product you don't own? Personally, I hire someone to write all my product review pages, but he never touches the product, and certainly doesn't belong to any enthusiasts clubs. \n\nHe READS THE CUSTOMER reviews and re-purposes them as his own opinion. \n\nAmazon makes this incredibly easy. You want your reviews to be largely positive, so check out the most-recommended 5 and 4 star Amazon reviews, and see what people are saying about what they like about the product. Do the same with the negative reviews when you're pointing out the flaws.\n\nThis makes it sound like you have an actual opinion about the product, without simply summarizing the product features --- though the product features listed on the Amazon sales pages is definitely something you want to incorporate into your reviews.\n\nNow, you have one epic 5,000 word resource analyzing the 5 best drones on the market.\n\nTime to build backlinks! \n\nAs was mentioned, nobody will give you a white hat link when you have an affiliate site. Good news? It doesn't matter!\n\nI've never built a white hat link, because all my sites are niche affiliates and nobody would bother linking to it naturally.\n\nWhich is why I build my links using PBNs. I'm not going to write a whole story on this tactic, just Google it. Yes, it will cost you a little coin, but if your keyword research is on point, and you've analyzed your competition so that you're reasonably sure you can rank in the top 3-5 on Google, then the investment will be worth it. (Of course, building links this way is risky, be warned).\n\nSo that's what I would do.\n\nBut I'll reiterate this would be my plan if I wanted to make this a niche site (which is I would), rather than a so-called authority site that will take you forever to build up and which still has no guarantees of success (income).\n\nGood luck.\n\nEDIT: I'll add that I don't recommend just having a 1 page site. I recommend making that the focus on your content and linking strategy. After that page is up, sure, you can write 700-1,000 word \"articles\", and sprinkle them onto the site. 10-15 should do the trick. But these will just be to show Google you have some additional content, that's informational. You shouldn't monetize these posts, and most likely you won't even want to try to rank them. Just filler for Google, basically. ","name":"t1_cru5jgs","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-03 16:23:57","week":23}

If you want to sell things, especially as an unknown artist, you can't afford to have people hassled when they try to purchase your music. iTunes does not sell mp3s at all, to the best of my knowledge. Amazon is clunky when it comes to searching for music. Beatport is huge mess, organization and transaction-wise; their download method is clunky and makes no sense. All three of these require artists to go through a distributor to sell music, which is not only unnecessary but also takes money away from the artists.\n\nBandcamp is \"better\" but managing the upload of music on there is a huge hassle. There is no centralized marketplace where artists can get good exposure without promoting on their own. Biggest thing though is the management of the music on the backend - Bandcamp's backend is like a maze, with no light source.\n\nSoundcloud does it best - and I struggle to say that, because their service is constantly down or broken in some way - and they don't allow artists to sell music directly through their service.\n\nThose are the \"big\" ones.

{"id":"crung1w","author":"SeanRamey","body":"No, on ALL purchases there is an APR interest rate charged to you. Even on the Amazon cash back card. You need to learn a little more about how credit cards work. They have to make money some how, and it's through interest charged. Now most of them have an intro period where it's common to charge no interest, but after that period (which is usually about 12 months) then they start charging a (usually) variable interest rate of about 13% - 22%. You have to pay the interest AND the principal amount. They tend to hide this information from you. You need to find the Terms and Conditions page and read it!\n\nEDIT: This is how so many people got suckered into credit card debt... They didn't read the fine print! Pay attention! Be careful!

It has both networking and duplexing capabilities (as well as the standard USB connection), which may or may not interest you, but are difficult to find in sub-$200 printers. My wife has been using it all through grad school to print out 50 and 100+ page documents. We also used it for wedding programs and thank you cards - it does cardstock quite well. It just started giving a low toner message (the toner it ships with is just a starter, not full sized) and current page count is 2,220. As for other wear-and-tear parts, the drum is at 93% and everything else is at 98% or better.

For several weeks before the wedding they would sit in our living room floor and put things together - wine bottle centerpieces with ribbon and artificial flowers, burlap and other material for table runners, flowers for the bride and her attendants, etc.  And yes, a lot of the ideas they used came from Pinterest. We had a friend do the wedding cake for the cost of ingredients. We used our church for the wedding and reception. Rather than have a meal, we opted for finger foods, fruits and veggies. For drinks we offered punch, iced tea, bottled water and coffee. Music was played over the church sound system from a list of songs the bride and groom had selected. We also set up a candy bar with various candies I had ordered from Amazon. In keeping with the bride and grooms wishes, it was a simple ceremony and reception and didn't cost me a fortune. Total cost for everything was under $5,000 and we received so many compliments afterward. \n\nMy point is be frugal, just don't be cheap. You know what I mean?

{"id":"crvc0sm","author":"AussieMoisture","body":"I sell things here on Reddit. I would, but I can't advertise on Amazon, eBay or Craigslist because what I do is \"adult industries\" and a lot of mass selling sites don't allow it. Also, I would like to venture into something that's not so heavy on the customer service front. Selling used garments and fetish related produce is not for the faint hearted. You learn a lot about the human psyche and in doing so, you become aware of a lot of things. It's a very, very customer service driven market - one that I genuinely love partaking in.\n\n-\n\n\nIt's highly lucrative for the amount of hours I put into it, however, I'm looking into other ways of creating ways of making money for myself.\n\n-\n\nI figured I would start from the basics, hence why I posted in this thread. I am business oriented. I know what good and bad practise is, I know that to get anywhere in business you need as open a mind as you can get.\n\n-\n\nBack to this thread. \"Where to buy\" seems to be obvious. Thrift stores, sales, garage sales, property clearing sales, etc - anywhere you can buy a quality item for a dirt cheap price. Not hard.\n\n-\n\nInventory control is not a problem for me and neither is book work. I have severe OCD, and I quite enjoy making sure my books remain balanced, up to date, I record data so I can see which sales are doing well, I have my own flow so I can see what is affected by season/holiday, etc.\n\n-\n\nSo related to my questions I posted here in this thread, regarding flipping, is essentially specific to the successful sellers here on Reddit. *Where* do you advertise? *What payments* do you take for your online orders? \n\n-\n\nEssentially I'm setting up a base for myself to run two businesses under two pseudonyms, as I understand most people who want to buy an original set of, for argument's sake, First Edition William Shakespeare's Mid-Summer Night's Dream don't want that seller to be associated with selling fetish photography. It's just not a good look.\n\n-\n\nSo I'm perfectly willing to be running two different browsers for two different \"identities\" (I personally don't want to be associated with either - and I'm quite used to sending anonymous goods internationally by post at this stage) with my online businesses. I was hoping someone would provide a fellow seller (if you count purchasing $3 panties and selling them for $75 a pair) or \"flipper\" some friendly advice on how to get started by means of \"where to advertise goods\" and \"what payment methods are generally accepted\" as I seem to have the ideal of flipping (purchase/inventory control/customer service/advertising itself/postage/anonymity) well established.","name":"t1_crvc0sm","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-04 16:41:50","week":23}

{"id":"crvlafa","author":"AVANAGEEK","body":"From an amazon help page:\n\n\"Label Requirements\nEach Unit you send to Amazon for fulfillment needs a scannable bar code to enable storage at a fulfillment center. Follow these guidelines to ensure prompt and accurate labeling of your Units.\n\nNote: If you don't want to apply labels yourself, you can sign up for Stickerless Commingled Inventory or the FBA Label Service.\n\nIn order to change your account from stickerless, commingled inventory to labeled inventory, follow the steps below:\n\nGo to Settings &gt; Fulfillment by Amazon &gt; Inventory Settings (Stickerless Commingled Inventory)\nClick the 'Edit' button\nSelect 'Disable' and click 'Save'\nAfter changing this setting, you will need to relist your products before you can send them in as labeled inventory.\n\nSo basically whether you forced a label to print or not, the MSKU was created as comingled so Amazon is not expecting labels on there.  If they get your products with labels covering the UPCs they need to scan, they probably wont be happy and your inventory will require rework by them or require you to return it to yourself.\n\nI think your best bet would be to delete your listings, get the inventory setting you want, and list them again.  Problem is I dont think your FNSKUs (the number on the FBA labels) will be the same if you re-create your listings, so I think those labels you just printed and applied are worthless.\n\nI would test one product to see if you can get it to have the same FNSKU when re-creating it with the right setting.

I know a bit of HTML and CSS, but Javascript/PHP/AJAX is way out of my league. We knew that to have a successful site, it had to be better than every other site out there. Our developer is honestly a coding prodigy. He's a pain in my ass (Hi Andre), but the guy can make anything happen. If he doesn't know how to do it, he learns immediately. When we see something we like on Amazon or another site, he implements it. He cleans up the code and makes sure the site is running smooth at all times. \n\nOur warehouse workers print invoices, wrap products, pack boxes, print labels, and load the mail truck. The two of us simply could not package all the orders ourselves anymore. We waited until it was far too late and our business was suffering because we were spending all of our time packing orders - huge mistake. \n\nNext was customer service. There was no way we could answer the phones, emails, live chats, social media DMs ourselves and we needed help there. \n\nMore shipping guys became necessary as time went on, and then our original worker became their manager. \n\nContent was next. We focus heavily on expanding our product selection, and it became impossible for us to add all those products. They need descriptions, photos, metadata, etc. Also, we needed someone to write blog articles, featured articles on other sites, etc. \n\nNext was graphic design, and shes fairly recent (it's been just a few weeks since she was hired) \n\nOur newest employee is our office assistant, and that has probably been the most helpful so far. She takes care of filing papers, emailing people, and other miscellaneous stuff that we just don't have time for.\n\n&gt;Has the design and infrastructure of the site changed a lot since you started?\n\nThe site changes every day, but there was a major migration from one SaaS platform to another. Don't ever use Volusion. We constantly add features, A/B test certain things, and make adjustments we think help our customers shop. \n\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_crvr8u5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-04 23:18:16","week":23}

If an item can be purchased online, they list it on Amazon.  If you're ever purchasing an item on Amazon for personal use and see DropAir as a seller, you should just google the item because it means one of the big box stores has it in stock online for a much cheaper price.\n\nThey seem to take advantage of the free shipping platforms (ShopRunner for TRU/KMart, etc; and Target's Redcard free shipping) which seems like it would have to be a violation of those services such as it is for Amazon Prime. If an order comes in on Amazon, they place an order on these websites and have it shipped directly to the customer. This is why I state that I have no idea why their feedback isn't in the 80s.  If I'm a customer and I purchase something from Amazon that shows up directly from Target in a Target box, I'll go to their website to see how much it was there. Once I see I overpaid by $10, I'd immediately leave bad feedback for the seller.\n\nAlso, I'm not convinced Best Brands Toys isn't some super secret subsidiary of Toys R Us.

There have always been resellers in some way or another even hundreds (maybe thousands of years ago) people buying something for one price and selling it for more. \n\nMany people are acting like trade between China and the U.S for example is something new with sites of Alibaba, but it appears that the first contact between China and the west was 200BCE .\nSome history on this:\nhttp://www.ancient.eu/Silk_Road/\n\nThere have always been people buying something for one price and then selling it for another. \n\nI think that merchants like Target coming out and saying that they are going to 'not sell to resellers' is more a PR thing. They saw that consumers were pissed via social media messages and made a public statement. \n\nThey want items to sell out or be hot sellers. Articles ,tv news broadcasts, podcasts ,etc  mentioning Lily Pulitzer selling out means more attention. \nPeople want something they can't have , and knowing something is the hot thing makes more people want it. \n\nI'm sure that the sites or companies that people resell will change in some way. People seem to have migrated from eBAY to Amazon for many products. \n\nIt looks like craigslist is not as popular as it was in the past. I am now seeing a bunch of apps trying to compete with craigslist. Apps like OfferUP ,etc. \n\nI think it's a good idea to always expand ones sources for items and for avenues for selling too. If you just focus on Target for example..and target starts cracking down , you could be out of business or see a big reduction in your business. \n\nIf you only sell on Amazon, there is risk there too, just because it's such a huge marketplace now is no guarantee it will remain that way. I believe it will remain that way for a long time, but it's impossible to say for sure. \n\nAlso you never know which products they might restrict people from selling in order to control the market. \n\nThis is more a risk the bigger they get.

Yet. There are talks about China which is why they jumped a little recently.\n\nThese are countries with HUGE amounts of people. Huge. A lot of people are poor and even if they're not, not many people have landline telephones anymore. So they have a cellphone.  Transit can take days, so to relieve the boredom of 2 days on a bus or train, you stream movies for a few rupies a day.\n\nEntertainment is escapism. It's a drug. It helps you escape the mundanity of your existence for a while. Personally I prefer books for that, but if you have cheap entertainment on a device you already own to pass the time, it wouldn't take more than a few percent of the population in China and India to make Netflix billions of dollars.\n\nEurope, Australia and South America also have a lot of room for growth. \n\nPossibly the biggest thing they have going for them is their recommendation engine. To me, that's the moat that keeps Amazon and the others at bay. \n\nHBO? Not a competitor, they complement Netflix nicely. \n\nI got into Netflix almost a decade ago and my portfolio is a little overweight with them already so at this point I'd only buy on a dip, but just like with Tesla, I think there's plenty of room to grow - even if I don't buy into the hype of the sensationalist crap headlines like \"will Netflix hit $2000?\". \nSure, if they never split and in a few decades... whatever.","name":"t1_crx7bl6","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-06-06 05:17:31","week":23}

{"id":"crxbsyh","author":"lwcunningham","body":"In this day/age opening a brick and mortar store would be limiting your market unless you were well established and had a definite steady amount of traffic coming in. The online market dominates mostly for goods that are not perishable. \n\nAs far as someone buying from you vs. Amazon depends on your brand image and promotion. Just because you have a premium price on your product does not mean people will not go to the lower supplier. There are many factors that influence buyers. For instance, maybe you include personalized thank you cards with each order shipped. If it's one thing people will always take not of is self recognition. You could probably sell a book 10% higher than Amazon just by adding a personalized touch to your sales. \n\nI sold on eBay for a while in a fashion where I would take a product from Amazon and mark it up by 15%. My margins were VERY tight, about $1-$5 profit per item, but I'd list 100's of items at a time. It wasn't my main source of income, but was enough to keep some lunch money in my pocket. The trick was using the right key words. Generally people search for a specific item through a search engine before going straight to a specific site. For instance if I'm in a rush to get a new basic iron, chances are I'd search one on Google and once I find one in my price range I'll just buy it. With the right key words, my item would probably be in the 1st couple results. \n\nI rambled a bit there, but my point is price is not always the deal breaker. Getting your product recognized is key. Giving them that extra touch that Amazon can't provide will keep them coming back.

They ALL drop ship. Keep in mind they are approached ALL THE TIME to drop ship for people wanting to start their own business. The sales reps can not give good pricing for your to compete without getting approval to put you on a better/custom pricing program, and for them to do this they put their reputation on the line believing in you and your business. \n\n2.

{"id":"cry1ba9","author":"mailingsvc","body":"I am sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  As I mentioned before I manage a fulfillment center and I also run a separate eCommerce business on the side where I do the fulfillment myself.\n\nBased on your post I am going to make a few assumptions.  First if you are doing this as a side project while also working a full time job, your order volume is not very high.  I am also going to assume that it isn't making a whole ton of money.  At least not enough for you to let it put any strain on your full time job.\n\nFirst things first.  Don't even think about using a fulfillment company yet.  Yes I manage a fulfillment company and telling someone to not use one.  For what I think your volume is you will run into all sorts of minimum charges that are likely not mentioned when you first contact them to get a quote.  Second no fulfillment company is going to take you on as a client while you are traveling and then happily turn it back over to you.  At least without charging you an arm and a leg.  A possible exception to this is fulfillment by Amazon if you are selling your items through Amazon, but even then the hassle is probably not worth it.\n\nI would if at all possible avoid putting a message on the site saying back ordered until date X. A lot of customers see back orders as unprofessional and any customers you lose will probably never come back to your site.  It sort of implies that you can't keep your inventory supplied.  Especially if you only have two items and they are both back ordered at the same time.  If you had hundreds of items and one or two is on back order that is a different issue.\n\nWhat I do and it works well is to figure out how much profit I make per order (you should already know this). That number is what I am willing to spend while I am out of town to keep the site open and everything operating smoothly for the end customer.  Basically I am willing to not make any money while I am away temporarily, but I am investing that money in keeping every customer happy and converting them into a repeat customer down the road, and or getting good public reviews out of them.  To make this happen find someone you trust that has some time on their hands.  High school/college students and stay at home moms are a good place to start.  Then do all the prep work you can for them.  Lets say you sell 100 of each item per week on average.  Box up 100 of each item and have it ready to ship.  All they have to do is put a shipping label on it.  If an order come in for 2 of item A and 3 of item B just have them tape the prepacked shipping boxes neatly together into a larger box.  You might pay a little more postage for that but it makes it really easy.  Don't make them do anything other than generate a shipping label and put it on the right box.  Assuming your items aren't huge, do all of this and pack it up in some of those plastic storage tubs so it is easy for them to store and keep neat in their house.  All you have to do now is teach them how to generate and print a shipping label.  If you don't want them to have access to your eCommerce site you can even do this remotely and generate all the shipping labels and print them as PDF's and then email them the PDF's to print.  Assuming you have an OK profit margin you will easily find someone that would like some extra cash for a few weeks every quarter. It will also give you the practice you will need for thinking how to do things more efficiently, as well as how you can expand your operation when it does get to the point of needing to hire someone or hand it off to a fulfillment center.\n\nBasically streamline your process, do the work ahead of time for while you are away, and hand off the necessities so that the end customer doesn't know anything has changed.\n\n\n","name":"t1_cry1ba9","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-06-07 03:26:32","week":23}

They're owned by the same people who make TurboTax, which makes me feel better about giving them my info, but YNAB would do the best job if you're willing to track everything as you spend (it's like a spreadsheet budget on crack).\n\nIf you have a weak spot, like shopping or going out to eat, you should build that into your budget. You can spend some money on yourself - the key is just to do it in moderation, and after you've saved towards your goal for the month. Pay yourself first to a separate account you can't easily spend from and don't look at it for a few months, until you're used to the new budget and can really see the results. It'll be tough at first, but as a reformed Amazon addict I promise it works! It's sort of like getting a new bill you have to pay. You really do just get used to paying yourself first after a month or two, and by keeping that money out of sight, it's also out of mind - so you won't be as tempted to spend it since you'll forget about it.

{"id":"cryl143","author":"cb_hanson","body":"Your sentiments are admirable, but what most journalists provide versus what investors need are two very different things.\n\nHaving said that there are clearly some journalists who know their subject areas and have good contacts. I'm talking about people like Krishna Guha (formerly at FT), Greg Ip (formerly WSJ, now at Economist),  Jon Hilsenrath (WSJ) and of course columnists like Martin Wolf (FT). You'll notice that all the people I listed are at the big, leading outlets, which actually report news and provide analysis or else smart commentary. They don't rehash news on popular companies (Apple, Google, Netflix, Amazon) or write financial planning listicles that the editor knows will get a lot of clicks. Stick to this sector for your own career (I know.. easier said than done. You'll probably have to start at Bloomberg News or worse throwing together quick newswire type stories. It's a start, but don't stay there.)\n\nMost of the rest of the financial media is simply repackaging news from other sources. They don't actually have reporters on the ground sitting in at Fed press conferences and talking to staffers for background. They don't go to IMF/World Bank meetings or Davos. They don't go to Jackson Hole. They don't have industry (or government or academic) sources. More and more \"update\" type articles on company earnings and other routine events will be written by computer algorithms (this is already happening as I'm sure you know).\n\nThe key is to develop your sources. This is what will give you a long term advantage in the business. Why do you think Martin Wolf sounds so smart? He's certainly smart (I've seen him in person). But he talks to everyone at the highest levels and that provides a constant stream of ideas that he can think about and filter. And just as importantly, it makes him someone that everyone wants to talk to. It's a virtuous cycle. You can't be like him in the beginning, but think how he got started. Educate yourself on some field so that you are an expert (on par with the top business executives and investment professionals) so that people will actually want to talk to you. It would also help your education process if you do your own active investments (stock picking, trading macro markets like equity indices and fx).\n\nJust remember that most of the material that is put out there by financial reporters is useless because these reporters have no sources, no material, no analysis. Complete zeros. Don't be like them.","name":"t1_cryl143","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-06-07 19:51:17","week":23}

{"id":"crypnls","author":"footBand","body":"I am just starting. Going off the sell something you're knowledgeable about, I went out to Goodwill and bought some various paperback and hardcover fiction books that I thought were interesting titles. I also scored an unopened textbook that is going for ~100 dollars on amazon.\n\nI have spent the majority of the day putting together spreadsheets and looking to see if selling books on amazon is viable. Right now I don't know that it looks that way. My pricing strategy on fiction hardcover and paperbacks is as follows:\nF - HC - Great Condition - 8.99\nF - HC - Poor OR F - PB - GC - 4.99\nF - PB - Poor - 3.99\n\nAll of these state 3.99 will be the shipping fee. So my understanding is that for each item, the buyer will pay the price plus shipping. That total is credited to my account. So a 4.99 book plus 3.99 fee comes to 8.98. Amazon takes their cut at the following rate:\n1) 15% of list price.\n2) $1.35 variable closing fee\n3) .99 item fee.\n\nSo for every sale amazon will get 15% plus $2.34 cents.\n\nSo using the 4.99 book example\nPrice 4.99\nShipping 3.99\nSale Total = 8.98\n\nReferral - 0.75\nVCF  - 1.35\nIF - .99\nFee Total = 3.09\n\nNow the sale total looks great at 8.98 but it's actually going to be 4.99 once I go to the post office and pay shipping.\nSo really it's 4.99 - 3.09 which equals 1.90 profit. \nBut if I walk into the post office with the book (not packaged) and say \"hey I need to ship this\" I have to pay for shipping materials right? Even if media mail? Also the sourcing cost of the book was $0.50.\n\nShould I just go ahead and decide that books are probably not viable, list the ones I bought and when they're gone, that's it on books, while looking at something else to sell?\n\nFWIW I also picked up a stuffed doll and a hat that were selling well on ebay, and I have those listed over on ebay as well. My main concern is just if I should walk away from the idea of books.\n","name":"t1_crypnls","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-07 22:19:35","week":23}

{"id":"cryqehx","author":"Malinut","body":"At 24 the best thing you can do is to max out your ISA allowance. Currently it stands at about £15k a year you can invest for a tax free return. Put the 50k into it over the next few years, over which period I'd expect your income to increase leaving you able to add further. Pity you didn't ask the question before the end of the last tax year though as you could have put £30k in over just a couple of weeks.\n\nThe great thing about investing early, and continuing to invest, in an ISA is that you can take full advantage of the power of compound interest, which is immense (do the maths!).\n\nDon't do stocks and shares yourself until you've learnt the pitfalls: The psychology of trading is one of the most important things to learn about, after that it's about how you handle risk, then there's things to consider like just what, exactly, is your style of investing: Long term, value based or short term fundamental, technical or momentum based; and anything in between. At 24 it's unlikely you'll be able to asses risk properly, and people that say you're young enough to make mistakes are talking out of their ar5e. Here's an Amazon wish list for you I recently compiled that will cover pretty much everything and is from a variety of recommendations. I've made and lost 7 figure sums over the last 15 years so I have a decent amount and type of experience: There's no need to rush into it because significant gains can be had whichever way the market goes and most private investors loose their portfolio in the early, learning, phase. Don't bother practicing/experimenting with small sums because conceptions of risk differ with value. Study the arena for at least a year before you trade, better still treat that journey of learning as a 3 year Degree:-\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2QYZD58GOPFT8/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_o?sort=priority&amp;view=null\n\nOther than that, and possibly after the ISA in your case, I always say that bricks and mortar is a good investment -particularly relevant in the UK. £50k isn't much to play with but it'll help towards a deposit. Think about what you need (as opposed to want): Do your circumstances favour multiple occupancy rental as a business on the side or do your circumstances favour the stability of owning your own home? You could, possibly, find a commercial premises and convert it into multiple occupancy (the law recently changed to facilitate this; exercise your Google-fu and do some research). Owning your own home is less profitable and there are overheads but the security is nice; and as they say you need to get on the ladder to get up the ladder.\n","name":"t1_cryqehx","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-06-07 22:43:11","week":23}
