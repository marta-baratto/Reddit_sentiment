{"id":"36b738","author":"hydroto","body":"Hello, r/personalfinance! \n\nI don't know a whole lot about credit (how it's calculated, Visa vs. Mastercard vs. etc), and I don't know what to look for in a good rewards program. Being a college student in the North, I tend to use Amazon quite a bit to avoid driving outdoors in the winter, so I've been considering going with the Amazon Visa card. \n\nA little background info: I'm a third-year college student living in the residences halls September through April, on my own in the summer. I get paid well in the summer, but only 8 hours a week at minimum wage during the school year. I bank at Wells Fargo, but I may be willing to switch as I've noticed there aren't branches in some places.\n\nAnyone have a card they would suggest for a student? What rewards/aspects do you like about it? What are the drawbacks?\n\nAlso, if anyone reading has an Amazon card, would you recommend it?","name":"t3_36b738","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-18 01:23:59","week":21}

Problem is, lately he has been lacking, and he seems to have the baby boomer mentality of oil and gas being the savior, and he doesn't know anything about tech stocks.  Huge missed opportunity in that fund.  I keep another fund personally with only ~800k, and I have been keeping most of it in REITs, Munis, and occasionally investing in Tech stocks.  I have done very well with Tesla, Salesforce, Facebook, Amazon, Sketchers, Netflix, and some of the other companies like American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, HCA hospitality.  What do all these companies have in common?  Amazing management and employees.  Their hierarchy is much different than the majority of big corporations, and this is something I have seen coming for a long time now.  Anyway.  My current adviser seems to be stuck in the baby boomer delusion, and I'm not sure how to handle it.  \n  \nI am planning to call him up next week before I go on my vegas trip, and just tell him that I need him to transfer the account into my name.  But I'm a bit worried that he will take things personally and possibly fuck me over somehow.  He is a certified CFA, so I don't think he can legally do anything malicious, but he is also friends with my father, who is a narcissistic cunt, and I'm not quite sure how everything will play out.  He currently can trade without notifying me, I just let him manage the account.  I pay him 1% annum.  In my account, he currently invests in shit like Pimco, I'm not even sure if I'm getting double dipped on fees or not.  Seems pretty fucking retarded.  \n  \nAnyway, some help or guidance from your expertise would be much appreciated.","name":"t3_36gt7n","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-19 09:36:51","week":21}

{"id":"36i7m1","author":"nichesiteazon","body":"Hi guys,\n\nSo in my last post, I went over how I was able to earn $32,000+ over 12 months in (mostly) passive income by building Amazon niche sites.\n\nAnd by far one of the most common questions that I received was: where do I even begin? How do I even know which market I should enter? Which markets are profitable?\n\nSo I decided to write up a post, detailing one little trick that I use to identify profitable niches to target when building my Amazon affiliate sites.\n\nAnd it starts by scouring the Marketplace listings over at Empire Flippers. \n\nFor those of you not familiar, Empire Flippers are website brokers, who bring together buyers and sellers. A lot of the websites they sell are Amazon affiliate sites. There was one that just sold a few weeks ago for $200,000! Yes, an Amazon affiliate sites selling for $200k. Crazy.\n\nAnyway, while the EF sale listings don't include the actual website name and URL for sale (for obvious) reasons, they *do* include enough information that can help get you started. Specifically, they include the *type of market* which the successful site is in, and how much revenue they are generating each month.\n\nThe example that I pulled out in my post is the \"exercise equipment reviews\" niche. Yes, we all generally understand that gym equipment can be a profitable niche, but I think you'd be surprised at *how* successful some of these particular sites are.\n\nAnd by knowing 1) which niche the site is in, and 2) how much revenue it is generating, this can give you a good jumping off point on where you can start your next niche site.\n\nAnd the exercise equipment reviews is just one example. There are dozens of listings on the EF site that can give you even more ideas.\n\nI know a lot of people get stuck early on when building their sites about which market to enter, so I hope this tactic can prove helpful to some.\n\nHere's the full post, if you're interested:\n\nhttp://www.nichesiteazon.com/amazon-niche-markets/\n\nHappy to answer any questions.\n\nCheers.","name":"t3_36i7m1","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-19 18:03:05","week":21}
{"id":"36i97q","author":"Seppic","body":"I lurk in this sub a lot, but I'd finally like some advice.  I'm pretty sure I know what to do with my situation, but I would like some feedback.\n\nI accumulated some CC debt the last year of my schooling because I was one semester away and couldn't take out any more federal loans, so I used 2 cards to help pay for a small portion of the cost and my books.  My job wasn't terrific and I was only making minimum payments until now.  I finally got a decent job and I want to pay these things off in the best way possible.\n\nSo, I have $2,837 in CC debt.  It's not much compared to a lot of people with credit problems, but I want it gone before Christmas this year.  The breakdown of the 2 cards is as follows:\n\n* $1,705.27 - Chase Amazon (22.24% APR)\n* $1,131.30 - Chase Disney (12.24% APR)\n\nObviously I want to get rid of the Amazon card balance as quickly as possible because of the APR.  My question is if I should find a 0% interest card, pay the balance transfer fee, and pay it off with the same plan but cutting out the few months of the 22% that is going to be gouging away at me. \n\nI could get a Chase Freedom card and pay a 3% balance transfer and have 0% interest for 15 months. Which would give me more than enough time to pay it off in my goal period or a month after if something comes up.  Would this be the best course? Or is there a better card option with less or no transfer fee %? Or am I going about this completely wrong and missing the point?\n\nAlso, I set up a goal on my Mint account and I can realistically put a maximum of $500 a month towards this debt.\n\nThanks for any advice/guidance!","name":"t3_36i97q","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-19 18:14:06","week":21}
{"id":"36i9gy","author":"aerinjl1","body":"A short parable on waiting and watching. \n\nWe live in the city and our only outdoor space is a small terrace. We use it basically everyday to unwind after work or have a few friends over. We've been salivating over a very cool convertible patio furniture set (seats up to 6 with a fold-able table) since the start of last summer. We have held off because we do have an hand-me-down wicker set (love seat and chair) so spending $700 just didn't make sense when we had a perfectly serviceable, if shabby and not-that-comfy, alternative that was free. \n\nHowever, this last weekend one of our larger friends flung himself down onto the wicker love-seat and the back legs gave way to never fully return to original strength. It's fine if you're careful (and don't weigh much), but not safe for one large or two small people. The camel's back has been broken. \n\nI checked, yet again, on the price of the set we've been wanting...sigh...still $700 at Home Depot. Nope. Checked the manufacturer direct...40% off sale for a total price of $420....better but still high. Checked Amazon (Prime) on a whim...$390 with a $100 off coupon! $290 with free shipping....ding ding ding we have a deal!  \n\nI feel like the frugal gods have rewarded us for waiting patiently and making due with what we had. If we had indulged ourselves a year ago, we would have paid $700, not $290. And don't forget to price check, even in unlikely places. \n\nYes, spending $290 may not seem frugal on the surface. But we use this space everyday and entertain almost every weekend. Even if it helps us not eat out or go out for drinks once a week, it will pay for itself by the end of the summer.

I anticipate that when I earn this degree I will make around 50k a year. I hope. \n\n**My current credit score is 658** according to CreditKarma.\n\nWhen I was very young I had a department store card that was stolen, had a charge on it, and I had moved before realizing it had happened and never bothered to update my mailing address.\n\nLong story short, it was marked as charged off, paid in full. That was 2007.\n\nI haven't had a credit card since. I have an amazon store card that I'm good at paying off. I generally pay off my student loan interest and bills in a timely fashion. I had a rough patch in 2012, but spoke to all my loan companies. I racked up a few late charges with one company (federal stuff), but was good with them all around that.\n\nI requested a credit card from Amazon and was denied.\n\nI have never had a hard credit card in my name. I would like to fix that. What are ways I can continue to raise my credit score? Two years (or maybe last year?) ago it was 575 or so.

It dates back to 2007. \n\nI'm trying to remember what happened here but it's been so long .. I believe I accidentally listed the same product twice - ended up selling both, but obviously only shipped one of them.

It's not a good look and no one will trust me.\n\nI contacted Amazon, but they said I can only have 1 seller account. They can make an exception if a second account is needed for a legitimate business need. You must also meet these:\n\n1. Provide an explanation of the legitimate business need for a second account \n2. Have an account in good standing with excellent Customer Metrics \n3. Have a separate e-mail address, credit card, and bank account for the new account \n4.

A lot of people are still nervous/confused/paranoid over picking products.  So I will demonstrate how my process using 3 example products.\n\nAgain if my process seems a little simple, it because it is.  You do not have to find the Holy Grail to be successful. The best way to succeed on Amazon is to build a brand.  You want aim for building a portfolio of products, not just depend on one product for your income.\nAdditionally, my strategy involves picking a fairly competitive product your first go, so that it can fuel future products.  \nBonus Tip: stay away from mobile accessories and supplements; they are tempting but far too competitive\n\nQuestions that need to be Answered and Desired Answers\n\nThe Basic Questions:\n\n1.\tIs it small? YES\n\n2.\tIs the product simple?\n\n3.\tIs it dominated by one-two big brands? NO\n\n4.\tIs it heavy? NO\n\n5.\tCan I build multiple businesses with complementary products? YES\n\n6.\tCompetitive reviews (between or under 400-1000 for most products)? YES\n\n7.\tMultiple Products under BSR or 8000? (Top under 1000) YES\n\n8.\tCustomizable (able to private labeled)? YES\n\nOkay let’s go:\n\nCase Study #1—Absolute Yes\n\nLet’s say I decide to go into pet supplies and want a fairly competitive product in the top 500.\n\nWe start with the search string.  Don’t forget to add “site:amazon” to the search string to only return amazon.com search results. \nI input this Google: \"Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #500 in Pet Supplies” site:amazon.com\n\nGoogle Input: http://i.imgur.com/lMMSdps.png\n\nThis is the product I found at 500 in Pets Supplies: http://i.imgur.com/RK58q7u.png\n\nThis product is too complex for my liking.   A manufacturer could have an easier time manufacturing duds.  Not too mention, it may be a little expensive to get my first test run of say 500-1000 units.  So I’ll move on…\n\nI stop however to look at suggested products that could be related to see if there is something simpler I could manufacture. \n\nPossible Ideas: http://imgur.com/Q2CHWGm\n\nIt looks like cheaper versions of the same product, so I’ll return to Google and enter “501” in the ranking I am aiming for. \n\nResult 501: http://i.imgur.com/GeH2rbr.png\n\nLooks like I’ve run into dog food.  I prefer at this point in my career not to go into anything edible.  So I return to Google.\n\nI keep entering the rankings only going one or two up…”502”…Nope.”503”…Naw ”504”…No way…until I reach “511”\n\nResult 511: http://i.imgur.com/3uC3UZ7.png\n\nDog clippers looks promising.  Let’s check it out. \n\nPotential Product: http://i.imgur.com/UBJlCLB.png\n\nLooks simple and is in a good price range. Not too many reviews…awesome\nLet’s check out it’s rank…\n\n Product Rank: http://i.imgur.com/N5T81gN.png\n\nOkay a BSR of 649 a little higher than what I was aiming for (lower the BSR the better) but 150 behind isn’t bad especially considering the product is number in 2 sub-categories. \n\nAt this point I could look at where similar dog clippers fall.  I can safely assume that who ever has this product used some type of special promotion to get their product to this point, but their product is here in this realm to stay.  Of course I could always check on that later in the week.\n\nSimilar Product Assessment:\n\nLet’s look at some similar products and see what’s up with dog nail clippers. \n\nSimilar Product 1:http://i.imgur.com/cztuvzF.png\n\nThis one looks neat. Only 490 reviews so it is definitely beatable in the review department.  Let’s check out the BSR below. \n\nSimilar Product 1 Stats: http://i.imgur.com/ea4hYP8.png\nA little behind at 1,657 in Pet Supplies, but its moving units, so still good.\n  \nLet’s go to the next product: http://i.imgur.com/JsZ4CLM.png\n\nThis one looks cool too.  It’s at 386 reviews so that’s definitely beatable.  Let’s check out the BSR.\n\nStats: http://i.imgur.com/4gjKpw3.png\n\nIt’s way behind at 4,922 in its main category.  But check out where its at in claw care and Grooming in its subcategories.  It’s safe to assume there are many similar products ahead.  Even far behind in these subcategories, it is still under 8000 BSR, very good sign this product is winnable. \n\nLet’s go to the next product.\n\nSimilar Product 3:[http://i.imgur.com/366WHiU.png]\n\nOkay this one is pretty competitive.  It has 1,288 reviews but I’m not going to cry.  It also has a perfect 5 stars.  There are many dog clippers doing well with far less.  Let’s check out the BSR.\n\nSimple Product 3 Stats: [http://i.imgur.com/drk1FvQ.png]\n\nOkay I stumbled upon the absolute number 1 dog clipper on Amazon.  The stats are testament to the opportunity on Amazon.  This product is number one subcategories “Clippers and Trimmers” and “Claw Care,” is 71 in all of Pet Supplies, has a perfect 5 star reviews and still has many competitors in the ranking moving a substantial amount of units.\n\nAt this point, I feel like this product is pretty safe.  I’ll now go on to….\n\n\nSearch Volume:\nNow I go on to search volume, to see if people will be buying dog clippers in the years to come and now. \nFirst I head to Google.com/trends.  I enter dog nail clippers and see what I come with. \n\nGoogle Trends: http://i.imgur.com/9dhYfmt.png\n\nLooks good.  It hit a peak in 2008 but has hit a pretty consistent level since then.  I can say people will be buying these in the future.\n\nNow I go to Google.com/adwords so I can use the Keyword Planner.  I enter in “dog nail clippers” again and see what I come up with.\n\nAdwords 1: http://i.imgur.com/exnH4tX.png\n\nLooks almost 1,000,000 searches in a month. Now I look for my keyword ideas and a breakdown of how it is being searched. \n\nAdwords 2: http://i.imgur.com/6F2rlKx.png\n\nHmm…it seems when I put in clippers I also get search results for trimmers as well.  The products are fundamentally different one clips nails the other hair.  So I’ll go to Merchantwords.com to see exactly what people are searching in Amazon. \n\nResult for Dog Nail Clipper 1: http://i.imgur.com/rtFdbjP.png\n\nAww man, looks like “dog nail clippers” doesn’t have much going for it.  There’s a mystery phrase below with 11,200 but I don’t think paying 30 bucks a month for keyword research is worth it. But I’m not going to panic.  I’ll just trying something else…maybe…”dog nail trimmer”\n\nResults for Dog Nail Trimmer on Merchant Words: http://imgur.com/SZkEFIg\n\nThere is our traffic.  The phrases “dog nail trimmer” and “dog nail trimmers” have a combined 24,900 searches a month. \n\nMy rule of thumb is that if the combined search volume of my keyword on merchantwords.com and google.com/adwords is 8-12,000 the product is go.  (Although 8,000 is pushing it, it depends on the market and if the trend is going up)\n\nThe Basic Questions:\n\n1.\tIs it small? YES\n\n2.\tIs the product simple? YES\n\n3.\tIs it dominated by one-two big brands? NO\n\n4.\tIs it heavy? NO\n\n5.\tCan I build multiple businesses with complementary products? YES\n\n6.\tCompetitive reviews (between or under 400-1000 for most products)? YES\n\n7.\tMultiple Products under BSR or 8000? (Top under 1000) YES\n\n8.\tCustomizable (able to private labeled)? YES\n\n\nSourcing:\n\nNext let’s go to sourcing.\n\nLet’s go to Alibaba.com\n\nPotential Source 1: http://i.imgur.com/FydoJAF.png\n\nWow, this one looks familiar a pretty good and consistent pricing for each piece as well. \nNext one…\n\nPotential Source 2: http://i.imgur.com/s4jKlCY.png\t\n\nThese are some neat ones really cheap too.  Although, it may not sell as well as the others you want to look for precedents.  If a product design is to out there, it’s better not to risk it. \n\nProduct Source 3:http://i.imgur.com/eY2aYNx.png\n\nThese ones are cool, I saw a few that looked just like this as well.  The minimum order is high but I’m sure they are no more than 3 dollars a piece.  Additionally, people in this field will always let you know that the minimum order is a fallacy.  You can negotiate nothing is set in stone. \n\nFor those who are familiar with my posts you know I absolutely love free shipping.  I’ll go to my favorite site Dhgate.com\n\nI input “dog nail clippers” and this one pops up. \n\nProduct Source 4: http://i.imgur.com/cwR9ZJu.png\n\nReally cheap with a minimum order of 200, not bad.  I didn’t really see any on Amazon that matched this model.  I’ll make a note to go back and research. \n\nProduct Source 5: http://i.imgur.com/mydbMb8.png\n\nHere goes more familiar models.  These are chip as well with small minimum orders.  I may do more research to find more nail clippers I can customize. Maybe add a logo to it like this one below. \n\nPotential Source 1: http://i.imgur.com/cztuvzF.png\n\nWe got a pretty good understanding of price to source so let’s evaluate our profit per unit. \n\nPotential Profit Per Item Sold:\n\nOur examples placed our product between $8.80-15.00, which is good pricing.  \nThe price to source is varies wildly, especially with free shipping.\n \nSo I’ll pick one for this example\n\nProduct Source 5: http://i.imgur.com/mydbMb8.png \n\nfor the purpose of the example, I’ll use the bottom one with the pricing being between $2.33-2.54\n\nFor the pricing on Amazon I usually pick a median price $11.90\n\nFor sourcing I pick the highest price because it’s just safer that way. ($2.54)\n\nIt’s safe to assume if a product is under $17.00 Amazon will take about 33% of your product price as part of its fees.\n\nSo I can assume I will own 67% so 11.90*.67 is about $7.98 profit.\n\nThis looks great a little over minimum wage for every product I sell.  Of course, if I pick a product from Alibaba shipping may take away $2-3 away but still good considering the price I source for and the potential turnover I will see. \n\nPlan of Action: \nI may do promotion to give away 250 units. I then will message buyers for reviews. I would go after the “dog nail trimmer” keyword as it seems to have the most searches on Amazon.\n\nComplementary products: Cat Claw Clippers, Dog Brush, Cat Brush, Deshedder?\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about the Amazon FBA process, click here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/\n\n\nQuestions are welcome but if you completely new to the process go to the reddit post I referenced above to get a full overview. \n","name":"t3_36jjfz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-19 23:15:57","week":21}

{"id":"36k9by","author":"raggyannie","body":"First off, I never imagined being able to own my own home. My SO and I both work for a small company, and while we do okay- we're not exactly sitting on a bunch of money. Combined income is around $70k, and we live in an area that is rapidly expanding (Thanks Amazon....) so housing isn't exactly cheap. Simply stated- my MIL keeps sending us different listings for small properties. Mostly one bedroom homes on small lots or commercial spaces. Ideally we would love to have a large shop space for projects or a potential business in the coming years, and a small loft or living space above it. Obviously if it was the 1970’s we would be in much better luck, but one can still dream, right? She actually found something that we’re interested in, and feel that we might be able to make work… but… I’m skeptical.\n\nI’m asking you, PF, because I don’t want to walk into my local bank and be laughed right out of the room. \n\nThe property we are looking at is a medium sized lot with a small warehouse that is surrounded by green space. It is listed for 300k.\n\nOur specs:\n\n-70k combined income\n-5k in savings\n-7k cc debt, to be paid off ASAP.\n-45k in Roth IRA 401k (combined)\n-we’re both in our early 30’s\n-no kids, vasectomy is done and paid for.\n-no pets\n-one car, PIF years ago. We drive it once a week to get groceries, and bike everywhere else.\n\nI’ve checked out a few mortgage calculators, and obviously there are a lot of options- but the payments don’t seem out of reach. My MIL has already told us that if we find a place we really like she will “help” with a down payment. (Not sure what exactly she intends, so I’m not holding my breath.) She also told us that if we buy property that we would have to do a lot of work to (say convert part of a warehouse into living space) that we could stay at their house and live rent free. We’ve lived with them before we were married (to pay off old debts) and they are actually okay “roommates.” We both have quite a bit experience in construction, and have family members that are more than willing to help out in any capacity. \n\nSo, would it be laughable? Am I being crazy for considering, or crazy for not thinking it’s doable? \n","name":"t3_36k9by","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-20 02:23:17","week":21}

{"id":"36komg","author":"shedby_budwin","body":"Hello /r/personalfinance! I have a question regarding personal loans...\n\n Some background, I am 19, just graduating from high school, coming from a paycheck to paycheck family where we buy cars with cash, rent our house, and my parents both have a bad credit history. \nAs I said, I’m graduating from high school in a matter of weeks, but I’m already out and working in the field of autobody repair on a work release type of program. I’ve always loved to fix cars and doing what I want for a living is amazing, but a major expense that comes with this field is tools. Unlike many of my friends coming into this field, my family is not in a position to help me buy tools. \n     \n What most people in my position would do then is to get tools from a “Truck Brand” Some of you may be familiar with this, some tool companies (Snap-On, MAC, Matco) don’t have a retail presence. Instead, they have franchised dealers that come to shops on a weekly basis to sell tools and collect payments. It is very tempting as a new technician to go onto the truck and get a new toolbox and fill it with brand new shiny tools. Then pay it off over time, making weekly payments. However, I want to avoid this option for a number of reasons:\n   \n-Truck brands are ridiculously expensive. All the tools I need (reasonably, not getting into silly one off things) and a toolbox to fit them in would be atleast 25-30k. 5-6 for the toolbox alone! The tools are high quality, yes, but you can get the same quality for MUCH cheaper. \n-MEGA high interest. 22% is what I remember hearing from the Snap-On rep that visited my class. \n  \nThe other option I’ve been thinking of is to put together my own list of hand, air and power tools and a storage solution using my own research and that would round out to about 6K. Everything would be ordered off of Amazon, except the [toolbox](http://www.strictlytoolboxes.com/tool-vault-tool-boxes/56-tool-vault-21-drawer-tool-cabinet-top-chest.html) and be very high quality, just as good as the truck brands that cost twice as much. Would this be a wise use of a personal loan? I have an account at Wells Fargo and was looking at a $5,500 personal loan over a 24 month period at $251/month at 9.259% APR. I have no credit history, good or bad, and I’m wondering what I should do to put myself in a position to be able to get a loan for this. Should I get a credit card and keep up with the balance for a few months? Should I wait and let more of an income/direct deposit history with my account?

Basic hand tools only, but I can get by like this for a while if I need to. \nTL;DR:\nis it a good idea to get a 5.5k personal loan to pay for tools (and storage) as a new technician, as opposed to owing a Truck Brand 20-30K, with much higher interest? \nWhat should I do before taking out a personal loan, with no credit whatsoever? \n","name":"t3_36komg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-20 04:19:12","week":21}

{"id":"36o6cz","author":"BWSA3","body":"At 21 years old, I graduated college, got a 40k a year job, and started living life as an independent, debt-free adult. \n\nAt 22 years old, I have accrued just over $7000 of debt. I am usually very financially savvy, but this is a big  mountain. That is why I am using reddit (this is my first post by the way) for support, advice, and help! So, how did I go from 40k income with no debt, to $7134 of debt. \n\n1) I quit my job in February. Management was awful and I had dreams to pursue. I moved from SA to Dallas, worked a 9 dollar an hour job at a hotel, and spent more than I had.\n2) My friend had a pal who ran a sportsbook. I got into gambling WAY too much for a bit. I'd say that makes up about 4k - 5k of my debt. \n\nI'm done gambling and chasing my losses, so I don't need a ton of \"stop gambling\" posts. I know I fucked up and put myself in this hole.\n\nAnyways, I got my job back in SA. I also got a raise. Here are numbers I ran:\n\nIncome - 55k | Monthly Income AFTER TAXES - 3200 | Bills (rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, phone, etc) - $1619 | *Income After Bills* (not including food or leisure money) - $1581\n\nNow for the gross part:\nDiscover - $3026.00  (21.99% variable)\nChase Amazon - $94.00 (19% variable)\nChase Slate - $3164.50 (0% until October 2016)\nWells Fargo - $1000 (0% until October 2016)\n\nI recently got those 0% cards to consolidate some of the debt, but unfortunately I could only get approved for 3200 and 1000 respectively, likely due to the high balances already being carried. \n\nCredit score: 657. \n\nMy plan as of now? Minimum payments on the 0% cards, and pay off Discover and Amazon as quick as possible. $500 here, $700 there, etc til they are gone. By the time my 3000 - 4000 dollar tax return rolls around in January, I should be able to pay it all off. \n\nAny ideas? I read that Dave Ramsey suggests paying off the lower balance cards first because of the psychological aspect behind having zero balance cards. Sounds like a decent idea since interest is just a little bit in the grand scheme of things. \n\nWhat do ya'll think?

I have about $1,000 in my bank account and credit card debt as follows: \n\n   - Best Buy Credit Card: $900\n   - Amazon Credit Card: $1,800\n   - Discover: Paid off with work expenses\n   - Bank of America: $700\n\nI really want this debt gone, but want to be living in a semi-decent place in Orlando since I know no one and want to also start saving for a big purchase in the next year (approximately $5,000). My starting salary for 6 months will be $45,000, then up to $68,000 (plus incentives) and I have received a $2,000 signing bonus. \n\nAlso, I have a company vehicle, so no car payments of any sort. Any advice on how to get rid of this debt, what to spend on rent, or where I should be allocating the money I make? \n\nThank you!","name":"t3_36rom6","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-21 18:13:56","week":21}
{"id":"36rxyn","author":"mycrystalcity","body":"Hey guys. I need some help forming a budget. I'm 25 and I work as a Network Engineer. I make about $5000/mo take home and I've made some mistakes, leading me to having a lot of expenses. Also, I seem to always be living paycheck to paycheck even though it doesn't appear I should be. I think this may be due to not having the payments split correctly from paycheck to paycheck; I don't really have an explanation otherwise. Also important to know - I have no emergency fund whatsoever.\n\nI've paid off two cards I had, but I don't really know where to start tackling this to get it down as efficiently as possible. I've read the FAQ's and everything about paying down what APR first, snowball method, yadda yadda - but when I look at my financials, my brain hurts and I feel like I'm not cutting into this like I should be.\n\nIf any of you can suggest which way I should tackle this, please let me know. I appreciate your help greatly!\n\n==============================\n(Balances)\nAmazon\t     $750 \n\nBest Buy\t     $0  \n\nWalmart\t     $0  \n\nBarclaycard\t$1,038.39 \n\nRegions LOC\t$755.26  \n\nMilitary Star\t$1,096  \n\nNavy Federal CC\t$7,944.67 \n\nNavy Federal Loan\t$4,432.75  \n\nJared\t                $3,956.34 \n\nCar\t                $11,201.81 \n\nMotorcycle\t        $4,595.06 \n\nHouse\t$129,622.23  \n\n\nand here are the payments I pay on those things per month:\n\nAmazon   $50\n\nBest Buy\n\nWalmart\n\nBarclaycard $50 \n\nRegions LOC $100  \n\nMilitary Star $50  \n\nNavy Federal CC $100  \n\nNavy Federal Loan $136  \n\nJared $245  \n\nCar $330  \n\nMotorcycle   $ 155.53  \n\nHouse     $750\n\n\nA few things of note - My FICO score is only around a 630 due to my bad decisions last year. I came home from Afghanistan and went fucking crazy and it's biting me in the ass. The score's dropped from around 720 when I bought my house to 604 at its lowest. While I didn't provide my APR's, just know that they're all 22.99% or higher on all the CC's except the Navyfed one (15%) , 18% on the personal loan.\n\nAlso forgot to mention, I don't party, my family rarely goes out - maybe 1 time a week @ $30, so $120 a month of so for that. I don't drink or smoke. No gym memberships. \n\nOther things about $800, plus groceries for the whole family cost roughly $400.","name":"t3_36rxyn","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-21 19:17:43","week":21}

{"id":"36x0yk","author":"pants222","body":"Hello, everyone!  I just wanted to preface this by saying I've been a lurker here for a few years.  I've learned so much on this subreddit and I'm anxious to give back, so if you have any questions feel free to fire away.\n\nMy service is called [indbl](https://indbl.com), which is short for Intelligence Drives the Bottom Line.  We automate the product research process for Amazon merchants.  Here's how it works:\n\nYou upload a CSV file of up to 10,000 products (often a list you can get directly from your supplier), choose if you want to search by UPC or something else (like product name) and we return Amazon data (such as sales rank, buybox price, etc) and the [fee breakdowns for FBA and MFN](http://i.imgur.com/zYRZkUA.jpg).\n\nA few friends and I sell on Amazon (both FBA and MFN) and got tired of doing product research.  It was just so time consuming to comb through thousands of products trying to find what was worth selling.  We decided to take a different approach and built an application to do the heavy lifting for us.  After seeing how useful it was, we decided it was too valuable to keep to ourselves.  \n\nThere is a total of three founders, we've bootstrapped this thing from day one.  Very little personal financial investment, just a ridiculous amount of time.\n\nWe've been working on it for a little over a year, in that time it has been through several iterations until we reached a point where we were comfortable sharing it with the world.  Good news is, we're finally there!\n\nI shared our site on /r/FulfillmentByAmazon and /r/ecommerce last week and the response has been fantastic.  We nearly tripled our user base and received some downright incredible feedback.  If any of you guys are reading this, I want to thank you again.  You all are seriously awesome.\n\nI wanted to post indbl in here to reach a broader audience to see what you guys think.  This is our first SaaS (and our first startup), we are very new at this.  Any advice or feedback you guys could share would be enormously helpful.  Don't be afraid to get real here, we need to hear the negative feedback just as much as we need to hear the good.\n\n**You can check us out at [indbl.com](https://indbl.com)**.\n\nIf any of you guys sell on Amazon and are interested in helping us with the beta testing, send me a message here or email me at info@indbl.com and I'll send you a coupon code worth 1000 free research credits.  It will allow you to research 1000 products for free.\n\nThanks everyone, have a great weekend!","name":"t3_36x0yk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-22 22:38:24","week":21}

{"id":"36yl2s","author":"[deleted]","body":"Long time lurker first time poster here just getting this app out there that I think is underrated. Its called [Cash Rewards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oogiem.gift&amp;hl=en). I did search up and see that it has been posted before but there is a new version with another way to earn and I think that other post went unseen.\nWays you can earn are:\n1. Offers - Choose from 4 different offer walls to download apps and get coins. Does require to install a separate app, i'm sure its just so it knows you actually did download and opened the app for it to credit.\n\n2. Lucky Wheel - Spin the wheel for a chance for up to 200 coins. Has a cooldown that gets longer and longer the more you use it.\n\n3. Scratch - Try your luck at a scratch off for a chance to win coins, amount is random and cost 5 coins to play.\n\n4. Slot Machine - Bet up to 10 of your coins, match 2 fruits get double coins back, match all 3 get four times the amount.\n\nFor Lucky Wheel and Scratch you can tap an ad at the bottom for double the coins. You get 30 taps a day.\n\nPayout: Amazon/Paypal - 600 coins = $1 - Paypal has fees\n\nI have only been using this app for 5 days and already have redeemed 4 $1 Amazon gift cards. Payout time seems to be 2-3 days not sure yet as I have gotten one in 24 hours. Here is payment [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/3fGix5x.png) so you can get an idea of how fast it pays out. \n\nTips/Notes: App does seem to crash every now and then but your coins do not disappear. Might be a coincidence but you are more likely to land 3 matching fruits in the slot machine if all fruits are matched before you spin meaning you should probably close the app and reopen it again so the fruits are matched again. \n\nJust wanted to share this and I hope you give this a try.\n","name":"t3_36yl2s","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-05-23 07:20:10","week":21}

{"id":"372i7o","author":"cosmic_fetus","body":"First off - Thanks for taking the time!  Much appreciated.  \n\nSo I've had a pretty busy 2015 so far app wise, and my score has dipped a bit correspondingly, no biggie(?)  \n\nSo far this year have grabbed:\n\nFeb 21 - Barclays Aviator Red\n\nMar 3 - Citi AA\n\nApril 15 - Chase BA\n\nMay 8 - Amex PRG\n\nNow upon discussing with fellow churner friend as well as typing it out here, i realize that that is perhaps too many apps?  Honestly there were some bonus promos &amp; spends i couldn't pass up =/ live &amp; learn i guess.\n\n\nCredit Score - Was 750 on CK (just barely excellent ;)  Now after a bit of a delay has dipped to 742 =/\n\n\nCK hard pulls showing just 1?  Wonder if this is out of date as well.  Utilization 1%.  Payment history 100%.  Apparently 13 total accounts, 7 of which are open.  Looks like it said somewhere around 25k total CL?\n\n\nFree FICO via barclays showing 711\n\n\nAll min spends have been met, except for the amex which will be soon.  Balances paid off almost as soon as they post.  \n\n\nIncome is 38k as is stated on apps.  Now this is after tax (actually living overseas) wonder if i should be stating higher?  Hard to say.  \n\n\nThe spend on the table - \nThe main reason i started doing this was because I had some work expenses I could put on cards.  The last of those for the year are coming up, and am looking for another perhaps 3-5k of bonuses.  I realize it will ding my credit score (approved or not), but i figure it has the rest of the year to recover as i wont be making nearly as many apps, if any.  Also living overseas I don't PretendSpend (love that, can we make it stick? hah ;), so this is sort of my moment if you will.  \n\n\n\nI guess mainly i'm looking for anecdotal evidence of my likelihood to get approved or not for mainly the Barclays Arrival +.\n\n\n\nI know many people claim there is a '90 day' rule, which has been shown not to be true by some kind commenters on here.  Just wondering what the case may be for me, of course MMMV.  They approved me for 5k on the aviator back in Feb.  Sadly I have only put a few hundred (&lt;1000) on it as i was meeting other min. spends.  This is the main card I want at the moment as i will hopefully be traveling this summer, and able to reimburse myself for some misc travel expenses with the miles.  \n\n\n\nCiti Thank You - I figure I could hit up citi again as I don't have many cards with them.  But actually yeah the AA wasn't too long ago, and despite some people chiming in about it being useful I'm still not totally sold on TY points, the transfer option is nice tho - sign up your family members!  \n\n\n\nLastly big kid Chase - I feel like i have good chances with Chase.  I only have 2 open cards with them.  They recently upped my CL on Amazon card to 4.5k and the BA card was approved with an 8k CL.  The problem here is i feel like the CSP is a bit of a 'rip off'.  4k for 40k?  Yeah authorized user ok.  led me to looking at the ink plus, but to be honest Im a little intimidated to apply for a biz card, even though i do private tutoring on the side. The 5k spend is also large, but maybe workable.  \n\n\n\nSo if you made it this far i thank you, and hope it wasn't a waste of your time.  Basically I'm looking for odds of approval for the arrival +, and generally wondering if an AOR is a good idea or not at this point with a declining credit score.  Yes i know its not the best idea, but so hard to leave that spend on the table!!  \n\n\n\nSome food for thought/tidbits for reading this - \n\n         \nI had been auto-paying my Amazon card with chase in order to not miss a payment, which led to me overpaying them.  I know its possibly just coincidental but i can't help feeling that that helped me out somehow with them?  Unsolicited credit increase, plus much higher limit on next card.  Also this is a bit of a no brainer but when the US airways promo was on I managed to convince my folks to get cards as well (no small feat).  Now although i can't transfer those miles for free i can use them to book a ticket for anyone.  \n\n\n\nOk, Thanks again so much for reading, and have a great day ;D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_372i7o","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-05-24 08:36:48","week":21}

([corrected](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/373yfk/how_25_stocks_and_the_market_fared_before_during/crjlg43))\n\n**23 April 2010**: The first recovery pulls near pre-crash levels. It proves short-lived though as the market slumps 15% during the summer.\n\n**22 December 2010:** The second recovery surpasses the pre-crash levels. It would slump again in 2011, before ultimately pulling through.\n\n**28 March 2013**: The market [finally eclipses](http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/28/investing/stocks-markets/) the high it set in 2007.\n\n**22 May 2015:** The previous close.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFinance was at the heart of the 2008 crash, with companies losing 80+% of their values. Some, like GE, GS and WFC have recovered, while others like BAC are nowhere close. Stalwarts like BRK, PG, MSFT, NKE, KO and JNJ, were barely touched in the early parts of the crash, but even they were pulled down as it became clear a recession was underway. It's amazing to see even the unrelated DIS and AAPL shed over half their value - there were very few places to turn to for relief. Volatile names like AMZN suffered mightily during the drop, crashing even harder than the general market, but this volatility may have also contributed to their spectacular recoveries. Less volatile names like VZ and XOM neither dipped as deep nor climbed as high. MCD and WMT were notably the only Dow Jones components to post net gains in 2008.\n\nThe 2008 crisis didn't exactly sneak up on the market. The causes were being shouted out for months and the uncertainty caused the market to slump a full year before the crash. A well-diversified investor could've got out with 70-80% of their portfolio even if they got in at the 2007 high and got out after the first crash. It wasn't until it became clear the crisis would push the economy into a recession that the rest of the market got dragged down, and bottom didn't come until nearly 6 months after the initial crash.","name":"t3_373yfk","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-05-24 19:33:58","week":21}

{"id":"crdask8","author":"brock_h","body":"I understand the sentiment behind everyone always saying be careful with credit cards, but why does everyone act like they've never seen a useful credit card offer and credit cards are the worst thing ever made? A lot of the times (especially as a student or young adult) you'll need an advance on funds (deposits, college fees, etc.) and using a credit card with a few thousand dollar limit and 0% interest for 9-12 months is a free loan you can pay at relative leisure. I've done this multiple times, having always paid it off before interest starts accruing, and it's saved me every time *in addition to* giving me other benefits such as cash back and flat discounts (e.g. $100 off $1000). I literally couldn't have done some of the stuff I've done without these credit cards essentially fronting me the money.\n\nThe thing is you have to *use the cards* and/or build credit with at least *some* debt before you start getting offers like this. Sometimes it takes paying some interest here and there. Oh well, I've wasted money on Steam games that haven't allowed me to take that vacation I wanted. /r/churning plug, maybe? Surely some of you must understand.\n\nTelling someone \"don't use a credit card\" as if it's some sort of magic demon that's going to magically grow wings and fly away with their money is ridiculous. Maybe it's because I have a basic understanding of what I'm giving and what I'm getting? Careful management and knowledge of the terms that is key to using any kind of debt. Telling people to \"always and forever\" avoid credit card debt is like preaching abstinence, you just end up making people more ignorant because they've been avoiding it so long they don't know what they're doing. I already see the downvotes from the typical knee-jerk always-debt-averse live-out-in-the-woods people that are all too abundant here...\n\nHow could people really upvote something that says \"Always use cash!\" - what is everyone 60 years old here? It's like being afraid of a debit card. It's only scary if you don't understand it. This stuff is out of date and lacks context based on how things work today.

{"id":"crdjdth","author":"cinonym","body":"The Amazon store card I was approved for had a much lower credit limit than other credit cards I've gotten recently, but did come with some free Amazon store credit. I pretty much use it for a painless five percent off. Between that perk and the credit you would save $70 off the purchase, if you are able to pay it off immediately (and if you're not I strongly caution you not to buy it). It does also have special financing for larger purchases, but I haven't really looked into this given that I don't find the idea compelling at this time. \n\nThere is also a Chase card that gives you an immediate $70 in store credit upon approval, and which had a higher credit limit when I received it. \n\nAnother option if you are set on having a zero interest period is to get something like the American Express Blue Cash Everyday, which gives you a percent back on everything, and a bit more for gas and groceries. It has a fifteen month interest free period, and gives you a $100 statement credit if you spend 1k in the first three months, which would be very easy if you're spending $600 right off the bat. \n\nAnyway, those are pretty much the cards I have. :-)  Be careful.

I'm single and only buy groceries for myself, and the BCP is well worth it for me.\n\nHere is a spreadsheet if you want to play with numbers: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQMZ1gx8VjjnrhcGGpZRLEHlOx-xGtPpIatao5Dyn5w/edit?usp=sharing","name":"t1_crel0c9","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-05-20 00:44:19","week":21}

My SO and I both work for a small company, and while we do okay- we're not exactly sitting on a bunch of money. Combined income is around $70k, and we live in an area that is rapidly expanding (Thanks Amazon....) so housing isn't exactly cheap. Simply stated- my MIL keeps sending us different listings for small properties. Mostly one bedroom homes on small lots or commercial spaces. Ideally we would love to have a large shop space for projects or a potential business in the coming years, and a small loft or living space above it. Obviously if it was the 1970’s we would be in much better luck, but one can still dream, right? She actually found something that we’re interested in, and feel that we might be able to make work… but… I’m skeptical.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; I’m asking you, PF, because I don’t want to walk into my local bank and be laughed right out of the room.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; The property we are looking at is a medium sized lot with a small warehouse that is surrounded by green space. It is listed for 300k.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Our specs:  \n&gt;   \n&gt; - 70k combined income  \n&gt;   \n&gt; - 5k in savings  \n&gt; - 7k cc debt, to be paid off ASAP.  \n&gt; - 45k in Roth IRA 401k (combined)  \n&gt; - we’re both in our early 30’s  \n&gt; - no kids, vasectomy is done and paid for.  \n&gt; - no pets  \n&gt; - one car, PIF years ago. We drive it once a week to get groceries, and bike everywhere else.\n&gt;   \n&gt; I’ve checked out a few mortgage calculators, and obviously there are a lot of options- but the payments don’t seem out of reach. My MIL has already told us that if we find a place we really like she will “help” with a down payment. (Not sure what exactly she intends, so I’m not holding my breath.) She also told us that if we buy property that we would have to do a lot of work to (say convert part of a warehouse into living space) that we could stay at their house and live rent free. We’ve lived with them before we were married (to pay off old debts) and they are actually okay “roommates.” We both have quite a bit experience in construction, and have family members that are more than willing to help out in any capacity.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; So, would it be laughable? Am I being crazy for considering, or crazy for not thinking it’s doable?   \n&gt;\n\n----\n\n^(I am a bot.

{"id":"cressv2","author":"dylanraddant","body":"With Stanley Furniture, I am a bit perplexed by the purchase. The company lost $29.89 million in 2014, and $12.83 million in 2013.   Granted, if the stock had tremendous liquidating value, it would be worth following the company.  However, since the stock trades above book value, I am less than enthused. More so is the fact that it is rapidly losing money, going from $44.01 million in 2008, to $5.58 million in 2014, mainly due to losing money.  The company has had negative cash flow, meaning that it is unable to do what John Malone is unsuccessfully attempting to do with EBITDA.  I would consider selling this.  \n\nI am quite a bit neutral on Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan, etc.  It is true that a lot of these stocks are at a bargain rate due to the market correction of the late 2000’s.  However, the tangible book value of a lot of these companies is negative due to a lack of intangible assets.  I would investigate this more if I were you. \n\nBlackberry is one of those companies that should not have been invested into yet.  As long as the company loses billions in net income, the price of the company will further decrease. What alarms me, however, is the rapid decline in equity.  The company has lost three times their equity in only three years’ time.  Granted, Blackberry had positive cash flow, but one should take Philip Fisher’s advice and perhaps pass on this one.  \nQQQ refers to mostly tech stocks.  I am particularly alarmed by significant holdings into Facebook and Amazon, which currently trades at lofty prices. While Apple and Microsoft are good companies for the modest investor, their growth will now rarely, if ever, beat the S&amp;P 500. \n\nNow a word on banks and insurance.  Benjamin Graham was against the idea of investing into banks and insurance companies.  First, one could not liquidate these companies due to the need of cash.  Thus, if one bought a bank stock based on cash liquidation, they were mistaken. Second, the nature of the unscrupulous banker makes it possible for crisis-after-crisis to involve banks.  Third, so long as banks make a profit, they are willing to do whatever it takes for self-gain, rather than the benefit of the investor.  Remember, Graham encourages an active investor.  By buying stock into Bank of America, one with a high market capitalization, for example, one has little input in the direction of the company.  Thus, I would sell, and then read Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham. \n\nMy advice to you for the long-term:\n1.\tBuy as much books from these individuals as possible, plus Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip Fisher, and Stocks for the Long Run  by Jeremy Siegel\n2.\tSwitch out your stocks for stocks that are depressed price-wise\n3.\tDo not, under any circumstance, cave into Reddit’s advice and “buy an index fund.” \n\n","name":"t1_cressv2","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-05-20 04:32:21","week":21}

They keep investing in the future, so either they are trying to take over the world, or the guy with the check book just YOLOs too much. \n\nCouple things to consider, their platform, is extremely profitable, and it is pretty good IMO. Not sure the problem you were having with search, the only problems i have had is when the thing i want isnt sold on amazon. \n\nPrime - brilliant biz model, since i have Prime, I always goto amazon first when looking for something since i feel like i invested in the shipping and need to get my $$ worth. Me personally, i get my money back, I order several items a month, sometimes a week. And amazon is probably making a profit on me still in the margins. I have, however, noticed a recent down turn in shipping speed (i moved from WA to IL so that could be some of it).\n\nSomething you havent considered -&gt; AWS (Amazon Web Services?) its their cloud platform. I believe this all started because amazon had tons and tons of hardware which it literally only needed for 1 month out of the year (December) to support the large increase in holiday shoppers. So they would sell the computing power when they didnt need it (i dont have a source on this, but i think thats how it started). Now, amazon is one of the big 2 (IMO) in cloud. They own the market, with msft Azure being really the only other player. (no source on this, but i bet im right if you google it). I personally like Azure better (Im a windows dev) and I think they have a better platform, but there is room for 2 in this space. There are new up and comers, and i think the Docker model is the future (container based), but the major customers in this space (big corps) have yet to move in and that could change the landscape. \n\nKindle - what a piece of crap. I dont get why, but old people buy them. Theyre just too slow to figure out how to open an e-reader on andriod/windows, and like most apple users, too dumb to figure out their ipad does the same thing.

A higher minimum wage might bring more people from other cities or from nearby areas to leverage the national value of the dollar (one dollar on Amazon is the same regardless what city you are from), thus by increasing minimum wage you might actually get even more people trying to live in the city for a relatively fixed amount of housing, ending up with more apartment sharing than you had before.","name":"t1_crf8v9n","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-05-20 16:54:39","week":21}

I am usually very financially savvy, but this is a big  mountain. That is why I am using reddit (this is my first post by the way) for support, advice, and help! So, how did I go from 40k income with no debt, to $7134 of debt.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; 1) I quit my job in February. Management was awful and I had dreams to pursue. I moved from SA to Dallas, worked a 9 dollar an hour job at a hotel, and spent more than I had.  \n&gt; 2) My friend had a pal who ran a sportsbook. I got into gambling WAY too much for a bit. I'd say that makes up about 4k - 5k of my debt.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; I'm done gambling and chasing my losses, so I don't need a ton of \"stop gambling\" posts. I know I fucked up and put myself in this hole.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Anyways, I got my job back in SA. I also got a raise. Here are numbers I ran:  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Income - 55k\n\n&gt; Monthly Income AFTER TAXES - 3200\n\n&gt; Bills (rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, phone, etc) - $1619\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * Income After Bills* (not including food or leisure money) - $1581\n&gt;   \n&gt; Now for the gross part:\n\n&gt; Discover - $3026.00  (21.99% variable)\n\n&gt; Chase Amazon - $94.00 (19% variable)\n\n&gt; Chase Slate - $3164.50 (0% until October 2016)\n\n&gt; Wells Fargo - $1000 (0% until October 2016)\n&gt;   \n&gt; I recently got those 0% cards to consolidate some of the debt, but unfortunately I could only get approved for 3200 and 1000 respectively, likely due to the high balances already being carried.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Credit score: 657.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; My plan as of now? Minimum payments on the 0% cards, and pay off Discover and Amazon as quick as possible. $500 here, $700 there, etc til they are gone. By the time my 3000 - 4000 dollar tax return rolls around in January, I should be able to pay it all off.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Any ideas? I read that Dave Ramsey suggests paying off the lower balance cards first because of the psychological aspect behind having zero balance cards. Sounds like a decent idea since interest is just a little bit in the grand scheme of things.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; What do ya'll think? TIA!!!!!! first abbreviation :]  \n&gt;\n\n----\n\n^(I am a bot.

All the gurus, piled on thinking they had a sure bet, and kept increasing their position because they couldn't leave their ego aside. They thought the great news wasn't good enough, and that the stock would just over-extend, they'd increase size, and hopefully rake in bank. Well, that's what happens when idiots get too cocky in the trade. Tim Grittanis loss and explanation were horrible. I read his blog, and couldn't understand the mind-set that \"it has to go down eventually, the stock can't possibly go any higher\". This thinking has killed so many folks in the past, with stocks like $TSLA, $SHAK, $AMZN, $NFLX for example. I learned a lot of valuable lessons from traders like this on what not to do, and shorting bios with some type of positive catalyst news is exactly what you want to avoid. \n\nThe worst thing I read was that last trader's loss, and I've seen his video of his gains from the last few years. He basically destroyed his account by not cutting losses quick, and broke his own set max loss rule. There was even a short, assuming \"newb\" trader that blew up his entire account thinking investorslive, along with the other gurus he follows could never be so wrong on something like this. \n\nHere's the audio (WARNING LOUD TURN DOWN VOLUME FIRST) [SOUNDS OF A DEAD SHORT](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1iF1U86HDKP) .\nIn all honesty, no one with a heart would want to see someone else go broke trading. My issue is with some gurus having egos about stocks, with the mentality that every ticker they play is somehow terrible and should be trading lower. Bears almost never win in a market with irrational traders/investors. That's why I short very rarely, and only on names that I feel shouldn't be trading in the first place. $TWTR $ETSY for example. \n\nI'll be expecting the same type of drop on ISR as PBMD had in pre-market. I will watch action looking for entry, and will take my profits from PBMD and use those when there is a hint of a red-green reversal in the making. Won't go crazy on size, but I know what not to do, that's for sure. \n\nEDIT: AS I EXPECTED A FADE THROUGH THE DAY, AFTER A NICE DROP/POP DURING PRE-MARKET.

{"id":"crgatgu","author":"LauraBellz","body":"Don't buy any appliances until you know your school's policies. I attended Boston University for four years, and we were only allowed to bring a refrigerator and \"a hot air popcorn popper\" - not even a Keurig (not brand-dropping, but most colleges allowed such brewers because they don't have a hot plate!)\n\nThat being said, RAs weren't allowed to open drawers or look under your bed without a legitimate search warrant. So it was ridiculously easy to bring my own microwave and hide it under my bed during breaks (or take it home for long ones, as I lived nearby and was driven home.) Coffee pots are wicked easy to hide as well, and electric kettles can be simply tucked in a drawer.\n\nYou DO need twin XL sheets if your school has XL mattresses - standard sheets will not fit. If you already have twin bedding that you want to use again, just buy a new fitted sheet if you can - but places like Target will have decent sheet sets wicked cheap. (A standard comforter will still fit.) If you're buying your bedding separately, I would suggest getting a full/queen size comforter - it'll drape nicely on your bed, hide some of the under-bed storage/mess you will inevitably have, and be more useful after you graduate. If your budget allows, buy a couple more sets on clearance once the school year starts. This will reduce your laundry load SIGNIFICANTLY.\n\nLaundry:\nIf you plan on going home occasionally, or have family nearby, try to do as much almost-free laundry as you can. It was $1.50 per machine for me and the dryers were almost universally awful - and air-dried sheets are reaaaaally hard to accomplish in a tiny dorm room. I stuffed a duffel bag every time I went to my boyfriend's or parents' house and would let the hampers pile up before breaks. Obviously, this will not be a feasible option if you're far away from home. Also, don't buy detergent at the convenience store in your dorm, and buy some half-decent stuff if you're wearing your clothes 93285698 times before washing. And if you're using someone's machines, buy your own detergent/buy them milk and eggs/cook them a meal/clean the laundry room as appreciation. Don't be a TOTAL mooch ;)\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to get some superfluous dorm supplies, wait until those aforementioned clearance sales after the semester is in full swing. I got a full \"dorm in a hamper\" set for $15 and change at Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon. Also, Amazon. If you have a .edu email you can get cheap Prime shipping, and they often have hampers and such for much cheaper.\n\nLastly, check right now if your school (or one nearby) has a Facebook page for selling/giving away stuff at the end of the year. People moving far away often sell their stuff cheap rather than ship their used Ikea furniture across the country!\n\np.s - if you're in the Boston area, [Allston Christmas](http://www.boston.com/yourtown/boston/allston_brighton/Gallery/allston_christmas/) is September first. Don't get anything upholstered, but treasures will be out for the taking. A minor version of September's event is starting up now - some leases end June 1st, and the summer subletters drag leftover stuff to the curb.\n\nOh, and DO NOT GET A FABRIC SHOWER CADDY. You want a cheapo, plastic one. The fabric ones get moldy and gross after a week and the plastic ones can actually be brought in the shower with you. Also, flip flops. No one wants toe fungus.\n\nGood luck in college, and remember to study once in awhile! :D","name":"t1_crgatgu","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-05-21 15:24:35","week":21}

Trouble is, I know the prices of these items at whatever quantities and there seem to be some competitors selling somewhat inferior product for very very cheap - same market, worse product. I'd imagine Amazon selling is somewhat price sensitive - how do you get around that initial hurdle, when you don't have a brand yet?","name":"t1_crggutj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-21 18:26:15","week":21}

Proponents of a higher wage are claiming that this will boost the local economy by putting more money into the pockets of workers. This is the same sort of argument you frequently hear for the construction of massive new sports complexes. But of course, the money has to come from someone else's pocket -- the customer and the employer. What were those people doing with it? If the answer is \"buying stuff from Amazon,\" then maybe diverting more money to wages is a net gain for the Los Angeles economy.

I be posted the below response on a other thread, but here's some information to think about.\n\nI see a lot of general assumptions about laserjet being the best option, but not much hard math. The real answer, as in sociology, is that it depends. \n\nLet's take the most common assumption that laserjet is just less expensive in operational costs and over the life of the device by comparing the Brother HL-L2340DW(laserjet $122.99) mentioned in another comment and the HP OfficeJet Pro 8610(inkjet $119.99). Assuming that we can purchase both of these devices at about the same price, let's just focus on the operational costs.\n\nThe Brother high-yield cartridge on Amazon is 50.99 and yields 2600 pages. Divide 50.99/2600 and you get $0.0196 per page printed - so almost 2 cents per page. \n\nNow lets look at the HP OfficeJet Pro 8610, with many more capabilities than the Brother printer-only device. The HP 950xl cartridge(black) yields 2300 pages and is $26.99 on Amazon. This comes out to $0.0117 per black &amp; white page. That's closer to 1 penny per page, compared to the almost 2 cents per page on the Brother. \n\nLet's take a look at color printing on the HP - something the Brother is not capable of. The 3-pack of colors needed in the HP 951xl cartridge is $89.99 on Amazon and yields 1500 pages per cartridge. We'll assume you're using an equal portion of each color on a color print, which comes out to $0.0599 per color page. This is actually less expensive than most color laserjets in operational costs.\n\nThere are some other things to consider about a laserjet printer versus officejet as well. A laserjet printer has a fuser that requires a good deal of energy to heat up and fuse the toner to the paper. For this reason, a comparable laserjet printer uses more electricity than an inkjet printer. That fuser also has to be replaced at some point. Most manufacturers of laserjet printers sell what's called a \"Maintenance Kit\" for their laserjets that includes that fuser and some other rollers and such. \n\nOn that point, if you think a cheap Brother laserjet printer is going to last you longer than a comparable HP OfficeJet, I would say you're going to be disappointed, but a lot of it just depends on how much you're going to print on it. I work in this industry and have never been at all impressed with Brother products. \n\nAs mentioned by others, you'll also want to consider the ink print heads. If this is a printer that might be placed in storage for a few months (extended travel or going home from college during the summer), a laserjet may be the way to go. \n\nBottom line, if you need the color print functionality or the scan/fax functionality of a multifunction printer, there are plenty of good reasons, costs included, to choose something like the HP OfficeJet Pro 8610. If all that you want are monochrome prints and you want to be able to store the device for long periods of time, you should consider a laserjet.","name":"t1_crh05sr","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-05-22 03:36:29","week":21}

{"id":"crh1ils","author":"boxsterguy","body":"I used to take advantage of this when Barnes &amp; Noble participated.  I'd get $25 gift cards for $20, then go buy ebooks through the cashback program and get 10% of that back (as long as you visited through the cashback portal and had your Discover card as your main payment instrument, you'd get the cashback bonus when paying with gift cards -- pretty sure that was a bug, but it lasted for a couple years).\n\nOnce B&amp;N pulled out of the Discover program, I stopped buying ebooks from them.  Now I just use my cashback at Amazon, where I would've spent money anyway.  It's a 1:1 mapping so no extra benefit like gift cards, but none of the other Discover gift cards interest me.\n\nEdit:  Looks like Barnes &amp; Noble gift cards are back after several years absence, but at $45 for $50.  And the 5% cashback deal is back as well.  Not quite as good as it was before (20% discount on the card, 10% cashback), but if you read ebooks it may still be worth it.

{"id":"crh2l02","author":"perrybiblefellowshit","body":"Assuming this is true, which I doubt, but might as well: \n\nThere is a disconnect between you and your husband that money is only a symptom of. You need to decide, as a couple, if your finances are going to be combined or separate. Because it sounds like you haven't clearly defined that for yourselves. If you decide to combine finances, then it is no longer \"his money\" and \"my money,\" it's \"our money.\" It doesn't matter who makes more, you are partners and that's not how it works. \n\nIf you choose not to combine finances, then you can decide on a fair system for paying bills and contributing to savings, and spend the rest of your personal income however you want. A fair system might be (using made-up numbers here): he makes $10 for every $1 you make, so you pay 10% of the bills and he pays 90% of the bills, and you each keep what is left for yourself. This is a simple, but unconventional, way to go about things. It will stop the fights in the short term, but probably lead to you resenting the situation since you will necessarily have less disposable income than he has.\n\nIf you choose to combine finances, then agree to stop thinking about \"his money\" and \"my money\" and decide where The Line is. It could be a per-item spending limit, or a weekly/monthly limit, whatever works best for you and him. Under The Line, you can buy whatever the fuck you want. Over The Line, you need to discuss it together and come to an agreement.\n\nPersonally, my fiance and I make about the same amount as each other (both full time, just a bit over $16 an hour each). We have a joint account that our paychecks are deposited into. We each also have personal accounts, and we decided that we get $50 a week apiece to spend on whatever we want. We've defined our personal accounts to cover fast food, paying to park closer to work, individual entertainment costs, jewelry, computer games, extravagances, random stuff on Amazon, etc. Our joint account is for necessities (bills, food, gas, clothes) and joint entertainment--if we go to dinner and a movie together, etc. We never argue about money--in fact, we don't even have to TALK about money that often, because we're on the same page. If one of us proposes going out to eat together, we have an implicit understanding that it will come out of our joint account. If one of us says, \"I'm going to stop by Subway on my way home, are you OK with making your own dinner tonight?\" then we know it's coming out of our personal account. It's super, super easy.\n\nBut first you need to talk about this. Give it a try. You're overspending passive-aggressively, sure, but your husband is aggressively trying to control you. That's not a recipe for a happy marriage. You can achieve a balance, if your marriage isn't too far gone. And I'd expect he will think admirably of you for trying to have this discussion instead of throwing more money away on status-symbol junk. \n\nTry to engage in some insight into your actions. Whether you're thinking that way or not, your actions come off like you're gold-digging your husband. And nobody likes to feel like a wallet with legs.","name":"t1_crh2l02","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-22 04:57:13","week":21}

{"id":"crhagtf","author":"Uncle_Erik","body":"My take is to buy tri-ply stainless.  The brand isn't so important.  \n\nI won't use non-stick cookware for two reasons.  One, it isn't BIFL.  It always peels.  Two, if the pans are heated empty, they release a lot of toxic stuff.  Google \"Teflon parrot\" if you want to read some horror stories about Teflon pans killing pet birds.  It can't be good for humans, either.\n\nI think cast iron is a hipster fetish item.  Yes, it works, but what a pain in the balls to clean and maintain.  People swear by how they cook, but I don't find it much different from other pans.  I inherited my grandmother's cast iron pan.  It makes a nice kitchen decoration - I sure don't use it.\n\nAs for tri-ply, tests have shown that all brands are pretty good.  Tramontina (Wal-Mart) and Cuisinart (Amazon) are inexpensive and perform as well as sets from Calphalon and All-Clad.  I went with Calphalon since I've been cooking with their stuff for over 25 years and like the company.  I recommend Calphalon, but I think you'd cook just as well with Tramontina.\n\nThere are two tricks with tri-ply:\n\n1. Heat the pan to cooking temperature *before* adding butter or oil.  If you add those cold, the food will stick.  If you add them hot, the pan is about 90% as slick as Teflon and cleanup will be a snap.\n\n2. *Do not* put a hot tri-ply pan into cold water.  The stainless and aluminum contract at different rates and you can warp the pan.  When I'm done cooking, I put the pan back on the stove.  It will be room temperature by the time I'm done eating and will be fine to wash then.","name":"t1_crhagtf","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-05-22 11:57:34","week":21}

{"id":"crhksu9","author":"-BW-","body":"I like the Citi Double cash card.  It is 2% back on everything, no categories, no limits.  It is not as good as Sallie Mae for Gas, Groceries or bookstores, but it is more \"versatile.\"  Let's look at groceries real quick.  Assume you spend $500 per month for your family of 4.  With Sallie Mae you would get $12.50 (5% on first $250, 0% on 2nd 250).  With Citi DoubleCash you would $10 back (2% on total).  With gas if you spend $200 per month, you would get $10 back on SMMC, and $4 on CDC.  With Amazon if you spend $50 per month, you would get $2.50 back on SMMC, and $1 on CDC.  If you spend $500 on anything else, you would get $0 on SMMC, and $10 on CDC.\n\nThis brings our totals to $25 per month on Sallie Mae, and $25 on Citi Double Cash, so it is pretty comparable.\n\nAs a side note, I just want to point out that I did not calculate that ahead of time in my head.  I am pretty excited that it coincidentally matched up perfectly to suit my argument haha.","name":"t1_crhksu9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-22 19:02:03","week":21}

{"id":"crhlpjs","author":"nick2253","body":"There's a few philosophies when it comes to credit cards.\n\nThe most basic philosophy is that one credit card is too many.  However, I would say most people here disagree with that statement.  Like any tool, a credit card can be incredibly useful, or hurtful, depending on how you use it.\n\nAnother common philosophy is, for lack of a better phrase, one-and-done.  Their goal is simple money management, and they like the fraud protection benefits of a credit card.  When they have only one credit card, it's also much simpler to see how much you spend, and where you spend it.  Without tools like Mint, people with multiple credit cards would have to go through multiple statements, which can be a hugely time consuming affair.\n\nThere's the rewards afficionados (I'm one of these).  They look at their normal spending, and try to get the most out of those rewards.  In my case, I have four \"standard\" cards:  PenFed Cash Rewards for 5% back on gas, Sallie Mae for 5% back on groceries and Amazon, Chase AARP for 3% back on eating out, and Citi Double Cash for 2% back on everything else.  I supplement those with revolving 5% cash back cards, like US Bank Cash+, Discover It, Chase Freedom, etc.  This means I can get at least 2% on non-debit/non-ACH purchases, and usually I can get 5% on most of my purchases.\n\nLastly, are the churners.  These people (arguably) get the most out of their credit cards, but they also go through the most trouble to get it.  They focus on the sign-up bonuses (which are usually 5-10%+), and switch cards as soon as they complete the bonus.  They don't generally care about all the non-bonus rewards on a card, and cancel any annual fee cards as soon as the fees come due.","name":"t1_crhlpjs","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-22 19:26:03","week":21}

I'm a hobbyist developer (I work in IT, but I'm more of a PM than I am a coder), and I was just wondering about your site earlier this week.\n\nSomething I was thinking about was setting up a few \"Presets\" that new users would be able to pick from. (High dollar, high discount, new electronics..... high discount, cheap entry price, clothing... the combinations are endless).\n\nAnother feature I was thinking about was integrating your eBay completed and sold results into the original search, and help users find items that sell for a price on eBay at a certain percent higher than what the discounted item on Amazon is selling for. The limitation here is that it doesn't account for market fluctuation, or that sometimes your link doesn't always bring up the appropriate product or appropriate quantity of produces. There would definitely have to be a disclaimer there... lots of newbie could get burnt pretty quickly.\n\nThe last item I thought of was having an option that limits the results to change in warehouse price, instead of just the difference between warehouse and new. What I mean is, I see all of the time on your graphs products that are 50% off of the new price, but only 10 cents lower than last weeks warehouse price. If I could exclude those products and only include items that are 50% lower than the lowest Used\\New\\Warehouse\\whatever price from the last 6 months, that would produce a lot of very useful information.\n\nI understand that everything is easier said than done, but I've been thinking a lot about your site this week... it's a very powerful tool that could be configured for some very profitable ends.","name":"t1_crhpgf9","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-22 21:07:24","week":21}

{"id":"crhwqpt","author":"AnotherBusinessModel","body":"I do agree with what you're saying about RA and OA being more time intensive than other forms of sourcing and selling.  But at the same time, you should consider that people value their time differently, especially if their job pays less than average.\n\nFor example, I make $12/hr at my FT job.  I work about 60 hours per month on Amazon and make on average $2,600 in profit monthly, which equates to $43/hr.  Now, I only take a fraction of that in pay and reinvest the rest, but as you can see, that is a great value on my time, as my time is only worth $12/hr at my job.\n\nI'm not saying your wrong, OA and RA take time, but its a great way for people to get into ecommerce and make extra money and eventually turn it into something greater.  I wouldn't say it's for chumps; it has given my family more financial freedom and has helped me provide for my family, which is not chumpish, but rather remarkable for someone in my position, who stocks shelves at a local grocery store.\n\nYour insight and experience was helpful though, thank you.","name":"t1_crhwqpt","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-23 00:43:11","week":21}
{"id":"crhx571","author":"MTRBeast33","body":"Don't pay your car payment with credit card, it will likely pull from the credit card as cash and there will be all sorts of extra charges.  In general it's difficult to find ways to pay bills like Loans and Rent with credit cards (see r/churning for this).  Not important though, not necessary.  To build credit just add a credit card here and there and pay your bills on time.  Always pay off your credit cards each month.  If your current credit card is a real credit card, ask them for a limit increase, this will help your credit in he long run.  If it's not an actual Visa/Master/Discover/AMEX go get one as soon as you can.  There is a great Sallie May card that is 5% off grocery and 5% off Bookstores aka Amazon (Up to $250 each per quarter in each category but wouldn't worry about that).  There are a few other good starter credit cards, it's not hugely important which you get at this point.  Credit cards are a great tool if used correctly, if you find yourself too willing to spend since the amounts don't feel real, limit the use to Gas.

{"id":"criynjt","author":"SomeRunner","body":"Tried it myself - my recommendation would be to not go for it if you plan on being in for it for the money within 6 months. \n\nVery low margins and forced to sell at prices that a lot of people wouldn't pay for product - it's impossible to get the pricing down because you can't buy in bulk but nobody wants to send you anything for free either so you're stuck with wholesaling prices. \n\nOnce you put your markup on the wholesale prices, the pricing is the same as if someone were to buy it on Amazon or a local store so there isn't any real advantage to buying through a subscription box service. \n\nOf course there are exceptions, but without taking little to no margins for your first 6 months, targeting a niche that generally has extra income, or hitting a wildly successful marketing campaign online (viral marketing - not just adwords and FB), your box won't be going very far for very long. \n\nThat said, if you still have your heart set on creating a subscription box, do some things before your box topic is set.\n \n1. Find a niche that you can add VALUE. Not \"you get to try something new\". Not \"Get a surprise\". Value should be in dollar signs, not emotional worth. \"the average cup of coffee when brewed at home costs $.33 for an American - if you buy through my subscription box, it'll cost $.25 - the average coffee drinker will save $5.30 a month when purchasing through my website.\n\n2. Pick a niche that you can find people online. Don't have a denture cream subscription box - most of your possible customers are people over the age of 50, many of whom aren't active online on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, or other online forums. That said, if it's hipster clothing marketed at young male post-college employed programmers, you could have an online reach to your target market - they're largely active on Reddit, Google+, Twitter. You can reach them and they're largely connected with each other. \n\n3. SCOPE OUT YOUR COMPETITORS. If a Google search turns up more than 5 competitors, you should probably just move on. Look at their websites, social media accounts, etc. How many followers do they have? How many people are mentioning them on Twitter? These are the questions you have to ask. If it's a crazy number and it would take you 12 months to reach half that many people, just forget about it. It isn't worth the work.\n\n4. Once you have scoped out your competitors, even if there are 2-3 of them, look at their pricing. The bottom line question is **can you offer a better value than the competitor**. Value = $$$. Period. If it costs the same, you're in grey area - none of their customers will switch to you, but you may get new customers who switch. If you cost more for the same amount of denture cream, same brand of hipster ties, or the same amount of coffee, people won't be buying from you (well... Maybe your mom will).\n\nI'll probably add later if I think of anything - sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.

{"id":"crje5z2","author":"dragontamer5788","body":"If you're only trading established companies, yes P/E is important. But even then, the importance of the number differs from industry to industry. 15P/E is fine for utilities, but very low for tech stocks. (Amazon's forward looking P/E is something like 1300+)\n\nIf you move towards startups, P/E is completely hopeless. All startups have no money or earnings. By the time those companies prove themselves with actual profits, its too late. Even \"largish\" companies like Tesla (which I do think is overvalued) will not have a P/E ratio until 2020 or so. IMO, I'd jump onto TSLA at like $100 or so (which still has no P/E ratio since the company has never made a profit).\n\nBesides, if a company (like Microsoft) goes on a buying spree and spends a ton of their profits buying out important competitors, their P/E ratio will drop for the year... while their long-term prospects will look better.\n\nAt the end of the day, P/E is a number. An easy number to calculate... one that holds a lot of information.

The real fallacy is that you can redistribute money and somehow everyone is equal again. It doesn't work that way. The more you try to redistribute the more the wealth gap will grow. That's just how it works. The wealth gap will grow because of redistribution and then you'll call for even more redistribution because the last batch didn't work.\n\nIf you want equality then make everyone equal. Don't give companies any more rights than individuals doing business. Tare down a majority of laws and regulations and you'll have equality and greater prosperity.\n\nThis means getting rid of things like minimum wage laws as well as laws that create barriers to businesses forming. For example, why can nobody start an ISP? The answer is that it's illegal. Why can't I buy a cell phone tower on Amazon.com and start a cell phone company? It's illegal. Everything is illegal and rich people are the only ones who can surmount the barrier.\n\nYou want to promote equality by creating more laws and more barriers to equality?

On the about us page you talk about how you do product design and prototyping and it would be useful to hear a bit more about exactly what you offer regarding those services. Do you have any testimonials from previous clients that you can show off? Try to think of the pain points your clients experience when designing a new product, how can YOU read those pain points. Why should they pick YOU over the other designers ODesk?    \n\nI'd also be interested to hear more about how you design for manufacture and assembly.

{"id":"crjnw76","author":"gmdm1234","body":"Trust me, I do understand.  I question your understanding, since you correlate car sales negotiations with bidding for a product EBay.  Those are two very different models of business.  As are transactions at Best Buy or Amazon.  The fact that you don't understand this (or at least refuse to acknowledge this) illustrates why consumers are increasingly suspicious of car salesmen, and have negative feelings towards the entire car dealership and car sales processes.\n\nThe \"different perspective\" you say you bring is really just the car sales status quo, which is exactly what this thread is complaining about.  You're not defending it or offering some new insight, you're just *restating* it.  And what's scary is, it almost seems like you've actually started to *believe* your own bullshit.\n\nThe fact that you say in one breath that a customer *could* have purchased a vehicle from you for $1500 less than you sold it, but didn't.  And then you say you didn't \"screw\" that customer, because he doesn't know any better?  That's BS man.  That's why people don't trust your profession - because this is the kind of shit you pull, *and you actually think you're being honest when you do this!*  The fact that the customer didn't know any better is irrelevant.  If you (not just you personally, but the entire car dealer model) were truly operating with integrity, you would sell your product at a fair, market-driven price, and not expect people to go through all this negotiation BS to get the actual price at which you are willing to sell the vehicle.\n\nThe fact that you compare buying a car with selling a $100 toy on EBay.  EBay is the exact opposite of the car sales model FFS.  I, the seller, can set a starting price.  Folks see that price.  If they are willing to beat it, they can set a higher price at which they'd be willing to be pay.  The price is shown right there in big bold text to anyone who looks at.  Versus car sales, where you start at the TOP and work your way DOWN.  Or even Best Buy.  99% of the time, you pay the sticker price.  If there are promotions or coupons or sales, they apply to EVERYONE, regardless of the consumer's negotiating skills.  And the most BS you need to put up with in terms of up-selling is some high school kid cashier asking \"you want an extended warrantee with that?  No?  Ok your total is...\"\n\nIts that kind of disconnect - that you can't see this AT ALL from the consumer's side of the desk.
