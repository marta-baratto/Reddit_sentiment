{"id":"38yi58","author":"bNoaht","body":"About a year ago I was getting ready to have a baby any day. I worked in the service industry for tips. I hated it, every day. I found this sub and decided to throw my hat in the ring. I started with $500 working out of my dining room.\n\nI started with garage sales only. I bought anything I thought could make a profit, after looking up the \"sold listings on ebay\" as was advised. I also sold 100% of my items on ebay. \n\nI blew through most of the $500 on things I never even tried to sell. I still have most of the inventory to this day (and I'm not sourcing another item until I list or donate them). \n\nSo my first learned lesson is: sell what you purchase right away or just get rid of it. Storage space is valuable. The item might need a power cord, or complex shipping, but get on it.\n\nI moved to thrift stores next, Craigslist etc... Haven't really been to garage sales since.\n\nNext I learned. A thermal a printer is a life saver. I got a dymo twin turbo for 80 bucks on eBay. It has saved me an exponential amount in time and ink.\n\nThen I learned not to buy everything that makes money. Large or complex items are terrible. The shipping hassle, returns, storage space. It isn't worth it for me.\n\nI learned that investing in my business should have been number one. I waited way too long to buy my now favorite tool. A surface pro. I had 2 laptops I used and they worked OK and did the job. But the mobility and touch screen function of the surface has been absolutely my favorite investment so far. But i waited too long on many things. I had the funds, but i just put it off, things like a camera, lighting set up, shelving, bulk supplies etc etc. You probably know your needs, invest in the business.\n\nNext on the list is waiting to FBA for so long. It's not quite as amazing as the stories I read. But it's still a lot better than eBay. It seems daunting at first and without the proper tools it might not be for everyone. But if you get the tools it is where you should be selling for most items.\n\nI then learned to accept returns and the customer always right attitude. Scammer or not, on lower valued items it is best to just be courteous and refund. Then move on. My time and account standing is worth more than the hassle.\n\nThen i bought a WiFi ink jet printer/ scanner for $50, several shelves for storage from home depot for $20 each (building up, not out has saved me a ton of room). Set up stations for each task to make everything run smoother, table was free, desk was $50. Invested in a lighting kit for $80 on ebay (absolutely worth it). Bought a cheapish digital camera for $30.\n\nFinally, and this is something I still struggle with, is time management. I have a family now and the wife and I both worked full time and we didn't have child care. I wanted this so much that I didn't sleep much. I hustled hard. I learned a better balance. And that eating right, sleeping well and budgeting my time was a lot more productive than just going 100 mph all the time. Time is your most important asset. It's one of the only things you cannot ever get back. Once wasted it is gone forever. Use it wisely, calculate how you use it, and spend it like you would money.\n\nAt the end of my first year. I have profited enough to quit my job (and the wife hopes to quit too, but her benefits are just so good). I have 5 figures in listed and 5 figures in unlisted inventory. I plan on hiring 2 employees by the end of summer. Renting a warehouse space and office and moving forward.\n\nAgain I started with $500. And blew probably $300 of that on inventory still sitting in storage. And I have what I believe will make me 6 figures within the next year. Mostly because of this sub, hard work, and research. So thanks everyone.\n\nEdited some stuff because I wrote that on my phone while my computer was doing updates.\n\nEDIT 2: I am really glad this has gotten so many upvotes. I wrote this up quickly on my phone, so I missed a lot of things. I forgot a few must haves that I purchased along the way that I should mention. First, A tape gun, I think I bought it for around $15 on eBay, I bought a nice one and it is amazing for taping up boxes. Second, a steamer for clothes (someone on here recommended it to me and I forget who...BUT THANKS!). Third, a Bar Code Scanner (Got whatever the top ranked on on Amazon is for under $20). It is an absolute must for FBA if you go that route. Fourth, flat rate bubble mailers from USPS...They don't stock them at any of my local Post Offices, but holy crap are they amazing and FREE! Just go to USPS.com, sign up and have them ship as many as you want (I do this with all their priority boxes too, and they are all free). Finally, A good postal scale. I bought a decent one for $16 on eBay. But I need to upgrade. If it doesn't have the detachable face it won't be very effective once you get into shipping big boxes etc, but any scale works well with smaller items. Good Luck and enjoy the ride. It is a lot of work, but also pretty fun most days.","name":"t3_38yi58","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-08 00:43:13","week":24}

{"id":"38yrmv","author":"JmGra","body":"I usually go to estate auctions and enjoy them a lot.  I tend to buy older / vintage / antique items to flip.  \n\nI really didn't feel like going out of town for auctions this week so I went to one local that does scratch/dent/warehouse deals.  \n\nI thought it was kind of cool because there was items from HSN, QVC, Amazon, Kohls, many places and the guy called out where it was from even.  He made no qualms about the fact that items were returned / overstock and there were no guarantee on anything; however, when he was auctioning stuff up he would assign stupid values for stuff and even demand people pay him more to the point it seemed like he was bullying.  He would routinely do what seemed like bait and switch in that he'd having a pot and pan set, shown together and even say its for a set of pots and pans and then proceed to take the lids off and say \"You havent bought the lids yet!\" and tell the person who just won that they could have the lids for another $5, when they act like they get upset he just starts yelling over them saying \"GIVE ME ANOTHER $5! GIVE ME ANOTHER $5!\"  It was fucking awful to even see!\n\nSometimes he would sell a box completely sealed up and say \"This box has a $499 value\" and proceed to auction it and the idiots go up to $60 for it and its a $30 juicer.\n\nHe would start auctioning shit that was obviously not worth much and start at $300 and then literally as soon as he got to $5 there was a mystery bid that no one bid and if you bid $5 you just got a bid for $10 because 'he had $5 over there'.  I ended up buying a set of coasters(didnt buy to flip, bought for my own use) for $10 because I raised my hand at $5.  When I won he told me \"you better take both boxes these were retail for $150!\" I said no and took my 1 box and the idiot still had the tag on it showing it retailed for $25.  \n\nOne item he noticed still had a tag on and he yelled at his worker telling him to \"check every item for tags and get those fuckers off this isnt retail\"\n\nI'd say 95% of what he sold, he sold ABOVE retail just because the stupid local people ate the shit up thinking they were getting deals from HSN,  QVC, etc and being told they were!  \n\nI have no intention on going back unless to video the shit.  \n\nI mean I know theres a lot auctioneers can do to talk up their items but this seems illegal.  He would even have someone win a bid for something like a bed set for $40 (he'd declare it was worth $999) and then bring up another box and say \"Give me another $20 for this one\" the person would just stare at him kind of laughing and he would say \"Seriously give me $20 for this one or your not getting that one\"  the person would just laugh a bit and then agree.   It was like people were paying to be abused...","name":"t3_38yrmv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-08 02:00:05","week":24}

This card gives me .25% cash back on all purchases up to $3000, once I hit that threshold I'd get 1% back on all purchases. I can also earn 5% back on different rotating offers I'd have to manually sign up for (which is annoying to me). No annual fee \n\n**Capital One Spark for Business:** ($7500 limit) Got this last summer for a business I was starting, didn't use it much and it's now just sitting in my wallet. This earns me 2% back on ALL purchases, no limit. $59 annual fee.\n\nOut of these 3 cards I already have, my gut tells me the easiest thing to do would be to maybe switch the Spark card to some type of non-business card with Capital One, maybe that way I could avoid an unnecessary \"hard pull\" on my credit, would Capital One allow me to \"switch\" cards with them? \n\nI'm not against applying for a totally different card somewhere tho if the benefits would be good enough.

{"id":"391sa7","author":"dirkmoody","body":"I am very new to the idea of flipping and am going to raise money to start doing it as a part time hobby by selling off my dvd collection. As I was going through all my movies, I found a few that are worth a bit more than the others. The bulk of the collection are common movies or ones that have little to no value. I will put those in an upcoming garage sale I'm having and then take the unsold to a used dvd store and get what little money I can for them. The ones worth a little more will be posted to either Amazon or eBay. \n\nAnd that is where my question comes in. I have checked prices on Amazon and eBay and see a pretty big difference in the pricing. It appears things are listed higher on Amazon than on eBay. Some examples are listed below. My question is this - which one do you all suggest I use and why? I have an eBay seller account already and know how their system works, but I have never sold off of Amazon before.

{"id":"392i9q","author":"[deleted]","body":"I am an 18 year old student and live in Germany. Currently I'm doing my \"Abitur\" (Abitur is the German word, I don't know the english one, maybe A-Levels or secondary school leaving examination?).\nNext year I will study in a university, but until then I have a part-time job in an IT Company. \n\nI get 10,5€ per hour and work approximately 8 hours a week so I get around 330€ monthly.\nThe problem is I spend my money almost instantly. Sometimes I order things off of Amazon or other sites before my paycheck even arrived.\nIt is stuff I wanted to have some time ago, i.e. a 120€ bluetooth speaker for my phone, a PS4, a guitar and so on. \nThe rest of the money is wasted when I go to school and buy food everyday, buy DVD's, new shoes and clothes or when I go out with friends at the weekend.\n\nI wanted to start saving the money for univerity costs, a car, or when I may move out from my parents house to continue studying.\n\nHow am I going to manage this?\nWhen I buy this stuff I say to myself that it's unnecessary yet I still buy it. The first 3 months I started saving the money, but then it was willy-nilly gone for random things.\nIt may sound like I am a shopaholic but if there is something I want I go get it.","name":"t3_392i9q","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-08 21:55:35","week":24}

{"id":"392se8","author":"[deleted]","body":"I've been doing a lot of research about becoming an Amazon Affiliate lately, and I think I'm ready to take the plunge. I've created several Wordpress sites in the past.\n\nThis question is more of an idea verification question, and whether or not it'd be worth my time to start a website like this or if i'll never rank in Google. The goal of being an Amazon Affiliate is to get people to click your links, and then make the purchase based off of my recommendation.\n\nI've thinking of creating a website called giftideasfortoddlers.com.Basically just a site that compiles a list of items that would be good as gifts for toddlers. If you end stealing my domain before I purchase it - I guess more power to you. I see quite a few websites like Target or Toys R Us that have annual lists and things, But I was wondering if I were to create a monthly list of items for toddlers that would end up being profitable, or if there is just too much competition for this type of site to even be profitable.","name":"t3_392se8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-08 23:02:27","week":24}

When dialing our 800 number, you may press 0#0# to bypass the menu and be connected to a consultant.\n\n-----\n\n**How do I send a payment by mail?**\n\nPer chat representative:\n&gt; You may send a payment by mail to the following mailing address: P.O. Box 2210 Decatur, AL. 35699-0001\n\n-----\n\n**How do I send a payment through RB/BB/Serve Bill Pay?**\n\nAdding \"BBVA Credit Cards\" as a payee for paying bills and proceeding according to on-screen instructions seems to have some issues.  You may need to manually enter in payee details as if making a check payment by mail.\n\n-----\n\n**How long do reward points take to post?**\n\n\nThe points can post as early as a few business days after the associated transaction clears pending, but often take longer.\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Are non-swiped transactions eligible for the 5x points bonus?**\n\n\nYes; despite the responses from certain BBVA representatives, there are confirmed reports for Serve, Amazon, and Comcast transactions.","name":"t3_3935it","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-09 00:35:38","week":24}

I wanted to include as much as possible in case folks are interested, though.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n* How we formulated our offering and brand\n* How we built our site\n* Our plan for inventory and operations\n* Getting pre-launch subscriptions\n* How we cold-emailed our way to great press\n* Where we are now and where we’re going\n\n*We approached our site Go and Behold as an experiment at first. Vinicius Vacanti kept a blog for a while and had [a great post about not launching a company](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fviniciusvacanti.com%2F2012%2F01%2F23%2Fhave-idea-for-a-startup-dont-launch-a-company-launch-an-experiment%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHs-dCVbD3udoCeqzJ9iLYjOnoCzA), but launching an experiment and this helped us keep a productive mindset.*\n\n**How we formulated our offering and our brand**\n\nWe’re 3 friends from the NYC area and we’re all from the marketing and design world. We were kicking around ideas, trying to figure out what kind of project to start because we just had the itch. So we jumped in the way our backgrounds trained us to - with research.\n\nWe wanted to be in men’s style, but we also knew the fierceness of competition in the space. We thought hard about what we wanted to create, how it would be different than what was already out there, and honestly, to what it might be similar.\n\nWe decided to create an online retailer that features under-the-radar brands, artists, and independent makers of things. We focused on keeping it attainable, so while prices could be high for some items, the emphasis on value for money would be constant.\n\nWe really liked what Huckberry was doing, and we were particularly inspired by [Matt Carroll’s writing on Quora about the company](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fretail-analytics.quora.com%2FBest-of-the-Best-How-Huckberry-is-kicking-Warby-Parkers-Ass-in-Transforming-the-Future-of-E-Commerce-PART-1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHt_GFaAUn3R5S8iZ3QiZHnqGeDtA) (read everything Matt has written - it’s gold). Huckberry’s focused on cultivating a tribe of like-minded people around a lifestyle brand, and that spoke to us.\n\nDifferentiation was key from the start. While we loved Huckberry’s approach, occupying a different niche would be crucial for us. Huckberry really nails the outdoors-y brand, and they position the company specifically to speak to the urban adventurer. \n\nWe wanted our brand to be a sleek one, focused on the urban as opposed to the adventurer, and ultimately have fashion-driven DNA.\n\n*Brand planning tools:*\n\nMood board: Mood boards are great for shaping your brand because they force you to think in abstract terms. And brands are, by nature, abstractions. They consist of values, aspirations, cultural and anthropological themes, etc.. You have to come up with images, fonts, magazine clippings, anything that you think encapsulates the vibe that you want your customers to feel when they come in contact with you in a mood board.\n\nWe used Pinterest, but you could just as easily go with posterboard, tape, and printouts or magazine clippings. We created a new private Pinterest board and started pinning images that would help define our brand. Everything from pictures of people to architecture to typography and more. When one of us would post something that didn’t sit well with the others, we’d talk about why and hash out our disagreements.\n\nOur mood board ended up featuring pictures of Marlon Brando in The Wild One, the Rolling Stones in their younger days hanging out in Laurel Canyon, old Norton motorcycles, classic punk bands, art deco architecture, and industrial decor, amongst other things. It gave us a really clear vision of what this brand was going to be.\n\n*Brand animation brief:* Animation as in giving life-like characteristics to something. You don’t need an actual template, it’s easy to do on your own. If your brand were a person, what would they be like? What’s their name? Where do they live, how much do they make and what do they do for a living? What’s life like - family, single, in a relationship? What do they drive, and what music do they like? What blogs and magazines do they read and where do they hang out? If you have partners, these questions should guide you to discussions that help you refine key aspects of your brand.\n\n*Brand archetypes:* Brand constructs are social in nature. They resonate with us because they tap into some shared human experience on an atmospheric level. Take a look at this [Slideshare](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FEmilyBennett%2Farchetype-overview-from-the-hero-and-the-outlaw&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6yI9h7o8rnbjUFpjn6SkAnEOdxg) and you’ll see what I mean. As you develop your brand, you should notice it lining up with one of these archetypes - they’re proven constants in human storytelling.\n\n**Formulating our offering**\n\nWe had a good feel for brand, but we had to figure out what specifically we’d sell, and to whom we’d provide what value. We loved the value proposition of niche taste and discovery. I think we each have a pretty good eye for style and get a lot of “where’d you get that?” type questions.\n\nWe figured we’d leverage that and hunt down independent brands and people who make great things for guys, and build inventory there. Our criteria is that there has to be an aspect of special attention to production. No mass-made stuff, and some depth to the product and brand.\n\nAnd there was something else we stumbled on. We want to help small brands and makers we believe in get in front of an audience, tell some of their story and sell their wares in a stylish digital boutique setting.\n\nThese decisions came from a combination observing the market and the age-old “build something you’d want yourself” entrepreneurship philosophy. We all kind of wanted something like Go and Behold to exist for years. So here we went ahead and built it.\n\nBut this is a crucial tool we used to organize our assumptions and start planning how we’d deliver what value to what market: [https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas)\n\nYou don’t have to use that particular link - just search “lean canvas” or “business model canvas” and print out an example and start penciling in your answers. They’re a little different but the outcome is going to be similar. It just forces you to get out of your own head about how cool you think your idea is. \n\n*In the words of Paul Graham, make something people want.*\n\nThe canvas will help you there.\n\n**How we built our site**\n\nNot going to spend a ton of time here because I feel like this is the lowest barrier of all. Fortunately, 2 out of \nthe 3 of us has design and development skills. We’re a bit lucky in that regard.\n\nOur path to a site build was the following: (1) Domain and hosting squared away, Wordpress installed (2) WooCommerce installed (3) found a great theme on Themeforest to customize (4) designed branded creative assets like logos and the like, picked fonts and color schemes, etc. (5) set up payment gateways, analytics apps and typical plugins (6) started configuring the site options and loading in content\n\nThere’s no secret sauce to the plugins or anything. If you have the design and dev skills, WooCommerce is great because it’s free, but the spend comes in when you need to start buying plugins to facilitate everything you want to do. The most important plugins are the payment gateway and email marketing ones, IMO.\n\nIf you don’t have design and dev resources on your team, go with Shopify or Squarespace and stand up a site near-instantly. No need to turn this part into a hurdle if you don’t have to. Build it, start marketing.\n\nYou’ve probably heard it a million times and it’s true - collecting email addresses and creating email rapport with your audience from the start is necessary. And it’s relevant for every phase - pre-launch, newly-launched, fully operating. Here are the tools we used (and still use):\n\nMailchimp: We kicked around others but for our purposes, Mailchimp really is the best. We’re now a premium paying customer but used the free solution at the beginning. There’s a plugin you can get to include a email signup box at checkout - definitely do that.\n\nSumoMe: We use the list builder popup and it’s been working really well. You can connect this to most email marketing services out there and test different value props, copy, and design.\n\nThe applications and themselves and their accompanying wordpress plugins are easy to find and set up.\n\nOther than that, we put the usuals in place: Google Analytics, PayPal, Stripe for credit cards, Amazon Payments (which surprised us with how often it gets used). We use ShippingEasy for managing shipping labels and Freshdesk’s free plan for managing customer support.\n\n\n**Our plan for inventory and operations**\n\nOur problem with getting inventory was that we didn’t have the money for it. But keep in mind that if you’re approaching things like we did - as an experiment - then you shouldn’t spend a ton of money on inventory anyway. Revenue and traction outweigh profit at this stage.\n\nInstead we found it better to find low or no-cost ways to test into products and product categories. \n\nWhat we did: We started searching out small brands and makers whose work we loved. We went through every resource imaginable. Etsy, Storenvy, Instagram, forums, right here on Reddit, and our own collections of favorite sites. We compiled the list in Google Docs and just started reaching out, seeing if people would be interested in doing a consignment-type deal with us. We’re still a young company much of our inventory is still on consignment and drop-shipping. We merchandise and sell, pay the vendor who fulfills the order.\n\nThrough lots of emails and lots of conversations, we started finding deals that worked. In fact, we found our partners for watches right here on reddit, Nick (/u/crappysurfer). We’re still out there building inventory and partnerships, it just takes hustle. This is one of our main focuses right now, actually.\n\nAs we learn what products do well, we start finding ways to place larger orders and create cost efficiencies, taking stock and shipping ourselves like a standard eComm business would. \n\nThe way we select, manage, and fulfill products is a key part of what we’re building - I’ll get into that more in a subsequent post if people are interested.\n\n\n**Getting pre-launch subscriptions**\n\nWe first built was a signup landing page, using Wordpress and Mailchimp. We did what most pre-launch sites do - collect email addresses so we have an audience to which we could announce our launch.\n\nI want to address really quickly what I think is a starting-up myth: *Launch to friends and family first*\n\nI think you read that advice out there a lot. I’m not saying it’s never a good idea - sure, it’s a good idea if your friends and family are in your target market. Buf it they’re not, you risk falling on deaf ears, obtuse criticism that doesn’t apply, and torpedoed growth potential from square 1.\n\nThe internet is a big place, go get in front of people who could become your ideal customers. There’s a good chance it’s not your immediate circle, and that’s totally OK.\n\nSure, we have friends who dress well, but that doesn’t mean they’d necessarily be into Go and Behold. No point in hanging out decisions on a badly-skewed market test.\n\nWe drove our pre-launch signup traffic via Instagram. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i43ku/how_i_used_instagram_to_promote_our_launch/) pretty much laid out everything we needed to know, so no need repeating it here.\n\nWe only did a handful of sponsored posts but it started out Instagram following, got us our first real traffic, and netted our first subscribers. Not a huge amount, maybe a little over 300, but enough to launch.\n\nCould we have done more to drive pre-launch traffic? Absolutely. We were already sourcing products so we could have done giveaways on blogs, done guest posts, and just creating more social media content buzz.\n\nHindsight being 20/20, we probably should have done those things, but you can’t invest in the past…\n\n\n**How we cold-emailed our way to great press**\n\nPress is best traffic generator. If it’s on high-quality sites, it’s just awesome for so many reasons. It doesn’t cost money (but it costs a lot of time), it passes credibility both in terms of culture and in terms of SEO (someone deemed you worthy of coverage), it lives on through time as opposed to PPC, etc..\n\nBut it’s a hard nut to crack. You’re asking yourself “How can i get written about?!”.\n\nMaybe we were lucky with the following story, but like Thomas Jefferson said: \n\n*\"I am a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.\"*\n\nThe key for us was finding the passion angle.\n\nLike I said earlier, it was on Reddit that we came across Nick Harris and his modded Seiko watches. We love Seikos and thought this would be an awesome product for us make available.\n\nIf you’re read the watches sub, you know there’s a group of people that’s all about Seikos, and beyond that, there’s a really cool subculture of modded Seikos. It has a passionate, die-hard following, and that’s key.\n\nWe found that Worn &amp; Wound, a truly loved watch blog, had covered modded Seikos. We also found that Gear Patrol had covered them as well. Both sites ran content on affordable watches in general, too.\n\nNick came up with a great design for us, the Field Standard, and we bought one for promo purposes. We then reached out to both Worn &amp; Wound and Gear Patrol.\n\nMost blogs will have their contact info readily available, or at least a general tips email. That’s what we used because we didn’t have any kind of inside connection to either site.\n\nI wish I had the actual emails I sent but I can’t find them right now. I do remember, though, that they were really brief, with a link to photos of the watch, asking if they’d be interested in reviewing the product.\n\nThat’s it. Short, sweet, simple, no pushy pitch. Publications want to write cool content for their audience. Use that, swim in their blood a bit, and ensure that there’s value in it for them, not just you.\n\nBoth sites got back to us and wanted to review the watch, So we sent it out and it made the rounds. In fact, Gear Patrol did a really cool feature on Nick with only a side mention of Go and Behold. Here they are:\n\n[Worn &amp; Wound](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwornandwound.com%2F2015%2F02%2F23%2Ffield-standard-seiko-mod-go-behold-x-nick-harris%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPV_459Glyy8_uQsAmw96InoePwA)\n[Gear Patrol (this article was actually about Nick)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgearpatrol.com%2F2015%2F03%2F04%2Fnick-harris-watch-modder%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGyQQWwDa9HvTfKyKAH0j4Z1QzQ3w)\n\n/u/chrispscott also included us in his killer [“Time On a Budget…”](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fculturaldispatch.com%2Fpost%2F112562025541%2Ftime-on-a-budget-the-best-watches-under-250-pt&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDoGmUYmzzfvUoqCtlK-UHd95oLg) post on his blog cultural dispatch. [He posted that article it to the watches sub and it garnered a nice bit of attention.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffrugalmalefashion%2Fcomments%2F2xqjlk%2Ftime_on_a_budget_the_best_watches_under_250_pt_ii%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHI_5NsCq5f-pfaB6acXhQD1OkqBw)\n\nThe results were amazing. \n\nOur traffic boosted, hundreds of email subscribers joined, and we built up an audience that really cares about watches. They sell out every time they’re released and the category in general has become an area of focus from which we plan to grow.\n\n\n**Where we are now, and where we’re going**\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, we started Go and Behold as an experiment. The experiment ended up working out, and now we’re working through what our next steps will be.\n\nEverybody wants to focus on growth. The hard part for us knowing exactly how to do that in the best way for our particular situation. We’re still bootstrapped, the business is creating self-sustaining revenue (to a point), and we need to apply that revenue in the most advantageous ways possible.\n\nThe KPIs we’re working with are around scale (traffic, subscribers, customers, partner brands and products) and monetizing the scale (subscriber and customer acquisition costs, email conversion rates, site traffic conversion, revenue). We also need to focus on growing our social presence.\n\nProfit is not a focus right now. We’d rather build the subscriber and customer base and get our marketing, operations, and service infrastructures working the right way.\n\nTactically, we’re going to focus on press and content partnerships, social advertising, in finding more of the right vendors and brands to bring on board.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThanks for reading.

We had $1600 in savings but with a recent storm in our area, a dead tree started to lean heavily over our house which had to be cut down and removed immediately. We are having trouble controlling our CC debt due to unforeseen circumstances and we don't have any type of savings left.\nMy breakdown are as follows:\n\nMy take home pay is $1128 after taxes and health insurance bi-weekly\n\n- Mortgage = $800 a month @ 3.75, I pay $400 on the 1st and another $400 on the 15th\n- Car Payment - $263 @ 1.6% interest. We have 2 cars and the other one is paid off\n- Car Insurance - $175\n- Cell Phone bill - $120\n- Cable/internet - $145\n- Gym Membership - $70 - This helps with coping with the stress of my job being in IT\n- Groceries $100-150 Bi-weekly, we eat out twice a month, but not at expensive place\n- Electric bill - $150 - Higher in the Summer of course with the AC running. I do my best to conserve, by turning off all of the lights, setting the thermostat at 78 when I leave\n- Gas Bill - $40\n- Water Bill - $60\n\n- I owe a combined total of $8900 on 4 different cards at very high interest rates\n- $3900 on a BoA Platinum @ 15% APR, min payment is $85\n- $2200 on a Discover IT @ 21% APR, Min payment is $65\n- $1300 on a BoA Rewards @ 15 % APR, min payment is $45\n- $985 on a Lowes card - Min payment is $30\n- $140 on an Amazon card- min payment is $25\n- $240 payment plan for our vet - min payment is $40\n\nSo about $300 a month, I'm paying towards Debt, which is a chunk of change and will take a while to pay off.\n\nAltogether, I'm at about $8500 owed in CC debt. I've looked at loans through Propser and they have one for 10k @ 218.17 for 60 months @ 13.41% APR\n\nOr I could do a balance transfer to a card that has 0%APR for 18 months.\n\nHere is the kicker: When I turn 30, I will be receiving a settlement annuity pay out of 250K tax free from an injury when I was younger.\n\nShould I take the loan or transfer the balance, pay for 2 years (28th bday is in 2 months) then pay off everything once I receive the annuity?","name":"t3_3961z1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-09 16:48:49","week":24}

Apple wants to make self driving electric cars to diversify their thirsty portfolios. I can't forget mentioning Apple's control over the app industry (something that still boggles me) with their App store. \n\nOn the other hand, Google wants to make wearables for everything, they even want to make smart clothes. Google also holds the majority of small businesses under hostage with their abilities to block you off the search engine even under an \"honest mistake\". You might say, well then get off Google (Yea... right). \n\nAmazon on the other hand wants to absolutely dominate ecommerce industry (which is ok if they stuck to their niche), disrupt the goods transportation industry with their fancy drones and completely destroy the cloud storage industry with their race to zero with Microsoft. Amazon also wants to challenge Netflix and Hulu in being the premier video streaming content provider. For crying out loud, this is a company that started off as an online book store. Lastly, Microsoft just wants to buy off anything that's remaining and that they could get their hands on to stay up to speed with their older brothers. \n\nSlowly but surely, these companies are becoming regulators of their industries and others across the whole tech landscape.

I currently have no balances on any of them (I pay them off every month) and have a solid credit score (FICO: 790). My Amex has been my go-to card for everything for the past 2 years and I've racked up 40k pts. which I hope to redeem for travel or flight upgrades in the future. I recently just signed up for the Chase Saffire Preferred as it has 2x pts for all travel and restaurant purchases (probably 90% of what I use CCs for). This will probably be my new card as I want to build up more points for travel and I like the idea of no international transaction fees (I do at least 1-2 international trips/year).\n\nThe cards I have are below – should I just keep them all open with no balances or close one or more of them?

{"id":"399s8g","author":"[deleted]","body":"So I currently have a Chase Slate card that's still in it's 15mo introductory period which should expire in January of next year. I'm carrying a balance of $3200 at the moment. In order for me to pay it down to 0$ by January (when the APR of 22.99% kicks in, this was my first credit card), I need to pay $534/mo.\n\nI unfortunately don't have that in my budget anymore and I was pretty irresponsible. But now I am going to be looking at rent (1368/mo), car (190/mo) and insurance (100/mo) at a bare minimum for expenses. I bring home around $2100 at a minimum (over the last 6mo) which only leaves me ~$442/mo. This is also completely ignoring gas and any savings, as well as other card payments (read: one, that is currently accruing interest @ 17.99%)\n\nMy plan of attack is to pay off the $800 I have @ 17.99% right now then start hitting the $3200 as hard as I can but in the interest of not paying any interest, I am considering applying for another card to transfer the balance to come Decemberish.\n\nCurrently I have the following accounts:\n\n1. Paypal Credit - 2yrs - $1800 limit $100 used (will be paid off this month, currently 0% APR promotional pricing)\n2. Amazon Store Card - ~1yr - $1800 limit $0 balance\n3. Best Buy Store Card - ~3mo - $2000 limit $0 balance\n4. Amazon Rewards Visa - ~8mo - $1000 limit $800 balance (17.99% APR card, top priority)\n5. Chase Slate Visa - ~9mo - $4000 limit $3200 balance (0% Intro APR)\n\nwith a credit score of 670. Obviously those two high utilization cards are killing me since my girlfriend is in a similar financial situation (except less than 30% utilization) and has a 730 credit score.\n\nMy AAoA is pretty low to begin with so I don't mind the slight drop in that which will come if I apply for another card in ~december and I may close out the Best Buy Store Card since I foolishly took that just for the cash savings on a single transaction and also because Citi sucks.\n\nDoes this sound like a solid plan? I really don't want to pay interest on that sum if I can help it at all, and I also feel like by the time December rolls around I will have enough paid off that my utilization will be down and I can apply for a card with better benefits and cash back, use it's introductory APR and a minor transfer fee to minimize how much I pay overall while also raising my total credit limit and lowering utilization further, with minimal impact to my AAoA.\n\nAlso if I got something like say, a $6k+ credit limit, I would have no issue closing out one or two other accounts to keep my debt to income ratio looking nice and make my life simpler so I'm not worrying about making payments to multiple institutions. \n\nRecommendation for good Chase cards are preferred (since I already have two of my 5 accounts through them and they're the easiest to deal with aside from PayPal in my experience), but anything is appreciated. Visa/Mastercard heavily preferred if not Chase (since they use Visa), I know Amex and Discover have good rewards for members but if I am going to get a card that with a decent limit and rewards I'd like to be able to use it everywhere for simplicity's sake, and there are a lot of vendors who don't take Amex or Discover locally.\n\nOr is there a better way to do this?","name":"t3_399s8g","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-10 09:38:44","week":24}

{"id":"39cq54","author":"wisniewskij26","body":"Today marks 2 weeks of running a subscription commerce business called Bookcase (http://www.mybookcase.co). We are a monthly book subscription box where the user signs up, tells us what kind of books they enjoy reading, and then we hand select books for them to read every month. There are many different book subscription boxes, but I feel that ours is different for a couple reasons:\n\n1) Most boxes are geared towards any genres. Our boxes are not genre specific, in fact our genre list is copied directly from Amazon so it covers basically any genre there is. \n\n2) Most book boxes aren’t focused on books! A lot of the subscription boxes for books I’ve come across are for ‘bookish’ things, such as bookmarks and tote bags. Our primary focus is on aiding in book discovery and any additional items we throw in are just extras.\n\n**The Story**\nI’d say the current form of Bookcase is the result of a pivot, but it was actually the original idea but then was changed into something else, and then pivoted back to its original form. The Bookcase that was launched was a social network similar to Goodreads, with a Pinterest style interface. I worked on it by myself for about 3 months and on launch reached about 500 users. The problem was the churn rate was basically 100% lol. While I still HUGELY believe in the idea, I quickly realized that I wasn’t properly equipped to execute on it so I decided to move on. One night I decided to go back to the subscription model, so I quickly threw together a preorder landing page, and the next day I pivoted.\n\nSo here’s a little bit about the new Bookcase:\n\n**The Price:**\nWe offer 2 different plans. Our ‘Bookworm’ case, which includes 3 books a month for only $18, and then our “Casual” case which includes 1 book a month for $10. Our price point is very low compared to other subscription boxes which is explained below.\n\n**Our Books:**\n[Here are some of the books we are sending out](http://i.imgur.com/ilN1ETJ.jpg)\nThe books included in our boxes are a mixture of new and used, hardcover and paperback. Obviously it’s very difficult to buy new books and still maintain our margins, so the new books are mainly from authors we have connected with that have sent us a bunch of books for free basically for promotional purposes. The rest we get from used book stores and a few local Goodwills (they have a great book selection surprisingly). We do hold high standards for the used books we ship out though, so customers won’t be getting any tattered books. \n\n**Marketing:**\nSocial media has been big in helping with the growth of the company. Prior to the pivot I had already built Bookcase’s twitter up to about 20k followers, but I decided to make an Instagram to go along with the subscription box and have built that to about 2000 followers so far. My methods on building an audience are probably frowned upon but I spend every afternoon following people on book related twitter and Instagram accounts. I also spend most of my free time favoriting pictures under book related hashtags on instagram. Its unconventional, and unprofessional, but I’ve had great results so until we have more resources it will have to do.\n\nMore conventionally I have run a free giveaway contest on instagram. And I also plan on shipping a few free boxes to bloggers and you tubers for promotions. \n\n**Results:**\nAs of today we have sold 90 boxes for our July shipment, for a total of $1,397 in revenue. Truthfully I don’t know what is considered good for a company’s first month, but I’m very proud of the results so far, and feel very confident that I can build it up from here. \n\n[Some boxes we have started putting together](http://i.imgur.com/MjTZlDR.jpg)\n\nI’d love to talk to people about their experience with subscription commerce, so please comment on this with anything!","name":"t3_39cq54","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-10 23:53:29","week":24}

{"id":"39e5uu","author":"thebornotaku","body":"So I currently have a Chase Slate card that's still in it's 15mo introductory period which should expire in January of next year. I'm carrying a balance of $3200 at the moment. In order for me to pay it down to 0$ by January (when the APR of 22.99% kicks in, this was my first credit card), I need to pay $534/mo.\n\nI unfortunately don't have that in my budget anymore and I was pretty irresponsible. But now I am going to be looking at rent (1368/mo), car (190/mo) and insurance (100/mo) at a bare minimum for expenses. I bring home around $2100 at a minimum (over the last 6mo) which only leaves me ~$442/mo. This is also completely ignoring gas and any savings, as well as other card payments (read: one, that is currently accruing interest @ 17.99%)\n\nMy plan of attack is to pay off the $800 I have @ 17.99% right now then start hitting the $3200 as hard as I can but in the interest of not paying any interest, I am considering applying for another card to transfer the balance to come Decemberish.\n\nCurrently I have the following accounts:\n\n1. Paypal Credit - 2yrs - $1800 limit $100 used (will be paid off this month, currently 0% APR promotional pricing)\n2. Amazon Store Card - ~1yr - $1800 limit $0 balance\n3. Best Buy Store Card - ~3mo - $2000 limit $0 balance\n4. Amazon Rewards Visa - ~8mo - $1000 limit $800 balance (17.99% APR card, top priority)\n5. Chase Slate Visa - ~9mo - $4000 limit $3200 balance (0% Intro APR)\n\nwith a credit score of 670. Obviously those two high utilization cards are killing me since my girlfriend is in a similar financial situation (except less than 30% utilization) and has a 730 credit score.\n\nMy AAoA is pretty low to begin with so I don't mind the slight drop in that which will come if I apply for another card in ~december and I may close out the Best Buy Store Card since I foolishly took that just for the cash savings on a single transaction and also because Citi sucks.\n\nDoes this sound like a solid plan? I really don't want to pay interest on that sum if I can help it at all, and I also feel like by the time December rolls around I will have enough paid off that my utilization will be down and I can apply for a card with better benefits and cash back, use it's introductory APR and a minor transfer fee to minimize how much I pay overall while also raising my total credit limit and lowering utilization further, with minimal impact to my AAoA.\n\nAlso if I got something like say, a $6k+ credit limit, I would have no issue closing out one or two other accounts to keep my debt to income ratio looking nice and make my life simpler so I'm not worrying about making payments to multiple institutions. \n\nRecommendation for good Chase cards are preferred (since I already have two of my 5 accounts through them and they're the easiest to deal with aside from PayPal in my experience), but anything is appreciated. Visa/Mastercard heavily preferred if not Chase (since they use Visa), I know Amex and Discover have good rewards for members but if I am going to get a card that with a decent limit and rewards I'd like to be able to use it everywhere for simplicity's sake, and there are a lot of vendors who don't take Amex or Discover locally.\n\nOr is there a better way to do this?","name":"t3_39e5uu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-11 05:32:32","week":24}

{"id":"39g07c","author":"reversebanjo","body":" In this post I will tell my Amazon Affiliate tale so far, then I will offer some of my lessons learned, and hopefully the community will comment to give some direction on where to go from here for myself and people in similar situations.\n\nLets get this out of the way.  My site is www.owntheoffice.com.  I hope you find my story and quality post make up for this shameless self-marketing.\n\nThe first thing I did was acquire my domain and hosting.  I chose my domain pretty randomly.  I was originally going to sell random office supplies but I decided to move into more of a “niche” of office chairs since that is the most popular strategy these days.  \n\nNext I acquired my Amazon Affiliate plugin.  I grabbed WooZone Amazon Affiliate Plugin from Codecanyon.  I have no ties to them but I will gladly plug their great product.  Next I purchased a theme.  I won’t name the theme as I am not incredibly happy with it, but PM me and I will share more.  \n\nSo far I spent $162 on the domain and 3 years hosting, $27 on the Affiliate Plugin, and $24 on the theme.  This totaled $213 without any construction.  I had also spent many hours of my time up to this point as I had no real previous web development experience.  I had to learn about buying a domain, hosting, WordPress, etc. \n\nThis started in April.  I spent the next few weeks picking at the site.  I would Google any problems I encountered and had great results fixing things.  I slowly molded the site into something I thought was marketable. \n\nWhile molding and fixing some problems, I created some content.  I only have about 4 meaningful “articles” so far with original content.  I plan to build more, but I read that original content is crucial for SEO.\n\nMy final expense so far was through Upwork (outsourcing site).  I hired a guy to finish some coding problems that were beyond my capabilities.  I needed to adjust image sizes on import, fix a slider problem with my homepage, and a few other minor tasks that I couldn’t fix with the help of Google.  This cost $55.  **The total cost of the site today has been $268 plus dozens of hours of my labor.**\n\nI have done almost nothing for SEO.  This shows in my traffic.  I average about 100 visitors a week.  This week I made my first sale!  It was a computer mouse (not even listed on my site) but it was still exciting.  \n\n**My site has a total revenue of $2.22 so far.**\n\n**Lessons Learned:** \n\nDon’t get sucked into buying things you don’t need.  My theme purchase could have certainly been avoided.\n\nLeverage your skills/knowledge.  It has been hard to create original content for office chairs.  Something I don’t know a lot about.\n\nDon’t get discouraged.  I haven’t had immediate success…..or any success. I have learned a lot and I am confident that drive is the most important tool for entrepreneurial ventures.  \n\nPlease give me any tips or improvements you can offer for my site.  Be it the layout, features, SEO tips, or anything else you think I should learn from my journey so far.  \n\ntl/dr; I haven’t had success yet, but I learned a few things; sell something you can talk about.  Don’t spend money on things you don’t need.  Learning can be as valuable as income.  Tell me how I can improve my site. \n\n[Amazon Affiliate Report](http://imgur.com/pD6We8r)\n\n[Amazon Affiliate Report](http://imgur.com/79rfJ25)\n\n[Traffic Report](http://imgur.com/LP0ShM8)\n","name":"t3_39g07c","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-11 15:51:51","week":24}

{"id":"39isv0","author":"joeldare","body":"I wrote several small books and self published them on Amazon's Kindle Publishing Direct service. They all got terrible reviews and I pulled them off the market. Bruised, but not beaten, I decided to write another. The subject; how to publish on Kindle.\n\nTo my delight, this book gets awesome reviews. At least, when it gets them.\n\nI wrote the 20 page book in a single weekend, listed it for sale on Amazon, and made a whopping $2.73 over the last 30 days. This was my fourth book, so I knew the subject matter and wanted to simplify it for the next guy. The process is fairly easy once you have the basics. There was no need to write a massive instruction guide.\n\nA few take aways.\n\n- A few great reviews is not enough to sell books, it sure feels good though.\n\n- Amazon books do not sell themselves. You'll have to put in a lot  of effort after your book is written.\n\n- You should probably spend most of your time picking the subject. Make sure there's demand.\n\nMy book is here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00A4112ZM\n\nFeel free to AMA.\n\nFull disclosure: I borrowed the post idea and title from /u/reversebanjo.","name":"t3_39isv0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-12 02:35:25","week":24}

{"id":"39lc69","author":"DisposableAccount15","body":"I'm in a hole and other than making more money I don't know how to get out.\n\nI make $16.50/hr full time. I work a lot of over time, so my take home pay is generally about $2000 - $2200 a month. \n\nI had never thought about my budget, but I recently upgraded my health plan from the $80/month plan to the $140/month health plan, so I was trying to see if I could afford it. Health insurance is pretax, so I calculated the difference to be about $45 a month. I didn't include it in my budget below, because my take home pay fluctuates about $100-150/month anyway. The max i get paid is a little more than $2200 and the least is $2000. \n\nRent -500 ($1500 townhouse / me and two roommates)  \nPower -70 (210/3)  \nCable - 50 (100/2 other roommate \"doesn't watch TV\")  \nCell -50   \nCar Insurance -60  \nNetflix -12  \nHulu -8  \nSpotify -15  \nAmazon Prime -8 (aka $100/year)  \nGas - 200 ($50 per week aka one fillup - commute is 50 miles a day)  \nFood - 350 (150 groceries - 200 lunch at work)   \nGym - 23 (Planet Fitness - 20/month + 40 yearly fee)  \nCard min payments -150  \nAnnual fee on Southwest card - 8 (aka $100/year - It does pay for itself as they give you about a flight worth of points at the same time)  \n\n$2100 income - $1500 in bills = $600ish left over. \n\nI'm using $4500ish of $65,000 available credit over 16 cards and store accounts. All of them have zero balance except for:\n\nBOA = 67 / 6300  \nDISCOVER = 161 / 4700   \nDISCOVERIT = 3283 / 9000 (0% for 18 months - Six months left)   \nHSBC = 620 / 4100  \n\nI bought my car in 2007 when I was making $11.25/hr. I was paying $300/month ($14,000) + $100 insurance, but I was living at home and didn't have any rent or bills other than my car and cellphone, so I actually had about $800-900 month left over.  I payed my car off in 2013, but now it's getting really old (10 years - 235,000 miles) and I'm afraid it will die soon. \n\nMy problem is that I only have that $600ish left over. Every car repair wipes out a month of left over money. Last year I spent $1500 on the car. My justification was that a new modest used car (like $8000) would cost me $150 a month + insurance ($50 more) = $2400 or just getting the car fixed would cost $1500. I have a bunch of things I need to get fixed on the car to keep it running that will probably cost another $1000 in the next month or two. \n\nI feel like I have no room for savings. I used to have about $2500 saved up, but I used that for expenses when I moved out of my Mom's house two years ago (moving truck, furniture, security deposit, etc...)\n\nI guess my questions are...\n\n* What started this look at my finances - Can I afford the extra $45/month ($60 pretax is about $45 in my paycheck right?) for the better health coverage? \n\nI'm in perfect health and in my twenties. I used to pick the cheap plan, but a coworker that broke his leg and ended up paying $5000 and another co worker that got diagnosed with diabetes and had to pay full price for medicine, scared me into thinking I should get the better plan. \n\nThe $80/month plan is:  \n$3500 deductible  \n30% co insurance  \n$6000 out of pocket max  \nNo prescription   \n\nThe $140/month plan is:  \n$1000 deductible  \n10% co insurance  \n$3000 out of pocket max  \nPrescription coverage  \n\n* Should I keep fixing this 10 year old 235,000 mile car? \n\nIf I buy an old cheap car, wouldn't I wind up with the same repair problems anyway? \n\nIt needs a new timing belt (last change 100k miles), new serpentine belt (slips when A/C comes on), new front door lock, and a few other little things. Other than those things, it's perfect. I've always babied it with premium gas, synthetic oil, getting all of the fluids changed, etc...\n\n* Other than cutting out my $10/day lunch what else could I cut? \n\n* Other than make more money - Any other hints?

{"id":"39np9r","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hey beermoney,\n\nOur roots (and [very first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/2w5u4v/i_built_an_app_that_will_get_you_money/)) are here. The app we're building is now saving an average of $5 for our members every month and we'd love to come back for r/beermoney's thoughts/feedback. A lot is working, but there's so much more further we can go together, and I'd love your thoughts.\n\n[Paribus](https://paribus.co) gets you refunds you're owed. To do it, it scans your inbox for receipts, tracks prices on what you bought, and when they drop, files price adjustment claims to get you paid. You relax, and it gets money for you.\n\nWhy do we do it? Two reasons -- 1) We're owed money often (Amazon is estimated to change 80 million prices per day), and 2) There's really no business out there that fights for consumers. Stores have unreal technology (to rapidly change prices, use data against people to \"customize\" offers, etc.). And we as consumers are outmatched. We want to build a business that evens the odds.\n\nAs long as you join with an email/account that receives your receipts (current, or one set up just for shopping), Paribus handles the rest. Lastly, we also just kicked off a referral program -- so if you invite a friend that saves money, Paribus will pay you $5 too. They save, you earn. And our top referrer has made $200 so far in the past week (referred 40 friends who saved).\n\nSo that's it -- what do you think? What could be better? We're building this for the long-haul, and would love to learn more.

{"id":"39pdoa","author":"johnjmart","body":"The wife and I had twin girls almost four months ago. For many reasons, we decided it made sense for her to stay home with them, leaving us with just my income. Needless to say, this has been a good time to reevaluate our spending and finances. Thanks to this subreddit, we now have an extra $224 per month (or so) to work with.\n\nSome of these are obvious and things we should have done a long time ago, but some are maybe less obvious. Either way, I hope others can pick up a tip or two from the list. Most of these have been the result of advice I've gotten here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow We Are Saving an Extra $174 a Month:  \n$30: Got T-Mobile Government/Military 15% discount (I work for the government)  \n$29: Got rid of Wall Street Journal subscription.  \n$20: Cut iPad data service.  \n$20: Drink water instead of soda, iced tea, etc. at work.  \n$15: Wife got rid of her New York Times subscription.  \n$10: Got rid of Dropbox. Wasn't using it enough.  \n$8: Took defensive driving course online. 10% off some parts of my car insurance. (Course cost $25-- so start seeing savings after 3 mo.)  \n$6: Got rid of credit monitoring service. Use Credit Sesame, Credit Karma and annualcreditreport.com instead.  \n$5: Bring own k-cups to work instead of contributing the dollar per cup my job's coffee club asks for.  \n$4: Offered to pay upfront for entire year of web hosting for a website I operate. Saves me an average of $4 per month.  \n$2: Occasionally use refillable k-cups at home.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(EDIT: I Don't know why I said bringing my k-cups to work saves me $5 per month. It saves me around $28.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn addition, I've started using Slick Deals to find discounts on k-cups, Quest Bars, toilet paper and a few other things. This likely saves me an additional $15 a month, even as compared to Costco prices for many of these items.  \n  \nI also have stopped wearing contact lenses as often, and resort to glasses (Warby Parker-- $100/pair), likely saving me another $10 a month.  \n\n**Total: $174 saved per month**  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHow We Are Earning an Extra $50 a Month:  \n$20: Put emergency fund in a \"high-interest\" (.9%) savings account.  \n$25 (avg): What we earn in points from using Amazon Credit Card for most of our discretionary spending.  \n$5 (avg): Do some of our grocery shopping at Target. Target card gives 5% back.  \n  \n**Total: $50 earned per month**  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOf course, we don't have any credit card debt. While we were carrying a balance a few years back, we had been throwing away hundreds of dollars annually in interest charges.  \n  \nOverall, **$224** is a decent chunk of money, around the equivalent of getting a $300 raise, pre-tax, or the equivalent of getting a $3600 raise annually. I wish I hadn't waited this long to shore up my spending!  ","name":"t3_39pdoa","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-06-13 15:27:43","week":24}

{"id":"39rct9","author":"[deleted]","body":"I will try to keep this long story short: \n\nI used Amazon to buy my books for school. Over 5 years it equated to to roughly $6,000-$7,000.  I got an Amazon store card to help me while I was at University. I used the store card for books and school related materials. Throughout the semesters I would pay double what the payments were when I could. My Grandmother got ill my 2nd to last semester. Crammed 2 semesters into 1 and dropped the double major to a single major so she could see me graduate. Had to drop the internship I had lined up because of this. \n\nUpon graduation I lost my temp job due to cutbacks, as well as my medical benefits. My medication's price went from $7.50 to $298 per month. Blew through my savings paying for the bills + medications. I went through a bad detox of said medications (couldn't afford proper detox, detoxed in 3 days instead of 1 month). Went 1 month dealing with severe side effects. Another month dealing with horseshit depression/guilt+residual side effects. Went 7 months without employment due to lack of experience or because they were afraid I would leave for a better job (was actually told this). When I couldn't pay anymore the balance was $1,825. With interests and lack of payments, overtime, it is now around $2500-$2,750. Did part time lawn mowing/snow shoveling to help pay what bills I could. I recently got a part time job at Walmart stocking shelves. I want to start paying off the Amazon card but they sent it to collections, and collections sent it to another collections. And now I don't know what to do. I'm scared.\n\nWhat would be the best way to precede? My first paycheck will arrive on the 19th via direct deposit. Its only for 50 hours @ $9.00 and hour. I am still looking for additional work, whether it's minimum wage, freelance opportunities, or my degree's field.\n\nI currently owe: \n\n- Old internet bill of $60\n- Amazon Store Card -&gt; $2750\n\nMy parents are helping me with (Until I get back on my feet):\n\n- Cell Phone $40/month\n- Student loans $100/month\n- Car Insurance $40/month\n\nI'm mostly worried about the Amazon Store card as I have never had anything go to collections and it slightly terrifies me.

{"id":"cryyuep","author":"me3peeoh","body":"Books, especially on Amazon, are low margin items unless you get hardcover 1st editions, rares, etc. but those don't come around very often obviously.  The book market is about volume and cheap sourcing. \n\n\nYes, you will have to pay for shipping materials.  For books, get #2 bubble mailers, at wholesale on eBay they will cost .50-.70 or so per mailer.  Total shipping fee is about $3.  Amazon fees of $3.09, so your total fees are $6.9.\n\n\nGross profit from sale is $8.98 minus $6.09 = $2.09.  Your margin is 2.78 / .50 = 418%.  That's a great margin if you sell 1000 of them, so it becomes a game about volume.\n\n\n50 cents is a great price for a book.  Goodwills in my area charge at least $2 usually $3 or 4 per book, which destroys the margin.  (I don't even look at the books in GW anymore because of this) If you notice, the Amazon shipping fee is 3.99 and it costs $3 to ship via Media Mail, that's how sellers can offer the item at 99 cents and still make a profit--because they are selling thousands.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: I got my math wrong.

{"id":"crzn9wc","author":"mrcrassic","body":"Nice post; have a few suggestions:\n\n* MAKE A DAMN SPREADHSEET! This alone has helped me track my spending and know what I can and can't buy by about 1000%. I don't refer to it as often as I used to when I created mine two years ago, but I use this EVERY time I pay bills or make a big purchase.\n\n&gt; If something's half price, buy at least two. Use this to stock up on stuff like toothpaste, shower gel.\n\nAmazon has REALLY good deals on some of this stuff. They had a 40 pack of toilet paper for something like $11; we haven't run out of toilet paper in months (we replaced paper every two to three weeks prior)\n\n&gt; LIGHTS OFF. Very elementary, so easy to forget.\n\nIt *might* be worthwhile to get one of those smart lights in a little while when prices come down; pretty sure you can put them on a timer amongst other nifty things.\n\n&gt; Unhappy with a restaurant / experience? Complain\n\n100% agree; companies in general, even really big ones, are SUPER responsive on Twitter. I had an issue with my Simple bank account last year that wasn't getting resolved through their customer service, and I got so mad about it, I tweeted about it (something I normally don't do). Spoke with the CEO within two days.\n\nHowever, I recommend contacting them by more conventional channels first so that you can at least say that you tried to use their customer service like everyone else but was dissatisfied with their service.\n\n&gt; Brand clothing is bullshit; a dark pair of jeans and a plain properly fitting tee will do just fine\n\nNot quite true. All things considered, a pair of Lucky Brand jeans (or jeans form a jean shop) will last longer, look nicer and fit/feel better than Old Navy jeans. What *is* bullshit is the prices at which they're sold. I'd *highly* recommend hitting up eBay for your name brand needs before hitting up the store for them.\n\nExample: [these](https://www.johnstonmurphy.com/harman-moc-venetian-driver/9837.html?dwvar_9837_width=M&amp;dwvar_9837_color=Tan%20Full%20Grain#start=1) $100 driving loafers from Johnston and Murphy, a very good American shoe brand, are [$30 on eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/252100-MS35-Mens-Shoes-Size-8-5-M-Brown-Leather-Driver-Shoes-Johnston-Murphy-/161729012622?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item25a7cce38e)\n\nI used to flip clothes for a short period (from thrift shops) and aside from really haute items, most of the stuff that seems expensive isn't. Perfect example: I found a $1500 Brooks Brothers Madison suit that had no imperfections (that I could tell) for $20 and had trouble selling it at $200. Really, really, REALLY good threads for absolutely nothing.\n\nTL;DR: Do your research\n\n&gt; Use public transport off-peak if at all possible\n\nHighly depends on where you live, and even then ponying up for a car can sometimes be a better time-money tradeoff. Sometimes this isn't possible at all (unless you work in an off-peak direction, which in that case, is AWESOME)\n\n&gt; Don't buy mineral water; tap water will do fine (your mileage may vary depending on where you live)\n\nNot an option for most of the world outside of USA and some places in Europe\n\n&gt; Use a cashback credit card, but only use it when there's no surcharge (see 14)\n\nBe careful with this, as this can be a very easy ticket into horrifying debt if you're not careful. Spend what you can afford. (A lot of people even recommend paying off what you spend every month, but if you have a 0% interest card and *know* that you can pay your spend off at the end of the year, I wouldn't even go that far.)","name":"t1_crzn9wc","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-08 19:47:41","week":24}

Do you have a coupon at the local store to get the same shoes? Did you wait 30 days before purchase?

Did you consider buying used from a used laptop store or scrounge craigslist or Amazon, again?\n\nCars - so you owe about 40k for each car - can one of those cars be downgraded?

Your run of the mill Monopoly set, no, probably not worth it, but a special collectors' Pokemon-themed edition with all the fancy tokens? Yes, that would be one to get. Keep going with board games and you'll learn to spot rarer titles, older cardboard boxes that signal vintage games, that sort of thing. As with any craft/hobby/job, you will have to learn, but don't expect anyone here to spoon feed the answers to you. Expect to make mistakes, but you will learn. Read the weekly \"flip of the week\" and \"weekend haul\" threads on here to learn from those with experience.

It currently has a signup bonus of $200 if you spend $500 in the first three months (and an additional $25 for adding an authorized user and making a purchase with such card in the same time period). Contrast that to the Quicksilver card, which gets $100 after spending $500.\n\nThe Freedom card has rotating 5% categories (they change once per quarter year) that are often fairly useful (including things like gas, restaurants, Amazon, and other things) and 1% back in all other categories. The Quicksilver card has a flat 1.5% back on all purchases. If you take into account the signup bonus, you'd need to spend $6666.66... to match the extra $100 from the Chase Freedom, and that's not taking into account any cash back earned on the same amount with Chase (the amount would depend on whether it's in a 5% category or not).\n\nBeyond that, the Chase card may be easier to get. Chase pulls your credit history from one or two of the three credit bureaus (depending on your location). Capital One is known to pull from all three bureaus. This may (or may not) make it easier for you to get the Chase card.\n\nIf you're interested, there is a referral thread for the Chase Freedom, http://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/38mp97/official_chase_freedom_referral_thread/.

{"id":"cs0d6hf","author":"potatosouper","body":"I've looked into the business side of retail loyalty programs in my capacity as a data scientist (not for Amazon), and I don't think the article says what the OP thinks it says.\n\nFirst, the article states the consumers who are Prime members spend twice as much as consumers who are not Prime members, *at* *Amazon.*  That last qualifier is key.  While this might encourage some people to spend more than they otherwise would (in total), it's really mostly about poaching sales from other retailers.  Amazon wants you to buy dog food from them instead of when you go out for groceries. \n\nSecond, correlation does not equal causation!  Business people often get this mixed up, and I guarantee there is at least one manager in Amazon right now who is saying \"Look how great Prime is!  It *DOUBLES* customer's average order size!  We need more money to advertize Prime!\"  Which is flat wrong.\n\nConsumers who are Prime members are not a random sample of all Amazon customers.  Most people are at least a little bit rational, and a consumer who thinks he will only order one or two items from Amazon in the next year is probably not going to join Prime.  On the other hand, joining is a complete no-brainer for a consumer who knows he is about to move across the country and needs all new kitchen tools and living room electronics--he's going to be making a ton of orders, and he might as well get free shipping on the small ones.\n\nFinally, the article tries to paint the picture that Kindle ownership drives purchase behavior.  I'd bet dollars to donuts that Kindle ownership is correlated with above-average income, which is correlated with larger order size.\n\n","name":"t1_cs0d6hf","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-09 09:21:23","week":24}

I would actually increase this to about $50/check so should be more realistically $138.33/month.\n\nThe utilities should be split up into the types - water/sewer/trash, gas, electricity. The transportation cost should also be split up - car gas, insurance, maintenance, car payment.\n\nIf you are careful with your phone than go ahead and cancel the $10/month insurance. If you are getting internet for your home you might be able to decrease the amount of 4G data that you use because then you will have wifi at home.\n\nDo you do Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime? If so, include this in your budget.\n\nAdd an allowance to your budget. This can be used for movies, hair cuts, etc. for your entertainment. I currently do $15/paycheck. $32.50/month.\n\nYou need to include the minimum payments for your debt into your budget.\n\nUpdated Budget:\n\n* $560 - Rent\n\n* $107.50 - $202.50 - Car (What else do you have for car stuff? Not included in the final number below).\n\n* $97.50 - Car Gas ($45/paycheck)\n\n* $100 - Car Insurance\n\n* $100 - Car Maintenance (If you don't use it for that month than put it aside so that when a $500 repair comes along you still have the money to do so).\n\n* $138.33 - Food \n\n* $? - Water/Sewer/Trash (Included w/ rent?)\n\n* $25 - Gas\n\n* $25 - Electricity (Go ask your neighbors what their average payments are to get a better idea of utility costs - these seem really low to me.)\n\n* $65 - Phone \n\n* $30 - Internet\n\n* $8.54 - Netflix\n\n* $32.50 - Entertainment\n\n* $100 - CC1 (I don't really know what the amount will be but assuming around this amount).\n\n* $35 - CC2\n\n* $58.99 - Hospital\n\n* $50 - Shrink (Keep going to these - you started for a reason and you shouldn't quit just because you are financially tight).\n\n* $50 - Medical (Like with the car maintenance, if you don't use this set it aside so when you need to go to the doctor's you have the money to do so). \n\n* $50 - Household goods (baking pan, toilet paper, aluminum foil, etc.)\n\n= $1525.86/month\n\n$1346 - $1525.86 = $(179.86)/month without your commission checks.\n\nKeep making minimum payments on all of your bills until you can get an emergency fund set up. This would be used for major car repairs, hospital visit, vet bills, etc. Normally I would suggest to keep this amount at $1000 but because car repairs and medical is already included in the monthly budget I think having $1500 emergency fund would be a good place for you to start.\n\nWhatever money that you have leftover after getting caught up and paid current on your minimum payments save towards your emergency fund. Once that reaches $1500 pay down your smallest bill first, while still paying the minimum payments on your other bills, until you are debt free.\n\nIf you have to use your emergency fund for anything, bring it back up to $1500 and continue paying off your debts. \n\n$530 to get you paid current $324 CC1, $58 CC2, $118 Hospital, $30 Toll. With your first commission check get paid current. If you have $900 leftover each month from commission then you will be debt free in approximately 10-11 months depending on how much interest you will actually accrue and $1500 emergency fund. ($900 + $100 + $35 + $59 + $50 = $1144.)\n\n/u/wecannotsee made some really great suggestions as well. Keep all of your receipts for the first 3 or so months so that you can really see how your money is being spent.\n\nCongratulations on getting a budget started!

{"id":"cs0rpae","author":"LitoFinance","body":"Hahaha, I've actually been going through the planning process for creating an ISP from the ground up (and not just one of those 'local ISPs' that borrow leased lines from Comcast/TWC/ATT/etc. The initial problem of course is cost, and an underlying problem is legalities and hosting.\n\n\nSay you wanted to create an ISP that offers 1Gbps speeds like Google Fiber. Well, you'd have to find a municipality that's willing to allow you to run conduit through their current physical architecture so you can run your fiber, which requires legislative coordination, and the ability to find existing documentation of diagrams of their underground layout. Then you have to find a places to host the network infrastructure devices [that you bought] physically. \n\n\nThe ideal solution would be to place it in an existing business' basements or something to that effect, where you aggregate multiple fiber end-points into a huge (but local) fiber ring. Now you have a business park, a Campus Area Network (CAN), that is all running fiber speeds at their edge-to-edge connection layer.\n\n\nIn an non-ideal solution, you would be running a centrally-located fiber-ring that you host at a Main Distribution Frame (MDF), that sprouts off distribution connections to other Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs), that continues to sprout off to other local-centric Area Hub Network(s) (AHN) that sprouts off to other Area Distribution Networks (ADN)! Now you can provide fiber-to-distribution or fiber-to-home easier, but the cost is absurdly high. You see where it can get convoluted? I haven't even mentioned the logical routing portion!\n\n\nSo how do you get businesses to agree with letting you host a service-provider data-center in their attic? Well, it's kind of hard to. \n\n\nOne solution would be to provide an *internal* comprehensive IT infrastructure solution to businesses (kind of what I do now) and tack-on then expansion services. There are already a bunch of small/medium-sized businesses that specialize in IT technology, who could be partners with Cisco or Juniper or whatever, to support their networking and system storage needs, so this route gets really difficult especially for the current cost-value it offers. A small-business is easily sated by a wireless router, or a 12 port switch that they can pick up from a reseller or Amazon. So smaller-businesses that can't really afford a massive internal IT architecture is out of the question. What else?\n\n\nAnother solution would be providing services to medium-sized businesses looking for an enterprise solution - someone that's looking to overhaul their IT infrastructure during a restructuring or massive expansion to match their new footprint. This is my preferred method of entry and frankly the one I'm more comfortable with. A business who's requiring a design for a global IT communication presence and connectivity to their internal datacenters with speed, reliability, and security. With those selling points in mind, now the idea of, 'Hey, see this business LAN I built for you guys? Yea, I can make your Internet faster too' is more palpable. There's a lot of businesses with internal NetOps' and IT teams that have the same ideology of making 'wholly-owned' Intranets/Internets but it's just super expensive when a service provider can logically segment you off to your own VRF Lite*. \n\n*VRF= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_routing_and_forwarding\n\n\nSo maybe some businesses will bite on that, but frankly, it still doesn't provide 'home' fast Internet speeds like what Google's trying to build now without massive capital. And I'm trying to build that massive capital with business-based service-provider presences so that maybe one day those much-sought after personal speeds can be a reality to people, not just a dream.\n\n\nSource: Enterprise network engineer/system design architect that has a dream","name":"t1_cs0rpae","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-09 19:11:01","week":24}

It's far easier to \"search\" niche titles on amazon than ever before.  But I'd also argue it's far harder to \"find\" niche titles.

So I judge the book based on the cover and a short read.  This search method may be more \"democratic\" than a system that typically sorts books by popularity, but it's also largely inefficient.

{"id":"cs16abo","author":"random012345","body":"&gt; I can't forget mentioning Apple's control over the app industry (something that still boggles me) with their App store.\n\nWhat \"boggles\" you about that?  It \"boggles\" you that Apple gets a royalty for using their multibillion dollar platform to sell a piece of software that could have been developed by one person and brought in millions? It \"boggles\" you that the services/platform model is highly lucrative and is why *every* entrepreneur/startup wants to create an \"as-a-Service\" business?\n\nDoes it \"boggle\" you that a decade or so ago, selling your products in a brick and mortar store will result in selling it to them at a lower cost than what they sell it for?  Does it \"boggle\" you that if you sell something on Amazon/eBay, they'll take a commission? Does it \"boggle\" you that local farmers markets and craft shows charge vendors for a booth?\n\nNo?  Then why the fuck does it \"boggle\" you that Apple is charging to use their *extremely* lucrative (to the developer) model and platform to sell an app?\n\nNothing they're doing is anticompetitive.  Google has had *tons* of failed and shitty products that went *nowhere*.  So, Spotify is being threatened by Apple? Ok. Great.  As a consumer, I like this because it is providing me a new option that has maybe a few extra features that brings me more value for my money.  I don't feel bad for a company that doesn't adapt or grow.  \n\nTwitter was nonexistent not too long ago.  Since then, Google and Facebook have attempted ways to take them down.  They have failed.\n\nreddit was a crappy site not too long ago.  Digg dominated.  Digg became shit literally overnight, and now reddit dominates.  Again - Facebook and Google have attempted ways to compete/defeat reddit, and have failed.\n\nGoogle and Apple are trying to win the cloud storage front.  Dropbox is doing fine.  I have no reason to leave Dropbox for either.\n\nMicrosoft has attempted... well... everything.  And has failed at.... well... everything.  They have not threatened really any startup in the past decade.  They have tried, and failed.\n\nBut you're complaining about Amazon going outside of its realm from an \"online bookstore\"?  Why is that a problem?  They lead ecommerce, but it certainly is still an extremely lucrative and viable model to start an ecommerce site.  I don't think you understand that in the global population, if you touch just a fraction of a percent, you're going to pull millions.  You may not be taking down Amazon anytime soon, but you'll do just fine.  This goes for *every* service/startup - you don't need 500,000,000 users to be a lucrative business.  Heck, you don't need to become a $1,000,000,000 company.  If you try hard on a product/service that has use, it is not unreasonable to compete to build a $1m company.  \n\nThe problem that Spotify and such will face is they grew their companies *waaay* too fast, and then they can't afford the workforce anymore.  They'll cut back.  But they'll still be a viable business.  Hell, Grooveshark stayed in existence despite being a shitty service going through tons of litigation for years.  \n\nWhen companies start buying up infrastructures to restrict access to startups (cough Comcast), or buying competitors at extremely discounted prices with the only option they'll give, or taking startups through months/years of litigation just to bankrupt them... then yes, they're a bit of problem.  If you recall, Microsoft got butt fucked for this practice.  Regulators don't fuck around with monopolies.  But none of these companies are monopolies. \n\nWelcome to capitalism.

{"id":"cs16s37","author":"random012345","body":"What are you talking about?\n\nNot only did Microsoft actually do some dirty practices in growing massively in the 90s (such as severely underpaying to acquire companies as the only option for the company, or just get put out of business), but they controlled almost the entire market.  They provided no competition for the browsers, which is ultimately what led to the antitrust trials.\n\nApple doesn't control the market in just about anything.  As a stock holder, I'd love for them to do so, but they don't.  They're a trend setter more than anything, but they're far from a market leader.  OSX holds about [6-7% of the market](http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&amp;qpcustomd=0).  They can ban every developer from releasing software for OSX, and they'll still not be a monopoly/antitrust.  \n\nEven iOS is only [at about 18%.](http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp) Again, they're not \"antitrust\" material.  Android may if Google ever decided to make it difficult for competitors to bundle their software, but Amazon has proven that Google isn't going to do this.\n\nBut throwing all of those numbers out the window, Apple still won't be considered a monopoly or anticompetitive for controlling the hardware/software.  IBM has been doing this with the Z mainframe.  They own the software and hardware.  It's not anticompetitive.  It's just how they sell it.   Just because they keep the hardware/software together in one, it doesn't mean they're anticompetitive.  Anticompetitive would be if either they suddenly controlled the market and made it highly difficult/impossible to have competing software IN the system (like a browser), or if they made deals with retailers to exclusively sell only Apple products to the point that no other competitor will be able to sell.\n\nThe landscape has changed greatly.  It's very difficult to restrict competition in the tech world today.  Well, unless you're a telecom, which is why net neutrality was absolutely necessary to prevent Comcast and Friends from fucking us all over since they refused to adapt their dated model.\n\n","name":"t1_cs16s37","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-10 01:47:48","week":24}

{"id":"cs16z8j","author":"baligolightly","body":"Ohhh haaiii. I have eight (8!) years of school experience to share with you about the little corners to cut while in grad school. These are little things that I've noticed I do differently that other people who haven't been in grad school don't do. It saves me a bundle. \n\n* Cut the cord. No more cable, just internet, Netflix, and your savior, Amazon Prime. Don't bother subscribing to Hulu, the good stuff is free anyway. HBOGo is good but finding someone who will let you bum off their subscriptions is even better. You miss sports? Shut up, you're in a college town, go to the bar and get a beer to watch the game. You'll still come out cheaper.\n\n* You shall never drink bottled water or buy a coffee again. All you need to invest in are water bottles and travel coffee mugs that don't leak. \n\n* Invest in the most expensive computer possible and get a good warranty plan. You will have to replace a mediocre one halfway through school otherwise. That's a $900+ hit that *will* hurt. Someone might respond saying warranties are a scam but unless their computer has crashed in the middle of a project and the Best Buy won't honor the basic warranty plan...they know nothing.\n\n* Your SO needs to exercise those scavenger muscles. I would eat one meal per day for free just by hanging out in my building. Between undergrads and corporations, someone is always hosting some sort of meal. They will have leftovers. And they will let you bring those leftovers home. You can have pride when you're earning an income. \n\n* Discounts, discounts, discounts. Start signing up for those professional memberships and start pulling out your student ID off campus. You'll be surprised what it can get you. Hopefully your SO can join you or you can also carry professional membership cards to get a discount. A little tip: alumni associations often let you join while you are still a student providing you have a school email. You can start using those discounts ASAP, most notably on movers to get you to campus.\n\n* Goodwill. Go around move out season (May-early June) and move in/end of summer semester season (August) and furnish your home. Clothing remains decent throughout the year. Maybe you have had a bad experience with Goodwill. But this is college town Goodwill. You've got a lot of well clothed college students getting fat and getting rid of their clothing. That's an opportunity right there. \n\n* This last tip will keep you and your stressed out SO healthy. Head on over to /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and /r/slowcooking. Make room in the freezer and make large batch meals and sides. \n\nYou maybe are doing some of these things, maybe you did them in undergrad and never again, maybe you think I sound crazy. But you guys are about to go on a stress fueled negative income roller coaster ride that I called home for eight years, so hear me out.\n\nEdit: All my degrees didn't teach me to spell :(\n ","name":"t1_cs16z8j","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-10 01:53:50","week":24}

{"id":"cs1fxfv","author":"nsfwchow","body":"I found the site Yroo to be quite profitable. It's basically a shopping website with gamification. Think of it as the lovechild between Pinterest and Swagbucks.\nYou get rewarded for doing tasks or referring friends. 10000 points is equivalent to $10. The best thing here is that you can cash out with Paypal. No need to have all the Amazon credits. When you redeem, there is a $2 redemption charge so it's better to build up your points a little bit before you cash out.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how you can get points:\n\n* 1000 sign up bonus - when you sign up from a friend's referral\n\n* Varying daily bonus (starts at 100, then 200) for each day you sign in\n50-200 for miscellaneous tasks such as favoriting items on their site. They say that each task has the chance to redeem 10,000 points. Not sure how likely that is. I still haven't gotten that.\n\n* 500, 1000, or 2000 for each signup. I think this is where you can make a decent amount of money. Each friend that joins nets $0.50 to $2.00. It's hard to say how long the referral program will last though.\n\nI just got my first two $38 payouts over the past two days. The trick is to have a good referral network.

You'll need a large for your dog. On amazon they're about $11. I found them at my local Orschelns for $9 and I haven't seen them any cheaper anywhere else. \n\nI'm basically in the same situation as you. My SO and I are expecting a puppy in July (a Vizsla) and we have been preparing since January. I wanted to buy lots of stuff over a long amount of time because all the extras can add up quickly and I didn't want to go to Petsmart and drop $100 on toys. Plus, I like to research everything and make sure it's a decent quality toy and it can be too tempting to throw stuff in the cart at Petsmart. Generally, I would advise against shopping there unless you're getting something on clearance or you want to check the size and feel of a toy or accessory. \n\nCheck out Chewy.com for toys. Amazon has a great crate that I've heard only positive things about and we bought the same one. Set it up and it's sturdy. It's called the Midwest iCrate. It comes with a divider panel so you can use it for a puppy and adjust it as he grows.\n\nInteractive feeders are a good spend because they can last forever. Most are designed so your dog can't chew them up, just bat it around the house until his food falls out. A good one is the IQ Treat Ball, 5 inch. \n\nIt's not directly frugal related, but you should check out kikopup on youtube.

There are apps out there like forklift that stream all Amazon Warehouse deals within a certain range of properties (you can select 90% or $500 savings or whatever), but a lot of your results are things with inflated MSRPs. There's not a good way around this besides researching the items that show up. \n\nOther people search the clearance section of websites several times a day. Lowes, Home Depot, Best Buy, over and over and over again. This again, is not very fruitful. But when a good deal DOES drop, you'd have first dibs. Keep in mind, about half of the \"REALLY GOOD DEALS OMG\" are just price mistakes that the companies aren't actually going to honor.\n\nLastly, there are people that make their own custom screen scrapers using languages like Python. This requires more upfront time, but it will hopefully automate all of your future efforts. People that have really good algorithms for this type of stuff are not going to share their scrapers with you... because then they wouldn't be the first to the deal.\n\nSo in short, just like everything in flipping, it seems like this would have an easy, get-rich-quick answer... but the real answer is more akin to tedious work, research, and a little bit of luck.","name":"t1_cs1r9vr","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-10 15:53:51","week":24}

{"id":"cs1wobe","author":"bender9000","body":"Hi Annonymouse10, A couple quick thoughts on this situation:  \n\n1) Consider packaging the socks yourself.  \n\nIt sounds like you already have a supply chain for your business, either imported or from wholesalers.  You could purchase customized packaging materials in bulk (locally or import it) and then re-package the product yourself.  The packaging could be as basic or as involved as you like.  That is to say, while it might not make sense to buy 1k-2k private label socks right now, you could instead buy that many units of packaging material and continue to use it every month with your new/different product.  You could buy the supplies and turn them into packaging yourself, or you could purchase finished packaging and just place the socks inside it.  \n  \n  \n\n\n2) Order minimums are debatable with the factory.  \n\nIf you already have an international agent or factory willing to sell you 50 pairs without custom branding, but they want 1k-2k pairs ordered for custom branding, then haggle with them.  The MOQ pricing is based heavily on the cost of supplies for the factory and where attractive price points exist.  For example, the factory might need to order 24 meters of material before they can make one sock.  If you offer to pay more for your smaller shipment, the factory will likely agree.  It can work out better for the factory, as they end up being paid for supplies that they can then use for other customers/productions later.  In the early stages of your business importing like this can be useful.  Just be sure to renegotiate as your volume increases.  \n\n  \n3) If you are needing to attach a custom label to the socks, as in sewn onto the socks versus just using custom packaging, and can not get the factory to do so, then consider having that work done locally.  \n\nYou could find a local company or contractor to handle that work.  I am not sure how payroll works in the UK., but keep in mind you could pay per unit for such service, it does not have to be hourly.  Doing so could save you a lot of paperwork and hassle.  Think local tailoring shops, local seamstresses found via Etsy, etc.  \n\n  \n4) You may need additional sales channels for your inventory.  \n\nIf 1k-2k MOQ remains a sticking point, and the subscriber base is not able to be grown quickly enough to justify that size MOQ, then consider other outlets for selling the excess stock, such as a low-cost-high-volume model via Amazon, wholesale to other businesses, etc.  \n  \nBest of luck!","name":"t1_cs1wobe","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-10 18:26:11","week":24}

{"id":"cs1wto2","author":"OneSkinneeJ","body":"**What is your credit score?** 798 (FICO)\n\n**What cards do you currently have? For better results also add the date you were approved for the cards.**\n\n* Barclays Sallie Mae World MasterCard (December 2014)\n* Fidelity Investments American Express (April 2012)\n* Chase Amazon.com Visa (~2011)\n* Citi Dividend World MasterCard (~2006)\n* Bank of America MasterCard (~2000, I don't recall any more specific details about it)\n\n**Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back?**\nPoints for airlines and hotels at this time. Between the Sallie Mae and Fido Amex, we get 2% or 5% cash back pretty much anywhere. I've been happy with this setup but we're planning a couple of trips and want to reduce the cost via airline miles or hotel points.\n\n**What point/miles do you currently have?**\nNone at all. I've only ever had cash back cards.\n\n**What is the airport you're flying out of?**\nIdeally, Melbourne International (Melbourne, FL, MLB). It's about 10 minutes from our house and is quite a bit more convenient than driving to Orlando (MCO) or Sanford (SFB). I believe that Delta, American Airlines, and US Airways are the most common airlines that fly out of MLB. Out of Orlando, I would expect pretty much anything is available. Thinking long term and flying from MLB is definitely of interest to me.\n\n**Where would you like to go?**\nWe live about 30 minutes from Port Canaveral, FL and like to go on cruises. We've booked a repositioning cruise that starts in Galveston, TX and returns to Port Canaveral, FL. The cruise leaves Sunday, November 27, **2016**. Our plan is to fly to San Antonio (most likely, maybe Austin) on Thanksgiving 2016 and spend a couple of days in San Antonio before driving to Houston the day before the cruise departs. From my research, the best way to actually get to Galveston's small port is via a private car service from Houston. If you're keeping score, we're looking at 2 flights (my wife and I) from Melbourne, FL (connecting via Atlanta or Charlotte) to San Antonio, TX, a rental car between Thursday and Saturday (we'd return it the day before the cruise departs), 3 nights in hotels (2 in San Antonio, 1 in Houston; if we flew to Austin rather than San Antonio, it'd be one night in each city), and a private car service from Houston to Galveston.\n\nIn the future, we'd also like to fly out to Nebraska and Colorado, and we'd also like to take cruises that depart from Alaska and San Juan. I'm very new to airline miles or hotel points but it seems that we should have more than enough time to accumulate enough miles/points to make it happen. \n\nMy first thinking is to get a Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Freedom now and earn the bonuses, as the Sapphire/Freedom combination seems like a pretty good place to start. I'm 6'4\" and flying for 2-3 hours isn't enjoyable unless I've got legroom, so if possible, we'd fly business/first class. Between the two, I believe the sign-up bonuses are 55,000 UR (40,000 + 5000 authorized user for Sapphire, and 10,000 from Freedom). Checking Delta, two business/first class tickets on Thanksgiving 2015 are 75,000 points. If we get the Sapphire/Freedom now and put all our spending there and take advantage of Freedom's bonus categories, would we likely cover the flights? My concern with the Sapphire is that neither American or Delta are listed as transfer partners. American is  listed under oneworld as a British Airways partner and I believe Delta was listed similarly. I'm having trouble understanding how those types of transfers would work. Flying either of those would be by far the most convenient since we could fly from our local airport.\n\nI'm not sure if we'd keep it afterwards or not, so I was thinking getting the Starwood Preferred Guest Amex either in December 2015 or January 2016. Our travel timeframe is within a year from either of those dates so assuming the sign-up bonuses are the same as they are now, that would be 25,000 Starpoints. From what I can tell, that would be just about enough to cover 2 nights at The Westin Riverwalk in San Antonio and then 1 night in Houston.\n\nIdeally, we'd also like to pay for the rental car, as well. Should we look into something like the Capital One Venture or Barclay Arrival+? I believe with those you can pay down line items on your statements that are for travel?\n\nSorry for the huge wall of text, hopefully I've provided enough details to cover our goals and am not too far out of line with my thinking and expectations.\n\nThanks for reading and any advice or suggestions!","name":"t1_cs1wto2","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-06-10 18:29:58","week":24}

Kirkland brand undershirts. They are long, so they stay tucked in. They are soft and tagless which makes them very comfortable. And they are thick, so I can wear them as a regular t-shirt, and they last forever. \n\n8. Electronics: might be cheaper, might not. BUT: extended warranties and great return policy might be worth the price difference.\n\n9. Dress socks - the cheapest I've seen. I buy a million matching gold-toe socks, so sorting socks is a breeze on laundry day.\n\nI do think that Amazon is cheaper on most things, so you'll notice these are all things that Amazon doesn't supply.

To look better on my phone when at the store. Instead of looking just on Ebay google them and see if anything comes up. Now I have a pair of baby slippers I don't know what to do with.

{"id":"cs29xrv","author":"fallenposters","body":"Just in case you are mistaking what a good sales rank is, just remember, the lower the sales rank number the better. For books, anything under 1 million is typically decent as long as you don't have too much competition. Anything under 100,000 is great and will sell very quickly if you price it competitively.\n\nThe first and the last book have great ranks (less than 50,000) and should sell fast via FBA. The second book will probably take a bit longer to sell due to its high sales rank.\n\nThe advantage to FBA over the others is that customers are typically willing to pay a higher price because of Amazon's handling of the item (fast shipping and great customer service). So because of that you can usually charge higher than an equivalent condition item that is being fulfilled by a merchant.\n\nAnother advantage to FBA is you typically will have priority in the Buy Box over MF listings as well so your listing will potentially have more eyes on it than an MF listing.","name":"t1_cs29xrv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-10 23:37:12","week":24}

I will keep this card for a year before downgrading it to a Citi DoubleCash. I will be keeping my Barclay's AAviator Red because it has a 10,000 mile anniversary bonus (carried over from when it was the US Airways card).\n\n→ Try to get Amex to waive Delta Gold fee or possibly PC. I no longer fly Delta monthly so I no longer need this card. It was a way to get my foot in the door with AMEX but currently none of their other cards are appealing to me with the exception of the SPG due to SPG points having a good transfer rate to AA. I wouldn't product change to SPG because I want (need) the sign up bonus. It just sucks that AMEX doesn't back date anymore. The SPG might be something I try to get next year after I downgrade the AAdvantage to the DoubleCash. In the mean time I need to figure out something for the Delta Gold.\n\n→App for Discover It card. I will probably do this after going for the AAdvantage card since Citi is tougher on new inquiries. Assuming I can find a decent sign up bonus (like the $150 that doubles to $300 or at least the Amazon credit) this would be the perfect 2% back card for the year that I need to wait to downgrade to my DoubleCash. Plus with the categories doubled to 10% for the year as well some will be of great use to me (gas, online shopping/holiday shopping).\n\n→App for BofA Better Balance Rewards card. I always pay my balance in full and earning $100 a year for making minimal purchases seems like a no brainer. The bonus will go towards my AAviator Red's AF so that way I can continue to collect my 10,000 mile anniversary bonus \"free of charge\". I'll of course go through retention yearly to try to get some extra miles here and there too but the BBR card seems like it makes sense for anyone who can assign it a regularly occurring bill and pays in full every month.\n\nSo there you have it. That's my plan for the next year. Now all I'm wondering is when to do it all. My Delta Gold fee hits next month so I'll need to do that first. My two Barclay cards only counted as one inquiry on TU and I only have one other inquiry on Experian from Amex. Do I app for the Citi AAdvantage next month as well and then go for the Discover It &amp; BofA BBR all in one shot? I'm just worried about losing out on the 50k offer from Citi and you must enroll by the end of July to get the double cash back bonus on the Discover It card. The BofA BBR can wait longer than these two but it is free money and I don't want to miss out and have it get nerfed like what happened to the US Bank Cash+.  I have done a ton of reading and research but I am always willing to learn more. Any suggestions or improvements to my plans? Basically I am trying to get my around the world ticket through sign up bonuses and I will put priority on their manufactured spend but I prefer cash back in general. Any advice welcome!  Thanks!\n\nEdit to add: My income is pretty limited at 25k on my apps. I currently have a total of $10,250 available credit so I'm not sure how much I can get without issue. Always around 1-5% overall utilization with the only negative things on my report being 3 late payments from back in 2009. I am also racking up student loans (currently ~25k but will rise yearly for the next couple years).

{"id":"cs2od0m","author":"ThatAssholeMrWhite","body":"Honestly you admit you're irresponsible and probably should avoid applying for more credit at this point until you get this under control somewhat. I wouldn't even think about rewards until you get these current debts paid off or very close to it.\n\nYou have a lot of risk factors for creditors. You have 4 new accounts in the past year, coupled with high utilization on 2 of those cards. Plus you have a young file and very low AAoA. (What you may not realize is that Paypal Credit is a hidden tradeline that does not show up on your reports. This means for credit scoring and underwriting purposes your oldest account is the 1 year old Amazon card.)\n\nWhat all this means is that you may not be able to get any more prime cards at this point.\n\nDebt-to-income ratio has nothing to do with your credit limits (nor does it affect your credit score). Closing cards will actually hurt your score because it will lower your available credit and hurt utilization.\n\nFinally you can't transfer balances between cards with the same bank, so you would not be able to transfer the balance from your Slate to another Chase card.\n\nI don't know where you live, but your rent is very high compared to your take home income, and that will continue to choke your cash flow.\n\nAnyway, all you should be focusing on now is throwing as much money at the debt as possible. Get the Amazon card paid off ASAP then focus on the Slate. Worry about getting a balance transfer card when the time comes in December or November. Don't close any accounts.","name":"t1_cs2od0m","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-11 06:18:20","week":24}

{"id":"cs2t37l","author":"senorchaco","body":"Don't listen to these fuddy-duddies. Clearly you are interested in learning how to invest and starting early in college when (especially in your case) you have a higher risk tolerance and can afford to make some mistakes is the best time.\nI'm currently 21 and I was in a very similar situation as you. I opened up a Sharebuilder (now Capital One Investing) account in 2012 (I was 19.) I funded it with $500 and received a $50 credit. I figured I'd use the credit to pay for the transaction fees. I used that to buy 8 shares of tesla, 1 of Amazon and 2 shares of MSFT and BRK.B. I had no idea what I was going into so I figured I'd get into some very solid large cap companies (BRK and MSFT) and also some highly volatile ones that I believed in (TSLA AMZN)   A month later the Amazon share I bought for $187 popped and I sold it for $226. I was hooked. Since then I've found that simply having a trading account will cause you to pay more attention to the world of finance and make you want to educate yourself even more. Because I opened the account I now know how to look at financial statements, performance ratios. My first shareholders conference call I listened to was led by Elon Musk and it helped me to understand just how corporations actually work, and managements role in decisions. I currently have about 18K that I've accumulated by consistently throwing an extra $500 I have saved in to my trading account. The extra money causes me to search out more companies and new industries. One cool thing I recently experienced was going to an annual stockholders meeting. I bought some shares of AVAV when I thought that they had some potential in drones and electric cars and realized that they're headquarters was only 45 minutes away from my house. So instead of voting online, I went to the meeting, got free food, and free company swag. \nNow, obviously your situation will not be exactly like mine, but my advice to you is (since you seem genuinely interested) take half of that $2000 and throw it in the best cheap trading account out there. [Mint.com](https://www.mint.com/brokerages/)  can make some excellent suggestions on which brokerages are best for you. Then but some large cap firms that you think will still be around and making a difference in 50 years. Since you're starting with a relatively low amount buy in chucks of at least $500 to try and minimize transaction costs and do a ton of research and trust yourself. \nThis might not be the most profitable or risk-minimizing approach, but you'll probably learn a lot more about how stock prices work for various companies.\nTL;DR Use this money as a starting point to not only invest in capital but as a learning experience that will provide you a greater understanding of the corporate world.\n\n...or you could put it in an Ally savings account/Vanguard mutual fund  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n","name":"t1_cs2t37l","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-11 09:38:58","week":24}
{"id":"cs2tmh9","author":"brevig","body":"My suggestions are based on competitors that are websites, where you're comparing multiple websites and not accounts on the same website like Amazon or Etsy.\n\nThere are two separate steps here:\n\n* find all competitors\n* gather information on competitors\n\nTo find all competitors: start with searches on Google/Yahoo/Bing/DuckDuckGo.  Skim through blog articles and look at the comments.  I've found competitors mentioned in comments that didn't show up in other searches.  Also, to get out of the \"filter bubble,\" search other sources such as reddit, Quora, ProductHunt, BetaList, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, etc.  Searching directly on their sites will uncover many companies not found on Google/Yahoo/Bing/DuckDuckGo.  These suggestions are for tech companies.  If you're outside of tech, there may be relevant news sources you should be searching on instead of those I listed.  Record them all in an excel spreadsheet.\n\nTo gather information on your competitors, there are 6 different pieces of information you may be interested in:\n\n* estimated website traffic\n* social media presence\n* how many sites/which sites link to them\n* information about the founders\n* any investors, how much they've raised\n* idea of how many employees they have\n* their advertising campaigns\n\nVisit their LinkedIn profile page.  Even if they don't link to one from their website, there's a good chance that they have one (especially if they have more than a couple employees).  Just search on LinkedIn for the company.  This will give you an idea of how many employees the company has, and thus how large the company may be and what their potential burn rate is...at least for employees (generally the largest expense).  Also, click onto the profiles of the founders.\n\nLook the company up on http://owler.com  That's a free source that will provide counts on how many Facebook and Twitter followers the company has.  Though the major benefit of this site is that it'll provide possible funding information.  I don't know how exhaustive that information is, but it's a very good start and nicely sums all the different funding for you.\n\nHonestly, I usually don't look at how many sites link to them, but you could use something like http://Moz.com or http://ahref.com ...there are several sources.  Similarly, there are many services that will provide you intelligence on their advertising campaigns, I'm not too familiar with those right now.  Usually just searching on Google shows me the ads but the services provide some more info so it may be worth looking into for you.\n\nLastly, the thing I care about the most: website traffic.  Love Alexa (where I pull most data I actually use) but it's difficult to do comparisons on multiple websites unless you pay and have programmatically automated the process.  I'd suggest using http://similarweb.com  They estimate the number of visits to each site and provide the past 6 months for free.  There's also more details about how they're getting their traffic, etc.  I'd put the visit estimates into the excel spreadsheet...at least the most recent month and the one 6 months ago, though I'd suggest you put all 6 months in.  At that point, you can chart all the competitors in a graph and see their trends for the past 6 months.  Sum all their info for each month and you can see the entire category's trends: is it stagnant, growing, shrinking?  That's the data I'm most interested in: aggregate growth trends.\n\nShameless self-plug: After doing this research repeatedly several times over the years, I realized it should be automated.  So I've been working on http://rivalseek.com, the competitor search engine.  MVP should be out in a couple days.  :)\n\nEdit: formatting","name":"t1_cs2tmh9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-11 10:11:40","week":24}

That might be right if you are wholesaling something or sell private label, but for me anyway, just run of the mill RA, I'm starting to explore a little closer the benefits of being patient and not being the lowest. For example, I was sourcing a couple of weeks ago and found an item selling for $12. The Amazon Seller app said that if I matched the lowest price ($27) I would make about $5 each when the smoke cleared (these are ball park figures).  I decided to see what other FBAers were selling for and found that there were about 5 different sellers, the highest was around $37. I bought the 5 items the store had, listed them at $35.50, sent them in and boom, sold them all today.  The $5 profit would have been hard to justify with limited capital, but $15 made it worth it to me. \n\nLesson learned: You don't always have to be the lowest price. \n","name":"t1_cs36k8w","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-11 18:34:39","week":24}

{"id":"cs39mmn","author":"MuffinMonkey","body":"Well I don't think I've made a decent enough profit.\n\nBut I'll reply. I'm not sure if you'll learn anything from it. Maybe, maybe not. I haven't given it enough of a thought to write it out in a sensible manner. I play in the language learning space only because I am (well, was) learning. Currently my site's at 30k monthly visits. 80% from Google.\n\nTo be more honest, my total Amazon earnings are $106.22 http://imgur.com/JiQhmXW but that's from Jan 2014 to now. In all of 2014, I didn't have a payment option set up nor had I earned anything worthwhile until 2015. That's when I started getting between $15-$30 month in amazon gift cards. For my other aff program, I learned $1k in all of 2014 (maybe a bit less) and I should be around 800-1k thus far. I didn't tally it up yet.\n\n**Let's backtrack. My site** - I started work on in Spring 2012. My goal was not to be an affiliate. It was not to make money. It was sheer curiosity of playing with a site after I played around with another one before. I wanted to blog about language learning. I tried out Korean as my first language (and affiliate product). My first sale was a $1.50 in May 2013. That was a nice confidence boost. I think I added Russian in the summer of 2013 and Japanese in late fall of 2013.  Given that there's a payout threshold, I actually didn't see a full payment until Fall of 2013. Around September or November. About $50-60.\n\n**My efforts? About 1-2 lengthy posts a month.** Not SEO based. Just whatever came to my mind. Within that 2012 to 2013 period. Again, I was doing it out of curiosity, fun, killing time and ways to learn some marketing as I work in marketing. Sales started popping up in Fall of 2013 and I started hitting the payout limit and started receiving payments. Around then, I started using Google Keywords Tool to test out various phrases that I could write articles about. And I started amping up my posts, once a week to 6 times a month.\n\nAlso, I've been using the fv simple seo plugin for SEO and writing custom titles/descriptions for search engines.\n\nWith the Keyword Tool, I'd set the popularity to low, make sure that they were searched less than 300 times a month (why fight an uphill battle with competitive ones?) I'd make a list of potential phrases, search them up on Google and see what results came up. If the sites had shoddy SEO practices (description, links) or in general, were slightly off - I'd write the articles focused around that phrase. The beauty of language is that there are many angles to target (grammar, vocab, specific reviews of products, idioms, phrases, sayings, alphabet, conversation, etc.) Just add a 2-3 more words to these and you have a long tail phrase that's searched but has no competition.\n\nI also do reviews on other language tools aside from my affiliate program I use. Why? Why not. Just to grab extra traffic if I could.\n\nBut of course, anything general like \"learn language online, online courses, online courses, etc.\" that were popular were a no go.\n\nAnd sometime around end of 2013 or sometime in 2014, I added Hebrew.\n\n**In January 2014, I also added Amazon to post up language textbooks.** No payouts til 2015 as mentioned up top. That was pretty nice. With my current aff programs, I was getting $50-100 every other month (or every month if I was lucky). The nice thing about having multiple languages is that while one \"accrues,\" the other is just about ready for a payout - as each came from a separate aff program and they all had a minimum payout. \n\nOverall, for 2014, no aff payouts on amazon but some pennies came in according to reports. Total language sales for the 4 languages came out to around $1k. \n\n*January 2015,  I hit a high of $240 for that month.* for the May of 2015, I hit a huge high of $440. I think that was luck and just a good timing. Overall, no stop in making articles.\n\n\nThings that I did:\n\n* I bought a Facebook ad one time. No conversions. Or maybe it was that one .25 cent one. Nevertheless, I don't discount the platform as I'm a total noob and didn't plan it out well. I just ran one with a $30 limit.\n* I changed my layout to a more mobile friendly one for 1 week. Result = drop in clicks.\n* I took off my BIG affiliate sidebar ads because I felt they were spammy for 1 month. Result = massive drop in sales. Apparently people click ads.\n* Use Google Keyword Tool to plan out things I write about\n* Write reviews on any related product.\n* Occasionally post on my 20k fan FB page. Boost in daily visits, possibly a few more email signups but hard to prove any sales.\n* Post on Tumblr. Can't show much proof for its viability, but damn, you're more likely to go viral there than anywhere else. Plus, if posts get shared, they don't die like they do on FB/Twitter.\n* Ignore the rest of social media. \n* Had social share buttons, decided to take them down and keep the email share button up. It was nice to see # of shares but the results = very little traffic = didn't really show the necessity. So, just email button it is.\n\n\nThings that I learned:\n\n* I probably would've quit a long time ago had I started with a goal and not curiosity and sheer playfulness. If you told me it'd take a good 1-2 years to make some decent pocket cash, I'd say no. I'd say the same thing right now.\n* If you don't buy ads - and I pretty much didn't - effort from organic search takes MONTHS to bear fruit, if any at all. I guess the magic is in consistency of pumping out articles that are based around phrases that are searched for.\n* Growth seems exponential. $1k for 2014. I'll probably double it this year if all goes well. However, it takes a WHILE to grow.\n* Keywords Tool was pretty helpful. A few of my articles have #1 spot on Google. Others have grew to the 1st page in time. And I think 60-70% didn't quite make it.\n* Amazon is nice chump change unless you're moving big ticket items. \n* Time and consistency with low expectations seemed to help a lot. Again, had I come out swinging and aiming for the stars, I'd quit a long time ago. But, I'm just assuming that latter part.\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cs39mmn","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-11 19:44:55","week":24}

Swappa charges high fees so avoid them. \n\nAmazon works well for NIB items, phones will sell faster than eBay but they impose a very buyer oriented return policy, so avoid selling used items here. You could have a buyer say that the phone was too scratched or wasn't as expected and you'd have to cover return shipping and give them a full refund.\n\neBay will probably be your best bet. You'll have a fair amount of exposure, so your phones should sell quickly and for more money, on average, than locally. If fees are a concern, eBay offers a fee calculator which should give you a good estimate: http://www.fees.ebay.com/feeweb/feecalculator\n\nAs for shipping, priority mail flat rate envelope (1-3 day) is not only cheaper than ground shipping, but your customers will love you for the quick delivery time and you don't have to weigh your shipments since it's flat rate.

The reason you want to do this is so that you can track your traffic and your keywords, when they begin to rank.\n\nSecondly, have you made a referral through Amazon Affiliate yet? Like has Amazon already looked at your website and approved it \"officially\"? This happens usually after you have made a referral and made our first referral sale, they send you an email welcoming you to the program. \n\nOnto the site itself - get rid of the disclaimer at the bottom, move all the text into your privacy policy, and instead of the block of text have a link the privacy policy that says \"Amazon Affiliate Disclaimer\". Also on the sidebars - I'd say scrap the advertisement - I checked the site on my iPad first and was kind of thrown off because it didn't size very well and looked a bit tacky - just saying.

Start a boutique souvenir store that focuses on items that are from the area (e.g. the midwest or southwestern or wherever you are). You could even look to partner with local craftsmen and sell their things on consignment.\n\n2. If you have access to the internet and a shipping service you have the potential to start an online business. I would review all of the top articles in [r/FulfilmentByAmazon](http://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/) and all of the articles here that talk about Alibaba. Specifically things by [u/blakmirror](http://www.reddit.com/user/blakmirror).\n\n3.

{"id":"cs48a09","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"Search everything you can on your phone until you get that 'eye'. Back when I started, it was a lot of trial and error, because smart phones did not exist. Probably 1/3 of what I picked up at the beginning was a loss and would not sell. I learned by my mistakes. Now though, there is hardly any reason for those mistakes. If you see something that looks like a quality item, search the model number on eBay, and look at the completed listings. Is it selling for double the price that Goodwill is asking? Is it selling consistently? Then pick it up. The only mistakes you should be making are if there is no history on eBay or Amazon (or no sales rank, in Amazon's case), and you take a gamble. When those gambles don't pay off, the money you spent on that item is just flipping tuition. You learned about something that didn't sell. \n\nIt's also important to really research the items when you get them home. An example I remember is someone picking up some Anime DVD because it sold for a ton on Amazon. When he sold it, the buyer reported him for it being counterfeit. This situation would have been avoid with even a modicum of research on the subject. Use google. Search on how to identify fakes, or different versions of the product. Look at other people's listings and see if there are any little differences between your product and theirs. Test the product. If you don't know how to test the product, look it up.","name":"t1_cs48a09","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-12 16:18:44","week":24}

{"id":"cs48gki","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"Welcome to /r/flipping!\n\nWhether you use eBay or Amazon, sellers usually pay about 15% fees. These fees go towards showing your product to millions and millions of customers. If you setup a brick and mortar store, you'd reach a small percentage of people in your town, and your overhead would be much more than 15%. If you setup your own website, you'd have hosting overhead and then you'd have to advertise like crazy... and you still wouldn't get even a fraction of the audience that eBay or Amazon can garner. If you sold on Craigslist, you'd probably get less than 85% of the eBay selling price (there are exceptions), because there is no return policy, you have to travel to get the goods instead of ship, and Craigslist is just shady to begin with.

{"id":"cs4rlt4","author":"PretzelSamples","body":"I recently released an ebook anonymously. To do this, I chose to sell through amazon. You can make whatever pen name you want, but your tax information must be correct. \n\nThus, your only risk of your identity leaking would be if your book became huge. Like Shades of Grey or Harry Potter or something. Then you have a higher chance of some employee at Amazon leaking it, or some lawsuit or other legal action in which that information is requested from Amazon in discovery.\n\nAs far as not using Amazon, and using a different payment method, there are other payment platforms outside of Paypal. They all request that you give your real information. You could fudge it if your sales are pathetic, but if your sales are enough to pay your salary, you need to be honest with them. Some may keep your information private, others may give it upon request, (or similar to amazon, only release it when legally appropriate.)\n\nKeep in mind, when using a Pen Name, you either have to tie your pen name to your real name with a DBA, or you have no way to prove you own rights of that book. What is to stop someone nefarious doing nefarious things with your book content? What if you were to pursue them legally? You'd have to reveal your identity in those actions, unless there was an exceptionally compelling reason for a judge to John Doe the plaintiff. \n\nFrom my research and personal opinion, it seems like the kind of thing where you basically just need to own it. If it is not going to make a lot sales you could maybe fly under the radar. If it gets to the point where it is selling well, you need to prepare to reveal your identity. \n\nOf course, you could (or should?) always talk/pay to talk to a lawyer on how they advise you to proceed. Perhaps one that specializes in working in publishing or print publishing. Obviously the one entity that will pursue you with prejudice is the IRS or state tax entities. They don't care what you've done or written to make money, but they certainly care that you are honest with them about that money, and that you pay those taxes.

The overarching reason is security of the purchase. When you sell a gift code there is nothing stopping you from using the code after the sale. This is why they require your credit card info to charge you if you try to rip them off.\n\nI know when reselling the cards there is more demand for physical cards, but why exactly they won't require a card on file for a mail in card is unknown to me. Perhaps they can track the balance and contest issues with the merchant if they have the physical card.\n\nWhich sites will take a code and/or card varies significantly by merchant. I.E. Most will buy Amazon gift codes and gift cards but will only buy the gift cards for something like Zumiez.\n\nI won't begin to go over the various sites, price differences, and which cards they will buy.

Always double check the legitimacy of any site before giving them your credit card info to be safe. \n\nI have sold to Monster gift cards and Giftcards.com without any problems but cannot personally vouche for any other sites.\n\nAs others have recommended already - GCX here on reddit is a great place to trade cards with fellow redditors rather than pay internet retailers a cut.

Soda club brand units take a bigger cartridge, nearly 3 times the size of soda stream. \n\nI charge $3.75 ($.25 an ounce) to refill soda stream size cylinders with food grade CO2 and several customers have reported 35-45 liters of soda water on those 14.5 ounce soda stream refills. \n\nAt a gas supplier like Airgas you can rent CO2 cylinders of various sizes or buy them on Amazon. In this case a 20 pound cylinder costs about $8-25 to refill depending on where you live. That's a significant savings and all you need is a remote line up to the soda stream unit. \n\nIf you want to make something like coke/Pepsi than buying the little flavor mixes is expensive even at walmart. We do this for trying something new but if you have enough demand you can buy bulk syrup from coke/Pepsi, Costco/Sam's, or many small restaurants will order a case of syrup for you. The syrup will change flavor over time so either you need to use a lot or split the case with someone. A few neighbors I know have a system where they each buy a different flavor and split them among the houses. \n\nYou can also refill soda stream CO2 with a special adapter. However! Soda stream has made at least 6 different valves with various anti tamper systems and at least 2 are impossible to hack. If your valve has a pin sticking up you can refill it but a little flat disc is not easy to refill and a flat disc depressed into a hex shaped hole is impossible. \n\nRefilling soda stream or soda club cylinders is illegal. In fact you don't own the cylinder! Understand that you own only the machine, the cylinder is being loaned to you by the manufacture and their label clearly dictates this. That is why i recommend empties be put back in the box and your system be attached to an aftermarket large volume cylinder via a hose. \n\nCo2 inside these cylinders is liquid and at a very cold temperature. Injury or death can occur when messing with compressed gas or cryogenic liquid under pressure, modifying valves or other gas handling equipment, and attempting to refill these things. You can over fill a co2 cylinder and have a bad day, the liquid rating in weight of CO2 is only about 60% of the volume inside so the gas has some place to go.

But think about that.  You could fit like 10-20 books in one cubic foot! \n\nThen there is a long term storage fee which is much much higher.  Don't recall exact numbers though, but it only applies if you have multiple of the same item in the wearhouse for like more than 6 months or something. \n\nHonestly, the storage fees,  the standard ones at least are nothing to worry about .  I personally LOVE FBA I travel a lot so being able to outsource shipping is ideal,  it also increases my potential sales because I am not limited by my shipping capacity.

{"id":"cs59djg","author":"johnjmart","body":"I think the Amazon card works well. It gives back 3% on every Amazon purchase, 2% on gas, and 1% on everything else. Tried Discover, but they make it way to complicated. For instance, right now they're giving 5% back on restaurants, but sometimes a restaurant is not a restaurant, according to them, and there doesn't seem to be a way to see if a restaurant qualifies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe $25 I get back from Amazon per month is probably a low estimate. Last month I got $50 back. I'd rather get a guaranteed amount back on my credit card spending, with a rewards system that is easy to understand, than to try to figure out a more complicated card. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI forgot to mention that I do keep other credit card offers in mind as well.

When you hit $10, you start to get really flimsy headphones.\n\nAlthough I have an iPhone, I like to use the $15-$17 Sony ear buds - black. You can find them anywhere. They are rolled up in a round, plastic container.\n\nAt the moment, I am using yellow Skull Candy headphones. They were $15 (50% off at store).\n\nRefurb is a good way to go online. Customer returns. Amazon or eBay. The package is open, but the items are just fine. \n\nI prefer in-ear headphones, because of my walks and running. But if you want near-indestructable headphones, I'd suggest Apple iPhone earphones. Mine took years of abuse (snagging, mainly) before they failed. I was always shocked that they kept working. \n\nAnyway, the moral of the story is to not go too low.

{"id":"cs5z7lt","author":"yournamemeansdick","body":"I'm tossing this account after today, so disregard username, not directed at you.\n\nTai does come across as an intellectual. He does a solid job on appearance.\n\nThe first video of the 67 steps he spends to disarm anyone who was alarmed by the website's structure. When one signs up, the website offers you several other products and these can be a few hundred dollars each. These set off flags for me, even though you can say \"no thanks\" it asks you if you are certain.\n\nThey want your cell number. They will continue to send texts unless you opt out of texts. They've not otherwise used my cell and I'm not yet receiving unwarranted communications. I didn't give them a photo. I canceled the recurring billing day 1-5 for VIP mentor and have not yet seen any attempted charges since notice that step 30 has unlocked for me, but my bank also sent me a new card after taking several days on processing the initial $67 payment out of concern of potential fraudulent activity. I have a hunch, but no proof, that it was this charge that triggered it. I rarely buy online outside of Paypal or Amazon, and this is the first time I have that resulted in my bank's concern shortly thereafter.\n\nBack to the first vid, he claims a refund and/or scholarship option. He conveys his intentions for the program, etc. He also makes a remark to not do it to be cheap. This is where he also deploys some hooks. Apparently he believes there are people who drop the steps because, \"people only see value in what they pay money for.\" That's BS. Things can be gifts, costing you nothing, and have value to you. You can spend hours making something, and it will have value if you decide to value it for the effort put in. Same with free education programs, etc -if you value the topic you will pursue it even if it doesn't cost you money -because it sure as hell costs you in your time and focus.\n\nAbout video 9, IIRC, he tries to expose how you can be a sucker. The email and basis really cause a sock, and I wouldn't be surprised if this knocked a good deal of individusals off the program.\n\nI went a few more, but between how he talks, in his tone and choice of verbalization, to his examples and analogies, I don't feel he is worth it simply based on how much of his fluff and formulated talk you have to cut trough to try to get something from it. He has a method of going about books the makes him come across as impatient. He just skims for what he's looking for and seems to believe that he isn't overlooking anything -yet he doesn't spare his viewers from his fluff, the stuff he skims through as holding no value, to present you with golden morsels. I don't doubt he's gone through countless books, but he seems to have not put the effort to polish his program before charging for it. Maybe that will change, but right now it is not worth the time for me.\n\nSelf help, motivational, business, and rehabilitation books can be found free or cheap in eBook format. They are the types of books that Tai talks about. The 100 Day Promise by Sandi Amorim was free, now 2.99 on kindle. I read that, and it contains insight on how to not sabotage your efforts towards betterment -something she says she had overlooked from her previous work. The book gives a structure a person can follow to get himself/herself out of a rut that is caused by disorganization of one's life. It is simply a regurgitation of things that should be no brainers, but profound, in a very quick read book that has far more far reaching and immediate application than sitting through 67 days of Tai's chatter. It is cheap enough that anyone could scrape up the $3 that it now is and get themselves to better days. She does pitch her service, but it is only assistance with the outline she gives vs the \"I hold the remaining part of the map and it'll cost you\" types one is more used to hearing from oil dealers. If Tai was charging $10 or $15 there would be less complaints than there are, because it costs too many freedom units for the effort he put into them.\n\nWe live in the information age. Information is being given away for free on a minute basis out here. If you know what you are looking for, you will find it the vast majority of the time -or find that what you are looking for is available for you to become the source to get it from. (Couldn't find X item, information on Y thing or idea, an alaogy or point of view on Z that really makes ELI5 sense).\n","name":"t1_cs5z7lt","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-14 08:47:19","week":24}

{"id":"cs6cd43","author":"mzlipppy","body":"I've been doing the same thing within the past year as well. \n\nI often shop at the thrift stores in wealthier neighborhoods. I find brand new (with tags) clothing from J. Crew all the time.  \n\nI also try to buy dresses or jumpsuits, because then it's an entire outfit for one price. Zara has really nice professional looking jumpsuits and conservative dresses for a decent price. The quality is there. I would definitely suggest avoiding Forever 21 (\"cheap girl clothing\"). You will NOT get your money's worth. It's tempting because of how on trend everything is for so SO cheap, but it's HORRIBLY made. I've completely sworn off that garbage. \n\nShoes I buy on sale from DSW, Nordstrom Rack, Marshalls, etc or you can get really lucky on Amazon too. I bought a pair of Sam Edelman booties for 40 dollars compared to the 130+ they typically are in stores, on Amazon. \n\nTJ Max and Marshalls are great for affordable business wear too!\n\nAlso, have you thought about going through and reselling some of your older clothing? This can help clear space, help to focus the style you're trying to achieve, and give you some extra money to put towards new outfits or anything else.","name":"t1_cs6cd43","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-06-14 20:08:10","week":24}

But look it up first.\n\nThey also make DVR devices that aren't connected to any provider, but you may be spending $300+ dollars for a piece of equipment for one show. If this show is this important to you, maybe buy the episodes on iTunes/Amazon as they come out.

{"id":"cs6hgdt","author":"pulik","body":"If done right, you can make a lot of money with Amazon. I have made $80k in the last 2 years and almost $100k in the last 3 years. That is in straight earnings. I got really lucky early on and built a couple dozen sites from the ground up. I would say 60% of those earnings is from just two sites I have. One is a blog that is updated 4-5 times a year and the other is a single page site.
