{"id":"4kmek1","author":"tlahpalli","body":"I am unemployed after tax season ended.  Last year, I had a lot of time to dink around online and found Reddit and many subreddits about income opportunities.\n\nr/beermoney was the main one I found all sorts of crazy, though sometimes successful ways to make money with little to no work.  It has since turned into a massive list I created, and my own use of it brings in over $200/month passively, and even more when I put in effort and time.\n\nI don't do Mechanic Turks, and I just read that post earlier.  So my question for personal finance is:\n\nWhat would be the best way to make the money I make passively worth more?  Do I invest it?  Do I add it to building up my retirement?  Do I use it as my fun money to buy toys, comics, etc?\n\nI have used the Amazon gift cards for essentials, as well as buying a brand new car seat, laptop, and my Nexus 6 (which is the current phone I use for the passive income apps).  What should I be doing with that gift card money?  I mean, I have Amazon Prime, so free shipping and good deals on things.  Is ordering toiletries and hygiene stuff the best way to use the gift cards?\n\nI am in my early 30's, married, two kids, living in the US.  We have two cars (both have loans on them), two debts that are in collections (I pay $25/month on the $10,000 debt, and $100/month on the $30,000 debt), student loans that are accruing a little interest, but not asking for payments yet, we live in section 8 housing so no rent at this time until I start work again (possibly in a few months).\n\nIf I am missing any information, let me know.  I am willing to provide more info if that helps in figuring out how to make the passive income and future earned income worth more and do more.","name":"t3_4kmek1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-23 07:08:57","week":21}

I will absolutely be taking one of these jobs but I am having a hard time deciding which I want to take.  \n\nJob A (Amazon):\nIs offering ~135k with stock options (Standard back loaded 4 year vest)\nThe title is a promotion as well\n\nJob B (Google):\nThey are matching my Amazon offer\nThe work is the same as what I am doing now, but is a lateral move.\n\nI currently live in Seattle (Born and raised).  So for Amazon I wouldn't have to move and the cost of living is much cheaper.  Google's job requires I relocate to Mountain View which has a much higher cost of living, plus income tax for California.\n\nI hear Amazon is known as a meat grinder, especially for the work org I would be going into, while Google tends to be a lot better culture wise.  Both places I'm told once I am in, it is pretty easy to move around if I start losing interest in the work and I am a good worker.\n\nSo, any advice on deciding?  I have no kids, not married, have a girlfriend who I've been dating for a while who is supporting either decision.  I know the Google gig would be less pay in short term, but from what I hear it is a much better company to work for.","name":"t3_4kop4v","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-23 18:11:05","week":21}

Very niche of course. \n\n\nI created a website and started selling it because i wanted to test the waters.\n\n\nFrom initial testing and with no advertising to speak of, I have managed to sell a few thousand dollars worth, mostly to US customers. Now even restaurants are contacting me because they want to buy in bulk to incorporate it into their recipes.\n\n\nHow should I progress from here? The japanese company has shown interest in speaking with me to work out a deal. I intend to ask for better pricing and exclusive rights to sell outside japan.\n\n\nFor the US side, i'm kinda lost.

Plus i suck at mkting and social media(hate it).\n\n\nWould Amazon be a viable solution? How hard would it be to have a food item listed on Amazon? The only ingredient is literally seaweed.

{"id":"4ktor3","author":"MarvinOltmans","body":"Hey there,\n\nI like to keep it short and straight-to-the-point. I've seen several posts concerning company names, and that's why I feel that there's a need for some general guidelines to keep everyone on track.\n\n**1.1. Don’t Infringe**\n\nBefore you start spending money on business cards, make sure the name is not already in use! Be aware that if the name is very close to another company’s, you’re going to have trouble registering it.\n\nOne of the most important things to be aware of is the competition in your industry. When registering catchy business names, you cannot create confusion for the customer. If the name is deemed too similar to a competitor, then you won’t be able to use it.\n\n**1.2. Trademarks**\n\nTrademark infringement carries a very steep penalty and is not looked upon lightly by the courts. Before selecting a name, you need to conduct extensive research to ensure it hasn’t been trademarked by another company.\n\n**1.3. Family Names**\n\nUnless your surname has a well-known heritage, you probably don’t want to use it for a company brand – especially if it isn’t synonymous with your services or products.\n\n**1.4. Keep It Simple**\n\nIf the name is hard to pronounce or spell, your customers will struggle to remember or share it. This could also be problematic when they are trying to find your website or online directory listing. While people “read” could read you company name well, they don’t always “hear” it well, and a good name should work both visually and orally. \n\nFor example, if you heard the name Spotify without seeing the word written out, would you be able to spell it? Most probably would. However if you were asked to spell the name Saucony (pronounced SOCK-a-nee) without ever seeing it, you’d probably find the task challenging. This poses a problem when it comes to customers searching for products online or sharing names with friends.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with spelling, but your brand name needs to be easy to pronounce. Take, Guerlain for example. Most people pronounce the brand name “Grrr-lane,” when it’s in fact “Gher-lahn.” How awful would it be to have a brand name that nobody can correctly pronounce? You don’t want to go down that road.\n\n**1.5. Spell It Out**\n\nThe use of hyphens, acronyms and initials may seem like a good idea, but in the long run it might be confusing. Unless it is especially brilliant, such as MADD (mothers against drunk drivers), it’s best to resist the temptation.\n\n**1.6. Grab The Domain**\n\nYour domain name should match your business name as closely as possible. Check with an online domain registrar. If the .com or .co.uk domain is taken, choose another name – otherwise you could lose business to a competitor, or lose a confused client. Don’t opt for the ‘lesser’ extensions (.NET, .biz, .me, etc.) as they are not considered prime property.\n\n**1.7. Search Online For Your Shortlist of Names**\n\nMake sure that when you type search terms for your business like “Charlie Custard” “Greeting Cards” that none of your competitors appear (in the UK and internationally), no dodgy brands or links come up – you’d be surprised what does – and there are no products or services belonging to other people which have the name you have chosen.\n\n**1.8. Pick A Name They Won’t Forget**\n\nMost business owners want a company name that will be so good people won’t forget it. There is so much competition out there, a company name can be a great way to stand out. What is it about your company name and brand experience they will remember?\n\n**1.9. Normal Words**\n\nOdd names are distracting and confusing. Use normal words, this creates a clear visual association of what the product is, like Dropbox, Banjo, Rent the Runway, Secret, Mailbox—you know, actual words. Choose a word that only means one thing, like Apple and Amazon. It's a real word, it's easy to pronounce, it's recognizable, and it's short.\n\nHowever, if you choose for a quirky name, make sure it is also somewhat related to what they're doing. In other words, your name shouldn’t be bizarre and convey the mission of a business in a wrong way. For example, Snapchat (an app for chatting), Evernote (a to-do list) and Pinterest (a place to pin images).\n\n**1.10. One-Word Names**\n\nWhile it’s hard to find an available one these days, one-word brand names are always ideal. They’re easy to remember, strong, and relatable. If you think about some of the most successful and recognizable businesses in the world—Target, Amazon, Apple, etc.—they all have one-word names.\n\nSometimes you have to invent these words—i.e. Twitter, Google, Starbucks, etc.—but the effect is still the same. Two words is acceptable when one word is not an option, but avoid going with three or more words if at all possible. Long names complicate everything from domain selection to future product packaging.\n\n**1.11. Consider Future Growth**\n\nThink about the future growth of your company. While you may specialize in a certain product right now, you don’t want to limit your company to only selling that product. The wrong brand name can seriously hamper your ability to scale in the years to come.\nFor example, let’s say your start-up sells cat food. Using the brand name “Cat Food Incorporated” doesn’t give you much room to expand into, say, dog food in the future. However, if you went with the brand name “Healthy Pets Incorporated,” you have room to expand food and product lines.\n\n**1.12. Unique**\n\nUniqueness is also key when it comes to a new business name. The name should always be completely different from the names of other companies, especially those selling similar products. \nThis will prevent consumers from confusing the brands. Also, if a consumer has a problem, there is a chance that this consumer could mistakenly make the complaint to the wrong company, solely because of the name confusion.\n\nThanks for your time, feel free to give your opinion about this subject :)","name":"t3_4ktor3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-24 15:09:46","week":21}

{"id":"4kw0l2","author":"Swinehoof","body":"Hello everyone!\n\nMy mom owns her own small business in which she makes many many wooden rustic signs (like so :http://imgur.com/6YS3685). I am back from college for the summer and instead of helping her in the shop like usual she wants me to essentially start and operate her business on Amazon.\n\nShe has been in business for almost 20 years, and she mainly sells wholesale to gift shops and boutiques. We can mass produce our signs, some up to 500 a week. They are completely handmade, starting from raw lumber and ending up looking something like the one in the picture. \n\nThe problem I am running into is listing her products. We don't have SKU's or really any official codes of any sort. Each sign has an ID number, but these were assigned by her to keep organized. Now a lot of people might think that Amazon handmade is the way to go, but I am not so sure. \n\nBelow I will be more specific with my questions, and any answers I can get for any of these questions will be helpful.\n\n1.) When someone searches for a product, and someone's product who is technically an \"Amazon handmade artisan\" or w/e meets that search, will they see the product along with the non-handmade options that fit that search? We are worried we will be bottle necking our sales by going handmade if it is essentially a different platform. \n\n2.) Can anyone help explain Brand registration? On the Amazon support it says Brand registration is for seller-manufactured items (along with other items, of course, but this is what we fit into). Do I have to register a brand for each product? \n\nI am just very stressed and confused about all of this. Quite frankly I would rather be in the shop mindlessly using a power sander, but this is more important. \n\nTL;DR - handmade products without official codes, want to sell on Amazon but don't know which route to take. \n\nAny and all advice is helpful and much appreciated, even if it doesn't specifically answer anything here.

{"id":"4l0dk1","author":"irestful","body":"Hello.\n\nMy name is Steve Rodrigue.  I'm a software developer from the south shore of Montreal and  I've been programming web applications commercially for the last 12 years.\nOver those years, I've occupied different roles, including: software developer, team leader, software architect and IT director.  It would have been easy for me to\nwork in a corporate environment.  However, I chose a different path; I decided to start my own company because I believe there is a problem in software\ndevelopment and I want to fix it.  I believe that inequality will increase in America if we continue to use and develop technology like we currently do.\n\n**What is the problem?**\n\nIn the past 30 years, technology evolved greatly, specially the internet.  In the beginning, the world wide web was an awesome place where everyone could create\na decentralized website and publish their views and opinions.  Businesses used their decentralized website to sell goods and services online.  Then, they\nbegan to use online web applications to share informations with their employees and customers.  Lately, they have been building their online offerings on top\nof third party platforms where they pay a monthly fee to use.  In the past, software companies were building open source or private software that they were self-hosting on their own servers.  They had to pay maintenance fees\nin order to assure that their software would stay updated, without any guarantee that the company doing the maintenance was doing it properly.  For that reason,\nplatforms began to be very popular among small business owners.  They could simply develop their website on top of that platform without paying anyone to update\nand maintain it.  However, they are paying a much bigger price.  They are locked in.\n\n**Can you explain?**\n\nIf you buy a house from a contractor and, after a few years, something breaks, you have the ability to hire anyone of your choice\nto do the repairs.  You don't explicitly need to use that same exact contractor.  If you were obligated to use his services, he would probably increase his\nprices and decrease the quality of his services because he would have zero competition.\n\nThis is exactly what's happening in the software industry with proprietary platforms.  Small businesses are renting accesses to platforms to classify their own\ninformation and automate their own processes.  Each month, they pay fees for various platforms accesses where they willingly put their private corporate\ninformation.  They then hire someone to build their website property on top of those platform APIs.  If something breaks in one of the platform API, they can\nonly communicate with 1 company to fix the problem.  If a platform goes out of business, their own website will break because they can't easily replace the\nprocesses that was managed by the proprietary platform.  If the proprietary platform decides to increase his prices, the small business will have the choice\nof modifying his own website and stop using that platform, or simply accept the higher charges.  Obviously, when a company invest hundreds of thousand of dollars\nin development, they won't want to abandon their investment, so they'll just accept the price increase and therefore, increase their own product and service\nprices, making their own customer pay more.\n\n**Can it be worse?**\n\nSometimes, some proprietary platforms also decide to use your own data against you.  Imagine a startup in the taxi industry that needs a map platform to show\ncars to customers.  That map platform would be able to record all the customer's patterns in the taxi industry.  That map platform would then be able to take\nthat data and build a competitor to the taxi startup without doing any experimental research, right?  Well, unfortunately, this is a true story.  I'm sure\nI don't have to give specifics for everyone to recognize the actors in this scenario.  Overall, the monthly platform expenses and the mandatory data share makes it\nvery hard for an entrepreneur to bootstrap a competitive company, grow it and keep it competitive enough to not suffer disruption from a funded platform.\n\n**So... get funded?**\n\nYou might think that entrepreneurs should focus on starting companies that gets funded by investors.  They have money to build their own technical\nstack.  They can even separate their technical stack into separate platform products and then sell them to other companies, like Amazon and Google are doing\nwith their cloud offerings.  However, to get investor's money, entrepreneurs need to build a scalable company that will make billion of dollars in revenues\ndown the road.  For this reason, they build platforms that will disrupt markets that are currently served by smaller non-funded companies, all over the globe.\n\n**Why is that a problem?**\n\nBy being more advanced technologically, funded companies can increase their return on investment.  Customers then buy their products and services from\nthese funded companies because they are cheaper.  As a result, small businesses go bankrupt and close shop.  The funded companies can now force their distributors\nto decrease their prices because there is no more competition in that niche.  The funded companies can then make a lot of profit and pay back its investors\nor keep the money in their bank account.  So, the profits are no longer spent in local communities, it is taken from them and then accumulated in central\nplaces, like offshore investments, where almost no tax are paid... according to the Panama Papers.  Then, founders of these big platforms begin to invest in smaller companies, which makes the wheel turn.  I believe this need to stop.  I believe\nwe need to build more open source software to make businesses competitive against large platforms.  That way, entrepreneurs could bootstrap companies\nusing automation right away.  They would need less staff, increase their return on investment and offer better product and\nservices to their local community.  They could communicate with other similar businesses that serve other local communities and order in\nbulk with them, to make the same effect as a platform buying in bulk from a distributor.  Platforms would then have less free data to work with and it would\nbe harder for them to disrupt markets that already have good prices, with good services.  In such a scenario, customers are happy to pay a small price for\ntheir products and services, entrepreneurs make more money and work less and the government gets properly paid from taxes.  In that scenario, the only loser is\nthe investors that can no longer invest in a disruptive platform company and hide his profits in offshore investments.  Again, according to the Panama Papers.\n\n**What is your vision?**\n\nI personally want to live in a world where local communities are strong; where everyone gets well paid without working too much.  For this reason, I wanted to\ndedicate my company in creating open source software that specially help small entrepreneurs.  I already created a lot of development tools to speed up my\ndevelopment process.  I now need to create industry specific software to enable each industry to automate their processes and create their marketing efficiently\nwithout spending maintenance fees to update and maintain the software, while keeping their private corporate data.   However, I need funding to continue my\noperations.  Obviously, I can't rely on investors to get funded properly.  So, I want to work with my customers: the small entrepreneurs.  If you are an\nentrepreneur that share my vision, please [contribute to the project](http://irestful.com/contributions/).  By contributing, I'll build the features your company need in the open source software\nwe are developing.  Your company will also be advertised as official sponsors.  We want to build open source software that will help small entrepreneurs\ncompete against large funded corporations that disrupt local communities.\n\n**Donations are not sustainable!**\n\nOn the long run, when we'll have stable open source software built and when million of companies will use them daily, we will charge web development\nand web hosting companies that want to be technically trained on our open source products.  Then we will promote their services on our website, encouraging local\npeople to work with an accredited local professional. That way, we will become self-sufficient, without having to disrupt local communities to scale.\n\n**How can I help?**\n\nIf you share the ideas in this video, please consider [making a contribution](http://irestful.com/contributions/).

Some push through and get their business off the ground but - and I think these are most - never get that far and a perfectly good business idea just gets put aside and never gets a chance to \"live\". \n\nWhy? When you start off, you should make a budget, build a website, have a cookie policy, terms and conditions, do marketing, blog at least once a week, suck blog ideas out of thin air, reach out to fellow bloggers, get guest-posts, do SEO, build a ten stage email automation thingie, get your product packaged, set up Amazon to sell it through them, analyze the market and figure out who the competitors are and what they do right and wrong. \n\nIf you're just starting out trying to sell Do-Hickies I can really understand why it's just too much. Not to mention that you've got a full-time job next to raising a family.\n\nFinally, all the advice I get on the internet about SEO, websites, marketing etc. is all centered around industries that just don't resonate with my wannabe Do-Hickie Empire.\n\nWouldn't it be great to have someone who could guide you through the maze, kick your butt when needed and help you get the stone rolling so you can then continue yourself when you have learnt enough?","name":"t3_4l5cev","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-05-26 15:40:57","week":21}

{"id":"4l6g1p","author":"rawrtherapy","body":"I'm not going to put out what Online Stores i help manage but im sure if you look in my recent posts you'd be able to find out.\n\nAfter working with Amazon and Ebay through our online store pretty heavily for the last couple months I have realized one of many things for ranking higher and how to exactly do this.\n\nLets stick with eBay for now and then go onto Amazon a little bit later. Although there is a post on r/entrepreneur that has an amazing amount of advice in it. But its about that guy that did a case study of like 500k products through Amazon. anyways lets get to what we came here for shall we.\n\nRanking higher on eBay. Over these past months what Ive noticed is how to rank higher on eBay pretty organically over the course of about a week or two, and sometimes even immediately. Here are the top things that Google and eBay's Cassini search engine takes into consideration for your listings.\n\n1. **Your Category:** Your category is one of if not THE FIRST thing Google picks up when someone is looking for that particular something. I have researched this and I am 100% positive if you are not in the RIGHT Category you are not going to sell well or even show up to google or eBay's Cassini search engine.\n\n2. **Obviously, your title.** Your title is a HUGE part of the Cassini Search Engines ranking system, but not how you think. I've noticed the most important couple words (depending on how long they are of course) are the first 3 words and last 3. Something about the middle that the Cassini Search engine doesn't really take into about being your MAIN KEYWORDS. So remember, focus on those last 3 and first 3 keywords.\n\n3. **Your Reviews!** I cant begin to explain how important these are. Your reviews on eBay MATTER! And im not talking about your seller feedback. I am talking about your product star reviews! Get those up! One little trick i do is i offer the \"BEST OFFER\" option on our top 20 products and whenever someone \"makes an offer\"\ni tell them \"I can give you this item for 18.49 OR i can drop it down to 17.99 if you agree to leave an honest review\", 90% of the time they agree. I've taken our items that had one or two or no reviews at all to over 30 in just the course of about a month or two. Reviews are king! They give potential customers the extra push in trust they need to buy your product.\n\n4. **Using your competitions titles to support you:** If youre familiar with HTML you know that when you are adding a picture on ebay you have your \"ALT=\" code.\nLook at the top ranking products in your niche and use their titles to give yourself a little boost in rankings. Because you now have their keywords and title supporting you in the backend where nobody can see them its not public and it works. A little sneaky, but it does the job,\n\n5. **Vacation settings:** As some of you know, eBay USED to have RSS feeds that you were able to turn off an on as you desired. Not anymore. What the turning on and off of the RSS Feeds did is you give you a refresh with all the outside search engines like Google, Bing, Mozilla etc and gave you a slight bump in their rankings (because search engines love fresh new content). But now the RSS Feeds have been removed from eBay from sometime now, but what i found that works pretty much exactly the same is by changing your store into its \"Vacation setting\" It does some sort of REFRESH to all of your listings and gives you a bump in ranking for both ebay and all outside search engines (still dont know why this happens but it works) try using this when youre going to sleep and turn it on again after you wake up. I found that its best if you leave the vacation settings on for about 6 hours.\n\n6. **Staying active in your listings:** I found that we have more sales whenever i am more active on our listings than when we are not! Oh you just changed that picture, a little bit of the description and changed one word from the title? Here, take this bump in ranking for a little bit and get a couple more sales. There have been way too many coincidences where am i working on a specific listing only to update it and a minute or two later have a sale for it. Its just not a coincidence when it happens this often.\n\n7. **All of ebays \"extra\" stuff is bogus.** EXCEPT for that secondary title. I was surprised to realize that your secondary title actually shows up in google, believe it or not. So i you have some extra keywords, throw them in your secondary title and see if they work for you.\n\n8. **Variations:** The Cassini engine LOVES variations lets get that out of the way first. We've found that a lot of our products do a lot better with variations on them then with not so remember if youre selling different colored iPhones dont make 3 listings selling the different colors, use one listings selling 3 of the same thing.\n\n9. **Photos honestly dont matter** as its been sort of disappointing to find this out. eBay gives you a maximum of 12 photos that you can use, but I've seen items with only 3 photos (pretty crappy pictures i might add) on the #1 spot of a certain search. So dont worry about that too much.\n\n10. **The first sentence of your description is pretty key.** Google also ranks this when looking for your product so make sure you have your keywords in the very first sentence of your description.\n\nThats honestly all i can think about for now but im sure there is a bunch more than that that i cant think of at the moment.\n\n**I've ranked more than 20 products to the number one spot using this these techniques and countless others to reach the number 2, 3 and 4 spots. There are even some categories that our products rank in every single space for the top ten.**\n\nIll edit this more as i think about more stuff but hopefully my next post will be about Amazon and I'll bring in our Amazon specialist guy for that.\n\nBut yeah guys thats about it for now, have a great day r/entrepreneur!","name":"t3_4l6g1p","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-26 19:29:00","week":21}

I admit I know nothing about options and should likely research this before asking, but if any of you have an answer you're willing to share I would be appreciative.  \n\nMy strategy involves setting stop-limit buy and short-sell orders a certain percentage above and below the close price of a stock that is reporting earnings after hours.

Naturally, trading stocks after hours is tricky due to a lack of liquidity and erratic price movement, but I only deal with major stocks that have a history of predictably big moves with lots of volume (GOOG, AMZN, FB, AAPL, etc).\n\nI understand trading options is smarter than trading stocks most of the time and I'm wondering if you fine ladies and gentlemen might know of how I could replicate my strategy using options instead of stocks?\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions and thank you in advance for any help you might want to provide.\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_4l88o2","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2016-05-27 01:59:31","week":21}
{"id":"4l9avz","author":"rawrtherapy","body":"I'm not going to put out what Online Stores i help manage but im sure if you look in my recent posts you'd be able to find out.\n\n\nAfter working with Amazon and Ebay through our online store pretty heavily for the last couple months I have realized one of many things for ranking higher and how to exactly do this.\n\n\nLets stick with eBay for now and then go onto Amazon a little bit later. Although there is a post on r/entrepreneur that has an amazing amount of advice in it. But its about that guy that did a case study of like 500k products through Amazon. anyways lets get to what we came here for shall we.\n\n\nRanking higher on eBay. Over these past months what Ive noticed is how to rank higher on eBay pretty organically over the course of about a week or two, and sometimes even immediately. Here are the top things that Google and eBay's Cassini search engine takes into consideration for your listings.\n\n\nYour Category: Your category is one of if not THE FIRST thing Google picks up when someone is looking for that particular something. I have researched this and I am 100% positive if you are not in the RIGHT Category you are not going to sell well or even show up to google or eBay's Cassini search engine.\n\n\nObviously, your title. Your title is a HUGE part of the Cassini Search Engines ranking system, but not how you think. I've noticed the most important couple words (depending on how long they are of course) are the first 3 words and last 3. Something about the middle that the Cassini Search engine doesn't really take into about being your MAIN KEYWORDS. So remember, focus on those last 3 and first 3 keywords.\n\n\nYour Reviews! I cant begin to explain how important these are. Your reviews on eBay MATTER! And im not talking about your seller feedback. I am talking about your product star reviews! Get those up! One little trick i do is i offer the \"BEST OFFER\" option on our top 20 products and whenever someone \"makes an offer\" i tell them \"I can give you this item for 18.49 OR i can drop it down to 17.99 if you agree to leave an honest review\", 90% of the time they agree. I've taken our items that had one or two or no reviews at all to over 30 in just the course of about a month or two. Reviews are king! They give potential customers the extra push in trust they need to buy your product.\n\n\nUsing your competitions titles to support you: If youre familiar with HTML you know that when you are adding a picture on ebay you have your \"ALT=\" code. Look at the top ranking products in your niche and use their titles to give yourself a little boost in rankings. Because you now have their keywords and title supporting you in the backend where nobody can see them its not public and it works. A little sneaky, but it does the job.\n\n\nVacation settings: As some of you know, eBay USED to have RSS feeds that you were able to turn off an on as you desired. Not anymore. What the turning on and off of the RSS Feeds did is you give you a refresh with all the outside search engines like Google, Bing, Mozilla etc and gave you a slight bump in their rankings (because search engines love fresh new content). But now the RSS Feeds have been removed from eBay from sometime now, but what i found that works pretty much exactly the same is by changing your store into its \"Vacation setting\" It does some sort of REFRESH to all of your listings and gives you a bump in ranking for both ebay and all outside search engines (still dont know why this happens but it works) try using this when youre going to sleep and turn it on again after you wake up. I found that its best if you leave the vacation settings on for about 6 hours.\n\n\nStaying active in your listings: I found that we have more sales whenever i am more active on our listings than when we are not! Oh you just changed that picture, a little bit of the description and changed one word from the title? Here, take this bump in ranking for a little bit and get a couple more sales. There have been way too many coincidences where am i working on a specific listing only to update it and a minute or two later have a sale for it. Its just not a coincidence when it happens this often.\n\n\nAll of ebays \"extra\" stuff is bogus. EXCEPT for that secondary title. I was surprised to realize that your secondary title actually shows up in google, believe it or not. So i you have some extra keywords, throw them in your secondary title and see if they work for you.\n\n\nVariations: The Cassini engine LOVES variations lets get that out of the way first. We've found that a lot of our products do a lot better with variations on them then with not so remember if youre selling different colored iPhones dont make 3 listings selling the different colors, use one listings selling 3 of the same thing.\n\n\nPhotos honestly dont matter as its been sort of disappointing to find this out. eBay gives you a maximum of 12 photos that you can use, but I've seen items with only 3 photos (pretty crappy pictures i might add) on the #1 spot of a certain search. So dont worry about that too much.\n\n\nThe first sentence of your description is pretty key. Google also ranks this when looking for your product so make sure you have your keywords in the very first sentence of your description.\n\n\nThats honestly all i can think about for now but im sure there is a bunch more than that that i cant think of at the moment.\n\n\nI've ranked more than 20 products to the number one spot using this these techniques and countless others to reach the number 2, 3 and 4 spots. There are even some categories that our products rank in every single space for the top ten.\n\n\nIll edit this more as i think about more stuff but hopefully my next post will be about Amazon and I'll bring in our Amazon specialist guy for that.\nBut yeah guys thats about it for now, have a great day r/entrepreneur!","name":"t3_4l9avz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-27 07:09:29","week":21}

{"id":"4lbayl","author":"treblegiraffe","body":"I'm asking this on my girlfriend's behalf.  Her job recently changed their bonus program.  Previously the employees used to receive extra money on their paycheck if they met certain criteria, between $100-300.  Now the bonus system has changed, and when they qualify for a bonus, they receive \"points.\"  The points can be redeemed for any number of things, including actual physical merchandise or gift cards to common retailers.  However, from what I understand from her, the bonus is not being taxed -- it is presented as a 500 points bonus, and those 500 points can be redeemed for a $500 giftcard to Amazon, or whatever.  I'm concerned that the government will see this as compensation (which I feel it is) and go after her at the end of the year for unpaid taxes on the amount.  But since you can redeem the points for items I thought there might be some gray area here where they are standing.  I'm suspicious because the amount has increased quite a bit too (from $100-300 to 500 \"points\"), and that makes me think that the company has found some way to duck around the tax issue on their side.  So should she be saving a portion of her points for tax purposes?","name":"t3_4lbayl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-27 17:39:41","week":21}

I recieve the codes instantly to my email address and in my messages on the site. Paypal takes about a day.\n\nIf you get to Veteran status like myself or above then you get them instantly. Otherwise it's a 3 to 5 day wait.\n\nWhen you first join, your rank status is rookie and you get a 30% refer bonus; anyone who signs under you, you earn 30% of anything they make for the lifetime of the earner on the site.\n\nAfter your first redemption (minimum 500 points = $5) you will climb up 1 rank to junior.

These consist of sign ups and surveys mostly. Pays anywhere from 10 points to 200+ points per offer.\n\n* Premium Offers - These are offers you pay to complete and can use a credit card for.

Daily surveys, Your-surveys, Ampario, Research for good.\n\nThe best thing about the surveys is they hardly ever run out. You can try as many as you like all day every day. If you're lucky enough to reside in the USA and you are good at surveys then you'll likely see some research for good surveys paying $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, each. I've even seen some for $11.\n\nYour-Surveys have two sections- The Router section which pays $0.75 + whatever bonus you have regarding your rank on the site. Mine is $0.75 + $0.15. The other section is Called API and that contains surveys ranging anywhere from $0.50 to $5, sometimes more.\n\nOne guy on the site earned a $1000 Paypal Cashout and a $1000 Amazon gift code just through doing surveys. He wanted to build his own custom game machine. I think it's safe to say he done just that. His proof can be seen in the forums under 'look what I got' section.\n\nThat's another good part of the website, most people take a picture of what they have redeemed with a thank you note to R1 and upload it to the forums. There's also detailed posts from elite members of R1 explaining which offers are the best to do and how best to qualify for surveys.\n\nYou can also use the forums to set up your own shop. You can sell anything to members of R1 in exchange for either paypal or points. I have my own shop selling YouTube views - 1000 views for 150 points. Other members sell things such as gmail accounts, lifetime netflix accounts, outlook accounts, server spaces, HD referal video's, etc.\n\nMy name on the site is Rewarders1. I know, it's similar to the name of the actual site. I thought it would help me get refs when I first signed up. I'm requesting a name change soon.\n\n**Bad Things about R1**\n\n* Some people like to troll in the chat box and aren't very helpful to new members. \n\n* There are minor bugs on the site sometimes. \n\n* Some members have been known to try and con other people. Although there is a trade system in place now to help with this. You can rate each other after a trade.\n\n(Will be editing this post to add or delete stuff)\n\nThanks for reading.

{"id":"4li7dc","author":"Mynotredditaccount","body":"Hey Reddit! I've never posted in this sub, so forgive me if I don't know the proper etiquette. I constantly read posts from here for advice and inspiration.  This sub is amazingly helpful. I'm currently trying to save up enough money to move out of my dad's house. In the future, I would like to move out of state. Even more in the future, move out of the country lol but I digress.\n\nSo I have a little bit of a dilemma..\n\nA little backstory, I have terrible allergies (seasonal, and food. the anaphylaxis variety) So it's been very hard for me to find a job that I'm comfortable at. I've been bouncing around from (retail) job to job in search of a place I can thrive at with no luck. About a year ago, I decided that I would try to work from home on my own (by become self-employed), this year included me being a freelancer, I wrote articles, transcribed documents, and tutored. I even did people's college assignments for a small fee. My main income for about 6 months after that was MTurk (Amazon Mechanical Turk). \n\nAfter applying to hundreds of jobs,  I **finally** found a job where I get to work from home that I absolutely **love** (not retail). It's stable, my bosses and colleagues are friendly and welcoming. This job basically saved my life and allowed me to do all the things that I've been putting off (building up my credit, taking driving lessons so that I can eventually acquire my driver's licence) It's a low paying job ($9.35/hr), but full-time (30+ hours a week) with benefits. But I'm so happy to start work on Mondays, which I know is a rarity.\n\nI was informed of another job (retail) that I could also do from home, higher paying ($15.00/hr), full time (30 - 40 hours a week), plus \"perks\", not sure if benefits are offered. I just paid $40 for the background check and they already want to move to the 3rd step in the hiring process.. I may *actually* get hired.. and I'm filled with a very unsettling feeling. I have no clue what to do, I've considered trying to do both but I know it'll eventually drive me insane (and I *finally* got my anxiety under control)\n\nSo the question is, do I stay with the lower paying job that I love **OR** do I risk it all, and try the new job that I may not like?\n\n**I welcome any advice you have to offer, thanks for taking the time to read my situation!**\n","name":"t3_4li7dc","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-29 01:59:49","week":21}

{"id":"4lihmm","author":"bringtheloads","body":"Long story short, I'm flying over to a new city this summer for a 2-month summer internship. A lady reached out to me on Roomster regarding a room (sublet) she has available -- nice house, belonged to her late father, fully furnished, below average price. She included many pictures of the house and even two pictures of herself. Seems okay. She provided the place she works at as well, and I found her on Linkedin so that seems fine to me as well.\n\nBut there are some things that make me a bit uneasy:\n\n* Though spelling in her emails are fine, she doesn't leave any spaces after commas or periods. There are also some randomly capitalized words, but not too frequent. She makes a few grammar mistakes but not too often.\n* There were some things she repeated _many_ times in her emails, e.g. some details about herself, no pets, how she enjoys a glass of wine sometimes to relax after work.\n* Her Linkedin claims she went to two extremely prestigious universities in the US (undergrad and grad). Yet her emails tell me otherwise: not everything is gramatically correct (for someone who studied polisci at a top 10 then got her JD), can't use punctuation, weird indentations. \n* Initially she asked for a security deposit equal to the first month's rent _in the form of an Amazon gift card_ (weird). I asked her if that's the case, should I expect to be refunded cash or the gift card, since I wouldn't want the gift card. She seemed to completely change her mind in her reply, instead asking for a 'holding deposit' of $100 cash.\n* I have left my personal phone number in all my emails sent to her, and have brought up twice to her that it would be easier if we'd just talk on the phone. She hasn't called me yet, and seems to be ignoring the number provided.\n* Also, her current occupation has absolutely nothing to do with law, her JD, whatsoever. She's a front-end developer having listed a bunch of random technologies she's working with (I'm a developer as well and it sort of smells like bullshit), and her previous occupation was as a marketing intern. There was no time gap between her previous and current occupation, so I don't know where she could've gotten the proper schooling to be able to work with such a diverse set of tech skills.\n\nI'm writing a new message to her now, and my goal is to ask questions that would reveal whether she's trying to scam me of my holding deposit or not. I'm planning on asking for her driver's license (and providing mine in exchange). Is there anything else I can ask, or anything I can suggest in terms of the 'holding deposit' so that it's equally favorable to the both of us?\n","name":"t3_4lihmm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-29 03:21:27","week":21}

I'm stocked up on inventory for the rest of the year and I have a growth plan in place.\n\nThis post explains exactly how I got here, what tools i’m using, and what i’m planning on doing next. I urge you to keep the conversation productive, asking any questions you may have, big or small, and please keep the criticism polite. Suggestions and critiques are always welcome! \n\nFirst, a quick background:\n\n**Milestones in the Past 8 months**\n\n* [First Kickstarter Launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comfortableboxers/premium-boxer-briefs-ridiculous-comfort-at-a-fair) - $142k - July 2015\n* [Second Kickstarter Launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comfortableboxers/ultra-comfortable-mens-underwear-at-a-fair-price) - $219k - October 2015\n* [New Branding, Website, and Product Launch](https://comfortableclub.com/) - January 2016\n\n**The Refined Concept Behind Comfortable Club**\n\nWe started off naming the company The Comfortable Boxers Co.  It works well for SEO and gave it a nice unbranded feel to it, which resonated with those not willing to pay premiums. After striking the underwear market on a fairly significant level and with intentions of expanding our product line, a lot of thought went into a re-branding. In planning for monthly subscriptions services for our apparel, we’ve opted for a lifestyle brand with a primary focus on quality, comfort, and pricing. We arrived at [Comfortable Club.](https://comfortableclub.com) \n\nThe whole theme revolves around the idea that we shouldn’t have to overpay for premium apparel, so, quite realistically, the product line can expand into many areas. For now, though, we’re mainly focused on underwear, undershirts, and lounge products. \n\nOur name says it all. We make a premium line of obsessively engineered, ridiculously cozy underwear and lounge apparel – and deliver them at half the price of retail. Harry’s did it for razors. Casper did it for mattresses. Now, at Comfortable Club, we’re doing it for underwear and loungewear: building a great, premium brand that reflects the things that customers care about today: quality, cost, convenience and, of course, comfort. \n\n**Premium at a Fair Price**\n\nAn immediate reaction from some of you will be: \"Why would I pay $16 for a pair of underwear? I can buy X and Y for Z.\" My job since the very beginning was to convince customers why modal fabric is worth it, because your day absolutely changes when you're wearing these bad boys. Except this time, you won't be paying Calvin Klein or other brands over $35 for a pair. But I won't go into too much marketing lingo here, because the point of this post is to show you just how I managed to cut the price and built a sustainable business around the concept. Let's begin:\n\n**Bridging the Sourcing Gap**\n\nQuality underwear requires quality craft, so we partnered with the the best factory and fabric engineering experts we could find. The process was extremely long and patience was essential. First off, shy away from resellers and agents (aka Alibaba), do your research, find a sourcing partner, and go straight to the factory, the same ones used by high-end brands.\n\nOur relationships with the manufacturing plants are very close. So close, in fact, that during the peak manufacturing timeline we actually LIVE in the factory. This is part of our quality control program, which we’ll describe later. You see, the tricky part about sourcing is making sure you get a consistently high-quality product. Apart from a lack of organization, this is precisely the problem that plagues small businesses. Because small businesses usually don’t follow-up with recurring orders to the factory, the supplier is usually hands off once the product is on the boat. If you can establish a clear, long-term relationship, set your requirements up front, and have a presence in the process, you're set. \n\nWe learned this when sourcing metal sheet rolls for a multinational roofing company, so we opted for a closer relationship with the supplier. We established a permanent presence in Shanghai in partnership with a small sourcing office. This means we have feet on the ground in the factory, can supervise every step, and we establish our own quality control programs (at our expense of course).\n\n**Building Something Beautiful Through Manufacturing**\n\nEarly in our research (of which I also mean shopping around and trying everything out there), I learned there are three key factors that impact comfort: the stitching, fit, and fabrics. So in creating our underwear, we put a meticulous -- some might say, obsessive -- amount of attention into each of those areas.\n\nThe devil, as they say, is in the details, and when it comes to underwear, stitching is one that tends to get overlooked. We use a more robust, sturdier stitching in our products that make them last, while maintaining their comfort. But we shied away from traditional threads and opted for fluffy threads reserved only for the most luxurious winter apparel for a completely itch-free experience. Look closely at any pair of Comfortable Club undergarments, you can see the uniquely intricate, tight knit puffy stitch. \n\nWe opted for 92% modal fabric, an eco-friendly microfiber that enfolds the body in a light embrace. Modal is smooth, soft, and breathable, and its luscious texture feels similar to silk. It’s cool to the touch, super absorbent, and resistant to shrinkage and fading. In short, it’s the perfect microfiber fabric for body-hugging underwear.\n\nStitching, fit, fabrics. It’s a relatively simple formula, but the result is something pretty spectacular: underwear that looks great -- and feels even better.  \n\n**The Actual Manufacturing Process**\n\nHere’s a generalized model of the prototype and final manufacturing process for a new product:\n\n* Initial size, die-cut, stitching, waistband &amp; fabric specifications created\n* Textile production for prototypes\n* Dyeing process for prototypes\n* Prototype testing with real-world use\n* Revisions for prototypes\n* Revised prototypes created using same textile\n* Prototype testing under more scenarios\n* Sizing trials\n* Final exact manufacturing specifications created\n* Demand planning\n* Manufacturing order created\n* Quality control program created and programmed. Hiring process for quality control specialists begins.\n* Textile production - depending on the factory, this is done in-house or outsourced\n* Dyeing process\n* Waistband production\n* Quality control runs\n* Lab testing for fabric weight, color fastness, and shrinkage\n* Fabric cutting\n* Quality control runs\n* Revisions, if needed\n* Packaging specs created\n* Packaging order created\n* Stitching and crafting\n* Final quality control runs\n* Revisions, if needed\n* Ironing and folding\n* Packaging and labeling\n* Final check and count\n* Loading onto container\n* Freight shipping - FOB to door\n* Receiving at the warehouse\n\nPrototype as many times as you have to. Each round takes over a month of work, but the version you take to market has to be as perfect as possible. It's important to specify exact sizing guidelines and templates for every aspect of the product. Design specific packaging guidelines, including product tagging, warning messages on bags, SKU and UPC labels, and specify items per case. Color codes must be clearly stated. Fabric weight, fade, and shrinkage minimums and maximums be specified and tested. As an example, we raised our fabric weight to 190g/m2, and lowered our fade and shrinkage ceiling to 1%.\n\n**Quality Control**\n\nWhen you’re manufacturing thousands and thousands of items that involve a manual process, you can’t rely on a ‘set-and-forget’ attitude. Our quality control process involves actual third-party lab testing with SGS. We also send our own personnel to the factory.\n\nAfter finalizing the prototype phase and finalizing specs, we establish a strict defect-rate ceiling at 1% and randomly test up to 10% of the products to control for this. The sample size is large enough to be a good representation of the entire product. Of course, some defective items sneak through the cracks, but as long as you can keep it below 1%, you’re golden.\n\nTo reach this rate, however, we tripled our quality control staff and rejected every anomaly. We ended up rejecting a whole blue textile batch that led to a few delays.\n\n**Demand Planning**\n\nQuantities to produce depend highly on your demand model. With our initial Kickstarter campaign, we produced the amount pre-ordered on the campaign and at least an additional 50% for recurring orders. Problem is, we ran out of inventory within the first month! Lesson learned.\n\nFor our second Kickstarter campaign, we produced an additional 800% of total items spread out through 9 different product lines. For this reason, the transition into e-commerce was smoothly executed. Being out of stock is probably the most dangerous thing for your business.\n\nAs for quantities per size and color, black and gray are always the most popular ones by about 50% more than other colors. Sizing usually goes as follows:\n\n* S - 15%\n* M - 45%\n* L - 25%\n* XL - 10%\n* 2XL - 5%\n\nThis, of course, depends on your target market. But this model has done rather well for us so far. We also extended our offerings to include Lounge Pants, Undershirts, and a Women's Underwear line. The same model applies for all.\n\n**Presenting Your Product**\n\nIn presenting our product to the world, we could’ve opted for any local model and called it a day. we also could’ve sent our products over to a photographer that specializes in this type of photography. We truly believe we wouldn’t be here, telling you our story, if we had done this. \n\nWe instead researched the LA market for the best models we could find. They did cost us quite a bit, but the results speak for themselves. We personally flew to California, brought our own trustworthy photographer with us, rented a beautiful house on Airbnb, got some studio space, and ran the whole photoshoot ourselves. \n\nFor any product you sell online, you’ll need to create lifestyle images, e-commerce images, and product images. The theme around the lifestyle images depend on how you want your brand to be perceived.\n\nAs for [retail packaging,](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Comfortable_Club_Packaging-10.jpg?6884464036085610274) these were created as a showcase and ‘show off’ concept. More on that later.\n\n**Optimize Your Storefront**\n\nThe [Comfortable Club](https://comfortableclub.com) shopping experience starts the minute customers hit our website. The landing page says exactly what we do and transitions into our whole product catalogue. For this and many other reasons, we’ve built and designed the site for unlimited growth potential and scalability using Shopify’s excellent platform. \n\nOptimized for conversion? You bet it is. We’ve removed tiny roadblocks that shave off seconds from the shopping experience, like custom developed color and size swatches instead of drop down menus, as well as plus and minus selectors instead of a number input form. [Every little improvement counts.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Buybox.jpg?4437860519955730119)\n\nWe’ve also made the navigation menu sticky and always visible for easy browsing. On top of that, the mega nav menu (the pop-up that shows up after hovering over SHOP) helps customers understand how our products are categorized and allows for easy browsing at any time, regardless of which page you’re on.\n\nThe website is always a work in progress. We’re constantly fixing tiny bit that improve the experience ever so lightly. After-all, it's all a numbers and psychology game.\n\n**Automated E-mail Flows**\n\nE-mail is a beautiful art. It’s also the highest converting platform out there. I’ve set-up my platform using [Klaviyo](http://klaviyo.com/) and pop-ups using [Privy.](http://www.privy.om) They integrate very nicely with Shopify and pull in a great deal of data that allows you to segment e-mails and create flows rather easily. As for e-mail design, [here's an example of an abandoned cart e-mail.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/email.jpg?1514475351117951741)\n\nCart abandonment e-mails are what some people call ‘low hanging fruit’ and are huge drivers for conversion rates. It’s important to reassure your customer that you have his back.\n\n**The Enterprise Resource Planning System**\n\nOur ERP and information systems are designed to maintain exact inventory counts in every warehouse, with real-time visibility that allows us to plan our manufacturing requirements ahead of time, so we can grow with demand, instead of behind it. \n\nA lot of testing went into choosing the right platform. The first and most important criteria is integration abilities with my other platforms. Second, automation functionality. We opted for the beautifully operated [Stitch Labs](http://stitchlabs.com/) inventory management platform as my centralized hub. It handles all my sales channels, including Shopify and upcoming Amazon and eBay openings. We then assign a fulfillment warehouse to each one, and using the new 3PL integration functionality, orders flow back and forth. We designed workflows and established flow parameters like shipment mappings based on weight and destination. Stitch Labs handles the rest, including a complete accounting integration with Quickbooks. \n\nA new feature i'm probably going to end-up using is product bundling, which means I can finally build a virtual SKU composed of multiple existing SKU's. Stitch reports an inventory level of the SKU with the lowest availability. This will serve well for ‘packs’. \n\nReporting is robust enough to handle manufacturing requirements planning (MRP) and deep level sales insights, including customer loyalty and variant splits. I’m completely in love with it.\n\n**Automated Freight Logistics**\n\nOur logistics partner, Flexport, combines the power of the cloud and uses a proprietary bidding technology that guarantees the best rates and shipping times from our factory, all while streamlining the online-only process that eliminates paperwork and errors. \n\nI go with [FOB to Door.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/IMG_1033.jpg?10601425246704194831) Customs, paperwork, and communications are handled entirely by the Flexport team.\n\n**Automated Fulfillment and the Science of Shipping**\n\nIf you run a small operation in the hundreds of items of total inventory and can find the time to spend a couple of hours a day picking, packing, sealing, labeling, and dropping off orders at the post office, by all means, do so and use Shipstation for this. If you have a small amount of SKU’s but a couple thousand items, you can upgrade to a 3PL like Fulfillrite. On the other hand, when inventory counts start getting into the tens of thousands with hundreds of SKU’s, when you expect significant growth, and when you start requiring advanced order routing, you move into a larger, more established, 3PL with advanced connectivity features.\n\nWe opted for the latter with DCL Logistics.\n\nWe have the capacity to store, pick, pack, and ship any volume with same-day fulfillment and an optimized arrangement that places the popular items closer to the picking line. We also use special bar-coding in every single item to guarantee order accuracy -- making order confusion or missing items a thing of the past. In short, we moved in with the big boys!\n\nWe have 180 SKU’s over 9 product lines. Keeping track of each one is hard, but our 3PL handles it beautifully. Bear in mind, an organized inventory is crucial and begins from the factory, especially in regards to proper tagging an labeling. [Registration with GS1](http://www.gs1us.org/) for a proper UPC code was crucial for the process, especially if we want to expand to retailers or Amazon. \n\nThe implementation process with a logistics provider of their caliber does require quite a bit of customization and know-how. The way we have it set-up is:\n\n* Order received on sales channel\n* Order pushed to Stitch Labs\n* Invoice pushed to Quickbooks for immediate realization of income\n* Order pushed to respective warehouse with mapped shipping\n* 30 minute grace period for order changes\n* Items picked, packed, and shipped\n* Shipping notice sent back to Stitch Labs with packing list\n* Stitch Labs triggers the shipment notification e-mail according to packing list\n* Stitch Labs sends Costs of Goods sold info to Quickbooks to immediately realization of expense\n\nThe 3PL receive orders from Stitch Labs through the custom-developed API, granting a 30 minute window before the order is locked from any changes (for customers that make mistakes in their orders). They've since published this 3PL connectivity feature to all customers. They pick and pack, ship, and spit back tracking information to Stitch which triggers the shipment confirmation e-mail on Shopify. If yout can't develop an API between Stitch and your 3PL, you can bridge this connection via Shipstation.\n\nThe result? [Same-day shipping](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/100_0213.JPG?8245723273761910188) on orders placed before 12:30PM EST. That’s unheard of for a small business!\n\nThe implementation process took about 2 months, which I consider to be a good thing. One-click 3PL's are very limited in functionality, whereas custom designed connectors have given me the ability to process returns, handle special rules like box sizing, and perfectly expandable features like EDI’s with large retailers. As an example, the new Amazon competitor Jet.com handles most of their sales through EDI connections with other merchants.\n\nAs for shipping providers, USPS is always the best way to go with average shipping times of 1 to 4 days. Our competitors use Fedex Smartpost or UPS Mail Innovations, services that save a few cents over USPS. The twist? They sort the packages and hand over the pre-sorted bulk to USPS anyways, except this time USPS has no incentive to deliver quickly.\n\n**Accounting**\n\nLast, but of course not least: accounting. Yes, you guessed it: also automated. Stitch Labs spits out all invoices in one single format, regardless of the sales channel it received it from, and then sends out costs of goods sold to Quickbooks once the item is shipped. All we're left to do is match bank transactions and deposits with the appropriate group of invoices.\n\nAccounting takes us about 1 hour a week. Bear in mind, the implementation and work-flow design process took months. But remember, [preparation is key!](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280)\n\nTake the time to learn accounting. Take a quick course or read an accounting book. It's worth the effort, as this is the base by which your business runs. It's not as simple as how much cash you have in the bank. When long-term inventory planning is involved, knowing your numbers on a deep level is crucial. \n\n**[THE WHOLE PICTURE](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Macro_Operations_Diagram.001.jpeg?4487767735057772902)**\n\nSo, can we agree that automation is your best friend. What it comes down to is this: at Comfortable Club, we have the logistics of a Fortune 500 company -- without the Fortune 500 overhead. You might ask, what does all this streamlining, automating and general process-hacking get us?\n\nIt gets us the ability to run our entire operation -- thousands of dollars of orders across multiple SKUs every month --  as a one-man show. That’s right: the “we” we’ve been talking about this whole time? Well, it’s mostly just me. More on that in a minute.\n\n**Platforms I Use**\n\nAll of my platforms have been carefully selected to be compatible with each other. It took months of work to get them talking in such a way that requires minimal maintenance:\n\n* Inventory, Planning, and Sales: [Stitch Labs](http://www.stitchlabs.com/)\n* Ecommerce: [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)\n* Custom development: [Codementor](http://codementor.io/) and [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/)\n* E-mail flows: [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) - Much much better than any other platform I’ve tried\n* E-mail Pop-ups: [Privy](http://www.privy.com) - Connects beautifully with Klaviyo\n* Sales Taxes: [Taxjar](http://www.taxjar.com/) - Counts taxes from every sales channel and creates a beautiful liability report\n* Accounting: [Quickbooks Online](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/move-to-quickbooks-online/)\n* Kickstarter Order Organization: [Backerkit](http://backerkit.com/)\n* Kickstarter Shipments Pushed to 3PL: [Shipstation](http://www.shipstation.com/)\n* Packaging: [Pakible](https://pakible.com/) (not connected but awesome supplier nonetheless)\n* Freight: [Flexport](http://flexport.com/)\n\nGetting them to communicate is a matter of understanding accounting on a basic level, maintaining organized information, and mapping things correctly. In making them work, I've developed wonderful relationships with the support teams from all of these platforms.\n\n**The Almighty Profit Margin**\n\nI’ve noticed that the topic always goes into a heated discussion, and I have a few things to say about this: some markets require a deep commitment to an aggressive pricing strategy before you can start poking around looking for customers. And no, not anyone can price something low and sell thousands.\n\nWe required heavy investments in advertising to get noticed. It's only when you have validated your product, carrying a loyal fanbase of users, when you notice a strong rate of repeat customers, and when you can convince new ones easily that you can demonstrate long-term value and can start realizing healthy streaming profits.\n\nThis is the point at which i’m in. I’ve invested every single profitable dollar, funneling it into better photography, product prototyping, new product development, improved quality control programs, new advertising methods, and the development of my automated platforms. \n\nHere’s the breakdown of factors you have to consider in your profit margins:\n\n* Item cost - this cost is realized once it leaves the warehouse to the customer. In the meantime, it’s considered an asset in your balance sheet.\n* Packaging \n* Quality Control \n* Freight\n* Import duties \n* Commissions &amp; Credit Card Processing Fees\n* Kickstarter Fee\n* Receiving and unloading\n* Storage and warehouse space\n* Insurance\n* Picking and packing per item charges\n* Per order fulfillment charges\n* Actual shipping charges\n* Advertising with Google PPC, Facebook, and Retargeting (starting mid-May)\n* Photography and Models\n* Influencer Marketing\n* Video Production, although I handled all the video production myself, including the editing\n* Cloud platforms and monthly charges\n* Payroll for any employees\n* Travel expenses\n\n**Social Proof and Reviews are Key**\n\nLike we said, we had a hunch that we weren’t alone in our quest for better, more comfortable underwear. So rather than waste time and money on expensive validation studies and market tests, we took it straight to the market -- and the results were beyond what even we expected. \n\nIn Summer ‘15, we launched our first crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Less than a month later, we’d raised more than $142,000 and sold over 15,000 pairs of boxer briefs. So, being common-sense people, we launched a second, follow-on campaign, which went on to sell an additional $219,000.\n\nAll told, we have attained over 7,000 customers in less than 6 months and shipped over 30,000 items -- providing powerful proof that Comfortable Club has [struck a chord with customers.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/reviews001-udmlmgwsvx.jpeg?12664222863729221570)\n\nNext steps are opening up the Amazon sales channel and getting in on PR outreach. As I mentioned on my previous posts, I’m shying away from expensive PR agencies and handling the outreach myself. It’s all about convincing influencers, bloggers, and publications to try on your product. And who better to do that than yourself?\n\n**About Me**\n\nThe inspiration for Comfortable Club came after I tried my first pair of premium underwear. I believed in the premium aspect, but couldn’t quite reconcile myself to the idea of shelling out $300 to replenish my underwear supply. Having worked as a supply chain and planning director for a multinational company, I knew only too well that problems with product pricing start upstream, so I put my supply chain and sourcing experience to work to develop a better, more budget-friendly solution. I also worked as director for an SAP implementation initiative on a 500-large multinational company - being the main driver for my knowledge in accounting, systems, and integrations.\n\n**Want to Meet?**\n\nIf you’re ever around Austin and want to meet up, discuss life and business, or just say hi, i’d be happy to grab a drink with you.

{"id":"d3fnvwk","author":"WageSlave-","body":"Well, I for one agree with the OP. I tried to Turk for about three days. A typical job, called HITs, would pay something like \"$0.50 for a 5 minute survey\" which might make you assume you would make $6.00 per hour if you just did HITs like that back to back. However, what I found was that there are also THOUSANDS of garbage HITs that you have to wade through to get them. Once you find on that is good, it often turns out to be expired, or you don't qualify. Or you start the survey, get 30 seconds into it, then get booted out because you don't fit the right demographics. Sure for the exact 5 minute window that you are doing the good HIT, you are technically making $6 per hour, but when I included all of the unpaid time searching for those unicorn good HITs that number plummets. in the end I just quit in disgust. I worked for a few hours a day for several days and made a grand total of $5. So I made pretty close to $1 per hour.\n\nVery few people think they are abnormally dumb, so I might be, but I just don't know it. I certainly don't think I am, and i managed to get a BSME from GaTech with a high honors, so I managed to convince them that I am not abnormally dumb.

{"id":"d3gd3ml","author":"BizChap","body":"I was going to say refrigerated delivery boxtruck like how sysco does it, but I guess you are doing the monthly home meal plan bandwagon thing, shipping via UPS and USPS\n\nI have a feeling that you should be thinking outside the box though. Or copy someone else. But going to thinking outside the box:\n\n* This is *technically* an engineering problem. Think about chemistry. Exothermic reactions, insulation, etc. What places use insulators. What is an insulator, anyways? An insulator just basically keeps  heat from outside ambient temperature from equilibrium into the container\n\n* Now that we have that aside, what uses of insulators are already in place out there already? Put it bluntly, who uses insulators? \n\n* Hikers http://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Mylar-Thermal-Blankets-Pack/dp/B000GCRWCG?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=28BRZXKGSYWKI&amp;coliid=I15FHNVDLI6TEL&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl. Thermal blankets. A good thermal insulator (keeping body warm) alternatively can be used to keep a cold pack cool as well, because insulators are to prevent thermal transfer from one point to another\n\n* I'm just naming random examples outside the box\n\n--------------------\n\n##Food temperature safety, HACCP\n\n* You should know, at a certain temperature, things become dangerous and not safe to ship, specifically because of bacteria. You could alternatively put some sort of oxygen remover (Silica packets), although this isn't commonly done in food at all, because people might eat it and your shipping food.\n\n* Food danger safety is about 40* to 140*F. So you should also be considering the following: 1. What season are you shipping in 2. How far is your shipment going to go. 3. Are you shipping in a dense city like New York City and using couriers as well 4. Are you shipping in the northern part of USA or the soutern part of USA (since its hot down south)\n\n---------------------\n##Looking back at meal preparation\n\n* If you haven't already, your kitchen should have a blast chiller. When you cook said food, you need to drop it very quickly past the Danger zone (40*F to 140*F) and cool forced chilled air is the best way to go. Your catering service should have this, I assume its a shared kitchen rental\n\n---------------\n##Shipping\n\n* You said 48 hours to ship. So you are definitely shipping, within about zones 2-4 via USPS (up to 1000 miles I'm guessing). Are you running a &lt;16 oz shipment, because things get more expensive with USPS. \n\n--------------\n##Package engineering\n\n* I don't really do any of this, but you should know that box shipments going through UPS and USPS go through 2 things:\n\n1. Impact resistance - Max amount of blunt force basically at a designated point, this is what causes your boxes to have holes in it. Since they run a conveyor belt system and sometimes, by luck of draw, heavy shit falls on top of it\n\n2. ?Internal resistance? Can't recall the term, basically if your package is glass (which its not), it can get damaged by shaking of contents in the book itself. This is what accelerometers normally measure, there's been a study here on popular mechanics. I highly doubt any of this applies to you\n\n-----------------\n##Calories, and energy\n\n* You should also know as well, that depending on your box shape, and the amount of surface area, and the number of calories / mass of the items, you are going to get a different time to freeze and time to thaw rate. THis isn't going to make a huge difference though, but if you have liquidy sort of goods (sauce) that's thick, it generally takes longer to thaw. Same with higher calorie meals. If you are going for the low calorie segment market, as most of these businesses are, there's going to be a shorter thaw time. As calories are basically energy, and the more calories the more mass of food you have\n\n-----------\n##Purchasing of packages\n\n* I assume you are purchasing your packages from yoshi, sysco, webstaurant, or amazon. Those are just some of the options\n\n------------\n##Packaging machinery / Food box shape\n\n* Most packages of that type undergo thermoforming. You should look it up. They are usually cheap as shit quality normally. The most economical and most used packaging for frozen food is generally going to be a rectangular-ish shape, I know this to be true since I eat lots of frozen food from the grocery store. Healthy food choices (Steamers) is a bit different though. Most people are going to be packing grocery store freezers with just a single, thing piece of cardboard since its economies to scale. Yours is more higher end luxury\n\n---------------\n##Storage of materials and goods\n\n* You said something about ICE-gels, I have no idea what those are. Are those those frozen packs that you keep inside of the food?\n\n* I assume you have bought your competitors goods, whatever that may be. But, have you tried AmazonPantry? How reliable is your competition anyways? \n\n--------------------\n##Distribution\n\n* You may be looking at a whole set of different problems than your competition. If you are copying everything verbatim, to your competition, and you are still doing poorly, what differences do you notice between you, and your competition?\n\n* There are some things you may not see that your competitor is doing. Specifically, with distribution. Are they actually using USPS? or are they using a courier service that's local, and have a partnership with them?\n\n------------------\n##Shipping logistics\n\n* you should know, that USPS has different centers for shipping areas in different ZIPCODE based regions. Also, UPS, consider how they ship things. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3368846/155-miles-conveyor-belts-4-million-parcels-night-plane-60-seconds-Inside-UPS-giant-sorting-facility.html. USPS is a bit shittier though than USPS\n\n* Your competition very well might be located NEXT to a shipping warehouse, thereby reducing time to shape by a large margin. Because, think about it this way. The guy who picks up your package, is on a route everyday. If you are stop #1, your going to have that food sitting around for awhile. I suggest you talk with your UPS or USPS rep if you haven't already , try to pick the last available time slot pickup for route delivery pickups. Anywehre from 3PM to 6 PM IIRC, can't remember\n\n\n\n----------------------\n##My best guess for your solution\n\n* I have never bought any of these subscription based meal delivery home services, which I assume yours is. But, this is how I'd pack it http://i.imgur.com/F9a6qHy.png. Its over simplfying it by a large margin, but that's the general rule of thumb I'd follow\n\n\n\n--------------------\n##Doing experimental testing\n\n* IF you want to really, find out what problems you are having, the easiest way is to stick a TEMPERATURE LOGGER http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/handle-buy-box/ref=dp_start-bbf_1_glance (like this) inside your box. Go look at its temperature changes over time, and compare that with USPS/UPS's tracking information on the box. Go ahead and ship it to your friends house, something mimicking real world conditions. Do this 3-5 times at random locations to get an accurate representation of data\n\n* I suggest you put this temperature logger inside the insulated area as well. You should know, that the insulated area does not necessarily have the same temperature as the food itself. If its well insulated, they should be near the same temp, if its not well insulated, it wouldn't be the same. Just FYI, I'd place the probe here http://i.imgur.com/FzrSIZ5.png\n\n---------------\n##TL;DR\n\n* These are all my assumptions I have of your business, I have never worked on the distribution side of catering, so if you provide me with more details I could possibly point you in the right direction (also, please provide me some of your experimental data / observations of competition in more detail (pictures preferably), message me or post here). Than I could give you a better assessment\n","name":"t1_d3gd3ml","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-23 16:01:51","week":21}

I have personally pushed aside dozens of ideas that I begin to develop when I sense the extent of resources needed exceed what I reasonably have (time, money, and sometimes a specific skill).  The ideas don't need to die forever, but there are better outcomes than having an idea-too-big collapse on you two years down the road due to very easy to see calculations from the beginning.  There is more to this than even execution, because it is very difficult for a person to assess what the crowds will adopt - so that's the risk, not just completion, but both obsolescence over development time, and also, a possible ghost town at the end of the road.  Calculate your path based on all such possibilities.  I don't want to judge your idea, but you would be competing against some hefty giants like Amazon, Spotify, and the long list to follow is brutal.

{"id":"d3htn0w","author":"Suddenly_Kanye","body":"Yeah, perhaps my comment is a bit defensive and part of it comes with the territory, but I apologize. The business of selling limited edition clothes &amp; shoes is an insanely competitive arms race nowadays since everyone and their mother knows that certain items can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Even though we're all a community here, everyone keeps certain trade secrets to themselves, whether it be where, what &amp; how we source. \n\n A big part of reselling limited edition items involves knowing the scene &amp; sometimes speculating what will and won't sell for more than the MSRP. It goes far beyond scanning an item with an Amazon Selller app or checking sold listings on eBay since the item hasn't been released so there's no precedent of sales. The problem is there's a lot of new people nowadays that learn about reselling from YouTube documentaries &amp; clickbait headlines of shoes selling for 5 figures. Then they come wanting to join, but don't want to put in the work of researching endlessly. Not saying OP is like this obviously, but it's a behavior trait that draws frustration amongst other sellers. \n\nI have always glad to help people around here and through PMs if they have questions that have a direction &amp; not just broad inquiries about what sells &amp; how much money we make.

Also, this competitor isn't based in our country, however, chances are they will expend soon and sell their meals in our country as well...\n\n* I get the feeling your competition is in America, but you are in Europe.

I guess what's the average temperature over there?\n\n&gt; http://imgur.com/4zWLLlU\n\n* It looks like you are already temperature logging. 7*C = 44*F. Okay, that's not much different than how americans say from HAACP organization, that 40*F to 140*F = danger zone. We consider 33*F to 38*F to be normal holding temperature for refrigerators, http://i.imgur.com/tCYxRk3.png, freezers are 32*F and lower (0*C)\n\n&gt; https://imgur.com/a/hJ94m\n\n* Hm. Looking at your 4 images. I can't think of your answer offhand, but I do believe where your answer inspiration should come from: Commercial Refrigeration Insulation and Home Insulation\n\n----------------\n#Commercial Refrigeration Insulation and Home Insulation\n\n* You might be asking why this is important, but first you must understand the following, history tells us something you can learn from\n\n* Meal food prep shipping frozen goods hasn't really been a thing until the last 10 years roughly. With new technology advancements and what not. There really wasn't anywehre online to advertise these things. The only things people were shipping that were frozen generally went to either 1. restaurants, 2. grocery stores, 3. the milkman to homes (now defunct).\n\n* We're getting a new advent of home shipping \"pre-made meal\" services now-adays\n\n------------\n##First understand the refrigeration industry for home-use\n\n* http://i.imgur.com/f5J9LCi.png. Home refrigerators have been around for about 70 years. In america, https://www.truemfg.com/AboutUs , this was one of the first companies to exist. I've been to their factory and seen their operations before, its pretty nice, 3million+ squarefoot warehouse manufacturing center\n\n-------------\n##That aside\n\n* Okay, now back to the problem. The history of refrigeration is important because it gives us insight on how other people back in the day tackled refrigeration problems. I think. Oh I remember.\n\n----------\n##Home Insulation and commercial refrigeration part 2\n\n* Basically, think about a commercial refrigerator. What makes it such a great insulator anyways? Specifically, how does it contain the cool air inside of its unit? Isn't a packaging box not that much different?\n\n* Refrigerators use something called R-434 refrigerant. It has a high \"R\" value. http://i.imgur.com/zC4ul8o.jpg. Basically, the higher the \"R\" value, the higher its insulating properties are.\n\n* Insulators work on two principles. One is the \"R\" value (basically, how little heat goes through it per given space) and thickness of material. If you've ever gutted open your home walls, or a refrigerator, you'll see insulation like this: http://i.imgur.com/Ztc4Jt4.png\n\n-----------------------\n##Home Insulation and commercial refrigeration part 3\n\n* So you have to understand, that good insulation has to be REALLY tight. I have observed how the best refrigeration company does their insulation methods (had to sign an NDA, so I couldn't take pics sorry). But they do their foam-in-place insulation by hand. They literally take a piece of masking tape to enclose their unit, and shove polyuerathne foam expander (what happens is 2 polymers mix and it forms an exothermic reaction). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjap74m4228. Foam in place units are kind of hot if you touch them while they expand.\n\n* Another better video showing how foam in work injectors work. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMdBsAzy6aE. And, how refrigerators use them. Around here shows how they make walkin coolers https://youtu.be/-k_SflGjUwY?t=406 (didn't find a better video at the moment). \n\n* **What my point here (1st)** : is that refrigerators, are no different than packaging boxes, just a smaller version of it, without a compressor, and without any electrical components or fans. Its just a box. A cold one. With a cold source (Ice Gels - packaging box vs. Compressor/Refrigerant for refrigerators)\n\n* **My next point** is that refrigerators came around 1920's for home use, before that it was commercial use in the 1850's. Then, around 2000's we get these home shipping goods. You see where I'm getting at? People borrow ideas from history all the time\n\n* **My last point** is that refrigerators are practically perfected at the moment. You won't see many EnergyStar (government entity) efficiency improvements for refrigerators by much. But, packaging is still a shaky road\n\n-------------\n##Now that we got that aside, the solution. Back to the drawing board....\n\n* Now history lessons aside, now we have to tackle the problem from a scientific standpoint\n\n* First, its important to understand as well, refrigerated delivery boxes (like sysco food trucks) are essentially an oversized version of what you are doing. Those take inspiration from the refrigeration (home, and grocery store distribution centers) and the home insulation industry)\n\n----------\n##Now that we got that aside, the solution. Back to the drawing board.... PART 2\n\n* Okay, scientific standpoint. Let's look at all the givens once more. And criterias\n\n1. A box. Pretty obvious you need a box to ship things, and its pretty obvious that you will use something cheap and economical and readily massive produced. Because this niche market is heavily reliant on shipping cheap goods, unless you are in a luxury neighborhood / market, but those people just go out and eat.\n\n2. Insulation material. It needs to be well constructed such that no cold air escapes. The moment it does, you made a poor insulating box. Imagine this: What would happen if your refrigerator gasket (that black rubber thing that seals your door when you close /open it). Is not this the same thing that your box will undergo? **Second**, imagine what would happen if you left your refrigerator door open at night. All the food would get warm no?\n\n3. Packaging material. This isn't necessary, and might get lumped in #2. But you might need a cheap filler that helps enclose the gap , for instance amazon's packing tape https://m.reddit.com/r/amazon/comments/49j3dc/what_packing_tape_does_amazon_use/. Or packaging peanuts. Your problem, is technically a distribution shipping problem as well. \n\n4. The food itself. I mentioned sauce, high calories high mass longer thaw out rate, etc just from how I eat frozen food at the grocery store and thaw out things at home. **Normally, from what I noticed, is that when I buy frozen food, the liquid contents (and meats) is seperate from the grains/rice**. Why is this? Trader Joes does this all the time (they are a leader in food distribution as well, more so than other grocery chains IMO), when I buy their curry chicken packages. Its probably because rice doesn't have a danger zone associated with it, and it needs water/steam from the liquid contents inside to thaw out\n\n","name":"t1_d3hv6eu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-24 18:25:45","week":21}
{"id":"d3hv6s8","author":"BizChap","body":"5. The actually container that the bag sits on\n\n6. How everything comes together. How everything is packed together. Basically, do you keep all your food in a two compartment tray, or a one compartment tray? (Two compartment) http://i.imgur.com/v52lNSw.jpg from trader joes. **I have a feeling that two compartment trays hold temp better than 1 compartment trays**. It goes back to surface area exposed (At the top where the thin plastic is), basically that cubic-shaped looking sauce area is basically an **ice pack** in of itself. Also for steaming rice too\n\n----------------------------\n##Contracting/Construction industry/ Packaging\n\n* Packaging things together in a well insulated way is not that dissimilar to how the construction industry works for homes. How do they build insulation in homes such that houses don't get overally hot down south, while at the same time insulating it such that houses stay warm in the winter up north? **Your solution to box packaging / #6 (How it all comes together)** should come from this resource.\n\n-----------------\n##Cooking Curve\n\n* http://i.imgur.com/j03De5W.png. Fryers have a cooking curve. I have no idea why this is relevant. But I believe its because sometimes, in a-la-carte style cooking (Catering and buffet), items are only cooked to 70%, and the the last 30% cooking is usually blasted in a microwave. If I recall correctly, Applebees was notorious as hell for doing this, until they changed CEO's recently, because I'm blasted with \"Wood-Fired Grill ads\" on my TV commercials at home, and I don't even use search queries in google for applebees for targeted ad (Definitely a blanket ad). According to how much I know about the mobile ad industry, its usually not targeted to any specific platform, like my TV watching commercial. \n\n* Applebees even said they no longer \"microwave\" their food on a TV commercial. so that confirms my supsicions here. And reddit notoriously , including people who've worked there, said Applebees was shit. Lots of places buy food and just microwave nuke it. Especially, panerabread soups. That 100% is pre-bought stuff, due to quality control\n\n* **My point here** is that I am not sure if microwave goods are always fully cooked, sometimes they are 70% cooked a-la-carte style. Doesn't have anything to do with insulation, its more so in food quality\n\n----------------\n##Engineering\n\n* Well now that I covered all of that, now its time to do actually engineering. I'll admit i'm a bit rusty as hell here, but bear with me\n\n* Surface area. We know that the more surface area on a package, the faster it thaws out (consequently it gets to freezing temp faster in a blastchiller). Time to whip out some generic formulas from thermodynamics...it needs to be the simplest formula though. Nothing fancy. We're not talking about pressure changes though, or \n\n* http://physicsforidiots.com/physics/thermodynamics/. Ah this is a good resource for anyone to understand. Here's the formula Q=MC(deltaT) http://i.imgur.com/qmurRgB.png. This is probably the most essential formula to understanding what insulators do. Basically....your food has mass associated with it M, C is dependent upon whether you use liquidy contents / 2 seperate compartments in container, DeltaT is change in temperature of your food over time. Q is energy from outside ambient temp coming into your box. I might expand here later, but this is important to understand\n\n* Everything has a Q=MC(Delta T) associated with it, for different areas in your container that have different temperatures in it. This only assumes everything is well packed and and no leakages. \n\n* **Here's my point here** : http://i.imgur.com/Q18PmUZ.png. Basically, there's 4 equilibrium points between each point here, T1 , T2, T3, T4. You can do a basic thermodynamic equation comparing T1, T2, then T2, to T3, than T3 to T4, etc. For different conditions, like ambient temperature outside( T4), for what type of food your packing(t1), to the packaging itself (T2, T3)\n\n\n--------------\n##Manufacturing of boxes\n\n* I do know how boxes are manufacturered.... to some degree. I've seen them in person before. . **Its important to understand this** because this gives insight on how economically feasible some products are, and how expensive box prices will be (Because box prices you see online are dependent upon how cheaply they can be produced..\n\n* Box packaging/folding, how it works, is not that dissimilar to origami /craft boxes. http://i.imgur.com/PluMwm3.png. Specifically, box making looks like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i3riKvCYkM.\n\n----------------\n#Insulation Aluminum material\n\n------------\n##types of insulation material (High R or C value)\n\n* Too lazy, just used amazon \"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=insulation+material\". Cars. You are using car automotive packaging material. http://i.imgur.com/IhAKGPj.png. I thought it looked familiar, its basically what people put on their car to prevent sunlight from making the car really hot (greenhouse effect/ radiation from sun). **SIDE NOTE**: 3M would be the leader here for finding out the best products. Amazons better for determining the most feasible solution in one search query though.\n\n* It comes in rolls. Rolls. Because its easy to pack. That much is obvious. Its not that far off from how yoga pads are packed. http://www.amazon.com/BalanceFrom-Purpose-Anti-Tear-Exercise-Carrying/dp/B00JW3CTTQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464102720&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=yoga+pad\n\n* **Not only that** I've seen this stuff used in duct work. In construction industry. For A/C ventilation. http://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Dryer-Vent-Electric-Dryers/dp/B017I06P8U/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464102881&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=duct+vent. Its aluminum exterior, with a filler interior (some form of silicone) http://i.imgur.com/R8aLcSY.png. Periodic table of element reference:  http://i.imgur.com/YMReh7s.png. Silicon is used for many things, from caulking for bathtub, to bike grease lube, to kitchen materials. Because its economical. Makes sense. Depends on manufacturing method though.\n\n-----------\n##Where else aluminum insulation is used:\n\n* Roofing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WYfpwskn1M. And A/C vents. And cars. and HVAC industry\n\n-------------\n##Aluminum properties\n\n* Found a datasheet. http://www.macbertan.lk/category/products/mcfoil-ultra/. Matweb was a bit complicated, so i googled it instead under \"google images\" using search term \"aluminum bubble foil thermal properties\" until i found a chart. R value is 12.3 http://i.imgur.com/opoQsTZ.png. Its probably around there somewhere.\n\n* Refrigerants, spray in urethane foam is 6.0 for comparison. http://i.imgur.com/RaanWcQ.png. Air ambient is 1.0 http://i.imgur.com/HmwRNnN.png. Regular cardboard is something like 3.0 or less\n\n----\n##manufacturing of cheap, insulation material\n\n* Might as well found out why said material is so cheap, according to amazon, and your competition's packing. \n\n* Alibaba.com would be the best resource here to see how its made since it probably comes from china. Also, \"Google Video\" searches. https://vimeo.com/99022623. Found a better video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5PDoD8b86U\n\n* **Buying bulk material, skipping uline**. If you buy lots of stuff, sometimes its better to order direct. Here's how I'd go about purchasing it too. http://i.imgur.com/otkDcQK.jpg. &gt;Also, looking at one of the landing pages. http://i.imgur.com/a5q4jkY.png\n\n","name":"t1_d3hv6s8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-24 18:25:59","week":21}

YNAB 4 technically has an option to import account statements, but really encourages you to manually enter transactions so that you are taking charge of your money. It's really smart about Vendor X always being classified as Category A, but for something like Amazon you'll always want to pick the appropriate category based on what you're buying.\n\nI believe the New YNAB offers bank syncing, but I never tried it so I don't know how smart it is.

You are registering your product as a manufacturer.  This has nothing to do with you the seller ( weird but true ).  Each item will have its own brand and UPC.  You will need a UPC for this part, buy one at: https://www.easyupc.com/\n\n2. You are then registering as a seller who sells your product.  It will literally ask you, \"Which items do you want to sell.\" You will choose your own.  There is an option for other sellers to sell your product too but it probably won't happen.  The two are kind of blurred together so you may jump from one to the next without noticing.  \n\nAs far as a channel for yourself, I agree its a good idea. You'll be busy so watch the video on the home page of [AwareLabs](http://www.awarelabs.com/) and when you're ready just sign up and follow their [Online Store Step By Step Guide](http://www.awarelabs.com/guide/online-store/), it will show you and your mom exactly how to set things up fast and easy so she can run it when you go back to school.","name":"t1_d3icqof","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-05-25 01:05:11","week":21}

You want to avoid shocking regular visitors, especially because the variations may not ultimately be implemented.\"\n\nFor example, let's say I'm running an eCommerce site (like Amazon) and I decide to do a A/B Test on your \"Checkout Process.\" I don't find it correct to include them into my test because it can hurt my profits. \n\nHow can it hurt my profits? Let's say, version A is the standard, and version B is the test version, if version B creates dramatic results including a 60% lower \"Checkout Rate,\" it could potentially drive my regular customers away in the future and I'll be losing money of course (but that's not the case since you'll be losing the same amount of money on new/regular customers.)\n\nWe're both promoting A/B testing, which is fantastic!

Either really focus on paying off the debt this year and choose the grad school money, or keep the debt at a minimum and wipe it out with your cash bonus at the end.\n\nIn the meantime, get a real budget, stick to it, and don't purchase anything superfluous.

I mean you have the advantage of being able to broadcast easily to lots of people with your own YT channel and website.\n\nI strategically hired a professional to light, shoot, and edit my videos and he is quite expensive. Unfortunately it is difficult to make money on YT and even on a regular content creation website because unless you have around 100,000 followers on YT and/or 500,000+ unique viewers per month on a website, the ad revenue will never be enough to break even, let a lone make money.\n\nI have found the *best* way to make money as a content creator is to have a product to sell and right now, I don't really have a *product*- I only have *content*.\n\nBut I just found out a few days ago that Amazon Prime Video has opened their platform to all content creators! This means I can now have access to their over 40 million subscribers which is a game changer. \n\nAmazon Prime Video has a majority of women over the age of 30, which is *exactly* my target market! In addition, the ad revenue is *much* bigger than what YT is paying. Plus I can give my viewers the option to download my videos for a small price (1.99 per episode seems to be the going rate) and I receive 50%. This is potentially a really. big. deal.\n\nPeople go to YT to get *free* content. Customers go to Amazon Prime to shop. \n\nPeople go to YT to watch lower quality content. Customers go to Amazon Prime to watch high quality content.\n\nThis could be the perfect fit for what I am trying to accomplish! \n\nI can now package my videos as a *product* and sell it to my viewers and/or have them watch the videos for free with a preroll ad (like YT), and make a higher percentage of revenue than with YT.\n\nI am *very* excited about this and have spent the last few days working with my director to repackage the content we have already shot into what will be 12 episodes which I can then upload to Amazon Prime! \n\nThen I am going to change my videos for \"season 2\" into longer form (up to 22 minutes) with even higher quality/content and have them exclusively on Amazon Prime.\n\nThen he can cut the longer form videos into shorter \"teaser\" videos which work better on YT and publish them there! \n\nThe recipes will continue to be available on my website and the Amazon Prime videos will point the viewers there. \n\nSo now, instead of *only* having what is essentially *free* content on a massive platform where it is incredibly difficult to get noticed, I will *also* have a hub with a huge audience (demand) and  shockingly low amounts of content (supply), where people are already conditioned to *pay* for content! \n\nCan you tell I am really excited about this?

No wonder it was a 'former owner' of a music store...nobody wants to buy CDs without cases and art.  It's very likely they're all stolen anyway.  Any time someone came in trying to sell us CDs without cases it was always some sketchy dude who'd obviously stolen a CD wallet out of a car. \n\nAs for the promos, it depends on if they are the regular CD and artwork but just stamped as a promo or if they are the promos that come in a slipcase.  If they're the former, I've always been able to sell them on Amazon and eBay without issue.  The latter are trickier; I wouldn't post those on Amazon but I've put up some on eBay but made it very clear what they were.

{"id":"d3j9g05","author":"NotRoryWilliams","body":"Yes, there absolutely is. \n\nI only sell on Amazon for certain big-ticket items like cell phones and cameras, as well as smaller items like textbooks. Amazon takes a commission out of the sale, which I think is around 15%, and then the rest is direct deposited to my checking account after the return period ends. I've sold a few thousand dollars in goods this way, and it's safer and often more money than I would get selling them in Craigslist. \n\nThe \"trade in\" approach typically nets you less than half what you get selling yourself. It's designed to take advantage of people who don't have the patience to do it the proper way. \n\nI don't sell on Amazon as a source of independent income per se, it's just a way to get the maximum value out of things I don't use anymore. It's not good for all items but it's very easy to see whether an item seems to be selling for third party sellers. When you get started you have no real choice but to undercut the lowest price anyone else is offering, but after a while you build up a seller feedback score and you can afford to start charging more when your items merit it, such as if they're in excellent condition and/or in the original packaging. My iPhones for instance tend to go about $50-100 higher than the base price because I include the original package and accessories, sell them before the extended warranty expires, and keep them in a case the whole time I own them.

{"id":"d3jab3n","author":"greenloving","body":"I agree with a lot of what fo4bapc said. Especially the 0% interest balance transfer.  \n  \nYou were right that you don't have a huge amount to cut from, but there definitely is still some. I would definitely get rid of the $30/month on eating out, the $10/month on music (there's YouTube, SoundCloud, and Pandora, which can be free, if you need to hear new music, also most radio stations broadcast for free online), and the $45/month on donations. Just getting rid of those three things gets you an extra $85/month to help you pay down your debt. Is there any way you can downgrade your internet as well? That could save you a bit and people generally don't need the high speeds that they think are necessary.  \n  \nYour grocery numbers don't seem to crazy to me, but check out  /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and maybe /r/MealPrepSunday to find ways to lower it even more. If you can get to a point where your food stamps cover all of your food intake, that's another fair chunk of cash that could go towards your debt.  \n  \nAlso, what is included in \"personal supplies\" and \"cleaning?\" I wouldn't think you'd need to spend $50/month on those two categories, but maybe I don't clean my apartment enough. Or are those category amounts not recurring every month?  \n  \nFinally, I would add that you should use those Amazon gift cards you get on yourself. You can get necessities like food, hygiene products, cleaning products, etc. on there which would mean spending less cash on those.  \n  \nGood luck!

{"id":"d3jcqco","author":"bbalfour","body":"A couple notes before I answer:\n1.  I am no longer with HubSpot.  I left a couple months ago to start something new.\n2.  None of my comments reflect the opinion of the company.  They are all my own.  \n3.  Dharmesh (the founder) posted a good/transparent/honest response to the book here:  https://medium.com/@dharmesh/undisrupted-hubspot-s-reflections-on-scathing-book-acdf9e8ada66#.gixkul8zo\n4.  I never crossed paths with Dan at my time at HubSpot and was on a completely different team.\n\nOk, now for my comments...\n\nAmazon is another company who has been under fire for their culture.  I'm not aware of the specifics, but I think Bezos in his last annual shareholder letter put it best when he said:\n\n\"We never claim that our approach is the right one – just that it’s ours.\"\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm\n\nGreat company cultures are distinct.  They are like personalities of a company.  As a result, some people love it some people don't.  Worst case scenario is you try to be everything to everyone.  \n\nI think this is a case where HubSpot's approach just didn't fit with Dan and I think that is ok.   \n\nI personally saw HubSpot change many lives both on the employee and customer side while I was there.  But not every person is the right fit for a company, and not every customer is the right fit for the product.  \n\nAs for marketing led vs technology led, every company is lead by a certain discipline depending on market, customer, approach, and founders.  AirBnB is design led.  Stripe is engineering led.  Zappos is customer service led.  So on and so forth...\n\nAs Peter Theil said, one of the biggest fallacies in todays startup world is - \"Focus on product, not sales/marketing - If your product requires advertising or salespeople, its not good.  Tech is about product development not distribution.\" \n\nYou need great product and great distribution to become a $1B company like HubSpot.  Even more so in today's environment where the cost of product dev has dropped to a point the market is flooded with web/mobile apps and distribution is now your biggest risk.  Thinking otherwise is foolish.   \n\nIn my opinion HubSpot was marketing/sales led early on, and is now much more balanced with product.  I think it was a good think that HubSpot was marketing led early on.  They needed to be in order to create the market around Inbound Marketing.  If they weren't, there wouldn't have been a market to build product/tech for!","name":"t1_d3jcqco","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-25 19:57:34","week":21}

{"id":"d3jpnlu","author":"doubleh5","body":"The mutual funds are okay for retirement accounts, I guess. Maybe the fees are worth it for you to set it and forget it for the next 40 years. \n\n$1,500 is not too little capital to realize noticeable gains/losses. However, buying ETFs with $1500 likely won't satisfy your risk appetite relative to that little amount. The ETFs will dilute almost all risk except market risk but your growth will be stagnant and at best you'll return $50-100 (3-5%) over any 52wk span. \n\nIndividual accounts are all about being right. I suggest you identify a number of specific stocks that you're bullish on and diversify across sectors. There are a few simple steps you can take to develop a perspective and pick stocks: \n\n1. Take a global macroeconomic perspective. Will this be a good year for stocks? How will global growth concerns influence market performance? How will the activity of central banks influence market performance? What will the prospect of rising rates do to my positions? How are oil markets going to behave in the next year? Asset classes react differently, but in unison in reaction to these events. \n\n2. Take a market perspective. Will Europe perform better than US? Should you have exposure to emerging markets? How is the Fed behaving in comparison to the ECB or the BOJ? Will rising rates in the US be beneficial for US stocks? (Probably not) Will easing in Europe be beneficial for EU stocks? (Probably) These things matter a lot to markets. \n\n3. Take a sector perspective. Will biotech perform better than information technology? Will retail recover from bearish sentiment? Will financials become more profitable in a rising rate environment? Does the market undervalue any sectors? Will oil rebound? Are tech companies overpriced? \n\n4. Take a perspective on specific company fundamentals. Will JP Morgan perform better than Goldman Sachs this year? Does Tesla's business model allow it to compete with GM/Ford over the long term? Is Amazon's online retail business capable of producing growth? Or does the profitability of its web services business make it a good opportunity? Does Netflix have a sound balance sheet and is it capable of rapid growth, even in international markets? How will CHK's debt be refinanced? \n\n5. Take a perspective on technicals. Is this a good opportunity to buy Apple? Does the recent market undervalue Paypal? Is GE over bought or over sold? Is LMT due for a selloff? \n\nA prospective on these factors will allow you to develop a sound investment strategy. \n\n\n","name":"t1_d3jpnlu","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-26 00:51:51","week":21}

Companies like Netflix, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon maybe Google, are all amazing investment opportunities. But they also might be the first to go when times get tough people cut back on tech first. So I would shovel every dollar possible into them at the time. Which is where the cash advocates come in, important to keep a cash reserve for when opportunities like that come up.","name":"t1_d3jz62v","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-26 05:07:38","week":21}

About a month ago I made a test channel and 1 test video (Top 5 Best Electric Skateboards Of 2016).\n\nSo far the 1 video has achieved about 14K views. From those views I managed to get 5 commission sales as an Amazon Affiliate and was able to earn approx. $80 USD as well as a few dollars in advertising revenue.\n\nIf the end goal is passive income, research YouTube video SEO and ranking strategies.

{"id":"d3jzwkc","author":"Cheznor","body":"Not including the bit about the seller apparently ignoring your request to cancel (not cool), your main concern here seems to be that the seller took too long to ship?\n\nBy default, Amazon gives 3rd party sellers 2 business days to ship an item. You ordered your item on a Thursday, meaning the seller had until Monday night to ship your order. Why did you message them on Saturday and ask them if they had shipped? They were still well within their handling time as set by Amazon. It seems like you're just an impatient buyer... don't buy things via 3rd party sellers if you can't wait a (very reasonable) two business days for your item to ship.\n\nUnbelievable the things that people complain about on here.\n\n&gt; full disclosure: i sell on amazon(obviously) and am fully aware of the policies. 4 day handling time is way outside of the usual scope to ship things.\n\nYou should look up what a \"business day\" is.

But I gotta say, given that affiliate links are one of my site's main sources of income, I'd suggest reconsidering your stance on them. \n\nNot wanting to appear to have an ulterior motive is 100% respectable, but how about destination pages on your site listing hotel deals? People have to stay some place if they're traveling! Almost every affiliate company /program has an API and you could have a Paris page auto-populate with Paris deals, etc, then include links to them with any plane tickets you find. Then join AirBNB's aff program and place those links beneath the hotel deals. If people are buying a ticket because of your email, chances are they'll at least click-through to see what the hotel deals are and now you've got the reader back on your site. You could even make a single \"hotel deals\" page with search boxes for whichever hotel affiliates you join and mention it at the bottom or top of each email.\n \nSuper Shuttle has an affiliate, people have to get to the airport. Heck, just this week it was reported that [only 15% of Americans have used Uber or Lyft](\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/05/20/why-so-many-americans-have-never-even-heard-of-uber-or-lyft/), I'd consider including those links. Make a weekly blog post / email with a few Amazon links to your favorite travel toys, gear, luggage, etc. You can outsource Amazon roundup posts for $X, but given that your list is curated, I'd go the \"most is less\" route and personally share your own favorite or hand-picked items.\n\nDo you do domestic flights (NYC - LAX, etc). If so, car rental deal pages would be another series of pages I'd consider whipping together. \n\nYou could keep the airline links 100% affiliate-free and still make some decent cash.

If you like or need to travel to visit family, think about a rewards card that will help you with your travel costs.  If you purchase frequently on Amazon, I'm sure they have a credit card that's catered to you.  Once you get your credit cards, try to resist department store cards that lure you with same day discounts.  These are fleeting, and those rates are in the 20% range.  As your income grows, revisit calling your credit cards and asking them to raise your credit limit.\n\nhttp://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/articles/","name":"t1_d3kub6m","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-26 21:36:31","week":21}

{"id":"d3kwinj","author":"jordanwilson23","body":"There are tons of people that ship over 50 items a day out of there house.  If I was doing under 20 items per day, I would ship from my house and have returns sent back to my house.  You can get a PO box if you want one, but most smaller sellers are not getting a PO box.  I would print labels using Stamps.com or if using Ebay or Amazon I would just print straight from their site. If you get to over 20 packages a day, I would open a Shipstation or Shipworks account and link your stamps account.  Then if you get even bigger and up to 50-100 packages a day, you can integrate UPS or Fedex into your Shipstation or Shipworks account.  You will already be familiar with the platform and at that point adding a UPS or Fedex account is easy.  Schedule a pick up with the post office and have them pick up from your house daily.  Ask them for large canvas bags so when they show up all your items are in 1 bag that can easily be carried.  Print a scan form so only 1 scan is made on all your packages.  For items under 1lb use USPS FC Mail.  For small items over 1lb, jam those items in padded flat rate envelopes if possible.  For items that will not fir in flat rate envelopes, you can then look at Parcel Select or Flat Rate Boxes.  Once your volume is big enough, you can negotiate rates with UPS or Fedex and use Surepost or Smartpost for items weight 1-10lbs and that price will be significantly cheaper than USPS Priority or Parcel Select.  You would want about 40 packages a day to start going with UPS or Fedex.  Having accounts with them will also put your shipping charges on terms which opens up cash flow.","name":"t1_d3kwinj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-26 22:24:06","week":21}

It would be extremely hard to get interviews with FB, Google, MS, Amazon etc. with a degree from Angelo State. The difference of salary between a company like that and a small company would be more than your debt in the first year itself.\n\nFrom your other replies it seems that you have a high GPA and could learn better from a competitive university.

{"id":"d3l43ot","author":"jackets19","body":"Very interesting thought process, I actually am in complete agreement. I see myself owning Tesla, FB, Netflix and Googl, Amazon in the future and long term hold forever potential. The problem is all of these are considered overvalued and are \"tech\" stocks or closely related. I do think there is a market correction or recession (not an enormous crash, but still there) coming in the next year or 2. There is tons of talk about how people will pullout of stocks and into bonds when the interest rates rise, and there is too much historical proof and trends in all the major economic indicators that we are close to a dip. So right now I'm holding 325 shares of SCTY, and saving cash to jump in on the next downturn. Reason I own them is I've done extensive research, they're at an all-time low price point and have enormous upside potential. Because of them I'm also indrectly invested in Tesla, but have much higher return potential. Their financials are complicated but I could talk about the reasons to invest all day, there's a moderate amount of risk but if Tesla realizes their vision, electricity usage will go up and every Tesla owner gets into the \"Musk lifestyle\" and will want solar and the powerwall. One thing that's often overlooked is the employees, the brightest young minds are passionate about changing the world and making a difference, which SCTY uses to their advantage big time. Now costs are the only thing holding them back and as scale rises they are getting to more attractive cost points. Once it's definitively cheaper than fossil fuels it's game over residential, companies, utilities and the government will flock to a cheap green source. Recession resistance as well with long term contracts and people still need energy regardless. I rambles a bit but I agree with you basically if you are passionate about an investment you have an advantage in seeing the perks and potential without panic selling at lows.","name":"t1_d3l43ot","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-27 01:28:09","week":21}

I have a roommate which helps with rent costs.  My student loan on IBR is the same, and the cost of your utilities/gas/internet is the same but again, having a roommate defrays the cost since we share the cost.  \n\nBut all in all, instead of grouping your cash flow as you did, I'd say - \n\n\"Necessities\"\n\n$2k rent, $150 utilities, $100 gas (that's filling up my 10gal tank 3-4 times for me in a month; guessing your commute is worse than mine as I only fill up twice a month), $200 401k, $400 student loan, $100 car loan, $50 auto insurance, $45 phone, $350 food\n\n\"Nice things\"\n\n$350 travel savings, $40 subscriptions, $40 gym membership, $100 entertainment\n\nThat comes out to $530 on nice things.  It really depends on where your priorities are.  $40 on subscriptions sounds a bit high to me; only thing I subscribe to is Amazon Prime for its 2-day shipping and its free videos.  Do you need all 3 of Kindle/Netflix/Spotify?  I use Google Play Books on my phone, which is free, and I download epub files to read. \n\nI also don't have a gym membership because I happen to live near a park for evening walks and several trails that are good for short 3-hour weekend hikes.  I don't lift, but I know some people who have small weights that they use for light exercise.  Other people prioritize the gym, or don't live near somewhere where they can walk a lot.  \n\nI also don't know what you consider entertainment; not drinking definitely saves me a ton of money (alcohol is expensive) but I still go to dinner/the movies with my friends several times a month, and spend about $60-80 a month on that.  \n\nEdit: by the way I looked at the title again.

{"id":"d3lsor0","author":"SawBo","body":"This is in the Wiki FAQ, I don't exactly agree with it 100%, but it's been stated and I agree with most of it. \n\n\n**Escrows/Middlemen and Why Not to Use Them Here**\n\nShould we use an escrow/middleman to make our trade safer?\n\n&gt;NO. In general, that might be a great thing to do on other subreddits and online trading communities, but not here on GCX. There are several reasons for this. For most gift cards, it is not possible to check the balance of a card to see if the code is valid without redeeming it. Therefore, a middleman would receive a code, but not be able to check if it is valid or if it is a fake. So the middleman would not be able to do anything to make the trade safer.\n\n&gt;Even if you are the one with the card and you know that it is valid, using a middleman is not a smart move here on GCX. There should not be more than two people involved in a trade. As per the GCX Safe Trading Guide, if you are so uncomfortable trading with someone that you require a third party's help in handling the cards/money, you definitely shouldn't be trading with them in the first place. If you want help with evaulating someone's reputation though, message the moderators using this link for a background check on another person. We'll gladly help with pretty much anything, except for handling any gift cards/money.\n\nNow that Amazon allows you to check on a code before redeeming, it makes it possible to verify, previously this wasn't possible. Still middlemen can't protect you if you get a gift card and don't use it immediately.\n\nAlso posting questions like this probably isn't allowed.

I also applied for the PRG at the same time (got a 50k/$1k spend targeted offer). Somehow Amex's system didn't realize I was the same person who applied for both cards, despite the fact I used the same information on each application, and it wouldn't let me add the PRG to my newly created online account. Took a bunch of phone calls and about a week of waiting for that to finally get taken care of.\n\nThen I discovered I had two separate MR numbers, one for each card. Had to call again and get those merged.\n\nThen, about 5 days ago, I was attempting to buy my last MPX Amazon gift card ($40, I'd bought and been reimbursed for $160 previously). The card was declined. I logged on to the website to see if there was a fraud alert. Nothing. I didn't get a phone call or email either, until about 3 days later, when I got an email that said \"your card has been locked, blah blah, please call the fraud line.\" The first two reps I talked to asked me for the \"confirmation code\" that was left in a voicemail. I said I hadn't gotten a voicemail, just an email, and there was no code. Well, they couldn't talk to me without the code; they had to initiate the call to me, using the phone number on file (which was the same number I called them with). They both said they'd call me right away after we hung up.\n\nNothing. I waited all day, no phone call, after talking to both reps. I called again. The third rep asked again for the voicemail code, which I repeated I didn't have and said I had already been through this twice with no callback. He put me on hold. Then came back to say that my account was locked for \"security concerns,\" but he couldn't specify what the concerns were or what had triggered them. Then he said he would mail me a form that I needed to take to a bank, along with a copy of my photo ID, and get notarized. After I sent it back to Amex they would \"reactivate my card within 72 hours.\" The rep reassured me that \"this is a one time thing and once you do this you won't need to do it again.\"\n\nI don't even know what triggered this. I used the card for normal spending -- restaurants, gas, groceries, etc. No charges over $100. The only thing I can think of is that I made multiple MPX transactions. \n\nFortunately I work at a bank so it won't be a problem for me to get the form notarized and faxed back to them.

{"id":"d3n0b1h","author":"free_george_bush","body":"Richard House and Luke McLeod-Roberts\n\nhttp://im.ft-static.com/content/images/c712484e-d8f7-4be8-a5fc-8ae6d3355d7a.img\n\nIf Brazil’s political and economic volcano threatens to dump an ashmound on the case for investing across Latin America, nobody told the Chinese about it.\n\n\nIn fact, even as drumbeats for the suspension and impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff rose to a crescendo last month, expectations held that China would plough record amounts into building hydrodams, power lines, toll roads and transit systems across Latin America — with Brazil emerging as the Asian investors’ top pick.\n\n\nThat is the conclusion from a survey of 20 infrastructure executives and specialists conducted by FT Confidential Research, a unit of the Financial Times.\n\n\nThe poll of their investment expectations found that appetite among big Chinese players remains undimmed, despite a rocky economic and political period for Brazil and other countries in the region, because they are thinking of longer-term strategic goals. Indeed, Brazil is expected to receive the greatest level of Chinese investment in Latin America in 2016.\n\n\nNotably, the operator of the largest dam in the world, China Three Gorges , is making big bets on the region’s hydropower infrastructure. Li Yinsheng, the chief executive of CTG’s Brazilian arm, told FTCR that even after winning auctions as the sole bidder for two hydroelectric plants in November 2015 — costing R$13.8bn ($3.9bn), and bringing its total investment in Brazil to R$17bn — the company still plans to acquire sizeable greenfield assets.\n\n\nCTG is not alone. China’s State Grid is developing two transmission lines delivering power from the recently inaugurated Belo Monte dam in the middle of the Amazon to south-east Brazil at a cost of R$12bn.\n\n\nA majority of respondents to the FTCR survey — 13 out of 20 — expected Chinese investment in Latin America to increase in 2016, while only one believed it would shrink, as the first chart shows.\n\n\nhttp://im.ft-static.com/content/images/05c6dd5c-2358-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.img\n\n\nDespite the tumbling prices of oil and gas and mineral resources, 50 per cent of respondents said the energy and mining sectors would still receive significant Chinese investment in 2016, though the energy sector (including hydroelectric dams and power transmission) was expected to be the top area of investment. But there was evidence of expectations of greater diversity into areas such as transport and other sectors such as housing, as the second chart shows.\n\n\nhttp://im.ft-static.com/content/images/adc78fb0-2358-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.img\n\n\nChinese companies have already established themselves in Latin America, investing a total of $41.8bn in infrastructure from 2013 to 2015, particularly in the extractive industries, as the third chart shows. While this investment total might be dwarfed by the scale of Chinese investments in Asia, our study suggests a hunger for new Latin American projects despite regional volatility and China’s own economic slowdown.\n\n\nhttp://im.ft-static.com/content/images/5b8f61b4-2358-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.img\n\n\nYet even though funding — often state-encouraged — is plentiful, China is becoming more selective with its investments. Time was, China was happy to take on projects in markets shunned by western investors, notably the so-called Alba countries, which include Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Now, respondents said they expected this year’s Chinese investment to shift rapidly away from Venezuela, with Brazil and Argentina predicted to be the two greatest recipients, as the final chart shows.\n\n\nhttp://im.ft-static.com/content/images/0764eae0-2359-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.img\n\n\nCountries such as Venezuela never demanded a high level of transparency and provided an entry point to the continent in a way that less liable to generate confrontation with the US. During this period, Chinese investment was largely absent from the more transparent, free-market economies of Latin America, such as Colombia, Chile and Mexico.\n\n\nBut the flaws in this approach became obvious by 2013, as the security and political situation deteriorated in Venezuela and allegations of corruption emerged. China is now diversifying away from the seething cauldron of risk that Caracas has become.\n\n\n“China is understanding that it did a poor job of assessing risk,” says Dr Evan Ellis of the US Army War College Strategic Studies Institute. “As the [Nicolás] Maduro administration has fallen apart, China has only given the appearance of supplying loans, without actually providing new money. This is money to cover work done by Chinese companies and allows the country to maintain face while consolidating its position. China is playing a much tougher game with Venezuela.”\n\n\nAs for Argentina, it should be noted that its renewed favour among international investors means China will now face stiffer competition from western nations than it did during the previous period of Peronist political management.\n\n\nSurvey respondents also told FTCR they expect Mexico and Colombia to benefit from China’s waning interest in Venezuela. Both are considered relatively low risk, with good-sized domestic markets. Risk should fall further this year in Colombia following the imminent signing of a peace accord with the militant Farc group.\n\n\nChinese investment in Colombia has already picked up. Together with local partners, China Harbour Engineering recently won the contract for Autopista Mar 2, a 245km motorway in north-west Colombia that is part of the so-called fourth generation of road concessions.\n\n\nThis is a prime example of the sort of project sought by China, involving both construction and operation. The FTCR survey suggests it is likely to be just one of the first of many in Latin America in the coming years.\n\n\nRichard House is Principal, Latin America, and Luke McLeod-Roberts is a senior researcher at FT Confidential Research.\n","name":"t1_d3n0b1h","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-05-28 17:17:59","week":21}

{"id":"d3nr2ig","author":"Lemmilou","body":"My 2 cents: What part do you hate most? Chances are it's the part you're also worst at. If you bring someone on, bring them on to do this thing -- it will remove the psychological burden of the tasks you dislike and hopefully they will be better at those things than you! If you reeeeally can't pay them, offer them something equally valuable for their time. A share in the company? Free endless granola? Bike repair?\n\nAlso, I'm sure you've looked into placement in local markets, but could there be other places to put your product? Bike shops? Crossfit? Yoga studios? Could you design a kid-friendly package and get it in kid-friendly locations? How about a fro-yo place, a high-end chocolatier or a gourmet ice creamery -- they could use your granola as a mix-in or topping and do some cross-promotion.\n\nIf you feel ill-at-ease pushing your product to marketers, come up with a way to make it a good deal for the person you're selling to, so it feels less 'selly' when you make your approach: offer prepackaged small samples with your order (my local health food store puts out samples of new products which seems to work well for them), or donate some boxes to an event where your audience is likely to congregate. Make it easy for your retailers to sell your product by including signage and some product info cards to keep near your merch. Leave retailers a card with info about ordering from Amazon (even better if your products go Prime with free shipping) so they don't have to interact with you face-to-face if they don't want to.\n\nFinal advice: growth is awesome, but too much too soon is as un-awesome as too little too late.

If you have a niche product like a set of glow in the dark keyboard stickers (I did this product a long time ago and would stay away) you can most likely set a 20.00 a day budget and get quite a few clicks for cheap without risking much money.  The clicks will need to be cheap since your product is cheap anyways.  You then need to follow up with those customers and solicit reviews in a non pushy way.  You need to make sure your product is FBA and not MFN.  You need to find a software to give products away for reviews.  You can say you are not a fan of this or you don't like them but that really does not matter because they work.  You are a seller, not the average consumer so you need to view Amazon from a seller's point of view.  You want to know who does give aways?  Anker, Sharkk, Oxgord.  Google those companies and check their Amazon feedback.  That is all the proof you need that give aways work.\n\nIf you do not want to do give aways, then you must do ads unless you have a viral marketing campaign in your pocket that is going to send tons of customers your way.  Sellers that give away products for reviews are not going to implode as suggessted by /u/safetyman35.

I would recommend googling how to make an effective product page.  It is pretty simple but if you do not understand what FBA and MFN is, I would assume you have a lot to learn.  A couple things to maximize your product page -\n\nImages - Clear images you can zoom in on.  They must have a white background and be edited.  You can have them edited on Fiverr or just by googling Image Editing.  It is cheap as hell too.\n\nTitle, Bullet Points, Description.  Make your title at least 70 Characters.  Most people think Amazon stops reading any info after 80 characters - can't guarantee that.  Make all of your bullet points 80 characters.  You can shove some long tail keywords in here.  if your listing is for a gaming mouse, you may want to refer to it as a Wireless LED Light Up Gaming Mouse in your bullet points.   Do the same with your description and make it at least 1,500 characters.\n\n\nOther Stuff - SEARCH TERMS - Fill these in.  Use every single damn character possible.  You have 5 spots with 1,000 characters in most categories.  Amazon says not to repeat any words in these fields but they say a lot of shit and I disagree with that.  If you want to know how well these work, take a long tail very niche search term, add it in and then search it in 15 min to see yourself at the top of the page.  For example if you put \"Hello Kitty USB Light up wireless gaming mouse WoW mouse\" in your search terms and then search it on Amazon, you will be at the top if that exact phrase is used in your search terms.  Amazon says that order of the words in your search term fields does not matter.  To prove that is not the case, take the same words above and put them in random places in your search terms and then do a search and you will find out you are not the top result.  No idea how more people do not understand this.  I would sign up for a software like merchantwords and download a bunch of your searches and then cancel.  This will cost you 30.00 and give you good keywords.\n\nMSRP - If you plan to sell your item for 10.00, don't put your MSRP at 15.00.  put it to 19.99+.\n\n\nBack to Ads -  Run an auto campaign with a default bid of about 5-10 cents.  After a couple weeks download the report, find your good performing keywords and put those in a manual campaign and raise the bid.  This will get you good data for cheap and let you take your most converting keywords and track them in another campaign where you can raise the bids.\n\nEDIT: Keywords, not keyboards.","name":"t1_d3o2nea","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-29 17:06:53","week":21}

Technology and infrastructure has made it much easier for single companies to operate nationwide, particularly in areas like communication, logistics and manufacturing. Where before many companies could compete even if they weren't the most efficient just because they were so far away and disconnected from their rivals, today's America is much closer to perfect, frictionless competition. In most industries, that has made the economy more \"winner-take-all\": where before there might have been hundreds of small bookstores, now there's only Barnes and Noble. Where before there were countless small distributors, now more and more are driven to obsolescence by Amazon and its long tail.\n\nI'm torn on this issue. On the one hand, it's good that the most efficient operators rise to the top, and everyone benefits as a result (other than their inferior competition). It seems unreasonable for the government to \"trust bust\" companies just for being too efficient.

For example in the case of switching jobs it could be that labour pricing in the job market has become much more competitive and therefore opportunities to find better compensated jobs have been reduced. Therefore switching has become less desirable. I don't see lower job switching as a problem per se, I would see a problem if real wages were decreasing or unemployment figures were on a significant uptrend. \n\nBeing less likely to switch states is neither here, nor there for me. I don't see the relevance on 'dynamism'. People still have the same choices available to them to switch states AFAIK.\n\nWhen you start a company you take on a lot of risks, like ruinous bankruptcy. So people don't generally start company's unless there's good potential compensation (monetary or otherwise) for the risks. As others have mentioned there are some traditional ventures, like retail, that have much more intense competitive forces then they did before due to large incumbents and the effects of technology like the Internet which create winner-take-all situations. The returns for a retail start up are probably much more variable then in the past, thus it's a higher risk proposition. Today an entrepreneur somehow has to compete with the Amazon, Wal-mart etc. and the vast body of retailers filling almost every niche imaginable via the Internet. In the days of yore just having a good geographic retail location, with adequate service, in your customers neighbourhood, was often enough to secure decades of good margin business with competition being an easily identifiable and management factor.\n\n","name":"t1_d3o78wg","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-05-29 19:23:13","week":21}
