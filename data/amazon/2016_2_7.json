{"id":"45vqk7","author":"noctisD","body":"It is basically the typical pay to review for iOS, where 1 review equals 100 points and 100 points is a dollar. \n\nPersonally, I like it more than AppReviewGeeks because from my expirience you get just as much apps from AppWinn as you would from AppReviewGeeks. There are also no PayPal fees and everyone gets a chance to review an app since it's on a \"first come, first serve\" principal but you can subscribe to get email alerts when new apps are offered. Also I'm not too sure about this but they say that the reviews have to be honest and they do not say that you have to rate it 4/5 stars like others do.\n\nFinally, their refferal system is just great! If you register with my referral link, you start with 50 points which is $0.50 and I get 50% of your points for lifetime, so that makes it a faster earner than AppReviewGeeks. You can redeem PayPal, Amazon, iTunes, Starbucks, GooglePlay, Xbox and Steam.\n\nSo that's basically it.

I need $500 of that to pay off a personal loan from my mother and the rest is what I have a question about.\n\n I make enough to cover my monthly bills but not for anything extra/emergency fund. Let's call the money from tax that I can use to help myself at $2500. \n\nI have 2 accounts in collections right now both for Universities that I have attended previously. \n\nOne bill is $1337.12 and I've negotiated them down to $1069 if I can pay it off all at once. \n\nThe other bill is for $1422.08 and I can get them down to $1137.67. \n\nI have 3 credit cards: \n\n$739.78 at 23.15% interest\n\n$440.68 at 19.99%\n\n$455.61 at 22.49%\n\nMy thought is to pay off 2 of my higher interest cards and the lower amount collections bill (it's been in collections longer) and that will free me up to make bigger payments on the last credit card until it's chipped away and then make bigger payments on my other account in collections. \n\nMy credit score is currently: 590 so I'm not really worried about this account sitting in collections as it's already done the damage it was going to do and if I pay off the older account (I think?) It will help offset that. \n\nMy current phone bill is $116 for my partner and I (she covers my part of the water bill so it comes out) I can lower that to $71.59 if I pay off our equipment installation plan at $222.05. \n\nThank you in advance for all the help.

I pay my phone bill with it, which insures the phone against loss and damage, which is nice.    I've had this for 5 months and it started improving my score a little each month.\n\nI also recently mentioned my credit issue to a family member that know my financial situation thoroughly.  They offered to add me to their oldest card, which is 24 years old.   We did, and my credit score shot up from a 664 to a 780 on its next update.  \n\nSince then, it has crept up to 796 as more age is added to my credit history.  I have a large work trip coming up, so I decided to test my new score against the Delta Amex again, which I had been denied for 5 months ago.  I was instantly approved without any issue at all.  I decided to also try for the Amazon store card (5% on all Amazon purchases), as I make significant amazon purchases for work monthly.  Again, I was instantly approved for a credit line of a few thousand without any issue.\n\nThis has accomplished my goal of the two important cards I wanted for work purchases that I now no longer have to put on my debit card, but what do I do next?  I paid a $25 yearly fee for the secured card, so I might as well keep it for another 7 months, but then should I cancel it if they don't graduate me?  My authorized user cardholder said I'm welcome to stay on the card as long as I'd like, so no credit age hit right now.   Also, I'd like to use my Delta Amex for everything possible for the mileage rewards, but Amex isn't accepted *everywhere*... should I get a good rewards card that is Visa based as well?   My Secured Visa limit of $500 isn't really very useful, and there's no rewards associated with the card. \n\n**Recap**:\n\n* Credit has gone from 621 to 796 in 5 months.\n* Secured Card, 5 months old, $500 limit, $25 yearly fee. No Rewards.\n* Discover, 24 years+ old, $XX,000 limit, authorized user only (don't actually use)\n* Delta Gold AmEx, New card, unknown limit, good rewards that I'll heavily utilize via work.\n* Amazon Store Card, New card, $3,200 limit, 5% back as statement credit on Amazon, which I use heavily for work. (I buy between 1-3k for work, monthly)\n\n* No debt, car payments, or anything else.  6 month emergency fund, significant savings, retirement match maxed, employed making $130k/yr+.\n\nCheers for the advice and support, it has improved my situation substantially!","name":"t3_460nx0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-16 04:59:12","week":7}

Now my account has been overdrawn and Bank of America just charged me with $35 overdraft fee. I have two questions regarding that:\n\n1. I know this was mostly my fault, I should've been aware of this and taken actions. However, is there a way for me to overturn this? Will it help if I talk with customer support?\n\n2. My Bank of America account is now on -$49 (-9 + -$35 for overdrafting the account). I get paid again in 3 days.

{"id":"46exf5","author":"nthock","body":"Hi everyone,\n\nJust want to share one technique I learnt in writing product descriptions for your own eCommerce store. Product description is crucial in converting your website visitors into customers, especially when they are first time visitor. However, writing great product description is one of the struggle that some of my clients are having. They either do not like writing, or they just do not know what to write about.\n\nSo here's the quick tip:\n\nFocus on the benefits, not features. It is tempting to write about the feature of the product. But that's not what the potential customer want to see. They want to know how can the product benefit him. So for every point you made in your product description, turn the feature into a benefit. Not just any benefit, but benefits that matter.\n\nBut, how do I find out benefits that really matter?\n\nOne way to do it is to look at the reviews at Amazon for similar products. Focus especially on those who gave very good reviews. Why do they gave such a good review? What problem does the product solve for them?\n\nFor example, I tried to sell manual burr coffee grinders online. There are lots of similar products at Amazon. One particular review caught my attention - the reviewer mentioned that he loves manual burr coffee grinder (as opposed to the electrical grinder) because it does not produce a loud noise which will wake his dog up every morning. That's probably not something that I will think of as a seller, but it became a strong selling point for pet owners who love coffee.\n\nHope that this quick tip can help you in writing better product descriptions.\n\nDo you have any other techniques or examples for great product descriptions? Share them here.","name":"t3_46exf5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-18 15:19:54","week":7}

{"id":"46gcdv","author":"taxtimeamazon","body":"Hi guys, Amazon seller here...so I buy and sell lots of random things as a sole proprietor, ended up taking in $160,000 in revenue and netting $40,000 in profit in 2015. Never done taxes before, I have a bunch of questions.\n\n1. How much do I owe? I live in California. \n\n2. Am I responsible for sales taxes? Lots of people buy things from me in different states and I never bothered to charge for that...hopefully that's not a huge mess...\n\n3. How do companies like apple avoid paying taxes with fancy loopholes? \nCan I structure my company in such a way to accomplish that? I'd gladly spend the money I would have to pay in taxes to accountants and lawyers and in setting up foreign entities/subsidiaries whatever is necessary to accomplish this. \n\n4. I've heard mixed things about S-corporations ranging from it's a great way to minimize taxes to the government doesn't recognize them...what's your scoop? \n\n5. Is there any way to buy something (house perhaps) to write off as an expense so I don't have to pay taxes, sell it, then buy it again right before tax season and keep repeating thus move to shelter taxes? Any other way of sheltering taxes?\n\nDisclaimer: I am not looking to evade taxes, only legally avoid them via any loopholes necessary.

I start at 3 pm and deliver 25 packages. So I work until I am done. It usually lasts 3 to 4 hours depending how far I drive. We use our personal vehicle and are not reimbursed for any expenses on our vehicle. I am averaging about 80 miles per day. I am getting $90 per day and can work everyday if I choose to. Most weeks I plan on working all 7 days so that's $630 per week. The thing is we are classified as 1099. I already talked to my \"boss\" per se about pay differences and wages for both as an employee and independent contractor. Due to many complications that doesn't involve our relationship, we agreed that being 1099 would make our process easier.\nI have been reading what I should be doing and figured out that I need to claim standard mileage deduction for my first year as a 1099 over actual expenses. \nI am not sure about how much money I should be saving for taxes and what other types of deductions I may be eligible for.

{"id":"46i9th","author":"chuckymcgee","body":"I've become rather intrigued by the Citi AT&amp;T Access More Card, even though I do not use AT&amp;T for cell service. Most interesting for me is its 3X TYPs on online retail purchases, worth effectively 4.8% if you also hold a Prestige. \n\nThis 3X card includes, among other things, Ebay, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, United Mileage Plus and Raise- effectively letting you get an extra 4.8% back on top of portal bonuses for just about any discounted gift card or item, netting you more on purchases that would have been otherwise on a non-bonused every-day card. It also can net 2.8% on your rent using Radpad, as mentioned in a previous post this week.\n\nThere is a $95 annual fee, but that's negated by the 10k/$160 bonus for spending at least 10k a year, which you'd almost certainly do just running your rent through Radpad. Plus Citi seems to be raining down retention bonuses even in the middle of the year, so more goodies on top of that. On the low end, this card will passively generate several hundred dollars a year with modest rent. A more active spender or MSer could push this card into the thousands.\n\nAs I had a basically unused Double Cash lying around with 26k CL (and no desire for a hard inquiry or the phone bonus), I felt like switching to tap into this extra cash and to take a bit of credit use off of some other cards. Conversion was an extremely easy, no hassle step that took all but a few minutes of talking to an agent and reading me the fine print. Annual fee will post a month out.\n\n**TLDR;** Prestige+ Access More+ Radpad==$hundreds of dollars/year, negative net annual fee; 4.8% on giftcards and loads of other online things for MS opportunities. Conversion is painless.\n\n**UPDATE:** It appears as though Citi has at the very least pulled some application links. Probably better to attempt to convert into this card sooner than later.","name":"t3_46i9th","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-02-19 02:51:46","week":7}

I'm not sure if it'd be worth using FBA or not.\n\nIt's going to be pretty time consuming, and I have two options:\n\n* **First Option (eBay):** Take pictures of every individual item, look up a price range for each item, and then create an eBay listing for each item.\n\nI don't mind doing fulfillment since I live walking distance from a post office, time isn't an issue for me.\n\n**Pros:** Higher margins than FBA\n\n**Cons:** Doesn't sell as quickly as FBA. MUCH more work involved.\n\n* **Second Option (Amazon FBA):** Determine exact condition of each item (not all are NIB), price each item appropriately, and post each item individually on Amazon.\n\n**Pros:** Sells much faster than eBay. Don't have to deal with fulfillment (which I prefer doing, if it means more $$)\n**Cons:** Lower margins, which means less $$ in my pocket. Equally tedious as eBay since I still have to price/post individual items.\n\n\nIt seems like FBA is only useful when time/fulfillment is an issue.

{"id":"46maa8","author":"glatts","body":"I recently started working with a Boston-based startup. We're still very early stage and looking to raise capital, but right now I'm focusing on our web presence. I've launched a search campaign that has been doing well on our limited budget (under $1 CPC, CTR between 2%-11%), but I'm not seeing it pan out on the back-end. On Google Analytics, our bounce rate with this campaign is 100% with 0 transactions.\n\nPerhaps this is just a factor of the traffic being too small to make a measurable impact, but I expected something better than those numbers, at least one conversion. Our previous campaigns went to our [Amazon product page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011VHB950), but we weren't able to track conversions through Amazon's website.\n\nWould anybody be willing to take a look at our [landing page](http://anchornutri.com/products/threepack) and offer advice on what I may not be seeing? \n\n-----\n\n**About the company/product:** Our company, Real Food Solutions, is looking to cure common ailments through all-natural food-based solutions. Our founder developed our first product after watching his sister and some friends become severely debilitated by nausea from morning sickness and as result of medical treatments while battling disease. His sister's symptoms were so bad that she was unable to go to work, and eventually lost her job. \n\nWorking with a Harvard Med School faculty member and gastroenterologist, they poured over clinical research, did some testing and created the Anchor Nutrition Bar. It's designed to prevent and alleviate nausea from motion sickness, morning sickness, and even hangovers. You can read more about it [here](http://anchornutri.com/pages/the-science) or [here](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/blog/2015/11/10/anchor-nutrition-bar/).\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT:** just want to thank everyone for your advice and comments. I'll look through them in more detail and type proper responses when I get home. Also, to be clear this isn't the home page, it's one of our product pages. It's where we're currently driving our paid search campaign. ","name":"t3_46maa8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-19 20:20:26","week":7}

I'm not necessarily chasing profits from the site, just testing out the world of marketing, setup, design, etc. I had multiple people recommend starting an affiliate site, because they're relatively simple as far as content goes.\n\nI've read just about every post and blog I can find about them, and I've gotten as far as I feel I can on my own. I've got my website up and hosted, gotten it on WordPress with a theme. From here, people say just put in your affiliate products with some reviews or posts, and play around with it from there to learn.\n\nThere's where my problem comes in. I can't find any affiliate programs that will let me sign up without a full site which already has relevant content on it, other than Clickbank, which doesn't have any products that I'd want to promote or be attached to. They're all e-products. I was hoping for Amazon, but they want a functioning website to pore over and approve. \n\nI don't want to waste my time making pages or reviews for products I won't get any commission on unless I have to. So for people in this area, how do you actually get affiliated with products to get the site started in the first place?\n\nEDIT: I guess I should say before the website is filled with content. It's already functional, just empty. It's on the default WP Coming Soon page for now.\n\nEDIT: I've also been recommended /r/affiliatemarketing which somehow I didn't notice before, so I'm x-posting there.","name":"t3_46xjw2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-21 23:04:00","week":7}

{"id":"d005psz","author":"garyh126","body":"I sold on eBay many years ago and was a power seller.  Here's my story.  \n\nAt that time 2005-2008, first I started selling items from retail arbitrage and garage sales.   Generated some decent sales and got some cash on hand.  But there were two problems: 1) unstable sources - cannot reliably count on retail arbitrage and garage sales for steady stream of product and it takes a lot of time to hunt them down; and 2) Took too much time to photo, write descriptions, and list.  In other words difficult to scale.  \n\nSo I pivoted to sourcing an item locally from a wholesaler. I bought a small batch 24 items and listed them online to test it.  They started selling so I bought more from the wholesaler and listed more variations (colors, sizes, etc).   Sales grew organically from there until I reached power seller status.  Rinse and repeat.  \n\nNow I no longer sell on eBay (Amazon is more lucrative).  \n\nAlso I attended eBay Live back in the day (not sure if it's still around).

{"id":"d006lg1","author":"oceanalwayswins","body":"For eBay, I'm wondering if putting them together in lots would be the best way to go, like lots of 3-6 bottles of nail polish. That may attract people better because of the cost to ship one bottle by itself. Because once you factor in the listing price and shipping, buyers might as well just go buy a bottle at the drug store. \n\nLike other beauty items from drug stores, so many people clip coupons in bulk and buy items in bulk for pennies. I've seen them then sell them dirt cheap at yard sales and flea markets, so that explains why there's so much competition on eBay. I think it boils down to how much you are getting each bottle for and what percentage you are paying of retail price. For me, if I was able to get $5 nail polish for a quarter, I'd totally put them in lots on eBay and be cool with $2-3 per bottle. I think the issue is how low nail polish sells for at retail prices. Even with Amazon, you're going to have to pay to ship and most people can't justify buying a single bottle of nail polish at what you'd consider a fair price and pay shipping... And there's no way you could ship for free and still profit.","name":"t1_d006lg1","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-15 02:49:45","week":7}
{"id":"d006qrd","author":"qumqam","body":"I wrote a longer bit above, but I disagree.\n\nWe as a society have stopped progressing in **physical** ways.  No more big advances in engines or chemistry.  Incremental ones.  Unless there is some big project that I'm missing (\"We'd only have fusion by now if we tripled its funding.\"), the problem here is more that the low hanging physical improvements have been picked.  \n\nBut in information processing, wow.  Wealth and allocation towards this has given us a connected world.  No more $1/minute phone calls across the state.  I can talk with people in the UK, China, anywhere, for virtually free.  No more out-of-date encyclopedias wastefully printed in every home.  Personally, I telecommute and that saves so much otherwise wasted energy.\n\nWe have shifted problems from the physical (build a better engine) to informational (use the engines we have more efficiently).\n\nAmazon doesn't succeed over mom and pop shops because we \"solely wish to create wealth\".  It succeeds because it is cheaper, which strongly implies it is more efficient.  No capital sunk into large stores, less stale inventory, better analytics, with a side bonus of better reviews and less buyer regret.  Yes it will use FedEx/UPS but this must be more efficient than shipping and holding at individual stores and driving to the mall to shop or Amazon would be out of business.\n\nNetflix didn't put Blockbuster out of business even though it \"served the same primary function\".  It succeeded because it was much more efficient to click a button (or use USPS) than to drive your emission-heavy car down to the mall and back.  Not to mention the unneeded production and shipping of CDs, DVDs, film, VHS, etc.  Yes, we have multiple media players, multiple gaming consoles, multiple TV or car manufactures.  This has nothing to do with modern technology and is more of a (generally seen as desirable) aspect of the free market.\n\nThis is /r/economics, so here is the thesis:  The \"importance of wealth\" leads to competition trying to improve inefficiencies.  These efficiencies will be either a savings in labor or in resources.  Any savings in resources *is* moving us towards a sustainable civilization.

I agree with the folks who are suggesting you get a part-time job - beermoney sites will be slow earners. \n\nHowever, if you're looking to earn a little something, I use Treasure Trooper - if you want to sign up under my ref link, PM me. This is taken from a post I made about the site. \n\nYou do surveys and offers, like many other beermoney sites. If you're under 18, you may have some difficulty qualifying for surveys, but don't despair - just keep trying. :)\n\n In line with its focus on 'treasure trooping', you can also earn gold coins (useful for the slot machine!), pearls (you can exchange 8 pearls for 2 referrals) and arrowheads (which can be exchanged for platinum coins or dragon scales). Platinum coins can be exchanged for Visa or Amazon gift cards, as well as e-Readers, gaming systems, and other prizes.\n\n\n\nWhat really makes this site special - the reason why it's the only GPT site I've stuck with - is its quirky, friendly feel, and unique RPG-like elements. A talented artist does all the site artwork, so it has a consistent feel - the dragon illustrations are excellent! (More about dragons later.)\n\n\n\nSpeaking of being a friendly site: the forum, and especially the chatroom, are helpful and awesome ways to get tips on earning. But! You can also earn extra prizes in forums and chat. There are contests in the forums for cash and other currencies. In the chatroom, you can receive daily prizes just for participating. There are hourly contests for those in the US who complete the most offers. Every week, there is a bingo night - you can win $5 or $10 prizes!\n\n\n\nAlong with forum and chat games, there is also a treasure hunt you can participate in, as well as a slot machine you can play every day for prizes.\n\n\n\nNow we come to one of my favourite features - the dragon game! You can hatch dragons, fight them to win prizes, and breed different types of dragons together to see which new and special kinds you can get. There's a fight night in chat every week where we battle our dragons. If you want to make some real cash, you can sell one dragon a month.\n\n\nIt's a unique and special GPT site, and the thrill of hunting for treasure still gets me every day.","name":"t1_d007t2a","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-15 03:27:14","week":7}

The vast majority of big option trades are hedged. There are often offsetting trades in other options, the underlying, futures, perhaps a pairs trade with another underlying.\n\nI see quite a bit of discussion about relatively complex trades for retail investors. For example, ThinkorSwim has a weekly segment on pairs trading. The segment is aimed at the small fish retail investor. An example of pairs trade might be shorting say GOOGL and being long AMZN or the reverse, or long GOOGL short SPY or the reverse. Another example might be long GDX, short GLD or short SLV. These are just made up examples. Someone tracking option activity in one of those underlyings can't possible figure out what the cross is. \n\nBottom line: option volume data is not actionable.

I would time my food money to last until payday. Even when I had a car, I was buying $5 or $10 worth of gas at a time, from whatever gas-station was closest, because I could not afford to burn the extra gas to fill up at the cheaper station without compromising my food, heating, or electricity, etc. Same with food: I would shop at the places I could walk to, either to save on gas or because I did not have a car. \n\nYou make different decisions when your resources only allow for a few days' survival at a time. Not because you are stupid, but because infinite risk changes the math. Downsides such as death, starvation, homelessness, etc do not fit well into conventional financial models. \n\nWhen you only have $50 to last you for the week, and no food and no car, you are not going to invest that $50 on a Costco membership. Neither are you going to save it for a car or a house, nor buy the 36-pack of TP on sale, nor are you going to spend $27 on cab fare to the higher-value supermarket across town. \n\nInstead, you are going to pay what they charge, for what you can piece together, at the corner store that you can walk to. Because that is the difference between making smart survival decisions, versus smart financial decisions.  \n\n&gt; For things like check cashing, though, who do you suggest provide this service free of charge?\n\nYou are the one trying to moralize a practical reality. That check-cashing services cost poor people a lot is just a factual observation. Nobody was saying it should be done for free, just pointing out one more hardship of being poor. \n\nPoor people have to pay to have their checks cashed. Nobody is saying that someone should do it for free, what we are saying is that people whose take-home is $200/week are hit proportionately harder by a $10 check-cashing fee or a payday loan, than affluent people like me, who get free interest-bearing checking accounts and Sapphire Cards with 3% cash back etc etc etc. \n\nIt's more expensive to be poor. I know, I have been there. The richer I get, the better the deals I get, in more ways than I can count or describe.

A big drop down and the premium might not make up for the drop in the stock.  So you keep the premium, but still have a long position that's underwater.\n\nPlus, if you're in somethign like an IRA, you can't sell the stock AH b/c then you'd be short the calls.   There have been some really strange things on ERs for GOOGL and AMZN the past year.   GOOGL went to like 845 AH, then dropped big time the week following.   One ER of AMZN last year saw a huge move up AH, then the next day it settled near the previous close the day of earnings.

{"id":"d02teo9","author":"Coronis12","body":"While I think you were going for humor, the design of this website combined with the brand name \"Lazy boyfriend\" and the tagline really doesn't strike that cord with me. Instead, it comes across as rather sleezy, I think the color of the website plays a big role in that, as the orange-wood-panel-and-beige design brings to mind images of fast food restaurants and hardware stores, not places you'd shop for gifts for a lady.\n\nSecond, by playing to the stereotype of a lazy boyfriend, I think you're going to alienate a lot of potential customers who might otherwise buy your product. Guys who are interested in a easy gift for their GF but don't want to be seen as thoughtless will be turned away by being seen as lazy, girls who are looking for gifts for their girlfriends will be turned away by the masculine-targetted language, and people who explore the internet looking for new products will be turned away by the usage of stereotypes.\n\nThirdly, and I think probably the biggest problem with the pitch is that by targeting \"Lazy boyfriends\" you run into the problem of not being visable, and the people who are lazy enough to want to buy a subscription to a site like this are going to be too lazy to search through dozens of web page results to find it. So unless you'd be able to get some very prominent visibility which would let you be discovered by your targeted demographic easily, I really can't see this campaign attracting a sustainable audience.\n\nOther concerns I have:\nThere's no way to tell what could be inside the box other than the image on the front page, so you're asking customers to pay 30$ for a pig in a poke. As far as I, a potential customer knows, you could be filling it with random junk you purchase at the dollar store and shipping it out (Not that you'd do that, but I've been burned by similar subscription services who use that tactic in the past). \n\n2. 30$ is a significant amount when you bear in mind the competition, IE: Amazon and ebay. Given that on those two you can purchase four CDs or movies and have them delivered to your house within two days, why would a consumer decide to purchase your box over their products?\n\n3. The request to subscribe to your newsletter pops up consistently, impedes my ability to browse your site and is very annoying. I'd suggest you get rid of it and make it so that there's a checkbox to subscribe to the newsletter at checkout.\n\n","name":"t1_d02teo9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-17 05:01:45","week":7}

{"id":"d03bfk0","author":"SsurebreC","body":"Oh boy...\n\nTo be honest, it's a good thing you're worrying about this now than in a decade but your parents really goofed and should have told you all this earlier. Like a decade ago. But what's done is done.\n\nIt's good that you feel guilty but there's a simple solution: stop doing things that make you feel guilty. If your issue is spending too much money, figure out where the waste is. For example, you mentioned eating out, buying stuff from Amazon, and seems like budgeting is a problem ($100 headphones, wow).\n\nSo rather than go on an immediate deep freeze, you need to figure out what you're actually doing. You start by going through the statements and have your parents help. Tell them that you need to do this to take charge of finances and it'll help them since they'll pay less money (and hopefully no money later on). Ask them to help you out - hopefully they know what they're doing too.\n\nStart out by grouping your expenses into categories such as:\n\n* eating out in general (with subcategories for stuff like Starbucks vs. dining)\n* Amazon and similar impulse purchases\n* large-ticket items (ex: those headphones)\n\nOnce you realize how much money you're spending on each one, you can then make cuts. Say you're going to Starbucks 7 times a week where you spend $50 (I don't know how much they cost, I've never gone to Starbucks). Cut that down to 5 and stop making it a habit as \"this is what I do\". Instead, question why you're doing it.\n\nSame with the rest - ask yourself why you need this. For example, are the Amazon things really things you need? How about this: prevent yourself from going to Amazon for a few weeks and unsubscribe from any sales-related emails from them.\n\nFor headphones, simply shop around but start with \"do I really need this\"? Assuming you do then shop around. I buy my gaming headphones (noise cancellation with mic) from BJ's for $20 and they lasted 3 years so far. Don't buy \"brands\", buy practical items (ex: don't buy Beats).\n\nThen, after your first month of doing this, take stock of the new balance and see how much you saved. Take pride in yourself. Depending on your relationship with your parents, ask if you can get those savings added into your bank account (which you must already have - a personal account). Then, as you continue to cut, ask for less and less money so you're still saving them money but you're getting a personal benefit out of it.\n\nIs it out of the question for you to get a part time job? Anything really. It'll go a long way towards making you feel the value of money. If you get a job for $10/hour then you'll really appreciate the value of working for over 10 hours just to buy one set of $100 headphones.\n\nAsk your parents if you can start paying for some of these bills yourself, even if it means your parents give you money to pay for them. This way you become more involved with the process rather than having someone else do the work for you. You might want to start with that - get your own bank account and credit card and make yourself pay for it all. Have your parents help out but since you'll be cutting things, they'll ultimately pay less and you'll all work out.\n\nAs far as cooking, there are tons of YouTube videos and ask your parents for help there too. There are a lot of online resources and start with the basics (ex: eggs, cooking meat, making pasta, veggies, etc). Don't go all crazy, do it one thing at a time. Heck, surprise your parents by making them food as a way to give them thanks.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to tell yourself that you can do it and take charge of your life. Then open a bank account if you haven't already (do this TODAY). Talk to your parents about your own credit card (they can help with which ones they use and you can simply give them a call). Your parents can co-sign if you have no income but it needs to be YOUR card rather than you being an authorized user on theirs.\n\nChat with your parents - don't forget that this will help them too. You're upper middle class - the money you're spending does actually affect them so they should also be supportive.\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_d03bfk0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-17 17:22:02","week":7}

But actually, neither of these lines gives you a good sense of what’s really going on.\n\n&gt; So where’s all the extra capex going? And, crucially, does it need to stay at these new, higher levels to support Amazon's business, or can it come back down in the future?\n\n&gt; It’s pretty apparent that the money is going into more fulfillment capacity (warehouses, to put it crudely) and to AWS. Hence, this chart shows an enormous increase in Amazon’s physical infrastructure, as measured in square feet - this is almost all fulfillment rather than data centers, though Amazon no longer gives a split.\n\nAlso, Amazon spends, on average, $1 billion/quarter in capital expenditures: http://csimarket.com/stocks/single_growth_rates.php?code=AMZN&amp;capx","name":"t1_d03lut2","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-17 21:19:05","week":7}

Just as I use Amazon and say, wow, this is the future (although the company's financials aren't to nice). Many see Tesla's and say, wow this is the future - I am going to invest in this because I think it is here to stay.\n\nThey are coming out with a new car that many see as what is going to make/break the company, apparently going to release what exactly it looks like within the upcoming month; he confirmed that the price was in the expected range recently; it makes absolute sense that some would risk it and say: I am going to invest before they release what the model 3's specs next month as the price range is a decent sign that we can expect what we were told to expect from it.\n\nYes it is risky, but r/investing cannot get over the idea that \"chevy or x, y, and z) can \"easily\" \"overnight\" destroy tesla because it's o so large and yada yada.\n\nTesla was the first American car company since Ford to go public, and it is the first car company in a long time to do business in this country. New car companies don't just prop up. This company is unique and there is \"no one\" in its class. I understand that a new car company with a technology no one else offers is something different to grasp and something r/investing and r/cars are hesitant about but people have the right to be excited and invest in this company as there is currently no substitute to tesla, not even the chevy volt.\n\nWe are not talking hybrids here. There is no other company on earth with a fully electric car line, infrastructure to power the cars throughout the world, the cars look decent to most, and has them hot and rolling out of the oven.\n\nTesla is unlike any other and you cannot look at it with the eyes you look at all others. It is doing very well for a new car company, better than others.\n\nI don't believe it is going anywhere and I believe it will only get better, that is reason to invest in it.

It's nothing personal and apparently that's how you're taking it.\n\nWhat are you talking about? My comment wasn't highlighted as being from a moderator, nor did I allude to being a moderator, and I would have made the same comment if I weren't a moderator or if we were in another sub.\n\nIf I was taking this as a personal attack I might have taken action under rule 1, which I didn't. Note that I didn't downvote your post either, for the same reason I don't think it was right to downvote mine (and others' who had the same experience I did).\n\n&gt; If someone wrote they advise calling the bank to ask if their PayPal deposit satisfied their DD requirement they'd get down voted. This is no different.\n\nOf course it's different. Someone doing this would attract unwanted attention that might affect all of us in a negative way. I don't see how suggesting a website over another to sell gift cards has any effect on the community.\n\n&gt; Also, I'm not going to get into an argument over who has what data points. I'm not a man on a smear campaign. I've sold A LOT of gift cards to cardcash and as such I put my 2 cents in.

I still use them but they're not my go-to exchange.\n\nThat's great, and thanks for sharing.\n\n&gt; All I was trying to do was use my experience and chime in to help others and one of the ways to do that is through upvoting good comments and downvoting bad ones.\n\nSo my comment was a \"bad one\" because my experience doesn't reflect yours? Does that mean your comment was a \"bad one\" because your experience doesn't reflect mine? Are we all just supposed to downvote whichever comment doesn't reflect our experience and trust the ones that received the least number of downvotes? Sounds very negative and this is *definitely* not what the upvote / downvote system is for.\n\nWhen reading the reviews of an item on Amazon.com, do you also click the \"unhelpful\" button on every negative review if you've had a good experience with said item?\n\nYou're supposed to downvote comments that are off-topic or do not contribute to the subreddit. I don't believe either of our comments qualify since both of them reflect our experience with a particular website, which is what OP asked, and even if our experiences differ I think OP benefits from hearing both and therefore neither comments should be downvoted.","name":"t1_d047hkg","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-02-18 06:43:21","week":7}

I understand why others would choose the Free Shipping, but consider this --\n\nSonja is looking for a package of chocolates that she wants shipped to her mother.  Sonja is not a prime member, so she is a savvy shopper instead and sorts the results by cost of product+shipping to get the lowest price for her chocolates.  As a result, the seller whose price is the lowest including shipping will get Sonja's attention.\n\nJoe also doesn't have prime and is shopping for the same chocolates.  He's not so savvy, and just knows that he doesn't want to pay for shipping.  He selects Free Shipping, and the seller whose price is the lowest with no shipping cost is the one that gets his attention.  \n\nKaren is the least savvy of all, arguably.

If that just HAPPENS to encompass what Sonja and Joe are looking for, that's fine, but as an FBA seller, I am only interested in getting Karen's attention.

Forget assets, this sounds like a spending problem. Figure out monthly expenses and compare that to income. Rent/mortgage, utilities, entertainment (TV, Internet, subscriptions, etc), phones, and even factor in annual expenses like vehicle registration and AAA or Amazon Prime.

Those don't have good interest rates (not that I've seen anyway). That will grow as well. \n\nLong story short, first figure out what you're spending.

{"id":"d04vjcv","author":"BZLuck","body":"1. Impossible to estimate without knowing your expenses.\n\n2. Yes. California doesn't care where you shipped the items to, they want their sales tax if it was sold in California . (Just google Amazon and California sales taxes. There was a big case about this just a few years ago and Amazon gave up and complied.)\n\n3. (and 4) Starting a corporation, or anything other than a sole proprietorship has some great advantages, but also a lot of responsibilities.\n\nThe biggest advantage to owning and running a legitimate business is that your end objective is to get the company to spend the money that would normally be going into your pocket that you would have to report as income. To you, it's income. To a company it's an expense.\n\nFor example, if the company can afford it, lease yourself a car. This gets you a car to drive, reduces your income and provides the company with a tax deduction. The insurance and maintenance on that car are deductible too. Same thing with health insurance. You get the company to pay for it so it never even goes into your pocket, thus it never becomes taxable income on your personal tax return.\n\nWhen you own a business you want to put as little money into your own pocket via a paycheck as possible.\n\nI owned 2 companies (4 person LLC and 2 person S-Corp) for almost 20 years. If the companies are making money, all is good. If they are not (at least in California, where I am too) you still have to pay estimated state taxes based on the prior years returns.\n\nWhen an LLC or a Corporation does their taxes, they generate a K-1 form. That K-1 form is filed, but nothing is paid because the profit and loss are transferred to each owning partner to add to their personal 1040's. If the company owes, you owe. If the company ran at a loss (not uncommon at all) you get the tax deduction.\n\nLast year I sold one company and closed up the other. I now work for the company that bought the one business. This is the first time I've had a W-2 in almost 25 years. I did my personal taxes for the first time this year too. \n\nIt was a shocker to see how few deductions I now have. ALL of those things that my company used to pay for and was able to get tax credit for, are now coming straight out of my pocket.\n\nFive. (The formatting is getting funky) If you have a legitimate business (license, DBA, resellers license, bank account, etc.) you can buy a lot of personal things. Wait, not necessarily buy, but rent or lease. You want to buy a house through the company? Not a good idea. However you can deduct some of your mortgage payment if you use part of your house (den and garage maybe?) for business, add up the square feet and get deducting. \n\nThat is if you don't already rent an office or other space to do that in. Same applies for utility bills. Need internet? Check. Write some of that off. Need to run electricity for equipment? Check. Some of that too. Every penny spent on shipping is a deduction. if you track it and keep the receipts. So is gas if you make deliveries. (Too many things to list!)\n\nIn a very brief explanation, that's how it's done and the advantages of becoming a legitimate business.","name":"t1_d04vjcv","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-18 20:33:09","week":7}

[source](http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/30/news/companies/amazon-warehouse-workers/index.html) \n\nIn addition, Amazon is famous for their horrible working conditions. Just google, there are countless articles.\n\nDue to the Affordable Care Act, both companies are required to provide workers that work over 30 hours a week health care benefits. \n\nI am not trying to make a case for Walmart, but if you are shopping at Amazon to avoid the evils of Walmart, you are just supporting a larger devil.\n\nedit, fixed formatting a few times.

I might be downvoted for this, and let me preface it by saying I have loved and lost the only cat in this world for me, but still have two dogs that I adore. If nothing had happened to your pet, you'd have spent $600 this year on pet health insurance with nothing to show for it. Say the cat lives 15 years, and gets hit by a car without ever needing your pet insurance, that is $9,000 you'd have spent. At least with other monthly fees, you'd arguably be offsetting costs of other fees, like Netflix lets you cut cable, PSN/Xbox live saves on entertainment, etc.\n\nIn that worst case scenario, you can get a new cat for $10 on Craigslist, and still have $8,910 over 15 years that you could've spent on other things. It seems a small amount of money, $25/mo, but if you have three or four of these amounts each month, it quickly adds up to a larger portion of your whole budget without you even realizing it.\n\nFor example, monthly subscriptions my family most likely has/had/may have had active at a time:\n\n* Netflix - $12\n\n* Amazon Prime - $12\n\n* CostCo/BJ's (Sam's membership considerably cheaper) - $4.58\n\n* XBOX Live/PSNetwork - $12\n\n* HBO Go - $15 \n\n\n","name":"t1_d05sg89","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-19 14:05:48","week":7}

I will be 100% debt free at the end of this month. I do not plan on getting any new cards until my debt is paid off. That being said, I was stupid a few weeks ago and applied for the CSP. I was obviously denied because I had only had the Slate for less than a month. It was also stupid since my highest credit limit at the time was almost maxed out. I'm sitting at 10% utilization right now.\n\nOnce the debt is paid off, I was thinking of cancelling the JCPenney Card. I honestly don't need it, its lowering my AAoA and it was really only applied for to save the 100 or so I got on the first purchase (...what a waste of a hard pull). I wanted to then PC the Slate to the Freedom since the Slate is pretty useless to have just sitting around. I then would like to get the Sapphire Preferred.\n\nMy Questions are as follows:\nAre there any data points suggesting that Chase 5/24 rule is only for cards you received or is it based on hard pulls? I have 5 Hard Pulls on my account but only three cards in the last two years.\n\nIs it possible to PC the Slate and then soon after apply for the Chase Sapphire Preffered?\n\nI also have been seriously looking at the American Express PRG. I chatted with customer service today and she seemed confident that I would get approved, but applying for a card with them when I haven't even gone one statement period seems stupid.\n\nI know of the AMEX 3X CLI after 60 days but I was wondering if I should take advantage of that when it comes around? If I choose to get the PRG, should I still ask for the CLI? If I get the PRG should I PC this to the EDP? I really like the 6% on groceries since that is honestly one of my largest expenses right now.\n\nI'm asking this because I am planning a lot of travel related things right now, I took this semester off to work and travel. I have a trip to Miami, LA, London, and a Road Trip to Colorado in the next two- three months. I really really want to get a rewards credit card to maximize the rewards I get on this travel, while it would be nice to fund the trips with the points I'm really looking to use the money I'm going to spend to save points for a future trip.\nHelp!

{"id":"d06tws4","author":"grackychan","body":"Yahoo had an opportunity to shift gears into what Amazon does with AWS and Microsoft with Azure. Except they're both geared towards mid to large enterprises. Yahoo had the opportunity to bring a host of cloud services, co hosting, virtualization, encryption, authentication, you name it, to the small business sphere, and grow upon that to serve larger and larger enterprises thereby taking market share from Amazon and Microsoft. \n\nYahoo had acquired a Dropbox competitor and a Docusign competitor in that time frame, but they never integrated and expanded into a full blown small business tech solution. They did have a captive market of existing business accounts with which to experiment expansion in the web services field but Meyer chose not to continue it. Instead of emulating Amazon or Microsoft she chose to emulate the super super saturated market of entertainment and media which has been around a helluva lot longer than Yahoo. It was a bad blunder and now the core business is dying. \n\nI'll agree that 2012 was a turning point that would set Yahoo upon a path to success or failure. Businesses tend to pay and pay a lot for good technology - I just wish Yahoo had been able to leverage their acquisitions into becoming a business services co. Too bad it ended up this way. I always thought they should've invested in providing a consolidated SaaS platform for every tech related business need - from communications to hosting to accounting, payroll, e-contracts, planning and scheduling, CRM, and other services which many companies pay many seperate entities for.

Cons: hasn't a minimal free plan as Mail Chimp, don't fool with payments they'll shutdown the account in 3-5 days.\nThey don't work with niches such as forex, pharma etc, if you are in that market. contact them before signing up.\n\nBASECAMP !!!!\nwithout basecamp I could run out of business in 3 hours, totally flexible, fun to use.

{"id":"d06xygj","author":"davidivadavid","body":"Interesting concept. I'm not sure selling online is the best way to go, but let's look at your landing page.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that this is not an \"actual\" landing page.\n\nLet me be pedantic for a few minutes: technically, any page where users landing when they go through an ad is called a \"landing page\", because that's where they land. \n\nHowever, a landing page is supposed to be a *self-contained* sales piece that describes your product in details, its benefits, the problems it solves, etc. and then asks for a sale. That's why bounce rates on a landing page are irrelevant. People *are* supposed to bounce (or buy).\n\nBut what we have here is a typical e-commerce product page.\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nE-commerce product pages are generally what people look at when: a) they already know the product, or b) they already want to buy it, or c) they already have a pretty good idea what the product is.\n\nSo, the problem here is the *level of awareness* of your audience.\n\nIf the traffic you drove to your page already knew there was such a thing as a bar that could cure their nausea, you could use a page like yours, potentially.\n\nBut the fact is they probably don't. So you need to *educate* them about your product and its benefits before you can even hope to sell them anything. But NOTHING does that on your current landing page! \n\nThat's the problem with any product in a new category. You need a longer landing page than you would if you were selling a generic product.\n\nEven assuming you're driving traffic from \"how to stop morning sickness\", your page doesn't address that head on, as the bar is presented as a \"nutrition bar\". It should be presented as an anti-nausea bar. (I know it's in the logo/title, but people generally ignore that).\n\nThe worst thing is that your site has all the elements you need to build a really solid landing page (you've got scientific proof of efficacy, testimonials, a cool name/branding, etc.) but as of now, your Amazon page is a lot more complete, *and* has the customer reviews.\n\nWhat you need is to build a single, thorough sales pages out of these elements, and that addresses your customer at his level of awareness. For example, if you're buying keywords about nausea, your landing page headline should not be something like \"Pack of 3 Anchor Nutrition Bars™ $ 11.99\", because people aren't ready to buy yet!\n\nIt should be something like \"What if you could stop your nausea right away, simply by eating a delicious, all-natural nutrition bar?\" and then explain how you do that, describe the product in details, give testimonials, and link to the different offers (3 pack, box, whatever).\n\nHope that helps, tell me if you need more details. :)","name":"t1_d06xygj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-20 11:52:57","week":7}

I want to know that at the end of this month I can have saved $1500 if we stick to the cash flow plan.\n\nSo I have a spreadsheet for each month with columns for (in order left to right) date, income, expense, name of bill/category (Comcast or food or Husband salary), balance and notes. The balance formula is entered in every like 5 lines or something.\n\nIncome is in green. Expenses are in red if mandatory, blue if optional.\n\nI print it each month and cross out transactions as they happen. I'm not adding in lines for when I bought tea at the airport or even went out for dinner, but I will write in the current balance if it differs greatly from what my cash flow plan shows. \n\nIt's manual but not intense at all.

My credit card company has some protections and stuff, sure, \n\nYour credit card has ideal protections. If your card is stolen or used maliciously then you will be refunded everything. In most cases, it happens instantly because the fraud is obvious. *They* call *you* to alert you to the suspicious charge before you even knew your account was compromised. The simple fact is, the percent they make on online transactions is way the hell more than the bit they have to pay back when a card number is stolen. For now anyways, the credit card companies are happy to provide blanket protection for consumer accounts. \n\nIf you don't want to use yours, fine, I understand that. Why even risk the potential hassle of dealing with banks over this stupid shit when you can just use PayPal? But if you really want something, and the only way to pay is Visa... really, how often do you just pull it out and buy it? \n\nEven you don't, there are still ways for a retailer to get to a place you can trust, and that is cheap for them. They can sell through Amazon using Amazon Procurement or they can run their store off of a Shopify or the like, so you know the payment processor is working for someone else, someone impartial. \n\nThe point of both replies is, there are lots of options for payment processors. If cash flow is part of your business and PayPal has a reputation for freezing cash, what's to ask? The only way PayPal becomes a perfect solution is if they make both customers *and* vendors perfectly happy with the outcome. For my money, the conventional credit card processors are still better at that equation.","name":"t1_d07tfkj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-21 05:46:24","week":7}

{"id":"d07xteg","author":"_rectify_","body":"Here are a few ideas that require a little bit of work but can lead to decent money:\n\n1. Capture e-mail addresses. This will open up many doors. A simple way to do this is to offer a free insider's guide to the best courses for whatever (e.g., low cost, high cost, best views, best in area, etc.). This will also help you segment your market.\n\n2. Hook up with courses to offer packages to your site/list. You can get some sort of commission or discount on purchases (e.g,. you can buy a regular weekday round for $80 but sell it for $100). You can offer these to your mailing list or just advertise on your site. \n\n3. Tell your site and/or mailing list about new equipment and/or teaching tools and sell said goods. You can do this via something like Amazon affiliate or (better yet) Amazon FBA if you have the money.\n\n4. Straight up sell advertising slots on your site. 10k might not be terribly compelling for advertisers unless your hits convert like crazy. \n\n5. Figure out who those 10k hits are. I am not sure how you measure your hits, but quite a few of those hits might be crawlers and scrapers.\n\n6. Figure out what people are coming to your site for and how they are coming to your site (e.g., what keywords from Google) and start creating content that will bring in more of those visitors. Increasing your uniques will give you many more options.\n\nBest of luck!","name":"t1_d07xteg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-21 08:59:13","week":7}

{"id":"d08d2io","author":"imnotminkus","body":"Flea/tick:  \n\n1. I use Frontline Plus/its generics.  It's a topical liquid, and the active ingredients are fipronil (kills adult fleas/ticks/lice) and (S)-methoprene (kills eggs/adolescent fleas/ticks/lice).  I mention this because bugs in some areas of the country/world are more resistant to those active ingredients than others.  I live in Northeast Ohio and they seem to work just fine.  \n\n2.  Ask your vet about switching to Frontline for cost savings.  See if there's any valid objection.\n\n3.  Check Amazon's prices.  Buy in bulk - keep it in a cool, dry, dark place and it'll last years.\n\n4.  Check generics.  Walmart and Sam's Club sell \"PetArmor Plus\" - it has the exact same amount of the same active ingredients as Frontline Plus, but it costs less.  My local Sam's has 6 doses of PetArmor for $35, or 3 doses of Frontline Plus for the same price.\n\n4.  What's your dog's weight?  The Frontline Plus for 89-132 lb dogs is often the same price/slightly more than the 5-32 lb box, but the bigger one has 6 times the active ingredients.  Divide doses accordingly.  My dogs use one 89-132 lb dose combined, so I use a full vial at a time.  If it doesn't work out that perfectly, store partially-used vials upright in an airtight bag in a cool, dry, dark place.  I also wrap clear tape around them once before putting in the bag.\n\n\nHeartworm:\n\n1.  Again, ask your vet about switching to Heartgard (ivermectin).  [Some herding dogs/mixes have a genetic defect that that results in ivermectin sensitivity](https://www.petcarerx.com/article/ivermectin-intolerance-in-collies-and-other-dogs/750).  [You can test your dog for $70 to be sure](http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu/).\n\n2.  Unfortunately, the \"dividing doses\" trick doesn't work as well for heartworm protection.  Also, ivermectin requires a prescription for use in dogs, likely because the dog must be confirmed heartworm-negative (either with a test or continuous previous use of heartworm prevention), because giving it to an infected dog needs to be done under vet supervision or very bad things can happen.  So, you can't buy it online as easily, but if your vet will give you a prescription, check prices online.\n\n3.  Since ivermectin for use in livestock doesn't require a prescription, there are a few horse/sheep/goat heartworm products you can use.  I use [horse paste](http://www.amazon.com/Ivermectin-Paste-Dewormer-6-08g-Flavor/dp/B000HHLWPI) and calculate dosage accordingly.  A $2.50-$5 tube will last years.  None of my dogs have herd dog in them (2 are obvious, the other was confirmed by a genetic test).
