{"id":"4aew3j","author":"CrossTit","body":"This last year I was hired to run a 4th location for a decent size wholesaler in Texas. I have been doing research on ways to further increase our sales and noticed that on Amazon one particular line of our product has consistently better margins. The 2 biggest hindrances I see to making a consistent profit is the shipping cost and Amazon fees, but being a wholesaler with considerable buying power we might be able to do better with the costs. All of our shipping now is handled with our own trucks, but now that we would be selling to individuals through Amazon and we would need to use a shipping service.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience with getting package shipping rates with UPS/FedEx/etc? \n\nDoes anyone have experience with getting lower seller fees with Amazon?

{"id":"4af3nm","author":"qvplite","body":"Hey guys. I’m writing to share the details of my recent success story as an independent author. Hopefully this will help some of you who are interested in publishing. :)\n\nAfter publishing my first book in Dec 2014, for a long time I only sold 5-10 copies/mo. By contrast, this past month (February 2016) my results were:\n\n*-Sold over 1,000 copies of my three books (digital + print combined)*  \n*-Had an additional 100,000+ pages read through Kindle Unlimited/KOLL*  \n*-Earned over $5K in royalties from $7.5K in total sales*  \n*-Achieved #1 Best-Seller spot in all assigned categories (all three books)*  \n*-Launched to #4 Best-Selling authors in all Business &amp; Money*  \n*-Gained 500 new email subscribers on my author blog/website*  \n*-Maintained higher author rank than Donald Trump the entire month! (haha)* \n\nNow before I go any further, let me tell you right off the bat - there were no \"silver bullets.\" The truth is that it took hard work, experimentation, wasted marketing dollars, continuous learning, and a healthy dose of frustration since beginning this journey two years ago.\n\nFor that matter, I think the real lesson here is that *persistence finally paid off*.\n\nI refused to give up and kept exploring opportunities for marketing and sales, and have finally found a process that is working (at least for now). It’s working well enough, anyways, to have kept all of my books in #1 spots throughout the entire month of February, when I was firing on all cylinders.\n\nHere are a few things I learned, which may also help you if going down the same path:\n\n**1. Persistence paid off.**  \nWhen I wrote my first book two years ago, it was a New Years Resolution of mine to become a published author. The idea of holding my own book in my hands was the prize. At the time, I didn't dream of grabbing any best-seller spots. It was simply a bucket list project.\n\nBut after publishing this book, even with no marketing effort I was making about $40/mo in passive income. This got me thinking, “What if I published a few more of these and multiplied that figure by 4-5x? It’d be nice to have a few hundred bucks coming in…”\n\nAt the same time, I was preparing to leave my full-time job and open my own consulting firm. It occurred to me, then, that perhaps I could write a short book about the business planning process I used to make that transition - so I did. And since then, I’ve published a third book and am working on a fourth. Progress is gradual but I’m doing my best to stay focused - and persistent.\n\n**2. Market research is important.**  \nProbably no big surprise here, but market research matters. The first thing I do when evaluating market opportunities now is look at search volume in Google’s keyword planner. Less than 50K searches per month might mean too small of a market, whereas anything over 100K or so might be getting too broad. (This, by the way, is something I learned from a pricey online course I purchased to learn how to publish online). People tend to buy books for a specific reason, which is why focused-topic books sell better. I could be wrong, but it seems the 50-100K search range is optimal. There are other tools I use for market research, but this is a good starting point. If you care about sales, there is no point writing a book where no market exists for it.\n\n**3. Title and cover design are huge.**  \nWe all know that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover (or title). Yet that’s exactly what we do, isn’t it? There is an abundance of research showing more than 50% of the buying decision comes down to title and cover. Whether this is accurate or not doesn’t matter to me; it’s still a best practice to have a reasonably good looking cover, and a title that accurately describes what the book is about. If you’re not sure what a good cover looks like, just look at the current best-sellers list or walk into a bookstore and look at what others are doing. I’m sorry this particular point isn’t more insightful, but despite its simplicity it does carry a lot of weight.\n\n**4. Action trumps perfection.**  \nMy first book was a major effort. It took nearly one year to write. My editor went through five rounds of edits with me. Everything was done “by the book.” From the copyright to the ISBN number… from the Library of Congress submission to publication online… it was extremely time-consuming.\n\nMaybe this is how it’s supposed to be. But maybe not.\n\nConsider the sales performance of my second and third books. Each of them took far less time to write and publish. There were steps I skipped for each, and each book has gotten a little shorter. Yet these books have sold more copies in a few months than my first book ever has in its lifetime.\n\nThat being said, there are definitely trade-offs.\n\nMy third book verges on being too short and not useful enough. It was always meant to be an introductory guide, but some readers have felt it’s still a bit thin. These are points well made and I am grateful for the feedback.\n\nMy second book has gotten plenty of positive praise, but it still might have benefited from improvement. For instance, another round of editing and more information on business validation.\n\nBut what if in the pursuit of perfection, these titles were still unpublished? Last month wouldn’t have happened and I would not have gathered valuable reader feedback.\n\nJust like with persistence, there is a balance that must be found. Namely, the balance between “getting it done” and “getting it done right.” Lean too far towards the former and you risk putting out shit. Lean too far towards the latter and you risk never putting anything out at all.\n\nWhat I have learned in such situations is action always trumps perfection, though. I’d rather make some progress than be paralyzed forever. I'd rather publish, then feel out through real life feedback where the balance should be in the future.\n\n**5. Investment is the difference between hobby and business.**  \nWhat truly brought me to the next level with this was financial investment into marketing and promotions. There are a number of companies, bloggers, and industry providers that provide marketing and promotion services. Here are some that I've used: BookBub, Goodreads, NetGalley, and Amazon.\n\nOne of my favorite things has been free giveaways through Goodreads, because even though those don’t drive many sales, they do help with reviews which affects sales. Along those same lines I’ve even reached out to a handful of select individuals on forums including this one, giving away free copies in exchange for feedback.\n\nLet me be clear, though, that on top of the free giveaways - I have also put well over a thousand dollars into marketing at this point. I’m in the green when you take into account my sales, but the marketing investment was still a risk and your mileage may vary (even my mileage varies from title to title).\n\nThe deal is, though, is if you’re not willing to put chips on the table then you don’t get to play the game - and truly, this marks the difference between hobby and business. For a long time I simply wasn’t willing to put money behind my books, but after I did things improved measurably. It’s true that I have wasted some dollars along the way, but without trying things I wouldn’t have discovered what worked.\n\n**Last but not least, here is the exact process I use to produce new titles. Hopefully this gives you some insight into the steps required / what order to do them in:**\n\n*-Identify book concept / title*  \n*-Perform keyword research*  \n*-Design kindle cover*  \n*-Write book using CreateSpace template*  \n*-Save 2nd copy as kindle version (extra spaces removed)*  \n*-Create lead magnet on my author site*  \n*-Create and publish landing page on my author site*  \n*-Create and publish download page on my author site*  \n*-Create autosponder for my author site*  \n*-Edit book (content edits, copy edits)*  \n*-Apply for copyright (optional)*  \n*-Apply for LOC# (Library of Congress)*  \n*-Publish on kindle*  \n*-Design CreateSpace cover*  \n*-Order and approve CreateSpace proof*  \n*-Send copy of paperback to LOC*  \n*-Solicit a handful of reviews / give away free copies*  \n*-Host Goodreads Giveaways*  \n*-Being promotions / marketing campaigns*  \n*-Design ACX / Audible cover*  \n*-Record to ACX / Audible*  \n\n\nAMA.

This is my first identity theft I've been a victim of and I don't know anyone that personally has been affected either.**\n\n\nThe Fraud Resolution hotline states they will help me with the following:\n\n**1. Notify banks, creditors and service providers**\nWe'll be on the phone with you to assist with notifying your creditors, medical benefits company, your bank or other financial institutions, and your utilities. And if correspondence by mail is required, we'll draft letters for you to sign.\n\n**2. Place fraud alerts on your credit report**\nWe'll help you place an immediate, 90-day alert on your credit report at all three major credit bureaus, to warn lenders and other potential credit grantors that you may be a victim of identity theft. Plus, we'll help you renew the fraud alert if necessary, or add a 7-year alert if your identity proves to have been stolen.\n\n**3. Report the fraud to government agencies**\nWe walk you through the steps of contacting your local law enforcement agency to file a report regarding the fraudulent activity. This report becomes your official \"Identity Theft Report\" a document that creditors and credit bureaus may ask for. If you wish to file a report with the Federal Trade Commission, we'll help you with that too.\n\n**4. Check your credit reports**\nIn the event of an identity theft, we'll review your Experian, TransUnion and Equifax files with you so we can help you identify possible fraudulent activity you may be unaware of. We'll immediately get started helping you resolve any issues we find.\n\n**5. Cancel or request new credit, debit or insurance cards**\nDepending on the situation, you may need to cancel or change some or all of your accounts as a result of the identity theft. We'll help you determine which accounts to close. We'll guide you through contacting your card issuers, medical benefits companies and/or financial institutions to close your current accounts, report stolen checks, stop payments on outstanding checks you've written (if necessary) and transfer any recurring charges from your old accounts to new ones.\n\n**6. Secure and reclaim your identity**\nWe'll help you gather the necessary information you'll need to make telephone calls or to send letters to your creditors, your bank, the credit bureaus, and any others who may be involved in the process of securing and reclaiming your identity.\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!  \n\n\n*TL/DR is the bolded sentence(s) before the enumerated list.*","name":"t3_4alura","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-16 03:40:07","week":11}

For personal reasons I already plan to be visiting there soon, but given various factors I am considering moving to that country (quasi?)permanently. It is an island nation so doing Import Export business seems to be a logical field to look into if I want to be entrepreneurial.\n\nOn a shoe string budget I'd like some guidance on realistic goals for setting up income from Import/Export such as being a Manufacturing Rep or ETC (Ideally I'd like to find markets for USA goods, for instance).\n\nIs that the right level of the import export game to link into? What questions should I be asking? Are there any available case studies, books, or perhaps a Tech College degree that would be exceptionally useful before I dive into this endeavor?\n\nI basically want to do Mfg Rep or something like that which requires little initial overhead. I don't have that much industry experience in any one field, I'm looking more to be a general sales-person, figuring out what the needs are in my new target country and then find suppliers.\n\nWhile my initial capital is low, I do have SOME experience. I have lived in the target country, have overseen the import of electronics to that country as part of a previous job there, and generally have a few contacts in the target country's Ministry of Health.\n\nI've also just recently met a gentleman who exports orthopedic medical equipment to Europe and and interested in letting me take some sample goods on my next visit to my wife/family etc to see if I can gin up some interest for buyers there. But I figure if it will be a long trip there, I should branch out into examining many different markets, not limited to medical. There are quite a few I've already thought about for years that I'd like to get into, I feel I need some structure to examine and validate the markets while I am visiting.\n\nSo **TL;DR - I want to go to another country and sell goods from the USA (or at least from outside that country) but more on commission, not necessarily have to handle the warehousing and some of the deeper logistical and other issues (at least at first) that require steep capital investment. What is the best way to do this? What do you call this? How do I properly prepare for starting to do this?**\n\nHelp! Thanks.\n\nPS - Just thought of this, as a metaphor. I used to do affiliate marketing online and rather than go to each individual product's mfg it was much eaiser to become an Amazon affiliate, or a Click-bank affiliate, and then go in that marketplace to choose what I was going to re-sell or affiliate with. I obviously am aware of Alibaba, but I was wondering if there was some sort of service I could link into for tangible goods from say USA, or exporters who operate on multiple markets and would assist with the logistics of delivery to my target country. I hope that makes sense.","name":"t3_4amfz7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-16 06:35:50","week":11}

{"id":"4aooip","author":"PrettyOkay","body":"**_I didn't mean for this to get so extensive, and I should probably edit it. If you don't want to read it all, you can skip down to the \"LESSONS LEARNED\" subheading. Or don't read it at all. That's cool, whatever; this is for me._** \n\n**BACKSTORY:**\n\nI'm using a throwaway for privacy's sake, but I just wanted to share a breakthrough in my ongoing personal finance journey. For background's sake, I'm 27 now, and I hand a stunted beginning to my professional career.\n\nUntil about a year ago, I was incredibly responsible with my money. I had built myself up, over two years, from the high-500s in my various credit scores to the low-700s. I went from no savings and no assets to comfortably subsisting as an actual adult. I paid all my bills on time, paid off my credit card balance every month, and lived within my means. I even cleaned up some of my financial sins from my early twenties, getting two bills that were placed for collection completely expunged from my credit report via a combination of luck and what I learned here (I did pay the $400 balance on one of them, but it appears nowhere on any of my three reports), and paying off a ~$2,500 debt to an insurance company for a car crash I'd been in a year or so prior.\n\nWas I putting enough in savings? No. Was I pinching every penny? Not the way the more extreme members of /r/frugal would have one do, but I drove a 10-year-old car and almost never dined out and didn't blow money I didn't have on impulse purchases. I worked a fairly low-paying job (~$40,000) in a high cost-of-living area, but I had two roommates in an affordable-for-the-area house. I took a couple of small, affordable vacations in the summer and fall of 2014, but I bought most of my clothes at thrift stores and found a balance where I wasn't blowing too much cash at bars with my friends but still enjoyed my life as a mid-20s person in a fun city and built up a meager emergency fund.\n\n**SHIT HAPPENS SOMETIMES:**\n\nThen, last year came. I spent down my savings in January between a luxury purchase (an item I'd coveted for a long time, and planned to budget for, went on sale for 40% off and I acted immediately) and flying across the country on three-days notice for my grandmother's funeral. It was my plan to rapidly replace those funds, but in March and April I hit a rough patch, professionally. My earnings were impacted, and I had a tough time with the personal side of the situation as well. I saw the writing on the wall and began applying to other jobs, but in May things came to a head and I was fired.\n\nLuckily, three days after I was let go, I got a call informing me I'd been hired by a company I'd applied hard for. It was a drastic raise (to $48,000 a year), and a much better situation (working in a stable department for a publicly-traded Fortune 100 company).  Unfortunately, it was 2,000+ miles away. Closer to friends and family, great, but my new employer wasn't covering relocation expenses. In addition, I had to start in a few weeks, and there were another couple of months on my rent.\n\n**THIS IS ME, ACTIVELY HURLING THAT SHIT AT A FAN:**\n\nI managed to pull all the logistics together, but I let my finances slide. I still paid all my bills with what cash I had, but I began racking up credit card debt. A few weeks before I lost my job, seeing the writing on the wall, I applied for two credit cards with friendly 0% intro APR periods and was approved for healthy credit limits. In addition, after I was approved for those cards my original credit card company increased my limit on THAT card from $2,000 to $7,000. When the time came to move, I sort of went into a financial daze, and stopped closely tracking my money the way I had previously.\n\nI spent a month out of work and without pay (was not approved for unemployment). I spent that time AND another month-and-a-half sleeping on my friends' couches and trying to find a decent place of my own. I didn't live extravagantly during that time, but I had to make some tough choices. I bought a shitbox car (old one had died a year prior, had been using public transportation) because there were no other transit options in my new home. I didn't have the cash, so I floated the money from my credit card through Paypal. I still did normal social things with my friends, instead of begging off for lack of money. My living situation, though, is the thing that broke me.\n\nI wanted to live alone, and that's absolutely not the most frugal/responsible choice, but its what I really wanted. I wound up signing a lease for a $900/month apartment 20 minutes from my job. Not incredibly expensive for the area, but I could've saved a lot of money living with someone else. In addition, I still had another month's rent to pay on my old apartment, so I wound up incredibly cash poor for a while. \n\nThen, once I actually moved in, I really lost my mind. I made the regrettable decision that I had to have everything all at once, and spent close to $3,000 on home furnishings. My ex-roommates had owned all the furniture we needed before, so I had very little besides bedroom stuff. I plunked down for a decent sofa, dinner table, chairs, a kitchen cart, and oh: the kitchen implements. I love to cook, and I couldn't help but fill my kitchen up with well-reviewed pots and pans and tools. \n\nI knew what I was doing was wrong, but I had this vision of the life I wanted and didn't want to wait to put it together. It was a creeping, slowly-expanding thing, with more Amazon boxes showing up every week with this thing or that. I've thought a lot about it and, I feel like after my professional humiliation, and the personal stress of leaving and friends (and the entire life I'd built) behind, I wanted to feel successful and whole again.\n\nAt the end of it, I had about $10,000 in credit card debt. Before this, I'd never carried even a cent month-over-month. In addition, my student loan payments had kicked up as a result of my increased income, from $79/month to $339/month. I was driving an awful car (I got screwed by a guy we'd worked with a few times before), bad on gas and sucking up money for maintenance AND approaching the end of its useful life. I had serious pain from an unaddressed dental issue and I was spending so, SO much waking time stressing about my finances. I had stopped the worst of the bleeding, was living within my means on a monthly basis, but it was a razors edge. Every time a \"surprise\" expense came up I would just throw in on the debt pile.\n\n**FIXING SHIT:**\n\nFinally, one day, I found it within myself to retake control. I took responsibility for my actions, and leaned back on my personal guiding principle: \"I can't change what's already happened; all I can do is the right thing going forward\". \n\nMy story is not an instruction manual for getting out of debt. In the nine months since I made the choice to get better, I've worked hard and had some luck and fortunate circumstances benefit me. Not everyone has access to the same opportunities I have, and I certainly could being doing more. My parents are incredibly understanding and supportive so I came clean to them and asked for a personal loan. They lent me $6,000 from their retirement funds (they're old enough to draw without penalties) to take care of one credit card that was about to begin accruing interest. I'm paying them back $250 a month until they've recouped ever penny. Not everyone has that as a resource, I know, and I'm lucky that it was even possible. I have a good job with the best benefits I've ever had. I'm healthy enough so far to not need anything beyond my annual physical, and the dental plan is decent enough.\n\nI'm continuing to handle my current finances and started paying down the old stuff. Slowly, at first, but I've been able to commit more and money to the effort. When a card got close to the end of the 0% APR intro period, I'd open a new one and transfer the balance. Even at my worst, I never got behind on my living expenses, and now I'm even ahead.\n\nHave I been perfect? Not at all. I don't live a /r/Frugal_Jerk life. I treat my girlfriend to dinner out and buy a bottle of gin or a twelve-pack of decent beer with regularity. I had a bit of a relapse when I spent extravagantly on Christmas gifts for her and our families, but I kept my head on my shoulders and refused to spiral back out of control. I replaced the rustbucket car, financing a four-year-old hatchback with fairly low mileage at a fair price on two days notice after my old car died. Yes, /r/Frugal will tell you to get a $2,500 used car, but I'm doing 2,000 miles a month, and the value is there for me. I even got a root canal for my broken tooth, and I could go on and on about the difference improved dental health can do for someone's sanity.\n\nI'm not out of the woods yet. I still have a long way to go in paying off my credit card debt, but I have around $1,500 in tax refunds that are completely earmarked for it, and my credit is somehow still healthy enough to keep securing cards with good balance transfer offers. I'm not worried about accruing interest on those balances and I trust myself enough to keep paying them down while avoiding new debt.\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED:**\n\nIt's okay to fuck up. You probably will at some point. I've written advice here on /r/personalfinance that has been widely upvoted and submitted to /r/bestof, and I still got in way over my head. Humans are emotional creatures, life may not always trend 100% upward, and sometimes you'll have the wrong reaction. You can get better, though. My situation wasn't the worst ever, but it wasn't leading me towards the life I want to live. There are compromise I'm not willing to make, but I've changed and bent enough to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It'll be another year or so before I'm free and clear, and probably another year after that until I'm able to build my savings up to where I want, but I feel like I can do all that and still live in a way that makes me happy.\n\n**TL;DR:** Spent unnecessarily during a big life change, am working my way out of it incrementally while still feeling like I enjoy my life.\n\n","name":"t3_4aooip","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-16 17:51:38","week":11}

{"id":"4apyp5","author":"pixiestix88","body":"Where to start,\n\nLong story short i was living with my dad (i'm currently 26) to tackle my student loans which was 22k when i started around 4 years ago. But he lost his job last year and along with it my childhood home (sold). Along with it we no longer have health insurance and now live with some relatives in TX.\n\nI currently have 16.5k in student loans with a payment of 240.00 every month. Currently that is half my income a month i was making more before so it wasn't bad. I want to look into IBR but i work currently at a crappy job at big box electronics store with measly hours. I have no other debt, good credit (no idea the exact score), a decent older car fully payed off and the rest of my income around (the other 240) i put towards gas/some food, a rare video game since i don't go anywhere or do anything to save money and  into savings (around 3k) since i am looking to move back to my home state of Florida since the situation here is not well.\n\nHow do i look into income based repayment and i even eligible?\n\nIll throw these other questions in since i need help on being an adult.\n\nIs there anyway to get health care? I would really like to have it since i can no longer be on my dads. I looked at the obamacare or whatever but i'm too poor for even that, you have to make 15k a year. I'm not even close.  Right now its cheaper to pay the 1 prescription out of pocket every three months then it is for health insurance payments of every month. Or just at minimum dental (impacted wisdom teeth)\n\nI am of course willing to work full time at any job doing pretty much anything. Problem is the place i am moving to is a very small town. Like gas station, publix (grocery), walmart and that's about it. My skill set is limited to cashier, merchandising, stock/unloading, working with electronics and i used to fix computers on the side. Computer repair has always come to me easy.\n\nI currently live in the outskirts of Dallas but i am very unfamiliar with the area, no contacts here and don't want to live in a hording house. \n\nMy goal is to tackle the payments down so i can live in a income based rent place on my own back in florida. Of course this is after staying with some realitives and hoping to land a job or two. My reasoning is i feel like a loser and am tired of moving all the time (currently at 19 moves). I know this is a big leap with first/last rent, deposit, water, electric, etc\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for any help. \n\n\n**Update** \n\nI have looked into the IBR and ill have to do some research on the couple of options it has given me. But looks like for the time being its should be $0. I didn't think it would be so easy and i appreciate all the help.\n\nAnother thanks for the Amazon HITS thing both my boyfriend, dad and myself are combing through it for extra money and really appreciate that it will put food on the table. \n\n\n","name":"t3_4apyp5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-16 22:38:53","week":11}

I bought a 4 inch foam mattress.

I was and still am struggling with anxiety and depression making school (and work) very difficult. Over my 4 years I only am about halfway or less to a degree. I left school in the spring of 2015 so it hasen't been long, I took a few months off before my grace period ended, worked for about 5 months, and I've been out of work for the past month now. I'm currently living with friends and my expenses are extremely low, I don't own a car or go out often. My loan payments come out to about 550 a month. \n\nI worked for a company as a temp for about 5 months, and they decided not to hire me. During that time I was making loan payments and saving some money as they paid me okay. \n\nNow I am unemployed, and filed succesfully for forbearance on both my private and government loans. My government loans gave me 2 months, and private (Wells fargo, 80% of my loans) are giving me up to 6 months but I don't want to use it. \n\nI don't have anything promising for work and I've been applying somewhat, but my anxiety and depression have become worse and I'm scheduled for my first therapy session (Covered by mothers insurance)\n\nLooking for advice for now and for the future on how to go about navigating my situation. Most jobs I'm applying to pay little and so that won't give me much money after loans. My rent is going up soon because I will actually be moving into a house instead of living in friends basement.\n\nSome questions off the top of my head are:\n\nDo I qualify for any tax breaks for paying student loans?\n\nShould I try to save money during the forbearance or get off it and pay as soon as I am able? \n\nI also have about $900 in credit card debt, (Amazon Card), should I do anything special about this? Most of it is on a 6 month interest free finance, while the rest I'd like to payoff right now before accruing interest.\n\nThanks for reading.

{"id":"4av2se","author":"hopelesswanderer21","body":"Since January, I have made 55 bucks in amazon gift card credit, and 41 dollars in bitcoin. \n\nProof in amazon: http://imgur.com/Cu6fjJy\n\nNote that, it says 50 but I said I have 55, in Bing, I have enough credits for a 5 dollar amazon gift card, but I have used up all the numbers in my house, so I need a phone for confirming my account-Which I will get by asking my good friend after I go back to school from Spring Break\n\nProof for bitcoin: http://imgur.com/gallery/Eb7jH/new\n\nIt says I have 41 USD, and I included a few pictures of my transaction history. As you can see, I have a ton of transactions everyday of very small quantities ranging from 29 cents and above.\n\n\nWays I accomplish this: I use 3 bing rewards accounts. I have had 2 accounts banned, but its 👌 since ill just make a new one. After I rake in enough points, I cash out immediately. I also have to say that I use a website called pogocheats.com / bing rewards bot/chrome or something like that (just search it in google). Anyway, I leave the tab open doing searches for me while I browse reddit or do something else.\n\nI made 5 bucks from PerkTV. I run it on 3 phones everyday, and then another one at night. Not that it matters, but I use a ZTE Sonata, a Galaxy s4, a Galaxy s5, and an Lg stylo.\n\nJust today, I discovered that with an update, my Samsung Galaxy Discover is able to play perk, and it hasn't crashed at all, unlike my newer devices have. I  don't know why, but perk is really shitty now. It used to run no problem, but now it seems like after 5 mins nothing plays anymore. Im at 3800 credits as of now and will try to cash out once I reach 5000. \n\nProof of current credits http://imgur.com/XxPVdwq\n\n\nI tried earn honey, but it sucks they don't have an app, and it seems to take longer to earn nectars, although videos don't crash or stop like they do on perk, and i'm glad that a user works for earn honey--forgot his name though it was like favgames or something like that. If perk continues being shitty, Ill go to earnhoney. What I do enjoy are some of their videos of cars they have.\n\nI did sign up for swagbucks, but I just have used perk instead since I read a lot about perk farming etc.\n\nI tried translation sites where you translate documents, but they take so long to do, and they are I don't even know what to say. \nI signed up for lingosaur saying that I can translate from English to Spanish, and Vice-versa, and I spent about an hour completing the registration. They make you translate a document, and then have other users rate your translation. I literally guarantee that it was 5,000,000 times better than whatever google translate could have said. I can say that I know Spanish and English fluently and perfectly, but I think the users who rate people's submissions are cheeky bastards who are greedy and rate submissions poorly, in order for you to be unable to work on the site. It makes sense to do, because if someone pays the site for a translation, it'll be harder for someone to get work if there are a ton of other users. That's why I think I got rated shittily. (Not that it matters, but I do want to mention that I interned for a different country that speaks Spanish I worked for them *translating* legal documents, registering marriages and births, making and taking information/pictures, for passports among other things (They liked how well I spoke both languages).\n\n\nI use screenwise trends, which is a site run by Google. You register your gmail from your phone, tablet, computer, etc. I signed up my laptop, and my Lg stylo and have made 8 dollars doing nothing. They just track what you do with your things even more than they already do. You make 2 dollars a week from this. \n\nProof: http://imgur.com/9el4Y15\n\nBut you can only cash out when you get $25 bucks.\n\nI used an app (forgot what it was called) but it paid you like .001 cents and even less whenever you walked (it tracked footsteps), but after a week, I made like 6 cents, and so I thought it wasn't worth it because my phone has 8gb in memory, so the app is more inconvenient. And I for sure made them more than 6 cents in the time I used the app from the ads.\n\nI tried Ipoll, and just, no, like, no, noooo. It felt more like a scam to me.\n\nI tried an app called surveys on the go. I made about 6 or seven dollars in surveys, but you cash out at 10 dollars. Unfortunately, they stopped sending me surveys offers completely, and so there is no way to redeem my 6 or 7 bucks. I feel like a ton of sites can just put up a really high amount for you to be able to not redeem in a long time even after you have made money. For example, I can just make a site, offer a 15 dollar minimum payout, give you like 3 dollars when you sign up, make you work for like 2-3 weeks doing surveys and things up until you get 14 dollars. And then? Fuck you, I'll stop sending you offers so you never get to the 15 bucks and therefore not be able to cashout; I would have used you to make money for me and I'll just never have to pay you. That is what I feel happens with this app.\n\n\nAnyways, I have also tried an app called Lucktastic. I do not recommend it at all. It is not passive at all. The app gives you scratchers, in the format of lotto tickets and they offer 10,000 dollars prize, among other values, you get like 10 to 27 credits per scratcher. This is really fucking stupid because after you scratch it gives you the credits, but when you try to scratch another scratcher, it play a thirty second to 1 minute advertisement video. And you just sit there and wait because just watching the ad does not do anything, scratching the scratcher gets you credits so you have to actually stare at your screen. It gives you 100 to five hundred credits daily (sometimes it doesn't). Anyways, the payout minimum is 23000 credits and I only have about 17000.\n\nProof http://imgur.com/uGOlq75\n\nAnd I have had this app for like a month and 3 weeks. I gave up on the scratchers all together and just check in everyday by doing one scratcher, and it'll give you your daily 100-500 credits.\nSo Yes, I do not recommend.\n\nI signed up for ebates and think a cashback thing is a great idea, but seeing as i'm trying to make money, and not buy anything online, I have not made anything.\n\nI really like the idea of UserTesting since it gives you like ten dollars per review, but I notice you need a microphone (which I have), but my mom will and does assume that Im chatting with online hoes, so i have not done that at all, but I hear its great. \n\nAnother cool thing, Mturk. I have heard about it, had my amazon account reviewed and approved for turking. I put in my SSN and all of my info and shit, but you need to make an Amazon Payments Account, and apparently they check all of your information thoroughly to make sure you are 18. I am 17, and my birthdays is March 25th, so I'll have to wait till then to start turking.\n\nI Highly recommend an app called Bitit. About like 12 days ago, I made a post recommending it and saying that I had made 25 bucks from it, etc. \n\n[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/490a4n/earn_bitcoin_with_an_app_simple_fast_and_not_a/)\n\nOkay, as of now, I have made 41 dollars in bitcoin from this app. Twelve days ago when I made my Bitit post again I had 25 dollars, meaning that I have made 16 dollars in twelve days from this single app.\n\n I use it on 3 phones. My Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5, and my Lg stylo. and highly  recommend it. From the people that I have signed up under me, I have made $1.56 total, so that still means that they have all made 15-16 dollars if you add all of their amounts together. \n(the only thing I am giving a referral to)\n\n[Refferal](http://services.bititapp.com/referral/bititapp_d87e7d8e5437a10a3255ee95f1045bae2325d740ab539e41f2258d7e8355ecbe449c62f5)\n\n[Non Ref] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobile.app.bititapp&amp;hl=en)\n\nTwo days ago, I went to the thrift store and found a TI 84 Plus calculator for $9.99. I convinced my mom to buy it (she was like why what the hell, you have one, and how do we know this one works?) We took it home, I found batteries, and it worked great. The same day, I made an Ebay listing through a promotion Ebay sent me. They said that if I make a listing by March 27th, and that if it sells by April 10th, they'll give me a $50 dollars to spend on ebay. Someone bought it for 50 Dollars plus 8 dollars in shipping the day after I listed the Item. I was ecstatic since I made forty something in profit from selling a calculator I got at the Salvation Army. And I will get 50 Dollars extra from Ebay!!!\n\nThings that yo may be wondering (or not) and may mentioned before.\nI am a senior in High School. I am 17 as of now. I am in Houston, Texas, United States of America. \n\nPhones That I have:\n\nMy main/daily phone is an lg Stylo. It's great for a cheap phone. It looks expensive as hell, but its really cheap.\n\nI have a Galaxy S4 that has a cracked up screen. It used to be my Brother's phone, but he left to college, so my mom gave him her non broken screen mint Galaxy S4. I then bought her a Nexus 6 off Ebay for 223 dollars. (she wanted a big phone because she has bad eyesight). \n\nThe Galaxy S5 is mint condition and my mom found it in a restroom above the toilet paper roller thing. I can't use it becuase it has a bad IMEI, so its basically an Ipod. \n\nWe have a Cricket Wireless plan that is 5 lines unlimited data, calls, texts, and so whenever I signed up for things, I used the others phones signed up under the plan like my brother's phone, my mom's phone, my phone, the ZTE sonata (shitty phone really), and we could add a fifth line with an old HTC desire I have that was a gift to me (the HTC is an old 3g phone, and it had an old android system not fit for PerkTV).\n\nMy Galaxy discover was my first phone ever, its still in mint condition, but its a 3g CDMA phone so, I can;t use it anymore, so this is also like an Ipod. Fortunately, it has a more up to date android system fit for perking. My brother's galaxy discovers is lying around somewhere in the house and I hope to find it).\n\nTL;DR\n\nThis is a post of my journey with Beermoney. I comment things I have done to make money since January.\n\n(EXTRA NOTE) What should I do to make money with an Ipod touch 4th gen that I have (you cant perk on it I tried) and the old HTC desire?\n\nThanks for Reading and Wow holy fuck this is a five page document in Microsoft Word!

Even with shipping, the high turnover and low overhead of online retailers like Amazon typically make the most sense.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nBrick and mortar places are fantastic for one reason:  Clearance sections.  A great example is GNC.  GNC is basically the worst place to buy any health product.  The people are stupid, the service is poor, the prices are high.  Their clearance section is fantastic, however.  I'm a big fan of the low-carb B-Up bars that are very similar to the original recipe of Quest bars if you're familiar with them.  They typically retail for about $3.00 each or a box of 12 for $26.  In the clearance section I found an almost-expired box and a discontinued flavor for $15 and $11 respectively.  24 bars for $26.

{"id":"4b2x9q","author":"m101182","body":"Hey reddit. Right now I'm 27 years old, stationed in Japan for the military, and I'm looking to move back to the United States in about another 15 months. How do you think I'm doing financial-wise?\n\nCurrently I have no home or auto loans nor car insurance (I walk to work and sold my vehicle before moving overseas). I have no credit card debt, but I use my cards to accumulate % cash back for daily expenses. I think I have about 65,000 worth of credit available and my monthly utilization is below 1%. My work covers the cost of my apartment/utilities. \n\nMy goals to to one day get married, have a family and kids, and maybe buy a Tesla when they release their new model in 2018 or something. \n\nHere's my current financial breakdown:\n\n**BitCoin Wallet** 2 coins (about $800)\n\n**Banking $9,575.20**\n        USAA Savings 199.96\n        NFCU Savings 25.16\n        USAA Checking 8,450.00\n        NFCU Checking 900.08\n\n**USAA Brokerage $58,3118.65**\n        40 shares Apple (4260.31)\n        546 shares VTSAX (27699.75)\n        40 shares Disney (3965.72)\n        36 shares Archer Daniels Midland (1384.68)\n        10 shares Amazon (5520.80)\n        2,805 shares Solazyme (6339.20)\n        378 shares VTIAX (9148.09)\n\n**Roth IRA $48,446.11**\n        1693 shares VFIFX\n\n**USAA Investments $21,197.60**\n        100 shares Apple (10,534.59)\n        10 shares Disney (99.92)\n        44 shares ExonMobil (3704.80)\n        710 shares Solazyme (1604.60)\n        342 shares USAA Precious Metals (4296.08)\n\n**Thrift Savings Plan $7,097.69**\n        G fund - government securities, $2,046.11\n        C fund - common stock index, $3150.00\n        S fund - small cap stock index, $1267.97\n        I fund - international stock, $633.51\n\n**Total Assets: 145,434.25**\n\nI'm also doing school online, so every 6 months I'm spending about a thousand dollars for tuition and books. I max out my monthly Roth IRA, but fall pretty short on maxing out my TSP Roth IRA (I think I allocate maybe 300 per month to it).\n\nI think most everything is okay right now, but I work a crap-ton on my ship and I never have any time to sit down and really do some financial planning. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas about how to reallocate my assets? Am I doing anything wrong right now? Just wondering.

{"id":"4b438k","author":"Heli0sX","body":"A lot of my friends and colleagues are either writing or in the process of starting to write books (anything from children's stories, to economics, tech help, etc.). All of them have told me that they're not sure what to do after the books have been written (publishing, marketing, etc.). That gave me an idea of opening a company that will take care of all the electronic publishing services (copy editing, formatting, publishing, marketing, etc.). The issue is that I'm not sure where to start with it. Does anyone have any experience with online publishing platforms (Amazon, Apple, etc.)?\n\nI understand that formatting, converting to an ebook, copy editing are the easy parts. How would I go about deciding about how much to charge for the books and advertising them? I assume that I'll need to create a website for the publishing company (probably WordPress) and add the books to the site (advertise the books by advertising the site).\n\nAlso, would it be better if the publishing company specializes in one type of books (children's books, technical, economic, etc.) or would it be okay if I have an assortment of categories?\n\nThis is my first time opening a business, so any advice/criticism/feedback would be greatly appreciated!

I will often buy Amazon.com cards at the grocery store, but obviously there are dozens of stores to choose from.\n\n* 3% at gas stations.\n\n* 3% at major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others). \n\n* 1% on everything else.  \n\n* Varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back, $10 off a $10 purchase at walmart, $5 off a $5 purchase from itunes/app store, I have used all of these personally) that vary with time.  There are usually close to 100 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods.\n\n* An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.  Your eligible purchases can be covered when they're accidentally damaged or stolen for up to 90 days from the date of purchase with your Card.\n\n* Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).  A free yearly FICO score.\n\n* And perhaps the most important thing of all,... \"among the best customer satisfaction\" of all the credit card companies ( http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-us-credit-card-satisfaction-study ).\n\n* Last tidbit is a story I would like to share.  I was in Dallas, rented a car, apparently they have toll roads with no toll booths (not sure how a non-local would even pay the toll).  Got a $17 charge from some company in Arizona which I did not recognize.  Reported it to Amex as not authorized and they reversed the charges.  I later found out that it was for the unmarked toll (I guess they use some kind of out-of-state billing company).  So Amex gives you free tolls on rental cars (Joke,... but not really).\n\nThere is an annual fee of $75 but you get $150 as soon as you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months.","name":"t1_d0yqhmi","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-14 00:33:50","week":11}

Just for future reference if you ask questions on here and say you have an Ebay store, people will assume you are paying monthly to host a store, not a free account.\n\n&gt; -how do I calculate exact shipping &amp; what box I will need before hand?

Copy someone else's shipping for the same item? (Video games/consoles/controllers)\n\nAmazon item weights are notoriously inaccurate.  Looking at someone elses shipping is a good way to get a baseline.  You can also use calculated shipping (ie-pack and weigh the item in a box BEFORE listing so you know exactly how much it will cost.)  Overall tho you will get an idea of what it costs to ship items after you get a few dozen sales under your belt.\n\n&gt;  -is it smart to start off an auction at a penny &amp; let it get bid on or start somewhere in the middle?\n\nIt's smart to not use auctions at all.  Use BIN (Buy-It-Now) only.  Best Offer if you want.\n\n&gt; -what is the best way of shipping these type of things for the best possible condition as cheap as possible?\n\nUSPS First Class is best for items under a pound.  USPS Flat Rate boxes (free from the post office) are good for smaller but dense/heavy items.  Bigger items are a complete toss up, I just get shipping quotes from USPS/UPS/Fedex and see what is the cheapest.\n\n&gt; -what's the best way for me to avoid refunds, charge backs, &amp; scammers?\n\nBe honest and accurate with your description.  Always purchase shipping through Ebay so there is tracking.  No way to avoid someone that wants to scam/fuck you over, but it doesn't happen nearly as often as you might think.  You just hear about all the bad experiences, not the 99% of ones that go off without a hitch.\n\nDo recommend avoiding scam-heavy items tho (iPhones and gift cards are 2 good examples).  Those items attract a lot of assholes, so it's best to just sell them on Craigslist. \n","name":"t1_d0zmory","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-03-14 19:38:21","week":11}

I got a good deal on mine by purchasing a display model so I highly recommend getting one of these through a physical store and not Amazon if you go this path.\n\nThe reason is that Miele controls the price of their products so unless you get a discount or refurbished model, then you'll pay essentially the same price.

You can usually score a 20% off coupon and if you do this during Kohls Cash time you will score some money to use on whatever in the store.  A $300 vacuum will get you $60 to blow in store, $90 depending on the time of year (sometimes they offer $15/$50).  But the best part is this: Kohls has one of the absolute best return policies around.  If you keep the box and receipts and your vacuum dies a year after you purchase it, you can return it for the same model OR for a Kohls gift card.  Get the gift card, buy yourself a new vacuum and make sure it's during Kohls cash time. Free new vacuum and a little extra spending money.\n\nAs for vacuums, we had a Dyson for years and this past year we \"downgraded\" to a Shark and are so glad we did.

In fact, the cheapest option other than the likes of alibaba or knock-off ebay crap is Maplin, which speaks for itself. \n\nThat, and a lot of families here aren't massively computer savvy. Either that, or they just don't have the time or energy to shop around. One thing local to our area is a facebook group designed for buying and selling. It has around 45,000 members at present, and a friend of mine has just gotten a business in web design off the ground using the group as a primary source of custom. A second group also has about 30,000 members, but it's unclear how much overlap there is and activity is lower on the second group.\n\nWe also have a thriving word-of-mouth market here, as well as a sunday market on the riverside that generates a ridiculous amount of foot traffic - mainly shoppers between 30 and 50, which is the second most demographic in terms of demand (the first is working class persons around 20-27 with children or NEET).\n\nI'm not in college, I actually work as a syadmin(ish). It's technically an apprenticeship, so there's not a lot of revenue right now.\n\nNinja: Another point to consider is that a lot of people here are less willing to buy from Amazon as they are to buy from \"that bloke who does cables\".

If you're going to drop $300 on something a DustBuster and a Swiffer can take care of (hardwood everywhere is awesome, Pergo, too), then you might as well go the whole way and remove vacuuming from your life entirely. \n\nAmazon Warehouse regularly runs discounts (deep ones) on late-model and well-equipped robot vacuums. One further, they even make a Swiffer model with a wet pad instead of suction. \n\nI wouldn't worry about their performance. Intelligent cleaning patterns and dirt sensors mean it's getting everything, and you just have to let it do its thing. Scheduling lets you set it to clean whenever you want (middle of the night, early afternoon while you're out...) and the cleanliness gets better the more frequently you run it. Nightly passes mean you're house will be cleaner than the once a week the vacuum comes out of the closet. It comes with everything you need to block it from going places, clean and charge the Roomba, and it docks at home when the battery is running low to keep itself working. \n\nI could never have envisioned spending $300 on a vacuum. I hate cleaning in general and try to optimize everything I do to require as little maintenance as possible, and I know that a quality tool can reduce the work, but it's so much for something I hate to use. The robot? Great investment as I could get a quality robot and remove the need to ever truly do the vacuuming again.\n\nBought two for my parents (regular and a Swiffer model), and they couldn't be happier. Even if you have to rearrange furniture, wall mount some electronics, uncluttered some cabling or start putting the laundry into a hamper, any adjustments you might need to make to welcome a robot vacuum into your home are changes well worth making.

{"id":"d10a6ze","author":"qvplite","body":"Great points TrappStick. You're right there is more to it than just listing your book for sale. There's also more to it than finding the right price.\n\nWhat I've done is run promotions/ads at various prices and compared their performance. This requires a decent amount of capital to run multiple promotions and make sense of the data that come out of them, but it's the only way to get meaningful information. I've even seen variations in what works from book to book, so each title really deserves its own set of tests.\n\nThe majority of my reviews have come from free giveaway copies. This is what the big publishers have been doing for years. The more you can give away, the faster you can start accumulating reviews. Goodreads, for example, allows you to give away up to 100 copies per promotion, and I've read that Amazon is opening up their giveaways tool to its authors now too beginning this month. Contacting people on social media and forums has also proven to be useful in this regard, and giving away digital copies is free.\n\nI've always aimed to get a handful of reviews before launching a big promo, but one of my books was selling pretty well even when it had just one review. \n\nLike I said in this post, and the full article on my site, the real \"secret\" here is nothing more than lots of hard work. No silver bullets really. It takes time and money to schedule and run promotions, and to give away tons of copies of your material to grab just a few reviews.

{"id":"d10l8w3","author":"Uncle_Erik","body":"Good for you!  I have two suggestions.  One easy and one that will take a little longer.\n\nFirst, go buy a bread machine at a thrift store.  I found one last July for $22 and use it two or three times a week.  It has paid for itself over and over and over.  Most bread machines you find are in working order and you can usually download the manual off the Internet.  Check on your phone before buying.\n\nFlour is inexpensive and even store brand flour gives great results.  The only ingredient that can be expensive is yeast.  However, you can buy it at great prices at Sam's Club, Smart &amp; Final and Amazon.  I buy two pounds for $4.50 at Sam's Club.  The supermarket wants like $7 for eight ounces.\n\nThe results are so good.  For under $1 a loaf, I get bread that's better than the premium $5 or $6 loaves at the market.  Don't buy pre-packaged meat and cheese.  Have the deli slice it for you.  That, or cook a ham or turkey breast at home and slice it yourself.\n\nThe result will be sandwiches so much better than anything at Subway or most restaurants.  Plus it will be $4 or $5 cheaper than eating out.  You will look forward to eating your own sandwiches because they're so goddamned good and you'll be saving money.\n\nSecond, buy a copy of *Mastering the Art of French Cooking* by Julia Child.  I know, this sounds scary, complicated and a lot of work.  You also aren't sure you want French food all the time.  Relax.  It's not like that.\n\nChild takes you by the hand and starts you off with very simple building blocks anyone can do.  Seriously.  It's easy.  There is a lot of how and why, so you'll understand.  Then it gets more complex and you learn to improvise or cook with what looks good or was on special at the market.  It turns you into a good chef.\n\nAlso, French food is *very* American, believe it or not.  France deeply, deeply influenced the United States in many ways - this country has huge amounts of French DNA.  We tend to only think about the English, but there are deep hooks from France, too.  One of those is the food.  A lot of French food is considered American.  It just ended up with an different English name.  So you will see lots and lots of familiar food in French cookbooks.  Nothing weird.  Nothing you won't want to eat.  What you learn to cook will make you happy, I promise.  You will also make other people happy with your cooking.\n\nFinally, I have family in the high-end cooking world and one relative who shows up on the Food Network now and then.  When you eat out, only about 20% of the cost is for the food.  The rest is overhead, taxes, rent, insurance, and loads of other costs.  It's expensive to run a restaurant - I'm an accountant and have seen the books.\n\nSo cooking for yourself is about an 80% discount over eating out.  If you cook from scratch (and you should!) you will have an end result as good as the better restaurants.  You won't have any canned or bagged stuff from Sysco.  You will be eating as well as those with 1%'er salaries.\n\nPlus if you cook for others, you will become very popular.  It *will* get you a good significant other if you don't have one.\n\nFinally, look into buying a nice set of tri-ply stainless cookware.  The sets from Tramontina and Cuisinart are just as good as All-Clad, and tests have proven it.  For $200-$250 you will have the cookware you need to make very high quality food.  Go for it.","name":"t1_d10l8w3","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-15 14:54:44","week":11}

{"id":"d114vwe","author":"SailEvenstar","body":"We're American and live on a boat, sailing from country to country.  We've visited over 22 countries in the last four years; we don't stay anywhere long enough to get a bank account even if we could.  We also have a kid in college in the UK that needs cash from time to time.\n\nWith our lifestyle, frugality is a necessity. However, we also will get KILLED by cash fees if we're not careful.\n\nThis is what is in my wallet that we use regularly:\n\n- CapitalOne World Elite Quicksilver Master Card. No annual fee, no foreign transaction fees. 1% cash back. #1 son has a card on this account he uses for incidentals.\n\n- Bank of America Travel Rewards Visa. No annual fee, no foreign transaction fees. I purchase most everything I can on this card now that my son is using the other one. It also lets you apply their points against travel related purchases. So I took $1,500 off the last time I flew my kid to see us instead of buying some useless gew-gaw with the points.\n\n- BoA Debit Card for a cheap BoA account.  They have a number of deals with international banks, e.g. Scotiabank in the Caribbean, Westpac in the Pacific.  At the Scotiabank all ATM transactions were free of both international fees and ATM fees. Wespac ATM fees are waived, but there is an international fee (3%). There is a minimum balance, $1,500 or so, else you get clipped $8 a month.\n\n- Fidelity ATM card.  We don't do investments through Fidelity, but their free cash management account waives ALL ATM fees (including foreign) and only charges 1% on foreign currency withdrawals.\n\nWe also have a couple of other cards/things we don't use as much.\n\n- American Express card.  Yeah, it's expensive. We have our reasons for keeping it.  We use it primarily for domestic US charges; e.g. orders from Amazon or things to ship to us, monthly billing from the distance education school for our daughter, etc. But it also allows for a HUGE amount of short term cash flow if we needed it for an emergency. Five figures on the spot; when you're halfway around the world that sort of security is nice. They are brutal on foreign transactions though, so we don't use it except in the US.\n\n- Brand X free Mastercard; no annual fee or charges.  Brutally expensive to use locally, but free to own.  Again, handy, ready credit in the event of Bad Thing Happening.\n\nIn our experience, the rates you get from Credit Cards are not bad.  They don't seem to screw you, at least not compared to what you will get at a Foreign Exchange booth. You will never get the Forex rates you see quoted, because those are generally bank-to-bank large transfer rates. We've learned to stop sweating what the credit card companies give you, after comparison shopping it for a while.\n\n\nOur general process is...\n\n- Put it on a credit card if we can\n\n- In places that don't take credit cards, get local cash from the Fidelity card, unless there is a BoA deal bank.\n\n- In places that take credit cards, but prefer cash (like Fiji, they are allowed to surcharge you and prefer cash) we still charge things.  It lets us track things, and the local surcharge usually works out to a wash against the bank fees/cash back/rewards.\n\nWe do our major investment and banking via E*Trade and E*Trade bank, which is free. They have bill payment on the rare occasion we need to send a check to the U.S., and they are very good on transfers to other banks with cheaper ATM services.\n\nWe've used Transferwise a couple of times to send cash to our son in the UK, so far I am please with it. Fast, up front about costs, and cheap compared to any other option.\n\nLongwinded, but I hope it helps.","name":"t1_d114vwe","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-03-15 22:33:13","week":11}

{"id":"d11jokb","author":"Willsturd","body":"There are several ways of calculating intrinsic value. There are relativistic valuation where you value it against their peers, and more absolute valuation where you value it regardless of what it's peers are being valued. Most valuations branch from those two ideas.\n\nThe most common valuation is the discount cash flow model. This is what Buffett uses. The idea here is that a company is only as valuable as the sum total of all future earnings it will generate. To get a quantifiable number, we discount the future earnings back to today. We discount because future money is worth less than today's money. The rate used to discount the earnings can be extremely complex but just view it as your potential rate of return for now.\n\nYou can do this for whatever duration or into perpetuity. Depends on your view.\n\nThe math is pretty simple for the discounted cash flow model and there are plenty of calculators out there that will do it for you. If you want to go in depth, you can start trying to calculate a accurate discount rate by incorporating risk/growth the assets/debt since valuating Amazon is completely different that Exxon even if they may have the same income at one point (hypothetically).

I think my primary interest right now is in free hotel nights.  But I always love free flights.  Traditionally I've used my points for big international business class (sometimes first) redemptions. \n\n4. Two Hyatt free nights, ~20k hyatt points, ~75K UR points, ~8k SPG/IHG points, 28k AA miles.\n\n5. SFO\n\n6. My primary interest is using points for trips with my long distance bf, who's in Australia (hopefully this is the last year we're separated).  Thanks to AA devaluation, I booked a bunch of things out recently.  In August I've got business class award tickets to go see him in Australia, and in November I've got award tickets to Tokyo (where we'll again be meeting up).  We're probably going to be doing a weekend trip to Hawaii in June or July.  I fly to NYC to visit family ~3 times a year--I almost always do those flights on Jetblue because free wifi.\n\nI'm planning on using my two free Hyatt nights (plus 30k, or 15k+$300) for the Park Hyatt Sydney.  I'd like to get more points or free nights to offset hotels in Tokyo, Kyoto, or Hawaii.\n\nI'm definitely planning on applying for the Chase Freedom unlimited card, and I think I should go for one more Chase card on the same day to combine the hard pull/get in before the more stringent requirements (even though, for now, I still meet/could get).  I'm debating between either going for the IHG card (which I'd want to have around for a long time) or the Ritz or Fairmont card (where I'd just use the two nights and then cancel the card before the AF).  Either of those I could theoretically use in Hawaii, but since bf and I are only going to have a weekend there and neither Fairmont or Ritz has hotels on the same island as HNL, I'm torn on if it's worth it to subject us to connecting flights vs. pay cash and stay in Honolulu.  The Ritz in Tokyo isn't eligible for the free nights, the Ritz in Kyoto is sold out when we'll be in Japan, and there aren't any Ritzes in Australia, so maybe that's just a bad card for me for now?  I'd place some value on Lounge Club access from the Ritz card, since it would get me lounge access in the terminal where my Jetblue flights are from in SFO, but I'm just not convinced.\n\nIHG? Ritz? Something else entirely?

{"id":"d12rlh0","author":"qvplite","body":"This is a great question. It's a strategic decision that only you can make. In fact, I'm actually wrestling with this same question for one of my future works.\n\nHaving written both longer and shorter titles now, my gut tells me you are better off breaking your work up into a few shorter/mid-length titles. This may increase your visibility on Amazon and help readers discover your other works easier.\n\nThat being said, I think it really just depends on the type of book you're writing. Certain subjects lend themselves better to longer vs. shorter reads. Likewise, even the title and purpose of your book may produce an expectation one way or the other.\n\nIf your book is called \"The Complete System to Buying a Home: No Stone Left Unturned,\" readers might be disappointed if it's less than 100-200 pages. On the other hand, \"Quick Home Buying Tips For Busy Professionals: 7 Easy Guidelines Anyone Can Use\" it's almost expected to be a shorter, quick-reference type of guide.\n\nAnother strategic factor to consider: even though a series of shorter titles may theoretically produce greater revenue, some shorter titles do not qualify for promotions through certain channels (there are length requirements in some cases) - and, most shorter books will never be granted \"authoritative guide\" status like some longer books. So if you're trying to write a bombshell that will stand on its own as a cornerstone in its niche, a longer book will be required.","name":"t1_d12rlh0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-17 02:48:50","week":11}
{"id":"d12rrg9","author":"qvplite","body":"As of now I'm a few thousand dollars into promotions and marketing. Like I mentioned in the post, my ROI on this is well into the green (significant positive return on marketing investment) - but interestingly, without a major investment like this I'm not sure I would have hit the \"tipping point\" where things really took off.\n\nThis is important to understand. When you invest enough in marketing, you get more sales which increases your sales rank and author rank, in turn giving you more visibility across the Amazon site, and eventually Amazon starts including you in their emails to people with \"recommended for you\" books. This adds more fuel to the fire and increases sales further, reviews start to come in increasing sales yet again, and the whole basically thing spirals up.\n\nFail to hit that tipping point, though, and it's much harder to get non-linear returns. You get stuck in the long tail and never reach the explosive growth phase. Unfortunately it may take many hundreds, or thousands of dollars (or more) to hit this critical point depending on the niche you're in. The more competitive the niche, the more up-front investment is required, but also the bigger the payoff if you can actually get there.","name":"t1_d12rrg9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-03-17 02:53:26","week":11}

{"id":"d12trjo","author":"STL","body":"I was in a similar situation. Here's how it works. Suppose that your fund invested some money in Amazon and Zynga. Then in 2015, they sold some or all of their Amazon shares, which had risen significantly from their purchase price. That's a capital gain and mutual funds are required to pass them to you, where you pay taxes on them. But if the fund is still holding onto Zynga as it falls, then the fund's net asset value (i.e. share price) can fall. Especially true if they used the proceeds from selling the profitable stock to buy more of the plummeting stock.\n\nIn this situation, if you sell the fund in the calendar year that you receive the capital gain distribution, you can realize a capital loss (since the remaining fund has lost money in the Zynga dumpster fire) which can substantially or completely cancel out the cap gain from the distribution. That's what I did. If you didn't, then you're boned (note: I am not a tax professional). You get taxed on the big cap gain that you didn't ask for. In future years as you sell part or all of the fund, you can use the capital loss from that to cancel out capital gains from other investments, or up to 3k of normal income. (Any more than that, and your capital loss has to be carried forward to future years, which you might have seen in your tax program.) Hope this helps - I remember how hard this was for me to figure out.","name":"t1_d12trjo","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-17 03:50:05","week":11}

{"id":"d13ff0p","author":"STL","body":"&gt; However, to lose money overall, the fund had to lose more money on Zynga that it gained on Amazon, right?\n\nIt depends. Imagine that the fund started in Jan 2013 with $1 billion invested in each. Their holdings of Amazon rise to $3 billion by Jan 2015, while Zynga is steady. (So the fund's size rises from 1+1=2 to 3+1=4 billion, i.e. it doubles.) They then sell Amazon in 2015, realizing a 2 billion dollar capital gain which they pass to their shareholders. But they stay in Zynga while it falls over the 2015 year to 930 million dollars. So what you see is that in 2015, they send you about half of your money back as a capital gain, while the remaining fund declines 7%. (This is separate from the fact that distributions decrease the fund price; some places like Google Finance don't recognize this in their graphs, Morningstar does.)\n\n&gt; So why didn't it use the capital losses on Z to offset the gains on Amazon? Or is that not how it works? Maybe the fund has not yet sold the Zynga, so it can't chalk that up as a loss.\n\nThey *could* sell Zynga in the same calendar year to offset it (just like you can sell the whole fund in the same calendar year), but if they still think it's a good deal and will rise in the future, then maybe they didn't sell it yet. That's what happened with my fund. I couldn't wait around to see if they were right, so I sold (days before the new year).\n\nEdit: It also helps to know that you are taxed on dividends and capital gains regardless of whether you're set to reinvest them in the fund, or whether they're sent to you as cash. The feds don't care. As far as they're concerned, the fund sent you cash, and you're taxed on that. Reinvestments are equivalent to you manually buying more shares of the fund (including how they affect your cost basis).","name":"t1_d13ff0p","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-17 17:52:04","week":11}

{"id":"d13kflu","author":"g2nok","body":"Canadian here as well, I started flipping just a couple months ago in a story similar to yours. Came across this sub, made sure I did plenty of research, and then took the plunge and started visiting thrift stores every once in a while. While shipping most certainly sucks, it is definitely doable still, and I'm sure there are many successfully Canadian flippers out there. I want to preface this by saying by no means am I a \"heavy\" flipper, and I really just do this as a part-time hobby for some extra side cash. I source very slowly and sporadically and am patient with my items, but they do sell. I've had around $300-400 in sales the last 30 days, so nothing HUGE, but it's some nice extra spending money for me. I'm sure there are Canadian flippers who do this more regularly and are much more experienced and successful, but I'll share whatever insight I can to help out.\n\nI sell exclusively on eBay, and charge \"actual shipping\" so the buyer is responsible for the costs, and pay whatever it costs to ship to their location. I did some research into offering Free Shipping, but it wouldn't work for me due to the highly varied costs of shipping to the USA vs within Canada. I avoid selling on Amazon because FBA doesn't make much sense as a Canadian seller, and MF doesn't work well for what I sell because they reimburse you for a set shipping cost (whereas again my shipping typically varies a LOT depending on where it is being shipped to).  \n\nI started off only shipping within Canada simply because I wasn't familiar with international shipping and customs. But I quickly realized that you'd be missing out on a LOT of sales if you try to avoid the USA (10x our population is a LOT!). I'd say about 80-85% of my sales are to the USA now and only 15-20% are to Canadians. If you aren't already doing so, make sure you expand outside of Canada for shipping destinations. I currently only ship to Canada and the USA and haven't ventured into Worldwide as of yet.\n\nI typically price my items around the same as what previously sold listings had them at, and then charge actual-cost shipping to the buyer. Buyers still purchase my items without issue (despite shipping), and so it would appear that the high cost of shipping here is fine as long as the product is desirable. \n\nThe items I tend to sell DO have a pretty high ROI, but to me it doesn't matter as much because I am charging actual cost shipping. Are you trying to offer Free Shipping for your items? If so, you probably will need to find items with a higher profit to make up for the difference. If your current stock of items are easily purchasable in the USA as well, then you most certainly would need higher ROI to account for the shipping difference if you will be shipping abroad. However, on the flip side, your posts would be more attractive to Canadian buyers for being local. Harder to find, and unique items would most certainly be easier to sell to the USA as well. IF YOU ARE FLIPPING ITEMS WITH VERY LOW ROI, MAKE SURE YOU ARE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION FEES AS WELL!\n\nIf you are using a new account to sell on eBay with no feedback, it may be a good idea to buy a couple cheap items in order to get some feedback. Some buyers might be hesitant to purchase from a new account with no previous feedback/ratings.\n\nKeep at it, it's definitely do-able, and you'll learn a lot as you keep going. It probably took me a good month or month and a half before I got my first sale, and after that it's been much easier and I'm improving and learning more about flipping constantly.

If you're selling $10000 watches with an affiliate program that gives you 50% and you can get a conversion rate of 10%, then the answer is \"not many at all.\"\n\nIf, on the other hand, you're using Amazon affiliates and you get 6% and you're selling $.99 products, then you'll need a lot of viewers.\n\nThe quickest way to work out money and niche sites is this:\n\nconversion rate x affiliate payout per item x amount of readers you expect to get.\n\nso 1% conversion x $10 x 100 readers per day = $10 per day\n\nyou then have to ask yourself whether the amount of work you're doing is worth $10 a day. If you're writing a sales letter once every two weeks, then probably.

The most obvious thing seems to be packaging them up and trying to sell them through your classic places like Amazon. Breaking them up and creating courses out of them. Or just selling them as tutoring tools and make it all PDF and searchable with links. Not sure exactly what the deal is with these tutoring pamphlets that you guys have created but id start with the easy way... Slap it into some comprehensive order and advertise it/ sell it . You can choose where and what format. But something like Amazon (selling a digital book version of short course material for a buck or 2) might be cool. Or you can try to turn this into some higher end educational thing. You're the one with the tutoring startups lol ....

I've been able to pick up items online on clearance w free shipping by watching the emails.\n\nOld Navy - great for jeans, khakis and nice shorts and some cute graphic T's.

{"id":"d14x496","author":"KosherNazi","body":"The shift is less about platform, imo, than the service layer.  As you said, MS is embracing linux.  As long as AWS isn't the only one offering a competent cloud service, their margins are going to be impacted by competition.  And i think Microsoft will have the lead there with their vast experience and entrenchment in the business environment.  I mean, they're a $500bn company that still makes most of their money from software sales and support to commercial clients.  In the Linux world thats unheard of... Red Hat has had decades to compete and failed.  AWS found a crack and they're exploiting it, but Microsoft is already there with a rebuttal.  I don't think it's safe to act like this is still Ballmer's company and the product will inevitably get fucked up.\n\nIMO Microsoft is way undervalued atm because everyone still expects the mediocrity of the last 15 years to continue and that AWS has a clear path to the top of the hill, which I think is much harder than people understand.  The expectations and inherent risk in Amazon making that transition makes it a much more volatile play as well, imo.

The other non-tangible factor here is that I am less likely to browse Amazon and fall prey to impulse purchases.\n\nEveryone's factor will be different, of course, but the tipping factor for me was by calculating my per hour wage and figuring out the amount of time I save by ordering online instead of going to brick/mortar.

{"id":"d15qwrs","author":"PhileasFuckingFogg","body":"Etsy and Shopify are not different brands of the same thing. \n\nEtsy is a marketplace. It allows potential customers to find you. It's comparable to ebay and Amazon (you may not realise that Amazon, as well as retailing their own products, also allow third parties to sell through the Amazon site). Because Etsy specialises in handmade products, you have a slightly better chance of being found by potential customers.  Etsy don't charge monthly fees, just a sales commission. However you can also pay a daily \"relisting fee\" which puts you back at the top of search results. If you compete with others with similar products, you realistically need to pay that fee, or you won't get found. If your product is \"too original\" ie no one is searching for anything like it, you might have trouble connecting with any customers, in which case Etsy might not be a good fit for you.\n\nThe problem with investing too much time or SEO into an Etsy business, is the business becomes over-reliant on them. If they change the rules or prices or get over-crowded, you can move to your own site but any SEO work will be lost.\n\nBut you can easily sign up, make a decent profile, and list one or two products at virtually no cost and maybe a day's work including writing; play around with $20 of advertising, and see if it's worth spending time and money taking it further. That's basically a separate decision from whether you want to have your own ecommerce site.\n\nShopify is one way of making your own ecommerce site. Shopify are managed and hosted, which basically means they take care of the underlying technology for you, then give you templates which a reasonable person can set up themselves. However you'll still lack the experience of knowing what makes a good setup. From my point of view as a web developer, they charge a lot (in monthly fees) for relatively little, but I can see the convenience for someone who doesn't know where to begin.  You can hire someone to help you get set up on Shopify.\n\nAlternatives to Shopify include Squarespace (I haven't used it but the general word is they are inferior for ecommerce), and Weebly (definitely inferior, but used to have a free option). One free approach, which I did for my wife's craft business, was to make a very simple website with a few pages for free, then used \"Ecwid\" for the ecommerce side of things. [Ecwid](https://www.ecwid.com) is a fairly sophisticated shopping cart that is fairly easy to integrate with any other website. Free for up to 10 products.\n\nFinally you have the possibility to have your own ecommerce site. This would most likely be built with Wordpress + Woocommerce (widely supported), or possibly Magento (a bit more corporate). Since you're asking here, you probably wouldn't be trying to set this up yourself. You'd hire a developer, who would advise you and build your site (usually using existing plugins and templates, rarely more than a little custom code, but that's fine). You're looking at a higher up-front cost but perhaps lower monthly charges (some developers seem to charge a ton for monthly maintenance, but a well-designed site should need minimal maintenance). You'll have the widest possibilities for customisation - for example if a typical order is 20 pieces, you might have non-standard requirements around shipping, or paying by invoice.\n\nIn terms of design, I'd suggest not focusing too much on colour or design concepts. Firstly, because these things are generally easy to implement at the end, regardless of your choice of template. Secondly, because you do need to focus on your sales copy, product descriptions and product photography. Thirdly, the answer is pale background, minimalist design, avoid unnecessary widgets and social media buttons; big photos, clear calls-to-action, uncontroversial fonts and for god's sake no Comic Sans.

On both DVD and the older VHS, they have a deal with Amazon where they are restricted items.\n\n1970s and 1980s exercise videos where female celebrities lead the exercise do quite well. I don't know if the people buying them are really exercising, or just older men who want to see Susan Anton, Tracy Scoggins, Sheena Easton, etc. in their prime exercising in spandex.\n\nJazzercise VHS tapes do quite well. There are apparently a lot of older women who still like them.\n\nI've actually sold a lot of general exercise videos in VHS. I was curious why they were so popular, and began reading the reviews on Amazon. Many of the users were older women who like to work out to one or a series of tapes, and play it so often every day that the video finally breaks down and they have to look for a new copy.\n\nSome children's titles, like \"Little Bear\" and even Barney, sell quite well even though they are readily available on DVD. I suspect many parents of young children are more comfortable with putting an old VHS player in the kids' room rather than letting them scratch up a DVD. They start playing automatically when the child inserts it, and if the tape gets screwed up, replacements are relatively cheap.\n\nVHS is actually more durable than DVD, despite what people think. Small scratches makes DVDs skip or freeze up (like many Netflix or library copies), whereas VHS will keep playing and playing. \n\nThey are also one of the few remaining items where the profit margin is almost always good. It's rare to pay more than 25 or 50 cents. Amazon's new ASIN restrictions on slow-moving items for FBA sellers may have an impact on being able to list VHS, though.

{"id":"d164ee2","author":"BobbyTrosclair","body":"I do a visual inspection of the case and cartridge and put the tape in to my player and watch the beginning for a few minutes and maybe the middle to make sure there are no tracking or audio problems. (If there are, toss it.). People's players vary a lot in quality and tracking so something that plays fine for you may not play well on someone else's equipment. I always offer a full guarantee if any item does not play well but have had almost no returns. \n\nSomething to watch out for: there is a plastic tab on the bottom of blank VHS tapes (same side as the label on the side) that allowed them to be used to record TV shows, etc. If you wanted to protect them from being accidentally erased or recorded over (like the video of your wedding), you punched out that tab and then they couldn't be recorded over. \n\nCommercially produced VHS tapes (the kind we're talking about, with movies on them) were made with a plastic cassette that has shallow slots where that tab is on blank videos, so you wouldn't forget which VHS tape was in your VCR and accidentally record over your copy of \"Ninja Massacre\" to record a ball game or something. It was a fail-safe feature to protect the original movie that was recorded on it.\n\nSome users would repurpose old, commercially recorded movie VHS tapes because they no longer wanted to watch them, and would cover that tab with scotch tape to defeat the no-recording feature. Then they would use it just as you would a blank VHS.\n\nWhen you are reviewing a VHS tape, always check to make sure there is no scotch tape, or the remains of scotch tape, over that slot. If there is, someone probably recorded something for personal use over the movie, and you will have one cranky customer.\n\nOr worse. I noticed this on one tape I was reviewing before selling, and found that someone had recorded some hard-core porno, probably off an adult cable channel, in the middle of a golf instructional video.  I would guess someone was hiding that partcular footage from their wife by placing it in a tape she would never be likely to watch. He died, or forgot it was there, and it was donated to the thrift store. \n\nHad I not checked and sent that to a customer, and I would guess my Amazon selling privileges would be likely to be revoked.\n\nVHS tapes are also one of the few categories of FBA items that I still shrink wrap. VHS tapes are pretty durable, but if it slides out of the slipcase and crashes to the warehouse floor while it is being inprocessed, it can crack the case and make it unusable.\n\nAlso a good thing is to rewind each video to the beginning before shipping.

{"id":"d16dblj","author":"Eurynom0s","body":"I've lived in areas where Amex just wasn't widely accepted. When I moved into DC from Arlington, VA I had to up the limit on my Amazon Visa because of how common not taking Amex was in my neighborhood.\n\nNow I'll say this, it's worth having at least an Amex and a Visa in general, but for me specifically, not owning a car, the United Explorer Visa is great because it has *primary* car insurance on rentals--as in it covers liability, whereas Amex's car rental insurance is just secondary (damage to the car itself). There's one or two other cards that have primary rental insurance; I think they're all Chase cards though. Do your research on which card is best for you if this is something that matters to you. Personally, the car rental insurance alone makes the $99/year carrying cost of the card seem like an insignificant pittance.\n\nFrom my understanding the reason you'll find yourself in gaps of Amex acceptance is a combo of Amex having higher merchant fees and them bending merchants over without lube when the customer files a dispute. I'm not saying you should be wary of a merchant that doesn't take Amex--it's likely just that the fees are too high for them--but if you know that a merchant *used* to take Amex I'd definitely be curious about why they stopped taking Amex.","name":"t1_d16dblj","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-20 04:18:58","week":11}

What I'd suggest in addition to that is searching for proven \"niches\" that are making money and then figuring out how to replicate it. \n\nOne of the best places to look is [Flippa](https://flippa.com/websites). Find a website selling for a lot of money and then try to duplicate it/do it better. \n\nTo get started easily, without any programming knowledge I'd point you straight to [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/) and a [video guide to get you started](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/video/). It's almost all you need unless you're trying to build a Reddit/Facebook/Twitter clone...don't worry about all that technical crap, if you can write content it's a great start.

Though, [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com) is getting some traction as well.\n\nIf you've got some real drive and a little cash to buy inventory you can get started with [Amazon FBA](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm) - though it's not the easiest in the world to grasp without a little bit of a learning curve. Thankfully, there are guides out there to help and a [SubReddit right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon) in addition to that, [Ryan Moran](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/building-a-million-dollar-business-in-12-months-ryan-moran/) has a pretty awesome podcast series [and a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y35mxePPCc)on how to turn an Amazon business into a 7 figure business and he's legit.

{"id":"d16qv39","author":"No_One501","body":"Since this question seems to be asked every day on r/personalfinance, I’ve made a thorough list of credit cards I recommend to my friends and family if you have good credit and want cash back. Get 1 of them, or get some combo of them, and you’ll get all of the highest cash back in all categories. I’ve stuck with the big name companies, and always make sure to pay your balance in full and on time every month, or the interest accrued with these cards will wipe out any net gain with the cash back you’ll earn.\n\nAlso if you’d prefer a travel card, go to r/churning ‘s What Wednesday Thread and tell them your specific travel situation, they’ll help you get the best travel card.\n\nSo if you just want cash back, the first 4 cards are the ones I recommend myself, and the last 5 are cards that could be better or worse for you depending on your situation:\n\n1. **Citi Double Cash** – 1% cash back when you buy something, and 1% cash back when you pay your bill every month, making it the best 2% cash back card in my opinion. It’s the best card for everyday non-bonus spend, but it does have a foreign transaction fee, which doesn’t make it a good card for when you’re traveling. But once again, I’d then recommend going to r/churning and asking for a travel card in the What Card Wednesday thread if you travel frequently. This card doesn't have a sign up bonus\n\n2. **American Express Blue Cash Preferred** – 6% cash back on groceries (up to $6000 per year, after that you only get 1% on groceries), 3% cash back on gas (no cap), 3% cash back on select department stores (no cap, and the list is somewhere on Amex’s website), and 1% on everything else. Yes, it has a $75 annual fee, but if you get the $150/$250 sign up bonus, and spend more than $50 per week on just groceries, this card is better than the non-annual fee version of this card. Also if you’re making a major purchase, like a TV or a computer, I always recommend using this card over the Double Cash, because while American Express is known for their stellar customer service and warranty protection, Citi can be spotty at times and a pain in the ass to deal with. Warranty&gt;Cash Back in my opinion when making a major purchase. The sign up bonus on this card is technically $450 right now, but you can normally get a $250 sign up bonus if you've never had an Anerican Express card before. The normal bonus is $150 \n\n3. **Chase AARP Visa Restaurants and Gas (NOT the travel AARP Visa)** – 3% cash back on restaurants, 3% cash back on gas, and 1% on everything else. Both the bonus categories have no caps, and I’d recommend using the AARP Visa for gas instead of the BCP, since I believe (I don’t know since I don’t have it) it’s a little harder to redeem cash back with the Amex than it is the AARP. If you eat out/go out drinking a lot, I’d definitely recommend getting this no annual fee card for the extra 1%. If you don’t go out to eat or drink that much, than save the hard pull and stick with the above two cards. Right now this card has a $200 sign up bonus, but it's normally a $100 sign up bonus\n\n\n4. **Discover It** – I’ve actually not been able to get any of my friends and family to sign up for this card because they dislike rotating categories you have to sign up for every quarter, but the 5% rotating categories are pretty good AND you get double cash back he first year you have the card. So those 5% rotating categories and 1% on all other spend become 10% and 2% cash back the first year. It also has no foreign transaction fee, but unless you’re going to China, this isn’t the best feature since not as many places outside the US accept Discover. Still, it’s a great cash back card if you don’t mind rotating categories. There's no cash sign up bonus on this card\n\nThe next 5 cards are alternatives (and one addition) to the above 4 cards, that depending on your specific situation may be better for you than the above.\n\n5. **Amazon Prime Store Card (NOT the Chase Amazon Card)** – the Amazon Prime card gets 5% cash back on all Amazon purchases if you have Amazon Prime. If you shop on Amazon a lot and have Amazon Prime, then I’d definitely recommend this card, even though you won’t be able to use it on anything but Amazon. If you don’t have prime and don’t plan on getting Prime, use the Amex BCP to buy gift Amazon gift cards at grocery stores for 6% cash back. I don't believe there's a sign up bonus on this card\n\n6. **Capital One Quicksilver (NOT the Quicksilver One)** – an alternative to the Citi Double Cash that only gets 1.5% cash back on everything, but it’s easier to get than the Citi Double Cash with a lower credit score, and it has no foreign transaction fees. So if you’re credit isn’t excellent or you do occasionally travel (but you don’t want a travel card), then the Capital One Quicksilver might be a better travel card for you over the Citi Double Cash. This card also has a $100 sign up bonus right now\n\n\n7. **American Express Blue Cash Everyday** – 3% on groceries (up to $6000 per year), 2% on gas (no cap), and 1% on everything else with no annual fee. If you don’t like an annual fee or spend less than $50 per week on groceries, than you’re better off getting this card than the above Preferred version with an annual fee. This card also technically has a $300 sign up bonus right now, it normally has a $100 sign up bonus.\n\n8. **Sam’s Club MasterCard** – 5% on gas (up to $6000 per year, then 1% after that), 3% on dining (no cap, kind of), 3% on travel (no cap, kind of), and 1% on everything else, BUT you can only earn $5000 max in cash back in a calendar year, which isn’t bad, but it’s still basically a cap. This is actually the best cash back card for dining, gas, and travel, but it effectively has a $45 annual fee and it has a huge catch with how much of a huge pain in the ass trying to redeem your cash back. In order to redeem your cash back, first, you have to be a member of Sam’s Club, which is $45 per year for the cheapest membership. In order to then actually get your cash back, every February Sam’s Club will mail you a check with your cash back for the past year, and you have to then go to a Sam’s Club within 180 to cash the check or it’ll expire and you’ll lose your rewards. So a lot of people I tell about this card are turned off by how to redeem the cash back. But if you’re a member of Sam’s Club or don’t mind how the cash back is redeemed, it’s a better card that the Chase AARP Visa. I think this card has a $25 sign up bonus\n\n\n9. **Chase Freedom** – another 5% rotating category card. The Discover It is better in my opinion unless you want UR’s points for travel or find that Discover isn’t really accepted in your area. But for just cash back, the Discover It is better overall with the double your cashback in your first year. But the Freedom is a Visa, so it is more widely accepted than the Discover It and may be better depending on where you live. This card has a $150 sign up bonus right now, it normally has a $100 sign up bonus.\n\nSo to answer your question, the best cash back credit cards are the ones listed above. Get any combo of them or just get one depending on your needs, but unless you travel frequently, the above cards are all you should be looking at for when it comes to cash back.\n","name":"t1_d16qv39","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-20 15:58:34","week":11}

{"id":"d176mfe","author":"invenio78","body":"In all honesty for most Amex users this is not a problem.  The reason being is that Amex users tend to be higher income earners who spend more money than holder of other cards.  Not by just a small amount either, but like twice as much.  http://www.businessinsider.com/amex-visa-mastercard-and-discover-card-owners-spend-per-month-2015-9  If you are only spending a few hundred dollars a month, you probably don't want a card with an annual fee as it is simply not going to be worth it.\n\nThere are a couple of other things about the card that should be mentioned (or expanded upon) for the American Express Blue Cash Preferred card: \n\n* Cash back at the rate of 6% at grocery stores (up to $6000 per year, and you can purchase gift cards for other stores if you don't normally spend $6k a year on groceries which allows you to \"cheat the system\").  I will often buy Amazon.com cards at the grocery store, but obviously there are dozens of stores to choose from.\n\n* 3% at gas stations.\n\n* 3% at major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others). \n\n* 1% on everything else.  \n\n* Varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back, $10 off a $10 purchase at walmart, $5 off a $5 purchase from itunes/app store, I have used all of these personally) that vary with time.  There are usually close to 100 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods.\n\n* An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases.  Your eligible purchases can be covered when they're accidentally damaged or stolen for up to 90 days from the date of purchase with your Card.\n\n* Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).  A free yearly FICO score.\n\n* And perhaps the most important thing of all,... \"among the best customer satisfaction\" of all the credit card companies ( http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-us-credit-card-satisfaction-study ).\n\n* Last tidbit is a story I would like to share.  I was in Dallas, rented a car, apparently they have toll roads with no toll booths (not sure how a non-local would even pay the toll).  Got a $17 charge from some company in Arizona which I did not recognize.  Reported it to Amex as not authorized and they reversed the charges.  I later found out that it was for the unmarked toll (I guess they use some kind of out-of-state billing company).  So Amex gives you free tolls on rental cars (Joke,... but not really).\n\nThere is an annual fee of $75 but you get $150 as soon as you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months.","name":"t1_d176mfe","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-20 23:29:35","week":11}

{"id":"d177key","author":"distincthead","body":"As for turning that fifty into meaningful extra income, I'd seriously look into starting an online business over day trading and the like. Something like Amazon FBA or even eBay. Buy popular products locally at discount or clearance stores, provided the selling price on Amazon is like 3x higher than your price. Send them in to Amazon and when you get paid, reinvest it. It really shouldn't be hard to snowball something like that into five hundred a month. That is, provided your disability doesn't make leaving the house once or twice a week into a nightmare.","name":"t1_d177key","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-03-20 23:55:21","week":11}
