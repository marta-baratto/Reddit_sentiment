{"id":"3j5kj3","author":"lambosambo","body":"Hi. I am trying to start an online clothing business(mainly starting out with t-shirts)and I have ALOT of questions I want to ask. Bare with me because I am a complete newbie when it comes to this topic which is why I came to Reddit to request help from the professionals. It is a lot of questions but it could also help others as well who are wondering the same thing as me. Thanks in advance! P.S. Sorry for the wall of text.....\n\nFirst off, the **manufacturer**: What company has a reasonable price while maintaining good quality products? I looked into this one a bit and I came down to American Apparel, Next Level, Bella Canvas, etc. I want to ask to those who have used these companies to create your products: is it actually worth the money and how does it feel? \nThe quality of shirts from these companies may be good however I feel like as a business starting out, it could be a bit pricey. I would love to know about companies that have exceptional quality products yet cheaper than the ones I listed if possible.\n\n**Printing Method and screen printers**: This one is a bit tricky because there are several methods when it comes down to printing designs. I've read multiple posts on other forums and I still have a hard time understanding as to which x method is good for y quality shirts or which method is used for what kind of designs. I would appreciate if someone could break it down and literally explain it to me like I'm 5 years old. Also from your guys' first hand experience, which screen printers would you recommend? Just like the t-shirts, I'm not looking to spend an overbearing amount as a startup so I'm looking for quality screen printers, but affordable at the same time. \n\n**Custom Tags**: I'm pretty dead set on having custom tags with my company logo on it but I'm not sure what other information are needed. What I see on a lot of tags are wash instructions, where it is made(new Zealand for example), and material such as cotton. I'm wondering what is legally required to be written on the tags and what can I customly write on my tags.\n\n**Hang Tags**: This I don't have a very good idea as to what is a good price, what is needed on it, or if it's even necessary at all. I have seen many brands with hang tags and it does make them look a lot more professional but I am wondering if it's even worth the investment. Will boost my sale? Is it worth the hassle? If so, I'd like all the information available such as the best manufacturer for hang tags and what is considered a good deal on them.\n\n**Custom Package**: In order for our company to stand out more so than others I want to create a unique packaging. I feel as if clothes are limited as to how you can make the customer feel more appreciative. With a unique packaging, I want the customer to feel like they're getting their moneys worth as well as something a little more than just a shirt with their purchases. I would appreciate it if someone who uses or used packaging can provide all the details such as: manufacturer, price (what is considered cheap), and what should be included in the packaging.(such as details, etc)\nwww.howtostartaclothingcompany.com/t-shirt-packaging/ This website is a good example of what I am talking about.\n\n**Inventory**: I've read an article that suggested that 36 is a good number for startups. It explains that 1-2-2-1 or 1-1-2-2 (1-2-2-1 meaning 1 small – 2 medium – 2 large – 1 X-large) is the best sizes you can have. 36 products will be 6-12-12-6 following the method above. However, I also want to hear your guys' opinion on what the best way to stock your products is. The most conservative method that will have the products when needed but can order more and waste the least amount.\n\n**Shipping and handling**: What do most clothing companies use to ship their products throughout the state or out of state? Which shipping company is the most cost efficient, reliable and fast? \nRegistering the company: Is it necessary to register as LLC even if it is an brand new online store and I don't know the outcome of our store? Please in detail inform me why.\n\n**Refunds**: I've noticed a lot of websites that have 100% guaranteed refunds. How do they deal with this? What are some other common return policies that will satisfy the customer yet will give me the upper advantage and what do i do with the returned items if it's faulty? And what if there's nothing wrong with it? Also I'm sure there are people who'll have many reasons, even it may not be the item's fault, that'll make up reasons to get a refund. What do I do in that case? \n\n**Website**: Everyone needs a website. However, I want to try to use the website as a \"unique shopping experience\" to attract customers. Is it worth it to spend a lot of $ on a custom website to use the website as a form of advertisement, meaning people will be at awe at how different and unique the website is compared to other shopping websites. Obviously the products will be on par with the website so it won't be so one sided.(Good website and good products) \n\n**Promotions and mailing list**: When you first enter a website, you sometimes see a popup that asks you to sign up for a mailing list. I'm wondering what information I should include on the promotion popup and the emails I send out to our mailing list subscribers. Also, what are good ideas for promotions?\n\n**Payment Method**: I want the customers to have as many choices as possible when purchasing our products. Some payment method I have in mind are credit card, Paypal and bitcoin if possible. I'm wondering to those who have an online shop and make daily sales, which company is reliable and efficient with the lowest transaction fees and will earn you the most in the long run. Also I'm wondering if it is possible to get scammed such as drawbacks on Paypal and how to go about it if that were to happen. Some online payment companies I have in mind: Paypal and Stripe\n\n**Legal Policies**: I'm not quite sure how to write the FAQs or privacy policies but I do feel like it is a way to gain the customers trust. I'm wondering if I need to hire a lawyer to write the legal stuff or if there is any other way of approaching it. \n\n**Subscriptions that could boost the sale**: I was wondering if paying the subscription fees to sites like Amazon for $40 a month would be a good idea to boost our sales up. Also another idea I have is paying for a live support such as Zopim for around $20-$25 a month to potentially increase our sales in that form. I would love to hear your input on this. \n\nWhat are some tips on making your store look as legit and professional as possible? How do I gain the customers trust? Any tips that you've learned over the course of time will be an abundance of help for me.\n\n**San Diego Area Manufacturers and Printers**??? Before I settle on an actual online manufacturers, I want to see if local companies can create amazing products that are on par but for a cheaper price. I also want to learn the different types of printing method so I have a better idea of which design suits better for each method and material. Of course this is a question for those who live in San Diego area that share the same passion as me.","name":"t3_3j5kj3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-01 02:19:42","week":36}

{"id":"3ja065","author":"CuteCreatures","body":"I just moved back to the U.K. with my wife after living abroad for 27 years and owning and running various small businesses. I sold them all prior to moving back. After about 3 nanoseconds it became clear to me that Business is in my Blood. No way around it. As ever, funds are limited, what to do, how will I avoid crash and burn within the first year?\n\nOK, here goes, using the Reddit Entrepreneur Survey:\n\n    The business is just getting started...placing 100% original artwork, all quirky, non-serious, funny, cheeky cartoon-style animal related stuff on good products such as mugs, tees, cushion/pillow covers, bags, laptop sleeves, aprons and baby bibs.\n\n    My daughter has done this incredibly wonderful cartoon animal artwork, most of it some years ago. I think it's good enough to place on products, you know, tee shirts, mugs, bags etc. But, her output these days is limited as she's very busy with her full time non-art related work which she loves very much. I have a few of her old drawings, she's done one or two more since, I pay her a fee once a product with her stuff on it sells. I was hoping for more artistic output from her but it's clear she's too busy. So, I've reached out to the artist community and I've found one or two absolute gems who have been producing some fabulous animal characters for me. I pay for the work and the commercial license rights for each piece of art, the artist is happy I'm happy, a win-win!\n\n    I started working on this new business about 3 months ago. I rented a 1000 square foot commercial space, bought a Direct to Garment Epson printer (huge beast, horribly expensive, yet to use it yet!) for tee shirt printing and started working on designs. But, tee-shirts have taken 2nd billing since then. I've since bought sublimation printing and pressing equipment so that we can print on so much more than just tee-shirts.\n\n    Since starting up and getting ready to sell I have to admit that I've been spending most of the time learning the process of pressing mugs. It's easy enough to do fairly well but I wanted to do it 100% perfectly and have finally succeeded. Our original artwork looks FABULOUS on mugs. So, now we've just started the process of printing on to fabrics and I'd say we're 90% of the way to perfection. Another 2 weeks and it'll be 100% right. Only then will the products be of the required quality to offer to the public at large. So, per the survey, our 6-month plan is to have quality manufacturing processes for mugs (already done) and the other products we'll be selling. Part of that 6 month plan is to have 40 - 50 COMPLETELY ORIGINAL full-colour animal-related designs, all utterly non-serious and funny. Currently I have 28 designs completed with more under way so the 40 - 50 figure should be easily attainable. If each design can be printed on mugs, tees, bibs, aprons, laptop sleeves and bags you can see how we'll have a very varied product line at the end of the 6 months (each design multiplied by each different item it can be printed on). This variety will allow us to go “live” with our own website. I don't want to publish an e-commerce website with only a few products, people will get bored! Within the first 6 months (remember, 3 months already gone) I would hope to have generated some sales via. Amazon, social media and our own website.\n\nAt 1 year I would hope we'd have 60-70 original designs and that we'd be selling at reasonable volume, perhaps 4000 - 6000 units per month. At that point we'll be well into profitable territory. Hopefully at the 1 year mark I'll have two or three employees. Right now it's just me.\n\nThe 5-year plan? Assuming all is well at that point there are really only two things I see happening: (a) the business has expanded hugely and has become factory-sized big with 30 - 50 employees or (b) a large cash-bloated entity sees the brand and its success as well as its future potential and makes me an offer I can't refuse. I will be not all that far from retirement age, after all!\n\n    I've had a few negative experiences so far, entirely of my own doing: (a) Not really having a solid business plan, sort of winging it for the first 2 months although I've settled down now to a real strategy. (b) Opening up our business account with the bank took a month longer than it should have, I actually had to chase them down to retrieve and act upon my on-line application. I should have started bugging them after day 1 of applying on line. (c) I've started marketing on Amazon and I'm using the Pricing for Momentum strategy (start high, inch down until we find the happy medium). I'm doing it this way because I don't want to cheapen our brand even before it's off the ground by starting too low. I know our products will sell, but there is real terror and nervous excitement during this period of price adjustment.\n\n    If I could travel back in time (3 months!) I would have had a much more concise business plan. I could have saved myself 2 months rental simply by concentrating on designs first and then only getting the rental space and manufacturing equipment in thereafter. Mind you, in the interim I've been teaching myself new skills. Photoshop, the printing and manufacturing process, on-line marketing, ordering, packing etc. It has been Back to School, with me and Youtube and the Internet as the teachers but well worth it.\n\nI'll try and post on this thread about once per month to update things. A quick summary: We've yet to make our first sale, we only have a few mugs on the market, we're Pricing for Value on Amazon and we're still working on new products, new original artwork and building our company e-commerce site. Watch This Space and Thanks for Reading!\n\nNow, I think it's either time for a nervous breakdown or a jog. I'll go for the jog.\n","name":"t3_3ja065","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-02 00:12:43","week":36}

{"id":"3jaxvg","author":"fizzlefist","body":"At the start of the year I made a pact with myself to buckle down and work towards clearing out my debt.\n\nI had 4 credit cards to start:  an Amazon Rewards card (19.24% variable, $1800 limit), a Visa through my credit union (8% $500 limit), a Barclaycard Master Card (22.99% $3,500 limit), a Best Buy Store Card (no interest financing always paid off on time, $1,600 limit).  I also had a seasonal loan from my Credit Union ($5,000 at 5% APR over 5 years).  Additionally I had a no-interest financing account with Motorola for my phone ($3,600 limit for some reason) and a auto loan from my old credit union for somewhere around $20k at 4.5% over 72 months, and a pair of Federal Subsidized Stafford student loans taken in 2013 for $5,500 at 3.4% and 3.86% which were still in deferment .\n\nMy total debt was somewhere in the ballpark of $38,000.  At the beginning of the year I was bringing home about $870 after taxes and company health insurance.  I had maybe $300 in savings that fluctuated wildly as sometimes I needed to pull from it to pay everything for the month, but I'd always try to put a little bit back in every paycheck.\n\n---\n\nBack in April I started using You Need A Budget and switched to new local Credit Union (my old one was in a different town, but worked fine for the most part).  The new credit union is nice as they give me 2% interest on my checking account for having an auto loan with them, and the refi terms were very good.\n\nSo here's where I'm at now.  The Barclaycard outstanding balance was paid off, and they have offers almost all the time for 0% interest balance transfers for 10-12 months with a 3% transfer fee.  So I consolidated my outstanding credit card debt that *was* accruing interest onto it, which has zero interest accrual until July next year.  The credit union visa has no balance and I don't use it any longer.  The Amazon Rewards card is what I now use to pay for everything I can to get those rewards points, and I pay it off 100% every single month.\n\nI was able to refinance my car loan through the new credit union for a 60 month period at 2%.  Currently the payments are around $375/mo  and my balance is $17,600.  My old credit union's seasonal loan is down to $4000, still at 5% for another 48 months.\n\nMy student loan deferment period ended as I stopped taking classes when the financial aid dried up last year.  I've just made my first payment and they're currently at $5,490 on the 3.86% loan and $5,470 on the 3.4% loan.  Min payments are $56 and $54 respectively.\n\nMy Best Buy and Motorola Credit accounts are still not accruing interest and I've got a set schedule to pay them off before each purchase hits the financing offer end date.\n\nMy income has also improved recently.  Today I've hit my 1-year anniversary with the company and my take home pay is about to jump significantly between a raise and the company now paying 100% of my health plan.  I estimate my take home pay is going to be around $980 biweekly, but I won't see for certain till the pay periods line up in a few weeks.\n\n---\n\nIn summery: I've all eliminated interest on all my credit card accounts (temporarily), and I'm working hard to bring my personal spending down.  My savings is up to around $700 and rising steadily and all my bills are planned for in advance thanks to YNAB.\n\nMy monthly bills are:\n\n* $130 for cable/internet\n* $175 for rent (shared housing)\n* $375 for my car payment ($17.6k balance)\n* $225 for car insurance\n* $110 minimum payment on my student loans ($10,900 balance)\n* $105 min payment on the seasonal loan ($4k balance)\n* $30 for my phone bill\n* $25 min payment for my Motorola Credit account, I'm paying $40/mo to pay it off on schedule ($280 balance)\n* $30 minimum payment on the Barclaycard ($4k balance)\n* $35 minimum payment on the Best Buy card, actually paying $100+ according to the financing schedule ($1250 balance)\n\nAny suggestions on what else I might do to speed things along?","name":"t3_3jaxvg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-02 04:29:49","week":36}

{"id":"3jd655","author":"EpiHamster","body":"Hi, I leave in Eastern Europe and I do business in USA. \nI do internet marketing for a living and run a small web store – selling some musical equipment in US. \n\n**Disclaimer:** Please keep in mind, that I’m not 100% sure that all of this is correct according to US tax laws, for the this reason I don’t want to publish names and links here (if you can give me any tips on US law – it would be great!)\n\nFor last 2 years I was trying and testing many things to make business look like US local and to ease the process for customers to work with me. \nMy goal is to provide services and sell goods the way the customer could not notice the difference between local US Company and mine.\n\n\nSo here is some tips:\n\n**Address, shipping and returns:**\n\nYou need an address, for many reasons you need an address. I have 2 options for this:\n\nI started with USPS post office address.\n\n**Pros:** Easy – you can choose any location from [their site](https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction!input.action) and use it.\n\n**Cons:** It’s not your address by any means.\n\nFor internet marketing services, this was ok – you can choose any location and easy get traffic in local search there. However, for selling goods it’s a bad decision. So now I use the **option 2**:\n\nA lot intermediary companies have a warehouse in US – they consolidate your purchases in US stores and ship them to your location. Like [shipito.com](https://www.shipito.com/), [viabox.com](https://www.viabox.com/). \n\nFind the one who work more with your county, and choose small or middle one – it’s easier to negotiate some extra services (like testing and making photo). Use their address and their services. Now customers able to return broken goods!\n \nShipping company now manage my returns (you also need US address for returns to sell at Amazon). I just pay for testing and photo of returned goods (8$ per item) and for shipping returned goods back to me – if they are broken. It has also decrease replace time for the broken goods – if the warehouse found that item is broken – I ship new immediately and do not wait for original item to arrive.\n\n**Calls and number**\n\nTried many web messengers, skype. What I wasn’t expect is that conversion multiplied by 3 when I try a US phone number and start receiving calls from the customers. Ppl like to talk…\n\nUS phone with fancy voice menu cost me about $30\\month tried [grasshopper.com](http://grasshopper.com/) and [mightycall.com](https://www.mightycall.com/) – stayed with the last one. \n\n\n**Payments**\n\nPayPal – I have a business account in pp, all the payments converted in my currency and I transfer them to my bank account (after my account was banned by PP for no reason I transfer them asap).\n\n**Pros:** It’s easy to receive and highly trusted by customers. \n\n**Cons:** My account was banned by PP, the money that was on this account I received only after 6 months. The reasons still unclear.\n\n\n\nSorry for my English, hope someone will found this useful. \nCheers!

{"id":"3jdnrq","author":"LtRalph","body":"I have an SO who enjoys the fruits of my labor in the churning game, but doesn't want cards that she wont keep indefinitely. Also, churning really reduces your AAoA, so having a collection of valuable cards that you will always keep is a good idea. Here's my list:  \n  \n*Recommended:*  \n**IHG:** 49$ AF for 1 night certificate. 2 of us having this card = 1 weekend at a nice hotel for 98$ (dont get less than 60k+50$ sign up bonus. 80k+50$ possible).  \n**Chase Freedom:** no AF. nice categories, a stash for UR when you're in between churning a transfer card, and for some reason I still get the extra 10 points per purchase. unbeatable for small purchases.(20k sign up possible)  \n**All of my AMEX personal cards:** personal cards can't be churned, and the annual fee waived for military :P Some people keep the **SPG** in lieu of a 2% card.  \n**club carlson:** 40k points for 75$. was definitely worth it before the devaluation, now its just personal preference. (85k sign up)  \n**Fidelity amex:** Easy 2% no AF card. I add it to a 529 plan. Can sub for **double cash** or **SPG**.  \n**Wyndham:** 69$ for 15k, but EVERY property costs 15k, so ANY Wyndham property weekend for 138$? yup. This card is next on my list for my wife and I to apply for(dont get less than 45k sign up bonus).  \n*recommended by others*  \n**Discover IT**: no AFrotating 5%, but not as valuable as UR.  \n**Citi dividend**: no AF another rotating 5%, but not as valuable as UR  \n**Ink Cash**: 2x dining/gas, 5x office supply/communications, no AF  \n**Chase AARP**: no AF3% dining, 3% gas  \n**USBank cash+**: no AF 5% in fastfood/categories  \n**amex simply cash buisness**: no AF 5% officesupply/phone, 3% dining/airfare/gas/advertising/hotels/car rental  \n  \n-  \n  \n*Meh:*  \n**Marriott:** 85$ for free night cat 1-5. 170$ for a non-toptier weekend. Personally I'd rather churn the card a few times for their nights/flights combo, but lots of people disagree with me.   \n**Hyatt:** 74$ for free night cat 1-4. 148$ for a non-toptier weekend. Thats barely not worth it to me, but many people love it. also the status is nice.  \n**southwest**: there is a bonus to keep the card, but not worth it. Better to churn it every 24 months.  \n  \n-  \n  \n*MS cards:*  \n**Blue cash:** 6% groceries on 6k - 75$ AF= 165$ a year above a 2%.  \n**Sallie Mae**: no AF 5% on 250$ each of gas and groceries, 750$ books (amazon). Thats 300$ over a 2% for gas/groceries, and up to 450$ for books/amazon  \n**AmEx Old Blue Cash** 5% Cash Back on Gas, Groceries, and Drugstores after $6500 spent. limit 50k  \n**SPG**: Only for people that value 1 SPG over 2%. AF 95$  \n**Fidelity amex or double cash**: no AF gold standard  \n**Ink plus**: 5x office supply stores/some utilities. 2x gas/hotels. 95$ AF. I prefer to churn this since I don't MS enough to make it worth the AF.  \n**Bank of America Travel Rewards Card** (if you are Platinum Honors Client)2.625% cash back  \n**BBVA NBA Amex** no AF 5x twice a year.  \n**BoA Better balance reward** no AF 25$ per quarter paying more than the minimum, +5$ per quarter with BoA bank account  \n  \n-  \n  \n*Grandfathered cards:*  \n**Citi Forward** with the 5x on Dining+Amazon  \n**Priceline Visa** 2% CB, 50% bonus redemptions on NYOP, 10% back on travel redemption, 5% CB on NYOP. Card is effectively 3.3% everyday and 8.25% on NYOP if you redeem on priceline.  \n  \nThere are other cards out there that people keep because of **retention offers if you call in (always ask for this before canceling)**, status, lounge, bag check, or bonuses from spend. These include Hilton reserve/surpass (1 night for 10k spend/diamond for 40k) and airline cards like delta/united/AA (bag check/lounge/priority boarding/status).

{"id":"3jicq1","author":"mgoulart","body":"Thinking about it some more, here's why I believe Amex only reimburses fees: fees are easily waived by airlines since they are an optional, negotiable cost. \n\nAmex must have worked out a deal with the airlines they support (their list doesn't include all airlines) and probably only pay 25-50% of the fee that is posted. Here's the airlines they support: http://imgur.com/ThrGqhL\n\nIt's been estimated that the true cost for an extra bag to an airline is $2. http://business.time.com/2014/02/05/that-25-checked-bag-service-only-costs-airlines-2/\n\nSo for example, a $25 baggage fee could probably end up in only $10 payout to the airline and the airline still makes a profit.\n\nFor Amex it's a great deal. For airlines, Amex probably gave the incentive that the more cards out there that refund these fees, the more likely passengers will decide to check their bags knowing that their card will cover it, thus increasing revenues and as we've seen with the $2 cost, it's a marginal cost to them.\n\nTo finalize, the 3 factors that I think support this:\n\n1. the fact that Amex only allows this on a few airlines. Indicates that they worked out a deal with those and were unable to get the others to the table, like Allegiant which relies pretty much solely on ancillary fees for revenues.\n\n2. The fact that Amex only reimburses fees instead of flight costs, since flight costs are not an optional cost to the airlines and therefore not negotiable.\n\n3. The true cost of a checked bag being only $2 indicates that airlines can be brought to the table to negotiate. Change fees are also a negligible cost and more of a penalty, and airlines commonly waive those for their elite tier members anyway.\n\n4. The delay in reimbursing these indicates that for Amex it's not a simple matter of eating the cost of the $200 or $100 airline fee credit because they are probably banking on only having to pay out 20% of that instead of the face value. \n\nIf they were actually counting on users actually spending $200 or $100 in airline fees and that was the cost of doing business with the user, they wouldn't delay in paying it out. The delay indicates that it's not a cost they were expecting to have and thus are scrambling to figure out what to do and how to distinguish those transactions from real \"fees\". \n\nThey may just throw in the towel and hope not many people figure it out. They cant disallow Amex in the MileagePlusX app for payments, something which United wont be thrilled about. My guess is they are rushing to add more details to the transactions and will probably not allow MileagePlusX transactions to count as fees for reimbursement. That required United to pass along extra information in the transaction, since before August, MileagePlusX purchases were reporting as *United*.\n\nThe recent delay in reimbursements was probably an alarm raised at Amex HQ when United then told Amex that they can't accept a smaller payment for a fee that had *real* cost to them close to 100% of the face value in the form of Amazon gift cards sold in their MileagePlusX app. ","name":"t3_3jicq1","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-09-03 19:07:22","week":36}

The CapitalOne card is the one that is killing me.  I make the payments, but they turn around and charge me interest and it puts me right back in the hole again.  I was looking at Citi bank: (https://www.citi.com/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-simplicity-credit-card&amp;category=balance-transfer-credit-cards&amp;afc=151) specifically to see if I could get this debt under control and have it paid off by the end of next year.  I know it's not much debt in comparison to some, but it's some I'd like to take care of, and frankly, wish I never acquired.  Between my other bills I don't really have much more to spare month-to-month.  Would something like the card from Citi be worth it?  \n\nBreakdown:\nCaptilOne card:\n$2488.36\n$77 per month\nBestBuy:\n$1427.85\n$25 minimum payment, but I pay $50-75\nAmazon:\n$897.88\n$25 minimum payment, but I pay $40-50\n\nAlso have rent that runs $950-ish (electric bill gets factored in) as well as phone bill that is $85 and TV/internet that runs $60 together\n\nUnfortunately I'm not sure where to find the interest rates, I'd have to dig through the paperwork and they don't show on the individual websites account information.  I can afford what I've been paying as the above.  But the interest on the CapitalOne takes a big chunk out each month and I don't feel like I'm ever making a dent (interest is usually $55 charged per month)\n\nThank you","name":"t3_3jny7l","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-04 22:41:35","week":36}

{"id":"3joret","author":"themarcoproject","body":"Hi everyone,\n\nThe last time someone posted about Chase Freedom cash back bonus was last two months, so I was just wondering if anyone who did not see the previous post would like to give it a try. \n\nI am a [broke] college student and I have been using my Chase Freedom card for more than a year now. The perks that come with the card are amazing! When I got approved for the card, I was given a relatively high credit limit--at least for a college student--and Chase has been consistently raising my credit limit over the last year. I use the card ALL the time because I thought why not take advantage of the unlimited 1% cash back on the purchases that I make anyway. Every three or so months, the card has promotions where you can earn more cash back if you shop specific brands/places (Amazon, Target, groceries, travel, etc), which is absolutely fantastic! There is no annual fee and 0% APR in the first year! \n\nThe application process is quite easy. If you sign up for the card with my link, we both will get rewards. You will get $100 after you are approved and spend $500 on purchases (on literally anything) in the first three months from account opening, and I will get $50, so it's a win-win :D To be honest, [as a broke college student] I could use the reward from the refer-a-friend program to cover my day-to-day college expenses. After you're approved, you can make more money by referring your link to your friends (up to 10 friends). \n\nIf you are interested, PM me and I will send my link. Additionally, should you have any question, please do not hesitate to comment below. I will be glad to answer any questions you have about the card. \n\nThank for reading, guys. Have a great long weekend! ","name":"t3_3joret","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-09-05 02:25:39","week":36}

{"id":"3jp65c","author":"JessthePest","body":"Hey-o!!\n\nMy hubs and I are basically cook-everything-from-scratch people and we go through a 25# bag of flour, 25# bag of rice, 10# bag of beans and 10# of oatmeal a month. I'm getting sick of a) picking up heavy bags and pouring food into smaller receptacles and inevitably spilling and/or b) scooping food into smaller receptacles, bumping the edge of the bag and inevitably spilling. Also, leaving the paper bags on the basement pantry floor always made me nervous vis-a-vis pests, etc.\n\nSo, I'm looking into some kind of container storage system for these items. Needs-to-haves would be: food safe, air-tight (-ish, not like Rubbermaid totes, they don't have a tight enough seal), large enough to hold an entire bag plus a little extra, sturdy enough not to collapse under the weight of the storage *and* pouring food into it, durable enough not to crack after a year or two. Nice-to-haves would be: clear or some other way to identify what's inside (yea, I know, labels, but I have toddlers who *looooooooooove* stickers.), some way to keep the lid attached to the bin while it's open (like a hinged lid) so it can't walk away (toddlers, again), some kind of ergonomic handling, like casters or handles for easy lifting (I rearrange my pantry for fun--don't judge me :-P), not *terribly* tall (I don't want to crawl into the bin to scrape out the last of the flour), and since I need smaller and larger bins I'd like them to somehow coordinate (stackable or interlocking or matching in design) so they don't take up a crazy amount of room.\n\nEDIT: also, cost *is* a factor-I can't go crazy. And there are some CAR-razy options on Amazon. But, at this point, I feel like if I'm going to spend +$50 on a *box*, I want some recommendations from my \"tribe.\"\n\nThis is something I'd be willing to spend a little money on in order to reap the benefits of ease/convenience, and it fits with our long-term frugality goals, because once I get those damn bags off the floor, I have *plans* for our basement pantry.

{"id":"3jrajm","author":"lookatthebr1ghtside","body":"**1. Should I apply for a CLI on a single credit card or on all of my credit cards at the time same time?**\n\nI remember seeing articles saying that some people apply for multiple new lines of credit on the same day and it shows up on their credit history as just [one remark](http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2014/05/29/apply-multiple-credit-cards-day) (if done on the same day; though this is an oversimplification and I know there are more variables to this). I guess one of the thoughts is that if you're gonna apply for credit, consider applying for multiple lines on the same day and your score should be relatively unaffected in the long run. I'm wondering if the logic that argues for applying for multiple cards one day is analogous for requesting multiple CLI's on all my cards in one day. \n\n**2. If not, can what is the best way to go about requesting CLI's to while minimizing hard pulls given my current financial situation?** \n\nBasically I'm trying to maximize my credit building score in the long run by increasing my available credit while keeping balances low (better utilization ratio). Last year I got several e-mails from some of my credit cards saying that I could get free CLI's without hard pulls and I overlooked them. Kicking myself over that now. \n\nI am 28 and a resident physician (stable job in pediatrics) with income of $56k a year. I have &gt;$150k in loans to pay back (though I'm strongly considering PSLF especially if I do a fellowship; will unfortunately continue to put life on hold). I went to a public undergrad and between help from my parents and working 2-3 jobs in undergrad I came out debt free but medical school loans are currently destroying me. Working while going to school early on helped build me a decent credit score. I drive a 99' Toyota. \n\nCredit score is 756 on CK, 794 -&gt; 768 on Amex MyFICO score (not sure what caused the drop but credit scores are always variable in my book and I'm looking more at the long run), 768 on Mint.  \n\nI have 6 credit cards and  always pay my credit card statement balances in full (usually &lt;$1200 spread across all cards:\n\n-  Bank of America: my first credit card I got when I was working in college, $1500 limit (I think BofA does hard pulls)\n- Costco-Amex: this will sadly be converted to Citi in the future to my understanding; $5000 limit (I'm not sure if Amex does hard pulls)\n- Chase Amazon: Got this card on a whim to capitalize on a $50 discount (probably stupid of me in the long run); $3500 limit\n- Chase Freedom: second oldest card with revolving 5% CB; $4500 limit\n- Express Store card: $750 limit\n- Capital One travel card: Newest line that I got for some cash back; $10,000\n\n","name":"t3_3jrajm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-05 18:20:35","week":36}

{"id":"3jsknj","author":"danthediner","body":"I sell a lot of vinyl records and CDs on Amazon. I used go through my inventory and copy/paste titles, artists, and condition onto a Google Doc and post that on Craigslist. People don't buy records there as much, but it's resulted in several really high dollar batch sales to collectors. My inventory has skyrocketed, however, and going through everything manually is just no longer feasible. I need help putting together at least a semi-automated method for keeping track of inventory.\n\nI subscribed to a professional seller account, and was under the impression that the inventory reports feature would meet this need right away. No such luck. I've contacted Amazon support a few times and they are useless. They did add \"category listing report\" as a tool, but that only narrows things down to the broadest category differences. So I can request a report for all \"music\" but I can't narrow it down to records or CDs. Even when I try this, though, it comes up with a list of like 6 items; I have nearly a thousand under that category. I've also tried requesting an 'active listings report' but that came out with a list featuring many hundreds more items than I have actually have active.\n\nCan someone help me out here? Maybe a solution would be to figure out where to get the full list of active inventory from, and then to filter it down to just the vinyl category elsewhere. I generally use Google Sheets/Docs, but I could get my hands on any software if you can explain how to do it on Excel or OpenOffice or Numbers.\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_3jsknj","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-06 00:13:53","week":36}

The point is to complete offers, and use your earnings competing in auctions against other players. These auctions work similarly to penny auctions, except the prize is the collective amount spent in bids on that auction.\n\nThis is test week #3. The event will be today (Sept 6th) at 9pm Eastern time (8pm Central). All you have to do is show up and start bidding. It will last for 1 hour, and when it ends, the players placing in the top 3 will get money via PayPal. This week the prizes are as follows:\n\n1: $5\n\n2: $3\n\n3: $2\n\nAccount balances will not be altered like last week. The Loftybid cash you earn is now yours to keep and cash-out (see cash-out page). I would suggest doing any offers you want to do before the event to give yourself a head start on the competition. The offerwalls on this site are Super Rewards and Offer Toro. From my experience with them, they have a decent amount of free and easy offers like watching a video or going through a slideshow. You may not need very much Loftybid cash to do well in this event, it's just to test the quality of the offerwalls and the website as a whole. \n\nNotes: 15 people must participate during the testing hour for prizes to be awarded. You may have an Amazon gift card instead of PayPal payment upon request. If you sign in with Facebook and place in the top 3, you must message the Loftybid facebook page with your PayPal email or choice of an Amazon gift card.

{"id":"cumizm6","author":"brp","body":"If you are responsible with credit cards, then yes, it's perfectly fine.  In fact, a lot of people make a mini-hobby out of churning different credit card sign-up offers and bonuses to make out the best they can.  There's even a whole subreddit called /r/churning that's dedicated to it.\n\nThat being said, I have over a dozen cards myself, and here are some of my current favorites:\n\n**Chase Sapphire Preferred (CSP):**\n\n* This is my primary travel card that I use for work and personal travel and dining out.\n* 2x points for travel and dining and easy point transfer and usage.\n* Primary rental car insurance coverage\n* No FOREX fees\n* Nice card made of metal with chip and sign technology\n* $95 annual fee\n\n**Capital One Quicksilver Cashback:**\n\n* 1.5% Cash Back on everything\n* I keep this in a drawer and use it for all my auto-pay stuff like utilities, EZ Pass Tolls, etc..  where they typically don't fall into a category for bonus cash back.  Also, by keeping all my autopay stuff on this card and not using it at stores, it is very unlikely to get skimmed and cause me to have to update all my autopay stuff.\n* No Annual Fee\n* No FOREX Fee\n\n**Amazon Store Card:**\n\n* I use this for all my Amazon stuff, and it gives you 5% cashback all the time.\n* Do NOT confuse this with the Chase Amazon Visa credit card (I have this one too) that only gives you 3% cashback.  This is a new store card that Amazon offers like a department store-branded credit card.\n* No fees for this one, and it shows in the horrid web GUI for the card billing/payment.\n\n**AMEX Blue Cash Preferred:**\n\n* 6% Cashback on groceries, 3% at gas stations, 1% everywhere else.\n* This is my grocery store and Costco card (until Costco starts accepting Visa next year).\n* $95 fee, but worth it if you spend more than $250 a month on groceries.\n* I also use this card to buy gas station gift cards at the supermarket, wherein I get 6% cashback on them and then also get charged the lower \"cash\" price at the gas stations around me that charge $0.10 a gallon higher to use a credit card.\n\nThe above 4 cards pretty much cover all my purchases, but I will sometimes substitute with my Chase Freedom if the categories are right.","name":"t1_cumizm6","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-01 03:20:12","week":36}

{"id":"cumqlw0","author":"NickFYG","body":"Seems like you've been doing your research! You're 10 steps ahead of most who want to start up. I am Founder of [FYG Clothing LLC](http://shopfyg.com) and I can share how we started up! **Manufacturer &amp; Printing Method** --&gt; We normally go with Alstyle's 1301 blank tees. In my opinion, they are best for the price and quality. (You'll find Alstyle blanks being frequently used with brand that are sold in Zumies, Tillys, Pacsun etc..) And for printing, always go with screen printing AKA silk screening. **Tags &amp; Packaging** --&gt; I assume you'd want your brand to look like the #1 brand out there so for your custom t-shirt tags, it is as simple as picking a popular competing brand's shirt at the mall, snap a picture, go home and almost replicate how they word their tags, but throw your own style to it! (designed ours in Adobe Photoshop) As for Hand tags, yes I do recommend them. They make your brand look even better. For packaging, we don't to anything too special but give it a clean look. (11x13 Clear Poly Bags, Order Slip Put Inside The Box, Clear Tape, InkJet Shipping Labels) **Inside Your Site** --&gt; You are always welcome to take a peak at our site and replicate our FAQ, Product Avai, Return &amp; Exchm Shipping &amp; Hand etc.. to your very own liking. Just don't COPY it word for word. Make sure you know your site like the back of your hand.. And for payments, always and I mean always!! offer Paypal(user no longer have to have an account with Paypal to checkout) . It is also very smart to make other payment options available. Chances of you missing out on a sale on less likely with multiple payment options.. If you ask my opinion, live support would honestly be doing too much for a clothing company. Yes, it makes it look more official, but that would be taking money out of your pockets that could be used for something more beneficial. Amazon would also be in the same boat. **Screen Printers** --&gt; Hit up Google and start making them phone calls! Ask around for quotes to all your local screen printers. **Marketing** --&gt; Social Media is the waaaay! Instagram is free. Facebook is free. Twitter is free. Take advantage of it!...

{"id":"cun12po","author":"doc_samson","body":"Do you have the \"advanced algorithms\" already developed? If not you are looking at a need for serious computer science/math types for that part, not just your \"programmer for hire\" types. Things like this are NOT cheap and easy to create, and require very skilled researchers. A few years ago Netflix held a contest to improve their recommendation algorithm and the $1M prize went to a team that gave them a tiny fractional increase in speed. So this is not something to take lightly.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, but speaking as a developer (not for hire) your question comes across as \"I have this great idea, now I need someone to do all the work to develop it\" which is such a common comment to developers that it is often completely ignored.\n\nIf you have already gotten your ducks in a row so to speak, and you really just need a CTO, then you need to be aware that this\n\n&gt; I've had a lot of difficulties identifying what services I would need from, say, Amazon Web Services\n\nis called *solutionism*, i.e. you have a vague idea of what you need, haven't fully fleshed it out, don't understand the technology, and are charging directly into making technical decisions that can ultimately hamstring you going forward.\n\nWhat you need to do is outline your requirements as /u/AuraGlow recommended. Requirements can be high level like that or incredibly detailed, but either way the devil is in the details. If you state you need a shopping cart the developer may be prepared to build you a standard shopping cart. But if you later state that your shopping cart needs to use your \"advanced algorithms\" to match the customer up with other products before completing the purchase, well your requirement just blew up in complexity and your costs may skyrocket, possibly because you have to switch to another tech team to implement.\n\nSo when looking for a technical team remember to talk in business terms, and let them implement the technology. But make sure you find a team (or CTO/liaison/lead/whatever) who *can* translate between business and tech speak, otherwise you will have a mountain of headaches when they deliver exactly what you said but that wasn't what you actually meant/needed/etc.\n\nYes, this is a delicate art, and getting the type of team described above is like manna from heaven. So shoot for this ideal, but don't be surprised if and when you fall short. Also, typically the more ideal team == more $$$.","name":"t1_cun12po","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-01 16:48:39","week":36}

{"id":"cunrw3w","author":"crjohnson20","body":"Okay here's the thing.  If you use that acronym on this subreddit you will be downvoted extensively and offered little help.  That's because churning involves credit cards, which are not to be taken lightly and can mess up your credit and financial life if you make mistakes.  There are so many people here who have devoted a significant amount of time to learn the in's and out's of this \"hobby\" and frankly asking for an eli5 on an easily searchable topic is a bit of an insult.  That being said:\n\nCongrats on your Amex plat.  You now have one of the most premier credit cards offered by any cc company.  With your shiny new platinum card you get special perks such as lounge access, free boingo, a kickass customer service dept and a $200 incidental airline credit to the airline of your choosing (also, lots of other cool things).  Doing a google search of the keywords you referenced in your post (MPX, Amazon GC, Amex Airline Credit) will reveal that in the past people who chose United as their airline and then bought anything on MPX would count towards the airline incidental fee.  Meaning you could buy (almost as good as cash) Amazon gc's and get that money refunded to you.  This method of redeeming is currently heading into unknown territory as many people who have gotten the Amex plat have tried and have not had credit issued this far.  Stay tuned (keep reading the subreddit, every day!) to get datapoints in the near future on this loophole.  It's been said but I will say it again, do not call Amex customer service inquiring about your airline credit used on MPX!

It'll run through July next year, after that it goes to 23%.  The balance transfer offers are pretty much the *only* redeeming quality on it; I originally got it to buy an iPad years and years ago as they're who Apple uses, but you only get financing when you first get the thing.  It's a terrible card otherwise.  But they upped my limit to $10k last month, not that I ever ever want to use it.\n\nI definitely made an unsound financial decision with the car.  It's a '14 Fiesta with the tiny 1L 3-banger engine.  Really really fun to drive around in, and I can go 500 miles on the interstate between fill-ups... but yeah, it's only worth around $11k at most right now thanks that to that new-car depreciation.  There's not a whole lot I can do there except keep paying it down, but it's the lowest interest rate loan I've got at the moment.  Long term, I plan to drive that car into the ground.\n\nOn the bright side, all the good work I've done this year (especially paying off the Amazon card monthly, I presume) has done wonders for my credit rating.  It was around 690 when I refinanced my car 6 months ago, and now it's up above 760.\n\nI was definitely thinking about focusing the 5% seasonal loan now that I've got everything stabilized.

In a way it's similar to affiliate marketing. It seems like FBA is kind of the new \"Make Money Online\" method , similar to how affiliate marketing, info products and google adsense/building niche sites were in the past. \nIt's hard to say of course if the same thing will happen with FBA or not. \nIt seems like in many ways the internet has consolidated quite a bit. \nPeople used to have their own websites, but now they mostly seem to be leveraging larger platforms. I've noticed a lot of businesses don't even have a website anymore and they will just be on different social media. It makes sense because it's easier in a way, and everyone is already on all those platforms..much harder to get people to your site. \nBut then on the other hand you don't really have your own brand.

{"id":"cupc8qn","author":"ShadeDelThor","body":"I am fairly informed of this market. Here is the deal. Videogame studios are highly volitile. They can make huge sums of money with one game, or go broke on a single game. Blizzard tends to make very good games, and they had a reputation of not rushing any product and cancelling several projects that they felt were not good enough (Starcraft Ghost, Titan MMO which eventually was recycled as Overwatch). When they got bought/merged with Activision, many feared that Activison's need for profits/revenues would break this cycle (since activison was public at the time and Blizzard was not, and therefore Blizzard did not have to deal with profit pressures from investors). Luckily, so far it doesn't seem that Blizzard has had much pressure.\n\nActivision has Call of Duty, which is traditionally very popular. However they have been rushing some of the products to have annual sales. Other than that, I can't think of big titles and a lot of smaller titles are more hit and miss.\n\nBlizzard has World of Warcraft, king of MMOs, but it is showing its age of 11 years. Fans have been leaving, but often times come back for a month after each expansion. However expansions are only coming out every 12-15 months. HearthStone makes tons of money on microtransactions, and Starcraft is still popular due to multiplayer (but no microtransaction for long term staying power). Diablo is also popular, but again no microtransactions. Finally, Heroes of the Storm may become popular, but they are contending with Dota2 and League of Legends, two highly suscessful games. Heroes is trying to have a lower barrier of entry than those two games, which may help.\n\nOverall, investing in game companies is super risky because sales are volatile. Blizzard may be one of the less risky ones, but they need something to replace the millions of WoW players to maintain profits, and I dont think Heroes will do that (Hearthstone helps though). \n\nPersonally, if you want to invest in the industry I am considering shorting GameStop. I see them going the way of Blockbuster with internet delivered games becoming more and more popular. The only hope for GameStop is that virtual reality takes off and people go there to test it out, but then people may just buy what they like on Amazon for a lower price.\n\nHope this helps.","name":"t1_cupc8qn","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-09-03 17:39:01","week":36}
{"id":"cupcmuw","author":"ppjonesin","body":"There is no doubt a P/E that high is somewhat of a risk. \n\nBut the market values the stock on future growth.  The NFLX type of stock is based on rising revs and rising sub growth and international growth and more recently in house productions, and not so much earnings.

{"id":"cuphg55","author":"philoveritas","body":"It's very heartening to see a professor ask this question.  To give you a little idea of my perspective, I work in an small academic department at a large R1 university, and a small part of my job is conveying faculty textbook adoptions to the university bookstore, and to request desk and exam copies of textbooks from publishers on behalf of faculty.  I finished undergrad in 2012, and my fiance is getting her MS now.  Our budget is tight, and textbook purchases eat away at our savings when she has to buy them.  I'm acutely aware of textbook prices, and have some insight as to how they're adopted.\n\nPurchasing textbooks from the publisher directly, in my experience, is not a cost-effective strategy.  The prices on their sites seem to be between ten and twenty percent higher than the equivalent new book on Amazon, though this can and does vary.  Checking their sites probably won't hurt, but it also won't yield a good price regularly.\n\nOur university bookstore's purpose, from the perspective of university administrators, is to generate income to sustain the other operations of the university.  Consequently prices are consistently higher at this bookstore.  They also pressure faculty (through me) to adopt the newest editions of textbooks for their classes, even when the faculty member explicitly states a new edition is not requested and should not be used.  Here one pays for the convenience of having the textbook that day, rather than waiting for shipping.  Overall I think purchasing from a university bookstore is not a cost-effective strategy.\n\nAmazon is a fine place to pick up new and used books.  For those students who can cope with using a text marked up by someone else, a used book is a good decision.  The price will always be lower than the same edition new.  Amazon also offers free 2-day shipping as part of a promotion aimed at those users who sign up for free Amazon Prime using a .edu email address.  Telling students what textbooks are required/recommended a few days prior to the first day they'll be used or discussed in class would make this option more convenient for everyone.  \n\nSome college towns of sufficient size have Facebook groups that trade textbooks among themselves for next to nothing (some are freely given away).  The buyer must be aware of the risks inherent in dealing with people on the internet.  Some are comfortable with this, others are not.\n\nThere are things professors can do to help students who are in a bind and may have difficulty in affording textbooks.  Few faculty in my university go to the trouble of putting required or recommended textbooks on reserve in the university library.  This is usually simple to do, and it means any student can access the textbook without paying for it.  \n\nAsk yourself as a teacher, is the newest edition needed?  Can I assign content rather than page numbers for reading (i.e. \"the chapter on torts\" vs. \"page 121-176\")?  Do I need any of the online resources that are being promoted by publishers these days?  \n\nFaculty are also permitted, according to the librarian assigned to my college, to reproduce up to 10% of a book without messing with any copyright stuff.  That's 10% of the pages of the book, including front matter, endnotes, and indices.  If you can get away with using just part of a book, that's fine.  One could also copy 10% of the first part of a book and make this available digitally to a class.   \n\nLarger universities are sometimes equipped with book scanning machines which make it simple to scan entire books.  Check if your institution has this, and if so, check with your library to see if students could use the reserve copy and the scanner to make digital copies for their own personal, private use.  \n\nTo sum up:\n\nThings faculty can do:\n\n* tell students ahead of time what books are needed\n* make sure they know about the resources the university has that can help\n* place books on reserve so all students have equal and free access to a physical copy\n* make clear if a book should be purchased used (i.e. if books have removable resources that will be consumed in the course of a class, like perforated worksheets)\n* if the book is not in the library, make a polite request to the correct librarian asking that it be purchased and placed on reserve\n\n\n\nThings students can do:\n\n* read the syllabus as soon as it's distributed and find the prices of books through various sources\n* buy used if possible, perhaps from a local free &amp; for sale group if that's something one's comfortable with\n* buy as early as possible if you need to buy\n* if there's no value in keeping it around, consider renting\n* see if the book is on reserve\n* learn about the resources the university has that could help in reproducing the book for oneself\n* if the book is not in the library, make a polite request to the correct librarian asking that it be purchased and placed on reserve","name":"t1_cuphg55","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-03 19:51:50","week":36}

{"id":"cupndnb","author":"Drayzen","body":"Throwing around the \"billion-dollar industry\" when it's really the large companies like Hasbro and Mattel making the chunk of the money in mass markets is slightly incorrect. You also have to take into consideration the board games takes minis and a bunch of other formats into consideration. \n\nYou need a good game that's fun, to start. You should be playing with friends, making playtest materials, etc. Go around to local stores and see if you can drum up interest. \n\nYou also need a strong design crew to design your cards/board/packaging/etc. In addition, you'll need to secure financing for printing/advertising unless you have a kickstarter or an investor. A simple card game with a nice box and some dice can cost between 2 and 4 dollars on the small side, and it only goes up from there.Games are expensive, and intricate components are worse. You'll deal a lot with China unless you find local companies and you've created a ton of demand to handle huge print runs.\n\nLogistics is also a problem. Shipping games is expensive, expect 5-8$ per domestically. So not only will you need demand, you'll need to cover shipping costs or pass them on, production costs, and manufacturing costs. The more you buy the cheaper it is, but the cooler stuff you make the more expensive it becomes. You'll also want to be aware of the fact that there are open molds like the player pieces of Sorry! that are cheaper than making your own mold. Tooling for these can be expensive up front depending on what it is. If you wanted to make a 40$ board game with a decent profit margin, you'll be looking at just 5$ to make the game not including tooling costs, as well as the shipping costs that you pay getting the product. You also need a place to house the product after the container has been moved from the harbor. \n\nIf you print 3,000, you'll need 15 grand just for product alone, and if the product enters retail for 40$, understand that you might only make a 4:1 profit on that because of distributor fees. It's why games like Cards Against Humanity deal mostly through Amazon so they make direct profit, but they are a super unique case. \n\nIt's really hard to make games.

{"id":"cupubj6","author":"witchsbrew","body":"&gt;Look at the numbers; they are borderline insane. For every car it had sold by the end of last year, Tesla Motors had burnt through about $40,000 in research, development and capital expenditure. The company is worth about half as much as BMW, which makes 35 times as many vehicles. Tesla has never made an annual profit, yet investors keep pouring money in.\n\n&gt;In early spring, Elon Musk delivered an analysts’ call for the ages. With most companies, these calls are death marches through the footnotes of an earnings report, but the Tesla founder announced that his company would be spending “staggering amounts on capex” and would be worth $700bn, around the same as Apple, in 10 years. Here is how: revenue of $6bn this year, growing at 50 per cent a year for a decade, making a 10 per cent profit margin and valued at 20 times earnings. You hear that in Munich?\n\n&gt;It was sweet of Mr Musk to bother with a cash flow valuation exercise, but he may have been patronising his audience. The idea of applying the same valuation to Tesla as you might to Ford makes little sense. This looks more like a venture investment. You do not buy Tesla because you think you know what profits it will make. You buy the stock because you think some new technology such as Tesla’s will change the world in ways that invalidate any such estimate. This is a play on the looming changes in the car and energy industries. To profit from the electric car race, you have to back the winner. Missing out is costlier than backing a few losers along the way.\n\n&gt;It is all prone to risk: the novel technology, the competitive threat, the danger of its charismatic founder falling under a bus, taking Tesla’s mojo with him. Hedge funds love the stock because it is so volatile. No one can make up their mind whether it is for real. All that seems certain is that, a decade hence, the company’s value will be nowhere near its current market capitalisation of $28bn. If Mr Musk fails to realise his bold vision, the company might be worthless. If you buy Tesla now and the company delivers, you will have hit a giant home run.\n\n&gt;Mr Musk stands at a crossroads of three industries that have always been rich in swashbucklers and hype: energy, cars and technology. Energy has its wildcatters, oil and gas men who build great fortunes starting with nothing but a wide-brimmed hat and a hole in the ground. The car industry has long attracted adventurers. William Durant sold cigars and carriages before founding General Motors and hiring Alfred Sloan to run it. During the 1920s, he became a major player on Wall Street. But he was ruined in the crash of 1929 and ended his life invalided by a stroke and managing a bowling alley in Flint, Michigan. In the late 1970s, John DeLorean, a GM executive who made his name building muscle cars, raised money from his celebrity friends and a British government desperate for an industrial manufacturing success to build the DMC-12, an all-steel, rustproof sports car with gull-wing doors. The venture imploded in 1982 when DeLorean was arrested with 55 pounds of cocaine and charged with trying to sell it to finance his flailing company. His car may have been a clunker, but it was immortalised as a time travel machine in the 1985 movie Back to the Future.\n\n&gt;Then there is the technology industry, which rewards absurdly big thinking. You do not get to a Tesla-sized valuation by playing coy. Investors, employees and customers all want to hear you say you are going to be massive. Facebook, Google, Apple massive. That is what attracts the talent and the money.\n\n&gt;Mr Musk has done a remarkable job in proving that electric cars can be gorgeous. When you are slung low in one of the Model S’s curving seats, see the giant touchscreen which stands in for all the footling dials on ordinary cars, start it up and hear the murmur of its electrical system stirring to life — when you do all that, you might not mind taking a one-way trip over the financial rapids.\n\n&gt;The Tesla chief’s dynamism has hurried along an entire industry. He is keeping Mercedes up at night, as well as an already sleep-deprived Detroit. But to think that he can grow at the rate he proposes and gobble up the car market the way Apple did with smartphones is to misunderstand how cars are bought and sold. People crave choice. As Henry Ford discovered to his detriment, they did not want their cars just in black. They wanted them in lots of colours, with fins, and floating suspensions and giant grilles.\n\n&gt;Still, if you try to be rational, you are missing a big point in Mr Musk’s favour. Silicon Valley is currently obsessed with cars. More than that, those who mutter about the lessons of the last dotcom crash could be missing out on the next Amazon. If you had written off Jeff Bezos’ hubris, you would have missed one of the great investments of our age. You buy Tesla today so that in years to come, you can say you were there.\n","name":"t1_cupubj6","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-09-04 01:31:24","week":36}

{"id":"cuqi9aw","author":"thiscommentisdumb","body":"I don't know too much about using Amazon's store. I know they have an ad service that runs on their site. That might be your best bet but I'd do some research because I honestly don't know how good it is. Most of the people I work with do everything on their own site. Do you have a site that you're using to send people to your Amazon store?\n\nIf you're doing AdWords:\n\n* Focus on long-tail keywords. ie 'buy philips sonicare toothbrush' which signals purchase intent vs 'toothbrush' where the searcher could mean almost anything ('how to use a toothbrush', 'how to kill a man with a toothbrush', etc). They get less searches but they're more likely to convert. The search suggestions that pop down on google when you start typing a query are a good place to start. \n* Make sure your landing pages are hyper-relevant to the search terms associated with it. For example, if I do the search for a sonicare toothbrush up there, send me to a page specifically about sonicare toothbrushes. Don't send me to one that has other brands, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc. Not only am I more likely to convert because it's easy to find what I'm looking for, but your CPC will be lower because your Quality Score is higher. The example I like to give is Imgur. They're worth what? $200 million? You know how they started? [Some college student on Reddit thought it took too much effort to upload and share an image online so he focused on reducing the number of clicks it took to do it.](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/imgur-the-biggest-little-site-in-the-world/281872/) People are lazy. Make it easy.\n* Make your ad copy compelling. Do a search for whatever it is you're trying to sell and look at the ads that pop up. Don't copy them verbatim obviously but look for common themes. If they've been advertising for a while, they've already done a lot of work to make their ad attractive. No need to reinvent the wheel. Which leads me to...\n* A/B test the bejeesus out of *EVERYTHING*. Ad Copy, Offers, Landing Pages, Display Creatives. Everything. It's great to have super witty text or a pretty ad/landing page. But if it doesn't convert, what's the point? If you have an elaborate rich media display ad that converts at 1% and a text ad that converts at 5%, all other things being equal, which one do you really want to run?\n\nThat's just a couple of things to keep in mind as you get started.

{"id":"cur1dzr","author":"ME_LOVE_YOU_INTERNET","body":"I've worked in a deli &amp; I've squeegeed down the bathroom floor at a drive in movie theater, I've worked low wage jobs &amp; know from experience that the majority of them are part time jobs that don't offer benefits.\n\nStarbucks? Sure, we'll go there.\n\nI suggest you read up on automated tellers to see how much this growing industry values it's employees. Watch a vast number of jobs disappear soon &amp; the disassociated customers stop seeing a reason to tip the virtually nonexistent servers. Servers don't take the order, they don't check you out, they just bring the food &amp; make an awkward comment when your mouth is full asking if everything is okay, but hey, the tablet on the end of the table has a button to summon them if needed so that's an excuse to not tip right there, why are you bothering me if I haven't alerted you that I want assistance? Rude to interrupt...\n\nI've seen those tablets in action at a Red Robin by the way.\n\nAutomation is happening all over, eventually somebody will market a generic version of the automated teller to smaller businesses in the food service industry, probably within 5 to 10 years. Bartenders won't be tending bar so much as just making drinks customers have ordered from tablets that people pay from as well, just like the tablets I saw people ordering their drinks &amp; food &amp; paying from at Red Robin.\n\nYou don't tip fast food because the services are basically automated, not working hard enough to deserve it, soon it'll be more things, sooner than you probably think. I bet Starbucks will be the first to remove the view of the human element from outside the store, pay &amp; order from your phone! Download the app! It'll look like a vending machine &amp; nobody will feel the need to tip the people inside unless they order coffee when they go in to use the restroom. Starbucks is like Amazon, Seattle companies that want to tell you a story about corporate responsibility, ecofriendly, green, healthy, happy go lucky bullshit. These companies are only trying just enough to coast by with all the evil they're keeping from you, like McDonald's &amp; the apple slices, just enough effort for people to back off until the next scandal, then they remember all the other scandals, like when Starbucks had to pay £20 million last year for not paying taxes while operating in the EU for 16 years. A company with so much ethics they must care about their baristas to offer comparable benefits to high quality jobs...\n\nIunno, maybe that 401k matching at a barista's salary is totally valuable &amp; nobody working that position qualifies for foodstamps or would have to suffer penalties for withdrawing from their 401k out of desperation. Something in my experience with it tells me quite the opposite, probably the girl working 2 jobs one as a barista at Starbucks &amp; the other at a hair salon next to the deli I worked at. She struggled with rent &amp; needed foodstamps. As the industry grows it will automate &amp; displace workers, that's how the industry is really changing. If McDonald's can dwindle down to a single manager/technician for each franchise, they will, so will Starbucks.\n\nEdit: formatting + additional\n\nAdditional: Does it seem like the generality or the exception when workers in the food service industry receive benefits? Are we just cherry picking outliers here? Should I go looking for examples of servers who are allowed to be paid well under the federal &amp; local minimum wage because they receive tips?\n\n[Median pay for core front-line fast-food jobs is $8.69 an hour, with many jobs paying at or near the minimum wage. Benefits are also scarce for front-line fast-food workers; an estimated 87 percent do not receive health benefits through their employer.](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/fast-food-poverty-wages-the-public-cost-of-low-wage-jobs-in-the-fast-food-industry/) The study might be a couple years old, but if you want to find a more recent estimation please go ahead.","name":"t1_cur1dzr","subreddit":"economy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhpn","created_utc":"2015-09-05 02:05:23","week":36}

Be sure to fill out all of your information so you get invited to the most surveys. The surveys tend to be really straightforward and don't have the pre-screening questions that kick you out half way through.\n\nAcademic study sites are a good option too. I use [Prolific Academic](https://prolificacademic.co.uk/rp?ref=E08U6UUG) *[(non)](https://prolificacademic.co.uk)* where you can help in scientific studies. Most are physiological experiments around buying health and buying habits, so nothing too in depth. These pay about £0.50 to £1 per quick study.\n\nFinally, I make good money from cashback websites. I mainly use [Top Cashback](http://www.topcashback.com/ref/Member95132284824) *[(non)](http://www.topcashback.com)*. As well as earning cashback on most of your usual purchases from eBay, Amazon, etc., there are also great deals on lottery, bingo and casino websites where they'll often refund your first stake to make it basically risk-free.\n\nBest of luck in reaching your target!","name":"t1_curkkmm","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-09-05 17:46:09","week":36}

{"id":"cus1e67","author":"BeatDaBest","body":"I checked out your site and here's a couple of things I noticed:\n\n1. Overall the site looks nice and fairly trustworthy.\n\n2. The way your \"Shop\" is set up makes it look like the customer is going to buy the product on your site, and since they probably don't trust your site as much as they trust Amazon, they're less likely to click on the \"Buy product\" buttons. \n\n3. The way your site looks when I click buy product I would expect to get sent to the cart and not to Amazon, so there might be a big of confusion when someone clicks on the button and gets sent away from your site.\n\n4. In the shop section if someone clicks on the product image, you send them to the product description page. IMO your goal should be to get as many people to Amazon as possible and you're hindering yourself in that regard.\n\n5. You have unupdated prices in your shop. This what an Amazon rep told me in regards to pricing: \"due to prices constantly changing on our website, we ask that Associates not post any type of manual price entries on their website. Instead, we ask that you use our linking tools, which are developed to automatically update price changes as they occur. This is the only way we can ensure there is no customer confusion when they choose to place an order using your links.\" \n\nWhat I'd do if I were you:\n\n* Remove all of the \"products\" from the site and remove the shop page.\n* Write articles titled \"Best Vegan Face Products,\" \"Best Vegan Body Products,\" etc... with a TablePress table of all the items and your review of them. \n* Insert call to action links like \"check out this product on amazon, check price here, etc...\"\n* If you want to keep the shop I'd recommend removing the price and changing the buy now button to \"check the price on Amazon\" or something like that. Your goal is to provide value, but it's also to get people to Amazon so the more people click, the easier it is to get them to buy.\n* I'd remove the sidebar Amazon widget as it looks out of place and I've never had a good CTR with them. (Add a tracking ID and see how it performs)\n* For your surprise giveaway you tell people to sign up for your email list **but** you don't give them an easy way to sign up at the end of the post. Insert a sign-up form saying \"enter the giveaway now\" or something!\n\nAlso, the site is still only 2 months old so you're right on pace with where you're at IMO. \n\nMost of my sites took around 2-3 months to actually rank well on Google (keep in mind my keyword research is very detailed), so if you're not sure what's wrong you can just take some time off and come back later. (Don't forget to implement some of my tips for a higher CTR though ;)\n\nAlso I tested your site speed on PingDom and it is HORRENDOUS. I recommend getting a new host or trying to figure out why it's so bad... Here are the results: https://gyazo.com/264eb74ad2a82cec80c893a0bedb8cc1\n\nI decided to open up LongTailPro to show you the kinds of sites you're competing with.\n\nbest vegan hair products: https://gyazo.com/527259faa1c4a779b67647ee86b0b96e\n\nbest vegan body products: https://gyazo.com/ea7c6e440c5d3a225133ff69e4272a21\n\nbest vegan face products: https://gyazo.com/86a91580cbb0b10e56ae468c95ef727e\n\nMost of the keywords are very competitive so you'll only get long-tail traffic unless you do some hardcore SEO.\n\nBest of luck!","name":"t1_cus1e67","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-06 02:56:05","week":36}

She tried to like it, but she just couldn't. So we try to return it, and that's where the stress began.\n\nFirst they told us that they have a 25%  restocking fee. I don't know much about amazon, but I think that's higher than the 20% allowed by Amazon. I asked them about that, but they said they're not bound by Amazon's policy. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's not much of a difference if so.\n\nI object, and finally they offer a $30 credit as a \"reimbursement\" to \"cover the restocking fee\" since their system won't allow them to waive the fee. That sounds like a copout, but whatever- drive on.\n\nSo we're finishing things up, and they tell me the credit is for their store only, and that it can only be used by us. I really don't see how that dies what they promised, and I really don't have an interest in buying from them again.\n\nShould I just take the 75% refund and ship them the product (at my expense), or is there a better way to deal with this company? \n\nEdit: sorry!

{"id":"3j31un","author":"pushthecharacterlimi","body":"First and foremost, I'm hoping to get PFs opinion on what is the best credit card to use currently.  \n\nMy wife and I regularly pay of the credit card every month and are using just a mediocre bank card with 1-3% cash back..  We also have another credit card with another bank that I have a ridiculous limit on that I'm keeping open for emergencies.  This is rarely used except to keep it open\n\nThe change I'm hoping to do is to start using a card (or cards) that will really start to rack in more rewards, whether that is more cash back or airline miles.  We're heavy Amazon.com users so we were leaning towards an Amazon credit card for 3% back on purchases.  Today I started thinking if the rewards that come from airline miles would be more beneficial.  Which leads me into my second question.\n\nIs it a good idea to have multiple cards (paid off each month of course), that are used for different purposes for different rewards?  Sounds like a pain in the ass but I'm hoping to find out how we can get as much as we can out of whatever credit card we use going forward.\n\nThanks /r/personalfinance ","name":"t3_3j31un","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-31 15:44:26","week":36}

{"id":"3j3mv5","author":"paul_caspian","body":"One of the comments that we often hear from bloggers and other online writers is about \"commoditizing\" and selling knowledge as a product. There seem to be several ways to go about this:\n\n1. Write an eBook, sell it on your blog, Amazon, etc.\n\n2. Create an online course, get people to sign up, sell on Udemy etc.\n\n3. Create online content and monetize through ads / affiliates\n\n4. Create online content and monetize through subscriptions / paid access\n\nMy question is how viable are these methods for generating income? Methods 1 and 2 require quite a bit of up-front work, refining and testing, with success being an unknown quantity. Methods 3 and 4 require both awesome content (and I know there's a lot of \"not-so-awesome\" content out there) and huge numbers of visitors.

{"id":"3j598i","author":"Phantom707","body":"Note to moderators: no self promotion. I will say I had a little help from /u/Loopholetravel inputting some things together, though.\n\nWith all the recent applications (and almost all approvals) for the Amex Platinum, there has been a lot of talk about using the MPX app to get Amazon gift cards to utilize the $200 airline incidental credit. Besides that, a lot of people like purchasing Amazon GC through the app because it gets them some extra United miles. However, the earning rate is only 1 mile per dollar spent with Amazon, so a smarter idea would be to purchase GameStop GC.\n\nGameStop has a fairly liberal gift card policy, where you can purchase any gift card sold in stores by using a GameStop gift card. I've personally done this a few times by printing out a digital gift card and taking it to the store to buy an Amazon GC (note that there may sometimes only be \"Kindle\" GC; those can still be used the same as other Amazon cards). Combining this fact with the above means that you can get 4X miles instead of 1X. In addition, you might be able to find other gift cards that you like (I've seen BP and Shell gas station cards and, of course, gaming cards).\n\nThis is still YMMV, however, because you might find a cashier unwilling to let you do this. In my experience, they really don't care, but be aware of this possibility. Also, make sure that your local GameStop actually carries Amazon (or whatever store you want) cards and has them in stock before you make any irreversible decisions.\n\nThis also lends itself to some other possibilities. Amazon usually isn't listed in cashback portals (and when it is, it's only for a few select categories). You could purchase GS GC through the MPX app (or really anywhere that they're discounted) and then use those to buy Amazon cards.","name":"t3_3j598i","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-09-01 00:56:16","week":36}
{"id":"3j5c16","author":"GameWeiver","body":"Hey everyone, I am new to posting in this sub reddit so hello and thanks for all of the great information. \n\n\n\nRecently I changed something in my business model and it made a huge difference. So I wanted to share the changes with a quick story.\n\n\n\nFor the last 9 months I have been selling on Amazon FBA and I would always get items in and sort them for either FBA or my eBay store. The FBA items would get listed under FBA and sit until I accumulated enough units to warrant a shipment.\n\n\n\nSince I sell mostly retro video games I often go hunting for them or source online and it can take a while to get a good size shipment built up.\n\n\n\nLast Wednesday I was in a Google hangout with Pete (Craigslist Hunter) and Ronnie (HartsMotorCompany) and we were talking about FBA and how we do shipments, ect. Ronnie first brought up how he lists all of his items as Merchant Fulfilled at a higher price and lets them sit while he gets the shipment ready. Pete also explained he does the same and that it really helps convert sales before a shipment goes out. Needless to say I am sitting there feeling like a complete moron... how the hell did I miss that for 9 months.\n\n\nThis past weekend I did exactly what they said and the results were amazing! I did over $1,000 in total sales on Amazon in just 48 hours and over 35% of that was the MF items I now had listed instead of sitting on a shelf.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is actually embarrassing. I have been selling online since 08 and I this is the first mistake I have made were I felt like I left a ton of money on the table. Anyways it happens, you live and learn.\n\ntl;dr : List your items that are waiting to be shipped to FBA as Merchant fulfilled at a higher price.

What you have is basically an accessory so your only market is Nest owners or those who are interested in buying. \n\nHere are some ideas for marketing:\n\nGo to FB, run ads targeting the nest page (people who are interested or likely bought already). FB also lets you target certain purchasing behaviors which might work for you (will have to dig in to see).\n\nRun Google Ads - this might be trickier since you will find people researching to buy a nest, but I'd imagine if they see your product they might come back to buy it once they bought a nest, so a retargeting pixel might work well\n\nNest has certified installers, find those in your area and get them to upsell your product or partner with them \nhttps://nest.com/works-with-nest/#pro\n\nSell your product on Amazon - this is a separate sales channel from your ecommerce store, but I'd imagine a decent source of additional revenue if you set up your listing page to target nest keywords and do some free sales giveaways to spike your ranking\n\nDive into the nest community somehow and introduce your product: \nhttps://community.nest.com/welcome\n\nMight as well try on reddit as well, only 929 people subscribed but figure if they like your product enough they will champion it for you\nreddit.com/r/nest\n\n--\nAs far as wholesale goes, big box stores have buyers who do purchasing for the store. You would need to find the buyer for the store, or see if the store has information on their website about submitting a product and go through the process. \n\nI just did a search for \"sell product to home depot\" and got this:\nhttps://homedepotlink.homedepot.com/en-us/becomesupplier/Pages/default.aspx\n\nSo I would say find the biggest places selling Nest and see if they have supplier info.\n\nGood luck! \n","name":"t1_culdbzp","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-31 03:48:27","week":36}

{"id":"cultim3","author":"DarthGinger","body":"&gt; Is it a good idea to have multiple cards (paid off each month of course), that are used for different purposes for different rewards? Sounds like a pain in the ass but I'm hoping to find out how we can get as much as we can out of whatever credit card we use going forward.\n\nI do this. I have 4 cards that I use:\n\n* Citi Double Cash - This is my catch-all card. If what I'm purchasing isn't in a bonus category on one of my other cards, it goes on here. It is a 2% flat-rate card. You get 1% when you charge, and 1% when you make on-time payments. I also set up auto-payments for things like utilities and game subscriptions on this card.\n\n* Chase Freedom - This is your standard 5% rotating card. Every quarter, there is a specific category of purchases where you earn 5% cash back. For 2015, these categories for each quarter are: grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and  Amazon.com, respectively. You get 1% cash back on purchases outside the 5% category.\n\n* Discover It - Basically the same thing as Chase Freedom. 5% rotating card. The categories sometimes overlap, but usually not, so this usually gives you an extra bonus category. For 2015, the bonus categories for each quarter are: gas &amp; ground transport; restaurants &amp; movies; home improvement stores, department stores, and amazon.com ; and amazon.com, department stores, and clothing stores. Again, you earn 1% on purchases outside the 5% category.\n\n* Marriott Premier Rewards - This isn't a cash back card. It gives Marriott Rewards Points. I only have this one because I travel for work frequently. Most of the time, we stay at Marriott hotel brands, so the 5x bonus points on Marriott spending comes in handy. But I pretty much only use this card for charging hotel expenses and nothing else.\n\nIf you don't mind my asking, what kind of purchases do you typically put on your credit cards, other than Amazon.com?\n\nEdit: Added some more detail.","name":"t1_cultim3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-31 16:12:13","week":36}

I use Straight Talk, $45/mo for \"unlimited\" data, but the 4G cap is 5gigabyte.  After that it switches to a damn near unusable speed.

Personally I will do extra work even if not required though. Remember that this stuff will sit in a dirty warehouse, so keep that in mind as you send things in. Example, if you are selling a stuffed animal, you would want to put it in a poly bag. Also, all poly-bags must have a suffocation warning sticker on them as well.\n\n&gt; Also, Does my box label have to be a sticker or can I just tape it to the box.\n\nYou can print on normal paper and tape that to the  box.\n\n&gt; If I am sending in small items like Nintendo Ds games that dont have a barcode can I still get amazon to sticker them for me? Do I just place them in poly bags and let amazon sort through them to sticker when they arrive at the warehouse? How do they know which sticker goes on which game? For anything that is without a barcode does it need to be poly bagged and can I get amazon to sticker them even if they have no barcodes? \n\nthis part I don't know. Personally, I would probably wait until you can print your own labels. You are relying on someone else to label your products correctly. Without a barcode to confirm against, there could be mistakes, which means the customer could get the wrong game.

Discover offers 1% cash back on all purchases and 5% on special rotating categories, including Amazon through the end of December (you must sign up for these categories).  In other words, Discover can give you a gift card or statement credit (your choice, and the gc comes with an extra 10% usually) of $7-$40 (depending on where you buy). (Note, 5% is for the regular Discover it, not the student card that gives only 1% on everything, and 2% on gas &amp; ~~groceries~~ restaurants).\n\nAlso, and I say this with a great deal of caution because see my rule above, you probably have an introductory 0% APR for the first 12 months (make sure!). This technically means you could make at least the minimum payments (~$35) and carry a balance each month, essentially financing your purchase.  But, it is very easy to forget when the into period ends and you can be left with a huge cc bill that you suddenly have to pay off (so I caution against this--its exactly the pit cc companies want you to fall into).\n\nTLDR: cc are awesome b/c they give you cash back, but don't spend $ you don't have or fall into an intro 0% APR trap.","name":"t1_cum0dw3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-31 19:15:41","week":36}

{"id":"cum3jjq","author":"pauldessert","body":"You're not mistaken. The affiliate ID's are still in the links. Amazon assigns an affiliate number before you're approved and accepted as an affiliate. In fact, you need to generate a sale before they'll officially review the application. Days before I posted here, I sent them some traffic and made a sale. They review and denied my application for the following reasons:\n\n`- Lack of content which is original to your site and beneficial to your visitors\n- Pages that are mainly empty when advertisement content is removed`\n\nWhich is total BS, but that's a different story...\n\n`This also speaks to the fact that you are \"not making a dime off of this right now,\" which implies that at some point in the future you expect to be making dimes from your site.`\n\nOf course I want to make some money. Why shouldn't I? I spent a bunch of time programming the application. Anyone that thinks otherwise is naive. \n\n1. Like I said, I planned on affiliate sales to generate some money. That's not going to happen, so I'm moving forward. If I can't find a way to generate some money I'll shut it down. Posting this to Reddit is a way to test interest and see if this is something I should even continue improving.\n\nWhy invite competition? Because I'm not flipping these items anymore. I don't like dealing with eBay, shipping, etc. so, I've moved on to flipping cars, trucks etc.\n\n2. As with anything in life, use it at your own risk.
