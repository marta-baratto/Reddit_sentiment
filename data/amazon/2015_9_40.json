Is there anything that can be done? I already emailed the bank and told them which charges were fraudulent.\n\nThis was an old account from the time I lived in France. I had about 1000 euros in it and checked it about once a month. I planned to transfer the money out of there but made the mistake of using it to buy something on Amazon. I'm 100% their security was compromised, as I never used the card for anything else and it remained locked in a drawer.\n\nSo, yesterday I see four charges by a bullshit MLM company called Nerium International and totally flip out. The first one happened on August 30th and the last one on the 23rd of September. A little google search revealed [more dirt](http://nerium-international.pissedconsumer.com/fraud-at-its-best-20150828690919.html) on these clowns.\n\nThe question is if I have a chance to eventually get some or all of my money back.\n\nSorry if this is the wrong subreddit.","name":"t3_3mo381","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-28 08:09:54","week":40}

{"id":"3mptfk","author":"ABigPair","body":"I am 27 years old, currently with a few department store credit cards, and one Chase Freedom with a limit of $600 that I have had for a couple years, and my first credit card dates back to 16 years old, so I have good history. My credit score is currently a 701, but I'm currently holding a 45% utilization rate that is coming down below 20% next month. That should bump my score to 740, as I once had a 740 before my utilization jumped. I recently moved overseas and had my first baby around the same time, so some purchases had to be made that weren't able to be paid off within the month.\n\nMy Chase Freedom has a $600 limit, and I have been utilizing it well for things I can afford, basically just my monthly bills, groceries, and daily things. I am confident in my ability to hold a larger credit card responsibly. The $600 isn't cutting it exactly how I want it to. I want all my regular occurring monthly bills and purchases to be able to fit on the card.\n\nI have asked Chase about a credit limit increase, but they will do a hard pull on my credit. I figured, if they are going to do a hard pull, why not look into another card that has some benefits as well? I actually really like the Freedom's rewards, even though most of them I cannot use because I am living in Italy for the next 3+ years at least, and they have foreign transaction fees. However, this quarter has 5% back on Amazon, and I do a lot of Amazon purchasing. \n\nI want to have at least a $3000 limit card. I have looked into the Discover IT. No foreign transaction fees is important to me, and I plan to travel all over Europe, mostly by train, bus, and car, but also using RyanAir (cheap Euro flights). Will there be any other cards that I could benefit from living international and traveling? Not much as travel will be by air as it will be by ground, so probably no sky miles cards.\n\nThank you!","name":"t3_3mptfk","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-28 18:31:30","week":40}

{"id":"3mqhy8","author":"jmjacak","body":"I recently started a new job and was finally able to sign up for my 401(k) plan after a month (26, making $53k/year). I choose the traditional plan and have a company match on the first 6% (50% in company stock and other 50% to my fund of choice) I chose to allocate all of my funds to the Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX). I was initially going to just put everything into the Vanguard 2055 target date fund but did not want that much exposure to international stocks and bonds. I'm just wondering if this is WAY to risky for someone my age and if the expense ratio is to high at 0.82%. \n\nThe top holdings of the fidelity fund are as follows:\nApple Inc\t- 5.80\t\t\t\t\nSalesforce.com Inc - 4.14\t\nGoogle Inc Class A - 3.06\t\nAmazon.com Inc\t - 2.89\t\nFacebook Inc Class A - 2.49\t\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc - 2.28\t\nGoogle Inc Class C Capital Stock - 2.03\t\nNVIDIA Corp - 1.80\t\nGilead Sciences Inc - 1.71\t\nAlkermes PLC - 1.67\t\n \nThese holdings and the track record of this fund (since 1983 it has achieved a 13.18% average annual total return) were the main reason for me choosing this over a Vanguard Target Date Fund.

{"id":"3mqr6m","author":"[deleted]","body":"I was on Instagram this morning and started following someone selling a product that I own, I was surprised to see they're charging $39.00 + $5 shipping for the same exact item that I can buy from China for $12.50 shipped each. The product has several variations (size and thickness mostly) but is the same price regardless from China. \n\nI did some research this morning and found 10+ online retailers currently selling this item for $39-$59 each, and they seem to be selling rather well for a niche item. \n\nI don't have a ton of money to invest, but I am a web designer/developer and feel confident about making a website where I could sell my product. I was thinking of buying maybe 3-4 of each size to start, and reinvest 100% back into inventory until I have a good supply built up. \n\nI was also looking at eBay and Amazon and there is not a single person selling these on there yet. Looking at Google Trends there has been a 400% increase in search results since 2013 for this product as well. \n\nMy biggest concern is actually selling them once they arrive, I mean worst case I can just copy the instagram methods that others are using, but I don't know what kind of volume to expect. \n\nAny advice on how to move forward with this business? I went ahead and bought a domain (scored a nice 5 letter .com domain for $1 via GoDaddy) and will get to work on a site.

I waited on hold for a total of 50 minutes and 3 reps to come to the conclusion they will not increase my limit back to what it was. They said my credit report came back a few days ago(not sure why they took my credit score) and It said I was now somehow a liability.  They did not ask for any info,  they simply stated what had happened and it was my life now. They refused to change it.\n\nCalled my Alaska airlines and asked for an increase to match my Cabelas so I can just be done with them,  and Alaska simply said let's update your finance info ( which Cabelas did not do) 5 to 7 days from now I will have a response. \n\n\nNever missed a payment.  Any bill is always on time. No way did I take a credit hit. Haven't opened any credit cards in over a year.  No loans.  Nothing new. Except a decrease in credit limit evidently.  One of the 2 reasons was account life or something. Not sure why they are worried about my account being so young after a year of on time payments. \n\n\nSo.  Pay Cabelas and set the card in the file to gather dust and get a new card? Does this happen to other people?  Cabelas has been a huge pain in my rear multiple times,  and Alaska airlines has been nothing but pleasant in every way( customer service,  payment holdings,  etc) \n\n\nThinking about the Sallie Mae.

{"id":"3mwyf0","author":"mulch17","body":"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3mc4vv/whats_going_on_with_the_sallie_mae_mastercard/)\n\n[Previous Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3me8wj/update_whats_going_on_with_the_barclays_sallie/)\n\n**tl;dr - Bad news, the 5% cashback on gas/supermarkets/Amazon is likely going away. Supposedly, new applications for the card aren't being accepted, and Barclays is currently working on \"creating a new rewards program\" for that card (i.e. something that will probably be shittier), which is completely separate from their Upromise Mastercard**\n\nGot a call back from the same lady at the Barclays executive office that I talked to on Friday. She said she did some more digging into their system, and she also could not find a record of the Sallie Mae World Mastercard ever existing. Goodness gracious.\n\nShe contacted some of her other colleagues, and found out that the card was removed from the website on September 25th, which was the day after I applied and the same day I made my original post. The reason the site redirects is because that card is supposedly not being offered to new applicants any more.\n\n~~What's interesting though is that there exists a direct link to an application for that card, and it still appears to be active. You can find it in the comments for the original thread. Other commenters said that they applied for that card through that link and were approved instantly for the right card, but the lady on the phone said that new applications weren't being accepted after the 25th. I, of course, did not blab about the direct link still existing, so I'm not sure what to make of that. No idea if that link will go away, or if they're even aware of it even existing. I would encourage anyone that's interested to apply there ASAP, but I'm not sure if that card's going to be a false advertisement.~~ This link is now dead, just like I suspected it would be.\n\nI asked her how existing cardholders would be affected, and she said that they won't be affected, and that it's only new applicants that cannot get the card any more. However, she did say they're in the process of \"creating a new rewards program\" for that card, so those categories are probably not going to be around that much longer. I fully anticipate the new rewards program being much shittier than they currently are for that card. So those rewards will eventually go away at some point soon, most likely. By the way, she told me that \"this is between the two of us\". So nobody heard this from me. I'm happy to be a snitch and break the rules to try to spread the word to the community here!\n\nFinally, she closed by mentioning that none of this information affected my application, and that it is still denied, but it was for the correct World Mastercard. So I'm either going to have to be really persistent and persuasive to the recon people, or accept defeat and miss out on the opportunity of having this card. I would be very interested in having it, but I doubt I have much of a chance of getting it approved, and even if I do, it probably won't even be a good card for that long.\n\nBummer situation, but it is what it is, I suppose. She did say that they screwed up on their end by removing it, and that there should have been better communication within the company. Apparently the executive office wasn't even aware of this change, until I called and made them aware of it. That was interesting. Still no apology, but at least they took ownership of what was going on, and finally got their facts together.\n\nSorry to be the bearer of (likely) bad news, but here's the update I promised.

{"id":"3mxs1u","author":"SheffieldCrypto","body":"We are [SheffieldCrypto](http://sheffieldcrypto.com/), we specialise in developing cutting edge predictive models. These â€˜smart modelsâ€™ utilize machine learning and deep neural networks, they are constantly learning and evolving given new market conditions. Currently we are applying them to various digital currency markets, the results have been very promising. We require a financial expert, specifically an expert in trading systems, to design and implement a system to utilise the signals produced by our models.\n\n**Job Description**\n\n* Design and implementation of a semi-automated/automated trading system utilizing signals coming from the machine learning models \n\n* Implementing and maintaining the infrastructure connecting the trading system to crypto exchanges.\n\n\n* Custom indicator / feature design for machine learning\n\n**Person Specification** should be experienced or knowledgeable in \n\n* Algorithmic trading \n\n* Market analytics, Feature / custom indicator design\n\n* Systems design and Agile software development (CI, TDD, Scrum)\n\n* Object Oriented Programming (Python, Django web framework, Amazon Web Services)\n\n* Machine learning (recommended)\n\n* Natural Language processing (recommended)\n\n* Hedge fund operation (optional)\n\n\n\n**Additional Info**\n\n* We need the position filled asap \n\n* We will be offering equity in the company for the filled position (we are not offering a salary) \n\n\n\n**Model Information and Performance**\n\nIn a simulation we back tested our TA (technical analysis) algorithm with around 30 coins with shared initial parameters over a 3 month period, however many of these coins had little data (small market cap/volume), the results were as followed:\n\nStart capital: $5,000\n\nTA trader: $12,706\n\nBuy and Hold: $-731.79\n\nRandom $-1,145\n\n*Buy and hold and random are included as comparisons ie how a portfolio would have performed if one was to 'buy and hold' the commodity*\n\nAnother model being developed is based on NLP (natural language processing). This relies on input from social media or â€˜text dataâ€™, such bitcointalk threads, reddit, twitter etc. The semantical content is analysed and the algo finds patterns between that and price movements. We are currently working on combining the output from both algos into a deep neural network.\n\n**Feature/custom indicator design**\n\nCurrently the TA algo utilises the output from TA-lib (a library of 150 technical indicators). The design of custom input parameters (or features as theyâ€™re known in machine learning) will allow the models to make better predictions by feeding it more relevant market data. However the priority at the moment is the design of a trading system.\n\n**Final words**\n\nWe have 2 PhDâ€™s on our team working on model development full time. The models collectively have had 4 years of development (2 years/ PhD) and we are now ready to implement them into a trading scenario.\n\nIf you feel you are suitable for the position please apply via the short application form at \nhttp://sheffieldcrypto.com/recruitment \n\nYours sincerely \n\nDave - marketing and networking ","name":"t3_3mxs1u","subreddit":"algotrading","subreddit_id":"t5_2ubg3","created_utc":"2015-09-30 09:06:06","week":40}

I use it all the time.\n\nYou can make bread without preservatives or a bunch of sugar.  I've found that even the inexpensive store brand flour works pretty well.  Further, there are *thousands* of bread recipes on the Internet.  You can try something different every week.\n\nPlus I like to add 10 grain cereal, wheat germ, and other good stuff to my loaves.\n\nIt's not very expensive.  You can bake a loaf for 50Â¢ to 75Â¢ that is delicious.  You will probably have other people wanting you to bake for them, so ask them to contribute ingredients to get your cost even lower.\n\nThe only ingredient I've found unreasonably priced is yeast.  One local market wants $8 for a four ounce jar.  Ridiculous.  I went to Sam's Club and bought two pounds of yeast for $5.  There is also inexpensive yeast on Amazon.  Do not pay grocery store prices for yeast.\n\nSo go find a machine and start baking.  Once you get the hang of it, you will be hooked for life.

By making sure that all of the features of your products are thoroughly outlined in your listings. Are people returning their new product because the quality is poor? Adjust your prices to accommodate that. Some people make returns because they didn't read the listing, or because they broke the product when they received it, or because they aren't smart enough to figure out how to use it once they receive it. Returns are all but inevitable. The problem is that *one out of ten shoppers on Amazon* are not this type of buyer.

Since the current quarter and the next quarter both give 5% back at Amazon, that means 10% back at Amazon.\n\nOtherwise, Chase Freedom gives 5% at Amazon but only until the end of December. Sallie Mae MC gives 5% at Amazon all the time up to $750, but there is speculation that they may be nerfing that card since they removed it from the website.

{"id":"cvh6i2p","author":"leeloodallamultipass","body":"FBA is Fulfillment by Amazon. People buy stuff then send it to Amazon for them to sell. It can be unique items where they are the only supplier, or buying items like electronics that have a lot of sellers. A $500 iPad bought at an office supply store in a flash sale with a portal bonus or other discount can be mildly cash positive (~$10-$20) while giving a person 2500 UR, for example.\n\nFlipping is just buying shit and selling it for more, typically used or surplus. Like getting things at thrift stores and selling them on eBay or Amazon as used. It requires a lot more knowledge of your market than selling new. The highest end is flipping houses, as was possible during the real estate bubble, but that's not really a credit card-based operation.\n\nI don't currently do either.

Amazon has existed for about as long, but it's several thousand times larger.\n\nTo leave a mark, you have to disrupt the field you're playing in. Peapod hires delivery people and does delivery business. That is an old model, and as long as they keep doing that, they have no chance of beating the giants like Amazon or Walmart. If you take a look at some of the companies listed in the article, you'll see that Urbery, for example, is connecting would-be-byers and self-employed grocery 'gurus' directly, without much involvement from the company's side. This completely new p2p approach allows them to tap the unlimited potential of shared economy, or whatever you wanna call it, which made Amazon, Uber, Airbnb and hundreds of other businesses monumentally successful.\n\nMaybe they will fail anyway, like a lot of other startups did, or maybe they'll grow to be larger than Peapod in a year - that I don't know.

{"id":"cvhdnqr","author":"EDBL","body":"Now, although a professional vidoe will obviously get you the best results, with todays consumer equiptment, you can make some very impressive video content at home. There is no harm in trying to create something quality on your own and then jumping to a pro when you have the money if things don't come out looking good. Rememberer, You never have to show any one.\n\nJust a few DIY video tips:\n\n1. Use the best camera you can find, and use as many as you can. If you and every one you know has a 1080P camera on their phone, every single camera shoots from a different angle at the same time. This will increase your chances of getting a good shot you can use. Shoot in 1080P even if you render out in a lower quality, this will give you the most flexibility later.\n\n2. Use an external audio source. Buy a LAV mic if you can find on on Amazon in your country on a budget, look for one with good reviews. If you get one that is simply a 3.5mm jack, you can use any audio recording app on your phone to capture audio from that mic. Then sync this audio to your video in post.\n\n3. Use a program like iMovie to edit. It is extremely versatile and flexible. It will allow you to create professional looking edits with ease. YouTube has tons of tutorials.\n\n4. Use LOTS of light. Shoot outside if you can, I like to shoot in the early evening. At home you can use lamps and light fixtures pointed in the right directions. Trial and error is key here. If you decide to use indoor lights, you will need colour correct &amp; balance in post.\n\n5. Watch a lot of different content creators. Decide on a style. Try to replicate it. Moving shots are hard to replicate without expensive sliders and stabilization equipment, but they are possible to replicate at home, try to YouTube some tutorials.","name":"t1_cvhdnqr","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-28 23:50:59","week":40}

{"id":"cvhqoud","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"Sounds like you might be more interested in asellertool that holds database content offline, but just to bring it up, I'm working on a tool (in my very limited spare time right now!!) that will scan barcodes and store them so you can look them up when online.  It's not into a state where it's even kind of usable yet, but I do have it using camera to scan and performing some stupid basic lookups (right now, it just launches a browser to the relevant amazon and camelcamelcamel pages) .. I'm definitely interested in hearing from potential users what sorts of things you'd want an app like this to do.  I'm not into providing services, so I'm not looking for anything that would require me to operate servers, or collect monthly fees or anything.. although I'm finding that the Amazon API is really really not intended for access from mobile devices, so it might be unavoidable that I have to do some server work :|  But I haven't had a lot of time to study it.  (at my current rate, and with a move coming up, I don't really expect ot get much time for it until the holiday time when my regular work is mostly on vacation) \n\nBasically, what i'm envisioning is an app that will basically have two different modes: Online, and Offline.  In Online mode, you scan an item, it immediately takes some action or prompts you with a menu of possible actions to perform on that item.  In Offline mode, it just scans as fast as it possibly can, and throws all the scanned barcodes into a list.  You could later dump that list to a PC or email or individually act on each item like in Online mode.  At least, that's my basic thoughts on it.  \n\nActions would include looking the item up on Amazon, looking it up on CamelCamelCamel, possibly trying to glean other information that can be used to look up other things.. maybe I need to know some more online services that are useful.  My dream would be able to show the Amazon current sales rank #s, # of sellers, lowest prices in each condition, highest prices in each condition, and the sale price and sales rank bargraphs from camelcamelcamel, all in one place.\n\nAnd now I'm realizing that this could be super spiffy when used on a tablet, and linked to a scanner.. hmm.  Of course, I need to get an idea of a proper minimal set of functions and get those working before branching off into the nicer addons.\n","name":"t1_cvhqoud","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-29 05:54:11","week":40}

{"id":"cvhri65","author":"UK_lever","body":"No on will agree with this advice.\n\nI would hire a firm specializing in trusts and holding companies, and incorporate an investment vehicle that has the lowest tax implications, and use it as a holding company. I would try to use the corporate charter as a trust, so that it was structured in a way that the money can not be forfeited to a spouse or family member without your consent even upon divorce. I would use a name that was google proof, i.e \"value investing company\" or any other name that is so generic, it would never rank in google. Also, have the lawyer act as a registered agent so you are only referred to in the company charter and can not be personally identified. They can help you set this up with limited tax ramifications and a high degree of anonymity. \n\n1. Ask if it is financially worth it to create subsidiaries to achieve FDIC protection, I would wager it might not be but they could speak more pertinently about this.\n\n2. The stock market is over. Once again, recall that I am providing non-traditional advice. There is a massive shift in how companies are funded making the stock markets largely irrelevant and the JOBS act has authorized \"crowdfunding\" on an equity level. Highfrequency trading is ubiquitous and traditional investors can't do as well as they used to. That being said, you will need to put money here but expect immense volatility. I personally would allocate a portfolio based on things I use and expect to be big. I would buy stocks like Tesla, Solar City, some gun companies, tech companies (Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Facebook, etc). There are fundamental reasons these companies are poised for big growth but this isn't a blog post. I would also get blue chip stocks. Probably something like 250K into equity, ~175 in \"safe\" stocks like GE, vanguard and mutual funds, blue chips whatever, 25 into foreign currency and 50k into the tech sector. You can go to e-trade and they will advise you for free, or extremely limited amounts of money and sort this out for you.\n\n2. Build credit. Get real estate in NY. You are living there, be patient and get as much \"space\" for the money as possible. Manhattan real estate prices are falling but take a deal anywhere but staten island. You can see how much house you can afford, but interest rates are extremely low and about to go up. Buy a place that is new enough the building is in good shape, get a decent address that is very commutable, and try to get a 3 bedroom. Also, find out what rates are competitive for real-estate agents. Bias for people your age trying to cut their teeth, closing a big deal in there first 6 months will be big for them, they will go the extra mile.\n\n3. Park money in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I would put 1K into ether which is about 1K ether, and put about 9K into bitcoin. This is a relatively small amount of money, and the upside could be massive.\n\nOk, 10K alt money + ~300K (allows for 1.5-3M house ish) + 250K equities = 560K.\n\nPocket 40K. Put it into a checking account via your company and use it for expenses. Also get a credit card, and only use the credit card so you can build credit. Ideally, you will be able to write some of these expenses off. \n\nBuy in to a few companies. I would try to buy plumbing companies, electricians/hvac companies, maybe a lawn care company on long island. Anything that can not be outsourced or automated by technology. You don't have to buy the whole company, just make sur eyou deal with trustworthy people and get  a percentage. Then hire a web development and marketing firm to revamp their brands and do campaigns. \n\nGet a job at a sweet engineering firm, live frugally for 2-3 years as you cut your teeth. Quit, and retire. Manage your assets more directly and use your engineering skills to set up your own company.

It's a tough balance between creating the software and spending time on the marketing site.  I want to do both and there's only so much time :)\n\nSo, with uploading the data currently you are correct.  You would download the report from Amazon and upload it into the system (just a simple form).  It's been my biggest concern about this whole thing, like you say it's an extra step I'd prefer to avoid.  However, there is no API for retrieving sales data from Amazon unfortunately.  The only other way would be to have users input their login information into the software and then it would log in periodically to extract the data.  There are obvious security concerns with that and I think people wouldn't like sharing that kind of sensitive data.\n\nGreat point about the case study!  I'll start working on that too.\n\nAlso, I'd love an intro to the group!

IMHO the law of diminishing returns applies very heavily to luxury watches.  Once you get over a few hundred dollars, watches don't get any better, they just get more expensive for the sake of being more expensive.\n\n**That being said**, if you are going to spend big bucks on a watch, actually get a watch from a decent watch maker.  Don't buy a \"designer\" brand watch.  Tag-Heuer, Omega, Tissot, and Rolex come to mind for making very expensive, high quality watches.  You can probably get a used one in the upper end of your price range, but you have to know what to look for in terms of spotting a fake.\n\nI am also a big fan of Seiko.  They are a well known watch company, that makes high end and middle range watches.  My \"Nice\" watch is a Seiko that I got as a gift.  I believe it costs around $300.\n\nBe careful where you buy it.  Luxury watches are often counterfeited.

I had the ignition coil replaced, FOUR TIMES with the last time realizing there was a recall on their ignition coils! Changed my CV joints like 3 times as well as struts, shocks, and control arms in the front. Had issues with a persistent oil leak where I could smell it being burnt in my cabin. I had that fix two times, each time costing like $800 for gasket seals and repairs. The problem kept coming back until I learned on a forum that many owners had this same issue due to two rear gasket plugs that no one but VW dealers knew about. Bought them on Amazon for $5 each and some $6 silicone sealant and took me about 45 min of work and no more oil smells! By the time I sold that thing, it had better tires, better brakes and rotors, new lights, and everything ran better than the day I got it. I will miss that car, and it taught me a lot of stuff about car maintenance and VWs. But honestly I wouldn't own another one. I hear the new ones are better now but I'd buy a Japanese car known for their reliability. For one thing, VW parts were EXPENSIVE! You could be in the zombie apocalypse and pick a random house and find enough spare parts inside the garage to fix up a Honda or a Toyota. Everything VW had to be specially ordered from Germany.\n\nBut honestly, if you're going to buy a newer car and reliability is a concern for you. Try looking at a car that's known for their reliability. VW in my experience is not. When my old VW is working, I loved it so much more than a comparable Honda or Toyota.

{"id":"cvju1bd","author":"thelauraword","body":"I completely agree with you. It is certainly possible to earn great money by reviewing products via blogs, social media, and many other methods. However, we work with Amazon reviews specifically. Amazon actually prohibits providing financial compensation for reviews. From Amazon's own review terms, \n\n\"We do not permit reviews or votes on the helpfulness of reviews that are posted in exchange for compensation of any kind, including payment (whether in the form of money or gift certificates), bonus content, entry to a contest or sweepstakes, discounts on future purchases, extra product, or other gifts.\nThe sole exception to this rule is when a free or discounted copy of a physical product is provided to a customer up front.\" \n\nOur company is very adamant about following all policies, and we are only permitted by Amazon to provide a free or discounted product up front to a reviewer in exchange for a review. \nWhile this might not be as financially rewarding as receiving monetary compensation in addition to a free product, this does provide great experience to reviewers. Not only do you learn how to be a good reviewer, but you also end up creating an Amazon public profile full of your reviews (aka a good portfolio/reference for potential jobs outside Amazon).

If you buy through a distributor and sell as an authorized dealer they frequently searched out your distributor and got them to stop selling to you by threatening to pull their contract.

{"id":"3n4io6","author":"relevantusernamezlol","body":"Hello.  I'm 29 years old, a husband and a father of two little ones.  14 months ago my family was struggling financially and, being the sole provider of my family, I had to step up and make a change.  So I began selling on Amazon and eBay.  I'd buy from craigslist or Facebook groups and sell the stuff online.  It took a while to get going, but once I got in the swing, things really started coming together.\n\nRecently, I've been suspended by Amazon for reasons out of my control.  Everyone says that, but it's true.  Amazon is very fickle and not forgiving when it comes to customer complaints, unfounded or not.  My YTD sales are $190k and with the Christmas season approaching, I would've cleared $300k sales without missing a beat.  My post tax profit margin is 15%.  I also work full time and the money from Amazon is comparable to what I make at work.  And with so much more potential, or so I had hoped.\n\nWith this suspension and the cessation of business, I've had a few days to really reflect on my situation.  Financially, I'm not in bad shape.  I was very leveraged for a while, but I started to lower my use of debt about a month ago.  In August, I had $30k debt, $5k cash and $50k inventory.  Not a bad position when you look at the numbers, but my entire business was in Amazon's hands.  They had my cash.  They had my inventory.  This scared the shit out of me and I backed off my debt.  Now, I have $6k debt, $4k cash and $30k inventory.  Had I been suspended with $30k in debt and Amazon holding my assets hostage, I would've died of a heart attack.  \n\nAll that being said, I will likely be reinstated, but even if I am, I don't know if I want to continue. I'll tell you why.  Everyone talks about the hard work involved.  And they're right.  I've worked a minimum of 60 hours per week the last 14 months.  Most weeks, I was between 70 and 80 hours.  It was hard.  But, I'm going to talk about the mental and emotional aspects of having your own business and the problems I've faced during my stint in entrepreneurship.\n\nFirstly, my health.  I have never been in worse shape.  Working so much and trying to care for a family is a Herculean task and one I thought I was up for, but alas, I have failed.  There's no time to work out when you work 70 hour weeks and have kids to care for and a wife to spend time with.  If I get up at 4 and work out, I can't stay up late and work.  And I'm tired as shit all day and don't do anything productive anyways.  And I don't eat well because of lack of time.  By the time I get off work at 5 I just want to crash, and knowing I have so much work yet to do doesn't help either.  Better meal planning could've helped, but I didn't have the energy to make a menu and the kids keep my wife plenty busy.\n\nSecondly, my relationships.  They've gone through some very hard times these last 14 months.  My wife and I have drifted apart and I'm trying to bring us closer as of late.  Everything was about work this last year.  I was always preoccupied with something and I neglected my wife and kids - it's crazy - I was trying to build a better life for them, and I inadvertently alienated myself from them in the process.  The business took over my life.  Working full time and putting hours into the business was so difficult to handle when you have a wife and kids to consider and a house to clean and meals to cook.  There were always 1,000 things to do and never enough time to do them and this fact strained my wife and my relationship because I was always working.  My main goal of owning my own business was to spend more time with my kids.  But I've barely seen them the last 14 months.  My 3 year old always wants to play, but daddy is too tired, daddy is grumpy, daddy's feet hurt.  At one point, last month, my wife told me most days she didn't even want to be around me because I was so stressed, cranky and tired all the time.  That was a wake up call.  Some days I only saw my kids for an hour.   It sucked.  On my days off, instead of spending the day with my family, I grinded away on the business for 8 hours, then helped with housework and before I knew it, the day was over and I spent no quality time with the ones I love most, the ones I was working to provide for.\n\nThirdly, my self.  I lost myself.  My life was the business.  I used to have a ton of hobbies.  I used to love playing video games, reading books,  exploring forests, hiking, watching anime, writing fiction.  But this last year I haven't had time for any of it.  I couldn't relax.  There was too much to do for the business. Today, I was reflecting back to before the business - and even though we had financial hardships, I was so much happier back then.  At work, I would let my mind wander and imagine plots and characters to fiction I was working on, I'd recall a particular anime scene that I love, or I'd fondly reminisce on old friends and good times had on my favorite games.  I don't like my day job, but I have a lot of time to think.  And before the business, I'd think of happy things and really enjoy the time to myself, but after the business, all I could think about was growth.  Processes.  Taxes.  Fees.  Shipping.  All day I would agonize over all that I had to do for the business and it was exhausting.  My mental stress physically tired me out.  Since the potential abrupt end to my business.  I've been relaxed.  I've felt a huge weight lift off of me.  I've actually enjoyed my day at work so far, since I had nothing pressing occupying my mind.\n\nFor a while, I was considering leaving my job and the constant back and forth, the weighing of options, the tax implications, the health insurance implications; it was all very stressful.\n\nI know this turned into a stream of consciousness, and I could go on, but I'll leave it at this.  Running your own business is hard work, both physically and mentally.  Balance is key.  Having a family of your own makes it a hundred times harder, so pursue these ventures while you're young and don't have a lot of responsibilities.  If you have a family, don't shut them out.  Balance your life, take care of yourself and your family.  Your business will grow slowly, but you won't lose yourself in the process.  \n\nMy day job doesn't make enough to pay all our bills, so I'll likely continue to sell on a much smaller scale if I'm reinstated.  I have a business degree but haven't used it, so I'll try and find a good paying job and cut out entrepreneurship entirely if I can.  Having no time has shown me how valuable time really is.  And owning my own business turned into a 24/7 job - I did hire help the last few months but my workload never decreased.  But, not because I worked 24/7, but because it was on my mind every second of the day.  You can become so personally invested in something and it consumes you and that's what happened to me.  Don't let it happen to you.  I have an obsessive personality.  It happens to me a lot with all my hobbies or ventures.  Something for me to work on.\n\nI thought my own business would liberate me but it tied me down.  It was just too much for me.  It's not for everyone.  You can't say \"Fuck it, it's someone else's problem.\" It's your problem.  It's nice not having to care at my job.  Boring, yes, but stress free.  Now adays, I can relax at night.  Watch a tv show with my wife then stay up for a few hours after everyone is asleep and have some \"me\" time for a change.\n\nThere really isn't any point to this thread except to vent, and possibly to teach others the pitfalls I had.  I hope someone learns something and applies it.  They save themselves a lot of heartache.\n\nI'm on my phone so forgive formatting errors.","name":"t3_3n4io6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-01 19:23:05","week":40}

I am going to try and sell 4 of the 5 samples I receive, and depending on how quickly or well they sell I plan on getting the 100 units. \n\nShould I plan for more orders and off some sort of preorder/backorder service on my website? If so, do you charge them ahead of time and ship when it arrives, or charge them once you actually ship the item out? I was thinking if I got 10-15 preorders it would cover the cost of the 100 units. \n\nShould I make an Amazon/eBay/Etsy listings as well, or not until I actually buy the 100 units?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!

{"id":"3n4yey","author":"HelloPepperKitty","body":"I've been tracking my credit score every few months for two and a half years.  When I was 18 I no longer had insurance and worked full time as a waitress making $2.13 an hour plus tips and paying for tech school.  I had some medical issues and unfortunately had about $4000 go into collections.  I had no other debt but it tanked my credit.\n\n\nIn March of 2013 I decided to take control of my credit and I've gone from 498 to 700 (Equifax).  TransUnion is at 708.  Obviously I'm not done but I'm so excited to be at a range considered \"good\"!\n\n\nHere's my progression and a little bit about what I did to get there..\n\n\n3/2013 score 498 - opened a secured card with $300 (Capital One)\n\n8/2013 score 608 - only bought coffee with card, paid every month\n\n3/2014 score 612 - card graduated to \"unsecured\" with $500 limit.  Still didn't qualify for another unsecured card.  Got a secured card with Wells Fargo for $500 (put $200 towards)\n\n10/2014 score 636 - asked Wells Fargo to \"un secure\" card, they did.  Opened an Amazon Card for $1000 unsecured. \n\n04/2015 score 649 - Balances paid monthly on all three cards.\n\n07/2015 score 665 - Requested a credit limit increase for Wells Fargo from $500 to $1000\n\n10/216 score 700 Yay!\n\n\n\nSo next on my list as I think three cards are enough for me is getting lower interest rates.  Any other suggestions PF?  Currently that's the only type of \"credit\" I have as I pay for all of my vehicles in cash.","name":"t3_3n4yey","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-01 21:09:44","week":40}

{"id":"3n7n5i","author":"Doctor_Domesticated","body":"Hi!\n\n\nI'm about to get married, then move across the country, literally, Hawaii -&gt; Georgia, with my now fiancÃ©/future husband. I'll be moving in ~6 months. I'm a sophomore in college and have lived at home with my family. This will be my first time moving out and I'm stressing over on how to plan it. A BIFL (Buy It For Life) checklist is preferred, meaning I'm willing to spend more money on items that are well made/durable/meant to last (ex: I'd rather drop $$$ on new sets of Fiesta plates that I want to keep forever, than buy mismatched questionably made ones from Goodwill). Advice or tips are welcomed too! Thanks in advanced.\n\n\nDetails:\n\n\nWe will be living on base so housing is taken care of, as well as all utilities (all taken out of his BAH). Housing includes a fridge/oven/washer dryer. \n\n\nMy current plan: I plan on furnishing our home with stuff we get off of Craigslist when we arrive there, although I've heard investing in a new bed would be a good idea? I have literally rooms of useless crap I'm selling on eBay/Craigslist that I have no intentions on bringing and to have extra $ for the move. I only plan on bringing small sentimental items (plushies), my PS4 &amp; Xbox, 2 desktop computers, and college related stuff (backpack, notebooks, laptop).\n\n\nMore importantly, I am trying to buy as much stuff as I can NOW to  lessen the amount of money needed for after the move, just in case we encounter unexpected costs, whatever those may be. Especially since I dont know how my part time job &amp; schooling there will work out, but I live here and pay for absolutely nothing, no debt, while running a small e-commerce business ~$500/week (which will be difficult to manage in a new location since my sources are Hawaii based). For example, I am planning to purchase kitchenware stuff like a 7 gallon Crock Pot (planning for kids in the future, and plus I don't see the harm of having a lot of room in a crock pot), Fiesta plates/bowls (I absolutely love these and plan to use these foreverrr), utensils, towels, toaster, salt/pepper shakers, winter clothes (no snow in Hawaii except Mauna Kea). I don't mind buying used items from Goodwill and if buying new, it's coming from Amazon/EBay or Ross/TJ Maxx.\n\n\nThanks for reading! Any input is appreciated!

{"id":"3n9fuq","author":"TomatoBill","body":"So, I found Appbounty recently, and I've been enjoying it for what it is. Which is a simple way to get some quick giftcard money.   Sorry, not sure if it works outside of the US\n\n**WHAT IT IS**\n\nBasically, you go to the website on your phone (links below), download the app \"Bounty Bucks\" which will monitor what gets downloaded, and then you go to the website and download various apps. It only counts if it's the first time you're downloading it, but I had no trouble getting to 2500 (a $5 Amazon Card) in the first day. \n\nIn most cases, you have to just leave the app open for 30 seconds. I usually do a minute to be safe, and when I'm done hop back on the site and do a refresh. If the points go up, I delete the app and move to the next. I never sign up for any app program (well, I did for some with my spam email address just in case). Never gave out a phone number, never paid for an app\n\nAlso, if you have more than one phone, download it again! It's registered to the phone, not an account, so more phones = more money. \n\n\n**PAYOUTS**\n\nPayouts are Amazon, iTunes, Steam, PSN, Xbox, Minecraft, and Leage of Legends Giftcards. I've only been getting $5 amazon cards so far (only the $2 is a bad deal, at 1500. Everything else follows the 2500 points for $5 dollars)\n\nCodes take about 3 days to verify, but it gets put right in the \"My Codes\" area. I've had no issues with it yet\n\n**ISSUES**\n\nSo, there are some annoying bits. Sometimes a redirect to an app will fail, and sometimes it'll go to a completely different app. Just close and go back, try again. I find that 8/10 apps work fine.\n\nAlso, the apps don't refresh very often. Maybe once a week you'll get some new big ones as the app store updates. So expect quick turnaround as soon as you sign up, then a small dry spell with occasional apps once a week. Still, money for nothing!\n\n\n** REFERRALS **\n\nThe people who refer get 250 points, while anyone signing up via referral gets 50 points. \n\n[ref](http://abo.io/cnigvprs)\n\n\n[non-ref](http://appbounty.net/)\n\nEnjoy!

{"id":"3na7s1","author":"Micah_812","body":"So a little about what's going on. I was unemployed from July 2014 to April 2015 and ran up a small credit card bill. . . about $8k worth. I was going through a depression at the time, medical bills came up, and I was returning to school to work on a Computer Science major. I also have about $30k in student loans from a previous degree (BA of A . . .) that are graciously deferred right now. Sadly, I wasn't able to find a job during that time as no one would work with a school schedule. That is until I applied at Amazon who will hire anyone at all. I felt trapped, tried to move up in the company with past experience but no, they wanted you to have an entry level position until you had enough experience there to move up. I really wanted out as it had no future for me.\n\nFast forward to today, or rather next Wednesday, where I will finally start my career as a Computer Technology Manager for my local school district (it's a start and experience at least while continuing my education). In doing so I will be taking a small pay cut from my previous job, earning about $1500/month instead of $1900/month. However, once the new school year rolls around, aka next August, I'll be making about $38k/year instead (~$3200/month). I have YEARS of experience working on computers at home and helping my parents at their jobs as well (mom is a CTM in the same district for 18 years, dad works for the city). My parents are very loving and understand my issue and allow me to stay at home rent free. My only bills at the moment are my car ($310/month), insurance ($120/month) and my cell ($65/month). The rest gets dumped into my credit cards.\n\nSo here's the thing. I'll need a second job for some extra income to help remove some of this debt in the mean time. I have always wanted to work with my hands, making props or costumes as a hobby. I love going to conventions and doing photography there as well. Now I am not an expert that can be paid for my  craft, oh no. I am still in the learning phase but I really want to get into it. What I am looking for is some kind of a job that can feel more like a hobby, something that I can obtain experience or be in an environment that allows me to create or access to tools to create. Small ideas like Lowes or Home Depot would grant me access to tools later once I have more income. Photography gigs like at a Target or Walmart (heaven forbid) would also give experience. I'm just looking for more ideas as to what could give some hobby-esque experience or access for such while giving a boost to my paycheck.\n\nGot any questions, let me know! Also, any suggestions on how to further reduce my debt would be nice too!\n\ntl:dr I want a hobby like job as a second form of income, suggestions?","name":"t3_3na7s1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-03 00:54:51","week":40}

{"id":"3nb5cl","author":"throwaway251134","body":"Somewhat of an update from my last thread asking about my $1800 CC debt. I buckled down and the CC is now down to around $600 ($200 of which is going to be covered by medical insurance, just waiting on an update from my provider). Next Friday I will be paying off the rest in full, more than a month ahead of where I thought I would be. On top of this I reduced my phone bill from $65 to $40 per month, and discovered that I can easily stick to a $150/month budget for groceries. For once I am thankful for my small appetite. My next question is, where do I go from here in terms of emergency fund and saving for my future?\n\nI make anywhere from $1400-$1600 a month, I always estimate $1400. Rent is $500/month.\n\nI do not own a car and do not plan to buy one in the near future, I'm in Vancouver BC and we have pretty decent public transit, which is currently covered 100% with my tuition fees. I have pets. does $1500 seem like enough of an emergency fund to aim for before I start to give myself money for leisure? My plan is to bank at least 1k for the month of November, but I'm not sure how much farther I should go before I decide I can spend a little on things I want rather than need. After I hit my main emergency fund goal I plan to take it a bit easier and increase my contribution to my retirement fund to either $50 or $100/month. It's currently only at $25 per month.\n\nI have one Travel rewards CC with a limit of $3000 (I have traveled a lot in the past and mainly use it to book flights and hotels) and I was just approved for an Amazon Visa card, though I won't be sure what the limit is until it shows up in the mail in the next week or so. Since I'm in the USA quite often, I decided this would be my next credit card because there are no conversion fees. \n\nNow, in regards to the [USA] portion of my title. I will be graduating debt free in spring of 2017 and I will be immediately looking for jobs in the USA. Is there a resource that can tell me about what to do with my Canadian bank accounts, retirement savings accounts, etc? I am with TD Bank in Canada, and I understand TD Bank is only located in a small region of the USA. I really don't know where to begin with transfer of funds, changing banks, etc. What is the process for moving to a new country and taking your finances with you? I hope to eventually become a resident of the USA. I'm pretty up to date on the travel/working/etc Visas, but I'm lost when it comes to money.\n\nThanks for any help or suggestions.","name":"t3_3nb5cl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-03 06:08:48","week":40}

{"id":"3nco7b","author":"redditethrowaway","body":"I've been lurking in PF for about a year now, and I just see so many people struggling. Life is tough, money can be difficult to make, I get it. But if you know how, you can make a ton of money, with a lot of freedom. It's not going to be easy, but if you dedicate yourself, you can have a 6 figure a year profit business in 1-2 years through online marketing.\n\nBasically, there is a huge shift to online. Print is dying. Tv is less. Magazines are dying. Smartphones are getting better. 3 billion people have internet access. Paying online is as simple as entering a password or using your fingerprint, and as it gets better and more secure, more people will start paying online and buying things online.\n\nYou can pretty much order whatever you want online and it gets delivered to your door. Groceries, maids, cleaning services, televisions etc.\n\nPeople turn to the internet to solve their problems. If you can provide solutions for these problems, you stand a real good chance to make money.\n\nI'm not talking about scamming people or porn or whatever. Legit online businesses are real. I'm in my late 20's and have generated multiple 7 figures the last few years running marketing service based businesses and selling information products and courses.\n\nHow do you make money online? There are a ton of different ways.\n\nSome examples are Amazon FBA (selling on amazon), ebay, ecommerce like shopify, CPA offers, ranking sites through SEO, paid traffic campaigns like Adwords or Facebook. There are so many strategies, and each one can make serious money. There is no single strategy.\n\nAnother way that has worked very well for me personally is selling marketing services to local businesses. Business owners run their business and usually suck at marketing. If you learn a skill, you can sell it. E.g. learn to rank a website, learn to build social media profiles, find a way to build or improve websites. If you can help a business get more leads and traffic, they will pay you thousands of dollars monthly for your services. Win-win for both of you.\n\nI'm not going to go in depth into specific strategies, but I'm guessing that many people don't know of the possibilities of making money online.\n\nIt's no walk in the park. I've spent countless months grinding, figuring stuff out, sleepless nights etc. It took me a good 2 years of messing about before I started making decent monies (6 figures), but I'd say I'm pretty bad at taking action and I spent too much time reading and buying courses teaching me how to do stuff and moving from method to method without learning one very well.\n\nMy advice would be to choose one method, research it and start taking action, and stick with it. If there is a proven method and people are making money with it, so can you.\n\nI'm pretty ambitious and am aiming for 8 figures in the next few years, but that might not be what you want. But even just a few thousand a month in extra income could be lifechanging. And that is 100% doable.\n\nI hope this post can help even just one person. I know the online marketing industry has a bad name, but as you can see I'm just posting on a throwaway and not trying to sell anything.\n\nIf you're in a dead-end job or don't see how to make ends meet, or you just want a better life for yourself and your family, look into online marketing.\n\nBest of luck to you all.\n","name":"t3_3nco7b","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-03 17:38:50","week":40}

{"id":"3nggvi","author":"AJD73","body":"Hey all, since I'm really itching to start my own entrepreneurial journey, I thought I'd try and reach out for some advice. I've basically had the thought of creating a fitness accessory company as a part-time venture while I finish my finance undergrad.\n\nI know the fitness/yoga industry is a very saturated market place, and Amazon is no exception to this (and to make things worse, I live in Canada so I would likley be selling on Amazon.ca). While doing my research on Amazon.ca, I noticed that one individual company has top selling items in most of the product categories that I had envisioned myself going into.\n\nTaking all this into account (much smaller market size then .com in addition to various competition), and the additional restrictions that I would have a severely limited budget at the start (basically my budget would include; 1st inventory design, purchase and shipment, basic website and social media for marketing), is this a foolish venture to take?\n\nI am obviously not trying to get rich over night here, I'm just trying to gain personal experience while building a small company on my own. The debate I'm having keeps coming back to the inability to differentiate a product in this market place (how many ways can you actually change a yoga mat, jump rope or towel), and how difficult it might be to win over an audience using only social media and word of mouth.\n\nI will add, that the firm who dominates the rankings in this category looks to be under 2 years old, and was able to really take a foot hold by seemingly using instagram and facebook (although this might actually just hint at how small the .ca marketplace really is). Would it be almost impossible to even get started against sellers like this?\n\nThanks for all your help and inspiration guys!

{"id":"cvk59tp","author":"brierrat","body":"Do what you want. It's your business. Just be very clear about what you are doing. \n\nAlso, I suspect there are differing reasons for preorders. The sound reason to offer a preorder is to gauge demand and have a certain committed number of sales with a set profit margin. This is why Apple, publishers selling on Amazon, etc. allows preorders. The less sound reason, but one that some small companies turn to, is to use preorders as basically a pseudo-investment vehicle or short term loan on a manufacturing run. The latter can bite you if you have issues that lead to not being able to deliver. Lawsuits can result. \n\nIf you, for instance, pre-order a book on Amazon, you aren't charged until the book ships. Same as with Apple products. I would be very careful using pre-orders to fund manufacturing. I would use your pre-order sales to obtain a bank loan to fund the manufacturing run, which is what most other legit companies do. That way there are clear default terms you can budget into your business. ","name":"t1_cvk59tp","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-10-01 05:42:35","week":40}

Importing and manufacturing is not just about having an English speaking person in China who know's how to navigate 1688 and finds local forwarders on WuBa. Ask any of these people on the China side, \"what is the proper way to import wood into America? What needs to be done to legitimately get Bluetooth products into retail? When is it virtually imperative we use a supplier with an up to date, verified QMS certification, and when would something more in-house be okay?\" Some of them might know the answers to these simple, yet vitally imperative questions, and others will tell you these things are not important because once the goods successfully leave China, this Chinese sourcing agents hands are clean. \n\nA lot of Amazon sellers are beginning to see the catastrophe of where being negligent with compliance regulations can lead them. But lets be serious here, ecommerce is 10% of retail in the US right now. So, for the other 90% who are doing legitimate volumes, one import that was done by someone without the understanding and care for ensuring safe products and qualified suppliers will single handedly destroy an importers business and possibly their life. \n\nSo to answer your questions:\n\n&gt;How much would you pay for a service like this?\n\nI would run from it and advise all to do the same. \n\n&gt;How big do you think the market potentials is?\n\nBig, manufacturing in China is a trillion dollar industry.\n\n&gt;What do you think would be the biggest challenges?\n\nShort term, having anyone who has a clue of what importing entails to actually take a directory of unverified sourcing agents seriously.\n\nLong term, dealing with the countless lawsuits for improperly imported products that neglected compliance regulations and ultimately severely injured and killed people. \n\nIt seems you recognize the problem here. There needs to be someone on the ground and finding the right suppliers to elect as manufacturers for Western importers.

You'll be shopping for a used car on craigslist most likely.\n\nNormally I would recommend a used Japanese car, Mazda3, Mazda Protege5, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Nissan Versa, ect. And all of those are good choices, however my #1 pick for you would be a Ford Taurus. Almost all Taurus will be under $3000 it doesn't matter what the condition or mileage is.\n\nRules:\n* Don't buy from someone who has owned the car for a short period of time. More likely to have neglected maintenance, plus why are they selling so soon?\n\n* Get maintenance records\n\n* Get the car inspected by a mechanic\n\n* Buy from an adult not a kid\n\nWhen negotiating just tell them you are short on cash,\n\n&gt; \"Could you take $XXX?\" \n\nUsually I start at $1000-$1500 off the asking price for cars around this price range. Often times this can be done over email/phone without ever seeing the car. You may also want to say\n\n&gt;\"I don't want to waste your time, but I'm short on cash, if you'd be willing to take $xxx I can meet you this weekend to see the car.\"\n\n They will counter offer, if you think it's way too high right away, walk away. Some sellers are delirious and think their car is worth gold, these guys are a waste of your time. Most sellers will work with you. You'd be surprised how long some cars sit without any offers. \n\n**Extra**\n\nDon't spend all your cash on the car! Babies are expensive. Make sure to visit GoodWill for clothes, baby books, and even baby furniture. Also check craigslist and your local facebook's yardsale page.

Maybe once you are working a regular job and are out of school, but for now, she should put that dream aside and focus on finding a job that helps you guys pay the bills. As for budget stuff...  \n\nAs others have said, definitely cut fast food out entirely. It's healthier and cheaper to eat at home. Eating out in general (not just fast food) is hard on your wallet and should not be done if you have such a small budget. /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and /r/MealPrepSunday are good places to start if you need ideas of what to eat/how to eat on a small budget.  \n\nI would also bring your cable/internet bill down; even the $95/month rate you mentioned in response to another comment is higher than it probably should be. To give you an idea, the promotional rate on my internet/cable package just expired and went up to $68/month, with fairly basic internet that still has high enough speeds to stream Netflix, play World of Warcraft (on two computers!), etc. Obviously how low it gets depends on your area and provider, but shop around and see what you can find in terms of other promotions and whatnot. Also, you may just want to drop cable as most shows can be watched online the day after. If you don't want to drop it entirely, you should at least get rid of any extra channels so you are only paying for the basics.  \n\nClothes for $50/month should be dropped. How do you not have enough clothes already? If you really need new clothes or do not have ones that are appropriate for work/school, wait for a major sale and buy then or go to a thrift store/Goodwill/Salvation Army and get clothes there. If you have enough clothes to get you through 1-2 weeks, you probably don't need more clothes. Also, pants/shorts can generally be worn more than once without any noticeable smell, so you need fewer of them.  \n\nFinally, hobbies should probably be $0 at this point. There are plenty of fun free things to do and you don't have the income to be supporting $50/month on hobbies.  \n\nAnyway, good luck with all of this. You can get into a better position, it just takes some work. I hope it all goes well and congratulations on getting married!  \n\nP.S. Try renting textbooks if you can or buying them through Amazon, as that can save you a lot of money on them. I generally save a couple hundred dollars each semester by doing that.

My fields are entrepreneurship, internet marketing and self-help.\n\nI have actually fully attended about half of them (hundreds or possibly thousands of hours of learning). The other half, are only partially consumed or not started.\n\nI have formed brand new skills because of these courses. Some courses are really good. Others are partially good (techniques and such) but they don't deliver. Others suck. Replicating the original strategy is close to impossible for example in any make money via internet marketing stuff, even if it's legit. 99% of students will never make money out of that, even if the course is legit as I said (and few truly are). IM is so complex, that very few of them actually manage to get to the level where they really can apply that. \n\nAnything that resembles a formula, usually is a myth. Anything that resembles skill-forming and make your own choices based on the new skills, usually is legit.\n\nThe best of the best I've got from the most expensive ones; courses like $300 or even a $99 monthly subscription. Big names. Sound names. Like Dan Kennedy for example, or Ryan Deiss from Digital Marketer.

I think courses are easier to digest, but in books I do find much more information. For me books are also easier as I read very fast.\n\nAnother point is that I no longer buy courses anymore. I only attend the free ones and rarely throw a buck out. The free ones are usually very good and give you half of the knowledge. The paid ones give the other half, but the point is, in most cases you only manage to apply part of the free one. So in the end, it's wasted money. I do spend on books though. Wealth of knowledge, much smaller price.\n\nLater Edit: And to your question: Did I make money from these courses? The answer is, not yet. But going to, next. I haven't because I'm still working on my core products, however the other part of the system is already fully designed. So they do help.\n","name":"t1_cvkxhkm","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-10-01 22:39:58","week":40}

I'm in my early 20's and was just in your position. \n\n1. Carpet cleaning. Get a carpet cleaner as cheap as you can, and put up advertisements all over town. Charge less than professional companies. The startup cost will be around $500, and it will keep paying off. Maybe even run multiple businesses on the side...\n\n2. Learn to do some home repair from your father/somebody and specialize in something. Maybe fixing sinks. People are lazy, if you can fix their sink/dryer/washing machine/etc they will pay pretty good if it's less than a professional company. Put ads over town/craigslist etc. \n\n3. Reselling college books made me $500 this semester in profit if you get the right books people want. \n\n4. Window washing company. All you need is a tall ladder, and to charge less than competitors. Offer discounts and make sure you can actually complete the job lol. \n\n5. Reselling on Amazon, or Ebay, or finding a product niche that YOU can actually SELL. Keywords. \n\n6. Shovel snow/ lawn mow, sounds simple right? My buddy pulls in like $20K a year part time by shoveling snow with his truck. Once again, people are naturally pretty lazy.  \n\nThere are so many options out there, start small and local, if you are profitting enough, hire GOOD employee's, but that will take some years. \n\nAnyways, it's not really about passion.

The former is particularly strict, bordering on self serving but arguably their decisions make for a better and more consistent experience. Amazon's choice is tantamount to banning paper books because they don't work well on Kindle. That's right, it makes no fucking sense, customers already make their own purchase decisions and is nothing but self serving. It also ignores the difference between physical and virtual marketplaces, a physical product doesn't need to work with everything Amazon sells because it exists in the real world. Now if they sold me a fourth dimension bicycle and I was only a three dimensional being (guilty as charged) then I'd have every right to be disappointed.

Lots of grammatical mistakes to sort out.\n\nThe site is also missing key information. For example you are asking me to give you my email address to sign up but you are not telling me how much the boxes will cost. \n\nYou are basically selling a box with 1,2 or 3 books in it. So you are also competing with the likes of Amazon where each month I could just buy second hand books for, quite literally, pennies. Or just spend time bouncing between Wikipedia articles for free. You need to push your USP and benefits compared to just buying direct from very cheap book suppliers myself.  \n\nAside from the website I think the business model needs some work. For example you say box of knowledge but it is just up to 3 books. Audi CD's, dvd's etc could all form part of it. You say you will secretly choose the topics. Can I find out in advance so I don't read things I don't care about? What are the return options? \n\nLots of startups (as someone mentioned) are about delivery boxes these days.

{"id":"cvlz3dh","author":"doyouknowvanguard","body":"I believe by 2030 you will be able to stream Netflix on Mars while driving your Tesla Space Yacht Model X with Photon Torpedo Anti-Ship Battery Defense Modeâ„¢.\n\nBack to reality: I think Netflix is a good company that has a lot of its forward earnings already priced in. If they fail to meet expectations or if we enter an extended bear market I believe you'll see them get crushed. Also, while Amazon Prime Instant Video and Apple TV don't seem to be a threat right now, I'm unsure if Netflix will be the only viable streaming service in 10 years. With the Epix deal coming to an end you see Netflix trying to become its own production studio, and it may very well succeed, or it may flop. If a big media company changes their tune and partners with Amazon Instant or another streaming service so that their streaming service offers better movies/shows (ie higher rating/popularity) in a more timely fashion (ie I don't have to wait 20 years to see the current hit movies), I think Netflix could be hit hard.\n\nTL;DR: Lots of growth has already been priced in. Somewhat risky investment. I don't think the old media giants truly recognize the threat Netflix poses to their business model at the moment, or at least think they can still make a hefty profit. Once they start losing significant market share I think you might see them change their absurd pricing models and collaborate with another streaming service or create their own. Or maybe they'll die off without a fight like the dinosaurs they are, who knows.","name":"t1_cvlz3dh","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-02 20:46:18","week":40}

They used their power to dictate lower and lower prices. Then Apple came in with their ebook store, and tried to band the publishers together to fight amazon's strong-arm. \n\nThe US government said trying to fight Amazon together was collusion, and their monopolistic abuse was ignored, but they did manage to get pricing changes a bit, much to Amazon's displeasure.  \n\nAmazon is a strong, but not dominant player in video streaming, electronics sales, and online electronics sales in general. \n\nWhen you start to have and use monopoly or monopsony power - then people start wanting or  making regulations (MS &amp; Google) - but up until that point, letting business be ruthless and live or die, look at sony, sharp, dell, HP, LG - and particularly blackberry.  Blackberry's dominant position in phones was shattered by the iPhone, even though they had a closed and proprietary messaging system they wouldn't let others on.  Is that monopolistic power? No. They aren't using it to strong-arm customers. And the brand power they crated was destroyed by another strong entrant through the power of high-end market disruption (Apple) and later low end disruption (Android) - and they were arrogant enough to think they were better.\n\n\nAmazon is betting that the cost of not selling these devices (probably a very tiny fraction of a percent of their revenue) is worth paying to help drive their 3rd place (?) video streaming service (Netflix, hulu, Amazon?) - along with content and partnership deals probably costing ten times that. Top gear is going to cost them hundreds of millions of dollars - does this decision even cost 500,000? A million? It is a small thing. \n\nSqueezing book publishers and individual ebook authors (recent changes to self-publishing) is much more heinous, because there are very few or no other places left to go.

{"id":"cvmr5rw","author":"CasualPie","body":"Stop, do not pass go: Ditch any thoughts about getting a factory new car. You need to pick up a copy of autotrader and start hitting up used car websites.  \n\nYou should be looking for the most reliable cars from the last decade or so. If you can find a good one you could also go late 90s. You also need to keep in mind recommended service intervals. For example, used subarus are great cars if maintained, but you find quite a few up for sale just short of 150,000 miles. Why? Because at 150k you're supposed to get a spendy timing chain service on it. Stuff like that. In addition to reliability, you'll want DIY serviceability (older is better here). Being able to do service and repairs on your own will save you many thousands of dollars.\n\nI have a bit of a thing for late 80s and 90s jeep  Cherokees. With good maintenance, the engine will most likely outlast the body. The engine and drivetrain may as well be made out of Legos because EVERYTHING in that car is easy to work on yourself. Since its made to look good with junk on it, even not-perfect cosmetic repairs still look fine. They sport nice big tready tires and many have 4WD. You can usually find one needing a little work for a few thousand. \n\nThat's the kind of car you want. Reliable. Easy to work on. Cheap to repair and find parts. Used. \n\nAfter that find yourself a web forum dedicated to owners of the same car. Stay away from the customizations section and just absorb everything you can about working on it. I've kept my 04 Chevy Trailblazer going for more than 170k miles so far doing almost all the maintenance and service myself because others have done it before and posted about it. Just replaced the taillight assembly last night because some idiot grazed me. 10 bucks at a u-pull. \n\nOnce you get your car, familiarize yourself with rockauto.com . That site is god when it comes to DIY repair. Even if you don't buy the part there you can find the right part number easily. Then take that to a junkyard or even put it in Amazon (don't trust amazon's does-this-fit-your-car feature).","name":"t1_cvmr5rw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-03 16:43:39","week":40}

For instance I do amazon sales and I had a product get hit with an IP infringement and the listing was blocked. Had that been my business, then my Amazon business would have been a failure. But it was a learning experience that I've used to be able to grow my business. \n\nThe beauty of success is that it lets you fail. Maybe you want to open kiosks at the mall selling widgets; when you have one kiosk it's more 50/50. If it fails, your business fails, if it succeeds, your business succeeds. But often a bigger company would have 50 kiosks, and then can analyze each location and make decisions. If one is losing they just get that kiosk off the books. \n\nAnyways, my advice is put yourself in a situation where a single failure is a total failure.

But if you are building Amazon affiliate sites, or anything like that, I'd say try to find a topic that you're really passionate about and focus on that.\n\nIn fact, the whole idea of an \"affiliate site\" is kind of backwards. Don't focus on the type of revenue a site will generate. Focus on how it will help people, and who those people are. You'll be able to monetize in a bunch of different ways.

{"id":"cvn8qf7","author":"flighttonight","body":"If you want to go long with all of your purchases (which I don't find personally advisable), I'm not sure PYPL is the stock for you. They own Venmo, which is great in your example, but PYPL itself isn't doing anything anymore that couldn't easily be replicated by another platform, especially with the right investment in that platform's infrastructure. If you're really thinking long term, you have to actually project yourself into that future and take a long look around, if that makes sense. You have to think as if it's 2023 or however long your time frame is. PYPL was a disruptor and it produced a lot of really interesting people that went on to bigger and better things, but it's glory days may well be behind them. It no longer commands the same market share and has engaged in some questionable business practices along the way. I'd recommend something more like SHOP and their recent Amazon deal if you're really interested in merchant services and want to focus on that long of a horizon.\n\nAlso re NFLX, agree w others here, and for some of the same reasons I'd advise against PYPL. The first company that becomes the Internet's first subscription-based, commercial-free television network with its own content (which is what NFLX wants) is going to be worth a fortune, esp if it lands a professional sports deal. But there's no guarantee its going to be NFLX. It could be HBO. It could come from Amazon. It could be anybody and it might be more than one company at once. Think of those DVD kiosks like Redbox and think of how quickly those are going to go away as streaming keeps ramping up. NFLX might be nothing. Blockbuster once had 60,000 employees. Ten years is a long time.\n\nYou should totally invest though. Don't let anyone tell you different. But learn all you can about the stock and the company behind it first and before you do that, learn as much as you can about how the market works. Just to use your example, I wouldn't buy SBUX at that price either, not right now. It doesn't fit my investment strategy. But I would in the future, at that exact same price point even, but only if it climbed to around 66 first.

{"id":"cvnq5p6","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"Whole Foods is having fairly serious issues, unfortunately. I was always concerned about the moat that that company *thought* that they had. Last year, all the sudden, \"Oops, we have a lot of competition and they're having a bigger effect than we thought.\" The stock has since been obliterated.  The grocery industry is *lousy*. KR is doing well, but it's otherwise a hideously overcrowded industry and an industry with slim margins already. The small store concept that Whole Foods is planning is - I think - a mistake. More stores is not the answer as much as innovation and reinvention is. Amazon and its Prime Now will continue to expand and offer more grocery items and press on the whole grocery industry, as well. \n\nThey should have emphasized the value of their 365 products in stores years ago, but they didn't and they never really succeeded in getting the expensive image out of people's minds, despite the fact that Whole Foods is actually competitive on some things if you shop around there a bit. Some of it is expensive, some of it is very expensive, but I can also find some good deals when I go in comparison to other grocery stores. \n\n**Let me say this: I really do like Whole Foods. I am a customer. But I would never invest in it.** The grocery industry will - I predict - have a shake-out in 5 years and perhaps less. Not saying WFM won't be around (although I think some grocers perhaps won't be), but the industry will be forced to reexamine itself.\n\nAlso, look at natural distributor United Foods (UNFI), down by about as much as WFM is. Again, I don't think WFM is going anywhere and I do like the company but I do think it's not going to be a good time for the grocery industry and the next 5 years is going to be far more uncertain than the last 5 for WFM. I do think the growth story that has powered the company is over - perhaps they innovate and get it going again - but I wish they'd realized some of the issues they are now confronting earlier. \n\nGPRO has little/no moat and I just think the future is not without serious problems. I wouldn't go near it, but it is certainly more reasonably valued at 29 than it was around 90. Canon is certainly not faring well with the printer and camera industry, although they're one of the companies where I've always thought they could certainly make an \"action camera\" if they wanted to. That said, aside from a few potential things, I'm not really seeing the catalyst down the road. \n\nThree airlines? Sell two. Perhaps Boeing (BA) and invest in the people that make many of the planes rather than so much in airlines.\n\n My feelings about social media I've posted elsewhere, but hey, if you are in the industry and you have particular insights...  I would still diversify away from it moderately. Apple is great, Google (or Alphabet, but I'd rather Google, honestly) is great. Netflix is not going anywhere but it is overvalued and one bad quarter away from being down double digits in a hurry.\n\nNike is fundamentally expensive but as long as they keep hitting it out of the park they're probably be fine. That said, the stock is at the point where if they had a bad quarter, it'd probably get obliterated. I think VFC (North Face, among other things) is more reasonably valued than NKE but is also more low-key. Still, NKE will be fine for years to come but it's not cheap here, certainly.\n\nI'd try capping individual names at 10%. I mention a lot of ideas in the thread that OP has linked to.\n\nMSG, CNI, UNP, DHR, VFC, V, MA, FISV, CELG, GILD, AMGN, LMCA, LVNTA, BUD, VNO (although again, I'd rather see it around $80) STZ, BAM, BRK-B are names I mentioned in the other thread.\n\nOther random ideas with a basic summary (more detailed thoughts on the above at the linked thread): Intercontinental Exchange (ICE; owner of commodity exchanges in multiple countries, as well as the NYSE), American Tower/Crown Castle (AMT, CCI, owners of cellular towers and installations in the US and in terms of AMT, the US and elsewhere), Ecolab (ECL, giant, global hygiene and sanitation co), Liberty Global (LBTYA, largest international global cable company, also chaired by John Malone), Cerner (CERN, well-managed healthcare IT co), Howard Hughes (HHC, real estate company chaired by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman), Tanger Outlet Malls (SKT, high-end outlet mall pure-play), Conoco (COP) and Phillips 66 (PSX) or integrated Exxon (XOM); Thermo Fisher (TMO, instrument and equipment provider for the healthcare/research/life sciences industry)\n\nMy view on TMUS/S:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3n8cna/how_does_tmobile_look_as_an_investment_given_its/","name":"t1_cvnq5p6","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-04 15:20:05","week":40}

{"id":"cvnudwv","author":"RobBalt","body":"We ship about 500 orders a day on Amazon North America, Europe and Asia.  You mentioned 3 concerns.  We've had issues with all these. \n\n*\"Sourcing failures\" - The biggest problem we've had here is manufacturing inconsistencies or bad products. This is a huge problem which can cause the 'dropping' which I'll talk about below. \n*\"Items that don't sell\" - We've had this too.  This is easier to fix by lowering the price or buying ads.  You can diversify risk by making sure you have a budget to test 5-10 products in a few different categories. \n*\"Amazon Dropping vendors for random reasons\" Most call this account suspension and this is actually a big concern. On our smaller account had a problem with 4 out of 8000 orders and were shut down for 2 weeks with basically no explanation.  There are a number of steps to take to prevent this from happening, but you really need to have a lot of attention to detail. \n\nTo prevent suspension a few things need to happen:\n*You need to be lightning fast about responding to customer emails.\n*If your'e aware of a potential issue, get out in front of it and solve it before a customer is aware.  For example, due to a manufacturing error, we shipped the wrong item to about 20 people.  1 person complained about the problem and we proactively next day aired the other ~19 people a replacement unit at our cost. \n*Pay very close attention to the product listings.  Any small variations on the product listings could cause a suspension.  This variation could also be created by a competitor selling on the same listing. \n*Don't even think about messing with things that might be counterfeit.  Make sure you can 100% prove the source of the product is authentic. \n\nIf I were a college student and wanted to get started in Amazon, I'd find a friend that has a retail store with reliable vendors or I'd build my own product via Kickstarter or something similar.  Building a new product is no small feat, but you have control over everything.  The other thing you could do would be to look for products you could import that have been successful in other regions, but that also has challenges. \n\nThere are people that make a ton of money doing retail arbitrage but I think its risky and time consuming.  If retail arbitrage is your only option, I think you'd be better of focusing on your school work and waiting to jump on Amazon until you have a sustainable business. \n","name":"t1_cvnudwv","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-04 17:47:35","week":40}

If they were seen to manipulate search results, it would potentially be anticompetitive.\n\nAlthough Amazon wields impressive and growing retail strength, there are abundant alternatives for one to purchase books, CDs, and the like.  They, like any other private entity, can elect to sell (or not sell) what they like.  In the open market with competition, buyers will hypothetically seek out the goods they want from the retailers that sell them.\n\nIn practice, as the article states, this is a blow to Google (less so to Apple), as they don't have another sales channel as visible as Amazon (Apple always has the Apple Store).
