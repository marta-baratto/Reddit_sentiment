{"id":"35jco8","author":"[deleted]","body":"Probably pretty obvious, but figured I'd ask.  Alternatively where do you all get your random sized boxes?   Amazon doesn't look tooo awfully bad, but still figured there's always cheaper options, and yes I know reusing boxes from my own purchases / shipments is a good idea and I do that already but sometimes I don't have just the right box or run out.\n\nI even wondered if using shipping paper on the outside of a flatrate box would be a bad idea, but figure so.  \n\nAn example: Large flat rate box sending from where I am to NYC, flat rate would be 15.80 using the online rate I'm using.  However, if using the box by itself not flat rate with a weight of around 10 lbs is only $9.\n\nI haven't used a flat rate box yet except once to ship a small item to Texas which would've been pretty high if not for the flat rate, so I can see where it may be unethical / abuse to do otherwise...","name":"t3_35jco8","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-11 00:59:33","week":20}

{"id":"35k4xw","author":"Mr_Nice_","body":"I've built a web scraper that can go to an ecommerce site and grab all of the product and pricing data into a database. A client wanted a duplicate of his suppliers database and I didn't fancy doing it manually so I built this. I didn't expect to put so much time into it but it was challenging and fun so I got carried away.\n\nI am still working on the detection algorithm but it's fairly good at grabbing all the product names and prices without much intervention.\n\nI thought to myself today that it would be cool to add lots of sites to it and scrape them on a regular basis and then provide some sort of market analysis or comparison ... Or something lol.\n\nIt's a fun little project, I guess I am just looking to see if there is an angle to keep me working on it. I can offload the bandwidth intensive stuff to a vps so it's not that expensive to run. I think the thing that interests me is things like how often do sites add new products, how often do they change prices and how the prices compare across sites.\n\nI can either give it loose instructions to grab anything that looks like a product or I can build up detailed instructions for a specific site and do much more detailed analysis but that requires more time to set up.\n\nI thought maybe about specialising in a few big sites. That adds a bit of complexity and cost as I need to rent lots of IP addresses in order to do deep scans on large sites like Amazon as they will detect and block the scraping otherwise. I thought maybe I could create a spy mode where you give it a certain Amazon or ebay vendor and it then tracks them and scrapes all of their listings but I am not sure if that already exists or if anyone would want it.\n\nI thought I'd come here to ask what you guys and gals thought. What data would you like that you can't easily get at now? It doesn't have to be pricing info, that's just where I started. Any public data can be analysed with some tweaks.","name":"t3_35k4xw","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-11 05:29:00","week":20}

A number of /r/flipping folks made it their home -- using it to source items, contributing new ideas, and pointing out flipping opportunities via chat.\n\nI figured I'd make a proper post in case other people were interested :)\n\nThe Forklift has been around since November 2013.  It scans the Amazon Warehouse, comparing the lowest FBA \"used\" item versus the lowest FBA \"new\" item.  There's a ton of items in the datastream, so I've provided a number of filters so you can narrow it down to only see what matters to you and your niche.  (side note:  Amazon considers everything \"used\" except for food items.  Generally, it means returned, refused deliveries, damaged packaging, etc.)\n\nThe Forklift has an email alert system so you can monitor specific items and get notified when they drop in price.  There are price history graphs (used+new price) for every item.  The item landing page provides Sales Rank, item dimensions, and links to eBay completed/active/sold auctions.  You can also browse the last 14 days of scanned items by savings (% or $) or search the archive (hint: it's the box in the lower left... people have trouble finding it sometimes).\n\nAnd of course, there's ForkChat.  A nice mix of flippers, deal hunters, and \"normal\" people sharing deals and tips.\n\nStop by, look for deals, and say hi :)\n\nhttp://theforklift.net","name":"t3_35ljoc","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-11 16:22:13","week":20}
{"id":"35lman","author":"[deleted]","body":"I've posted here before and had some great feedback so I wanted to post my latest blog post again. Just like before, I have the entire post below, or you can go the post on my blog [here](http://yoursolopreneur.com/online-business/staying-active-on-twitter/). It's the exact same thing, just there I have some images of the tool and links.\n\n\nThank you and I hope you learn something helpful. :)\n\n----------------------------------\n5 minutes to read.\n\nIt’s no secret that you have to be active on Twitter to build a following.\n\nWould you follow someone who never created content and didn’t add any value to your feed?\n\nThat only hurts your following:follower ratio, am I right?!\n\nBut with all of the superficial goals aside, the more followers you have the more likely you are to reach your target customer. So here’s how I stay active on Twitter for the least amount of work.\n\n\n**Schedule Your Posts**\n\nAutomation is a solopreneurs best friend to keep you from going crazy.\n\nThe process of posting a tweet actually doesn’t take that long. It’s looking for what to post and posting them at the right time of day that makes it so much work.\n\nStarting and stopping a couple times a day to remember to write and post something is a lot of wasted time.\n\nWhat I do is:\n\nEvery 2 weeks or so I build a list of tweets – and other social media posts – in a tool called Buffer and schedule when I want them to post.\n\nBuffer allows you to set up a time of day for each day you want a post to go out, then you just add posts to a queue as you passively find things and it posts them for you. Now you don’t have to find and post things in real time.\n\n\nBuffer is great for more than just Twitter, though. I use it to set up queues for:\n\nFacebook groups/ pages\nLinked In\nGoogle+ *\nAnd Pinterest\n* The only one of those that is some limitations is Google+. You can only post to a page, not a profile.\n\n**Pricing:**\n\nBuffer starts free and has a bunch of other paid options each allowing more accounts with bigger post queues.\n\nThe free option will get you one scheduling queue for each platform and 10 posts in each queue. This is perfect for personal accounts and new businesses.\n\nThe next tier up is the “Awesome” plan. This allows 10 social profiles, up to 100 posts in your queue, and adds RSS functionality within the app to make it easier to find and post articles.\n\nThis one is $10 dollars a month and is the one I subscribe to. I found the 10 posts per queue limiting as that was only a weeks worth of posts for me. And I only wanted to have to set this up every 2 weeks or so.\n\nThis one is great for small to medium sized businesses.\n\nAfter Awesome, there are a couple different Business plans each for bigger and bigger sized companies. However, “Basic” and “Awesome” are the two I recommend for getting started. Then if you feel like you need more you can look into those.\n\nSide note:\n\nBuffer also has a “Transparent Pricing” post where they explain what the money goes to from the paid plans. I just love transparency from businesses like this. :)\n\n\n\n**What Should You Post?**\n\nNow we know how to schedule posts using Buffer, but what do we post about?\n\nFeeds\n\nIf you elect to go with any of the paid plans, you will be able to add RSS feeds inside Buffer.\n\n\n\nIf you go with the free plan you aren’t missing out on too much because you can create a feed in something like Feedly and install the Buffer extension in your browser and it’s essentially the same thing.\n\nBut I found myself using it a lot to share things from my favorite sites between posts for my own content. And being inside of the Buffer app just makes it easier.\n\nThe feeds you subscribe to will depend on your niche.\n\nBut for me I try to post entertaining and informative articles related to technology in any way. I also sprinkle in some personal hobbies of mine like rock climbing and poker.\n\n**Scheduling Your Created Content**\n\nOutside of your queue you can also schedule specific dates and times for a single post.\n\nI use this when posting content I create.\n\nFor instance: I want this post to go out at noon the day the article is live to all of my social media outlets.\n\nI type up the post, add some hashtags, click on which accounts I want them posted to, add a date and time, and BAM!\n\n\n\nNow I don’t have to worry about it again.\n\nI don’t have to remember at noon the day this goes out to post something to a bunch of different places. I just set it up once and it goes.\n\n**Hashtagify**\n\nFinally, hashtags.\n\nI’ve done a bit of A/B testing with hashtags and found I get a lot more impressions on my tweets when I add good hashtags.\n\nTo be honest, I’m still figuring out how to optimize this, but for now I’m using a tool called Hashtagify.\n\nThis tool let’s you enter in a potential hashtag and it tells you related hashtags and the popularity for each.\n\nSo for this post I entered “marketing”.\n\nIt gave me a few other options and I ended up trying out #smallbiz. So let’s see how that goes. :)\n\n\nNow you know how to schedule posts, how to easily set up feeds for a go-to place for content, and how to choose hashtags.\n\nThis will automate a lot of the work that goes into being active on social media, but remember, stay interactive.\n\nWhen you have some free time, retweet someone or reply to some mentions. Get to know people and make connections.\n\nThis isn’t meant to replace your workflow completely, just to make it a lot more manageable and eliminate the inefficiencies.\n\nI hope you learned something new to help you in your business.\n\nIf you did, please comment and let me know. If I’m missing anything, let me know about that as well and I will include it.\n\nIf you want to support me you can visit my support page and add my Amazon link there. That allows me to keep providing this content for free. It doesn’t cost you a thing and only takes a second, but it helps me out a lot.\n\nTo be reminded when my articles come out, you can subscribe to my blog in the right sidebar.\n\nFinally, what’s a Twitter post without plugging my own Twitter. :) @GilOsborne\n\nThank you for reading, I’ll talk to you again soon!","name":"t3_35lman","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-11 16:44:24","week":20}

{"id":"35m9zr","author":"Evenomiko","body":"I (late 20s with mortgage, no other debt, employer doesn't provide any sort of matching retirement investment that I have access to, 6 mo emergency fund already set aside) had a bit of extra money, so I decided to try investing in stocks to learn how the stock market works. I started last May and bought stocks in companies that I (as a \"young\" \"hip\" person) thought would do well as my generation comes into its own in terms of buying power (maybe that's not how stocks work, but it's how I chose). For example TSLA, TWTR, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, etc. Now, one year later I have an 18.7% increase in my money, which is amazing! I should also say that I still know essentially nothing about \"how the stock market works\" other than how to buy and sell stocks. \n\nI have heard that if you sell the stocks before the one year mark you pay penalties or something. I would like to quit while I'm ahead, but is that short sighted? I have a \"real\" investment account of mutual funds with a different bank that has an 18.3% gain over the past 2.5 years or so. That I didn't plan to touch and will try to keep adding to a few times a year in big chunks. \n\nWhat's the smart thing to do? Sell the stocks and invest it into mutual funds or something else \"safe\"? Take out the money and let it rot in a super low interest savings account (and risk it getting spent although I'm good enough with my money that it's not much of a risk)? Sell the stocks and pay off 9% of my mortgage with the money (my rate is 3.75 so that doesn't seem worth it)? Save up to buy more stocks, because I am apparently the luckiest person ever when it comes to investing? \n\nI know that investing is supposed to be a long game, but I just feel like I should quit now while it's going well and before I learn the hard way that buying a few individual stocks is an idiot thing to do with my money. I should also mention that this money doesn't need to be immediately available, but I might need it for a larger purchase some day in the distant future (towards a new car in ~6 years or moving expenses in ~3 years or to pay for child care in the eventual future). That's my justification for not putting it into an IRA (which I don't have), but if that's foolish, please tell me why!\n\nTL;DR Should I take my money out of the stock market after a one year successful experiment or just leave it there in the hopes that it continues to grow?","name":"t3_35m9zr","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-11 19:47:36","week":20}

Free stuff, for example.   \n\nLet's get frugal. \n\nReviews are valuable to Amazon sellers because they drive natural sales. Just use a product review service to find deals for you, and snag products at 90-100% off for leaving a review. Personally, I mostly use HonestFew to buy and review because it's Amazon-based and I'm going to buy this stuff anyway. Also, no buying quotas and it's free to use: https://honestfew.com/ \n\nGive it a try: cash opinions in for products. I did some digging. Hopefully this will save you some time. Free product sites and their specialties: \n\n1. HonestFew (for Amazon) https://honestfew.com/ \n2. BrandBacker (for beauty and fashion blogging, specifically) http://www.brandbacker.com/ \n3.

{"id":"35ofuf","author":"doogie88","body":"We, as in all of us in ecommerce here.\nFor those that have brands/products that are also sold on Amazon, how do we compete? Amazon seems to be getting bigger and bigger, it seems people find a product, then go to Amazon to see if it's cheaper. Not only that, but Amazon offers free two day shipping. I had a customer order on Wednesday, tried to get his product for Mother's Day but it didn't arrive until Monday. He says he wishes he went with Amazon that had free two day shipping and he knew he would have received it in time.\n\nI'm guessing it's common for people to compare your site/business to Amazon. Not only that but there are so many people that immediately just go to Amazon to find what they want, and won't even find your site. And it seems they're at the top of the search engines for most keywords/products already.\n\nMy only thoughts are to create a brand or a business that specializes in certain products so people would rather go through you. But you'll always have the people that a) trust Amazon b) can save a few bucks through Amazon or c) get it faster through Amazong.\n\nThoughts?","name":"t3_35ofuf","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-12 07:07:27","week":20}

{"id":"35q181","author":"rush72189","body":"Background: \n\nSo basically I have my one card that I've paid all my outrageous hospital bills with.  But I also use that card as my regular card (golf, food, gas).  Its a basic suntrust card, no interest first 12 months and its just a credit building card (so I'm told.... I'm a noob at this).  \n\nAnyways I'm at the point where I'm using more than 30% of the balance, and mint.com said that could hurt me.  I make very little money (that should change within the year), but my spending habits are very good.  I'm not worried about falling into debt.  \n\nIn an effort to reduce spending habits, I've decided to do my grocery shopping on Amazon.  I have a strange diet and I can pretty much buy it all on Amazon.  \n\nSo my question:\nGiven the background, is it a good idea to buy the Amazon card to buy my groceries with and pay for my gas/golf with the suntrust card?  Or should I apply for a simple card like the Chase Freedom card and start using that as my gas/golf/grocery card?","name":"t3_35q181","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-12 17:54:55","week":20}

{"id":"35v890","author":"theenigma31680","body":"A lot of people have been asking how to list things and what types of books people should be looking for.  I decided to give you a glimpse into the items I list.  I picked ten items out of my upcoming shipment to give you an idea of what I look for and how I process it.\n\nFirst, I check the condition of the books or items that I am going for.  If an item is new, it gets scanned.  If an item can be sold as used on Amazon, I go through a quick three step flow chart.  \n\n1. Item condition - Is the item in new, like new, good or just downright awful.  Also, is it complete or missing pages or parts?\n\n2. Type of merchandise - If it is a book, some worse conditions will sell for a much lower price and quickly too if the rank is good.  CDs on the other hand, the worse they are, the harder they are to sell.  No one wants to wait for a badly scratched disc.  \n\n3. Category the item falls in - With books, is it religous, self help, textbooks, fiction, etc...  Wtih CD's, I ask myself if I had heard of the artist before.  Having been a DJ, this helps greatly to weed out the popular artists that usually are saturated in the marketplace.  Last popular artist I sold was Sarah Mclaughlan (forgive the spelling!) because I got the cd for .20 and it was NEW.  Used would have turned a loss for me because I couldn't even make .03 cents profit.  \n\nALSO - When doing large CD lots, I use the decluttr app.  I open a new shipment and click \"add barcode\".  Then, since the barcode scanner stays up the entire time, I just swipe cds under my phone like at the grocery store.  Anything higher than .40 purchase price from Decluttr gets scanned again by amazon seller app.  This weeds out the junk very quickly.\n\nIf the item passes the 3 step check, I scan with amazon seller app.  I usually focus on really low sales rank numbers and over $5.50 selling price.  If these things check out, I pick it up.  \n\n[Here are ten of the books I got from my last trip from the outlet store.](http://i.imgur.com/S4CkNhW.png)\n\nThe sales ranks are all under 1Mil, which is what I shoot for, except for one.  It is over 5Mil.  When I picked it up, it was at 1.5Mil, and art books usually sell for a decent amount.  This was a bad buy, but if it ever sells, I will still turn a small profit.  I just hate sitting on items.\n\nTotal puchase price for all of these is $2.75.  Total profit, once sold, will be about $35.\n\nTime to get them prepped for shipment.  To get them into amazon, I scan each one at home with my phone.  click list, add my condition, quantity and selling price and hit list as MF (yes, list it as Merchant Fulfilled, not FBA.  I have my reasons... lol) and confirm.\n\nNow, I move to my PC and look at my inventory page.  [Click \"fulfilled By\" and select Seller Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/gm1UUD4.png)  This will take all the FBA items that you have out and only show you what you just spent all that time adding.  Next, select the check boxes next to all the new items and hit the \"action on ** items\" button.  Then, from the drop down box, select \"fulfillment by Amazon\"\n\nAfter that, it will ask you to confirm and take you to the converting page.  Options are Convert Only or Convert and Ship.  Select Convert and Ship and now all of your new items are in your shipping plan and ready to go.  Input quantities, label your items, confirm your shipments and you are ready to go.\n\nIts that easy.  Any questions or maybe you have a suggestion, feel free to post it and I will be happy to reply.\n\nGood luck /r/flipping!","name":"t3_35v890","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-13 22:09:06","week":20}

It seems to be doing the same thing as CashPirate: it let you install apps on your phone or watch videos and earn some points in the process. It has the same third parties as CashPirate, plus some more. You can redeem the points as cash in your PayPal account or as Amazon gift cards.\n\nHas anyone heard of it? It has 500.000 downloads on the Play Store, but it's the first time I hear from it.\n\nAnyway, here's the [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitburst.cashyourself) to download it from the Play Store. You can use my ref code : e3b759af-6dc0-40a9-98ed-94300df4da0c\n\nEDIT : I installed an app from the \"Supersonic Offer Center\" and got the points credited immediately, so that's a good start.

{"id":"35y2fz","author":"JollyJoshHalo","body":"Hey guys, I wanted to get some input from you all in regard to this strategy I put together for my brother to optimize cash back.\n\nCards Recommended:\nSallie Mae Mastercard. (One)\nAmex Blue Cash Preferred: (Two)\n\nBackground: He is not a churner, he came to me and asked what a good card would be for his normal monthly spending habits to simply maximize cash back. He isn't aware of or interested in manufactured spending or building points for award travel etc. I am looking for a simple approach to maximize cash back. I mentioned that the one card has an annual fee and he could simply use the Sallie Mae but it would limit his grocery rewards up to $250 per month at 5% then fall back to 1% but its no fee and would be only one simple card to keep track of.\n\nEstimated Normal Monthly Spends:  \nGroceries: $1,000 a month  \nAmazon: $300 a month.  \nGas: $150 a month.  \n\nI recommended getting the cards above for the reasons below.\n\nThe Amex Blue Cash Preferred has 6% back on groceries and allows up to $6,000 a year for cash back and no monthly cap to my knowledge. Even with a $75 fee if he chooses not to cancel(he seems weary of cancelling, but I tried to tell him it won't affect his credit long term)it is better than the no fee version. If he gets two cards he can spend $1,000 on one card for six months then use the other card for the $1,000 for the next six months. The card has a $150 sign up bonus but a $75 annual fee. Using this he will net $435 per card.\n\nI recommended using the Sallie Mae MasterCard for his Gas for 5% rate (at SAM'S where master card is accepted) and Amazon which Sallie Mae has 5% on for bookstores. This card has no fee and a $25 sign up bonus. This card annually nets $295 cash based on his spending.\n\nSo, if he used this method he would earn $435+$435+295=$1,165 annually. (and $1,315 if he cancelled before annual fees hit).\n\nHe isn't interested in churning cards for sign up bonuses but wants a simple effective method of using his normal monthly spend for decent cash back.\n\nLink to Spreadsheet: http://imgur.com/wB6xtJD\n\nLet me know if there is another card that is better or another strategy that I'm unaware of that would work better.\n\nThanks.","name":"t3_35y2fz","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-05-14 15:56:01","week":20}

{"id":"35yf2r","author":"archer48","body":"Some of you may have seen me from previous posts, regarding importing from China and some may know me from the sub I mod, /r/chinabuyers. \n\nI have a sourcing company in China where we work with various companies assisting them in purchasing from Chinese suppliers. We handle everything on the China side to get the goods to our customers. A large majority of my clients are selling on Amazon as  I am situated in the eye of the Amazon private labeling storm, so not only do I understand the selling and marketing aspect of this business, but am fully versed in the product sourcing and production aspect as well. \n\nAs we grow we have to be a bit more selective with the clients we bring on. \n\nWith that being said, we still get the daily messages from people who are interested in getting in the importing game, but are not yet ready to meet the purchase volume of the clients we decide to take on. I have found this to be the most difficult part of my job because I hate saying no to people and I know I have information and strategies to help them grow quickly and effectively.\n\nAfter brainstorming ways to offer a type of service dedicated to people who are new to the game to be able to get their feet wet, I've begun planning to offer consulting services. The goal is to offer a tailor made consult to the individual client in a efficient and cost effective way. There are a ton of resources out there at the moment, offering thousand dollar courses, books, seminars, and even interactive classrooms, but nobody is seeing the true importance in what these newcomers need, a guide that is to the point, helpful when it comes to real world issues, and something that won't leave them bone dry with no money left to spend it on exactly what they set out to do in the first place. \n\nI am looking for two volunteers who can act as my test subjects to ensure this service is something that can be done and remains helpful to the students throughout the entire importing process. \n\n**This is for people interested in purchasing from Chinese suppliers on their own and not from sourcing companies.**\n\nHere is what I provide:\n\n1. Navigation through the fear. If you're serious, you've read some of the courses, and have a general idea, but you're still left with individual questions that a book can't answer. We'll go through all of these and ensure every last question you have is answered.\n\n2. I'll teach you the basics of sourcing and show you methods that we use on a daily basis. I'll teach you how to use all the databases to their fullest potential and show you exactly what to look out for and ensure you're safe when purchasing.\n\n3. We'll find potential products together and narrow down the most ideal and profitable products for you. You'll learn what to look out for from a shipping standpoint,production/ compliance standpoint, and also marketing standpoint. \n\n4. I'll connect you with contacts in the shipping industry, people who can be your eyes and ears in China for QC, and ways to build your own network or team in China. \n\nIf you have already been seriously preparing to start selling on Amazon, via importing from China, please tell me about yourself in the comments or via PM. I will be choosing two people who I feel are the most serious and who will benefit from this the most. I am in no way looking for compensation, I will not be getting kickbacks through any stage of this. /r/Entrepreneur is a great sub and this is my way of giving back while also getting some feedback for a future service I intend to start in the near future. \n\n\n","name":"t3_35yf2r","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-14 17:37:58","week":20}

{"id":"360n9h","author":"FinanciallyAdrift","body":"Title says most of it, but details follow (if you don't care, skip ahead)\n\n**Background**\n\nI'm 21 years old. My father is an abuser, a clinically diagnosed narcissist, and a general jackass. My parents are divorced. He controlled, among other things, my college fund. I was still a minor when I graduated high school, and didn't get much of a say in my university as a result, and ended up at an elite and highly expensive university. I struggled being away from home, and got into therapy, where I slowly started to see the level of shit that my childhood was. He spent this time using money as leverage for my good behavior (\"If you forget to call me daily, you can't come home for Christmas\", \"Email me your class schedule or no textbook money\", \"Let me sit in on therapy sessions or I'll stop paying for your meds\", \"Give me your email passwords or I'll stop paying for school\"). \n\nI have been pulling away from him over the last few years, in part over his treatment of me, and in part over his treatment of my younger siblings and mother. He finally let the hammer drop, and stopped paying for my education a semester before I was to graduate. I had to move back home. \n\n**End Background**\n\nI live at home, rent free, with my mother. I do not drive (no license) and have no car. I work part time in retail management and make a minimum of $300 every two weeks (sometimes up to $150 more due to commission). I also sometimes sell my stuff on ebay, and use apps like Ibotta, Paidviewpoint and Swagbucks to make a little extra on the side, but it isn't much.\n\nI have no degree, but I'm working on my AA at the local community college between online classes and CLEP so I can get into a state university (automatic admission with an AA from a state community college) to finish my BA. \n\nMy major expenses are Netflix (8.99/mo), Amazon Audible (1.99/mo), and my cell phone bill (50/mo). I also pay for my meds (I have a chronic medical condition) which totals out around $20 a month, plus $20 for doctor visits. I have a credit score of 653. I use Mint and Mint Bills. \n\nI'd like to start paying rent to my mom, maybe $100/mo, just because she's the single mom of two minors plus me on a teaching salary and I feel like I'm taking advantage. \n\nOther expenses are mostly recreational (I'm in a relationship, we are fairly cheap with dates and switch off when we pay but it still costs something) and personal (I needed new clothing for work, especially as I've recently lost a lot of weight).\n\nSo, now for my questions:\n\n1. How much should I put away each month? \n2. Would it be worth it for me to start driving? I'd be paying back my mom the increase in insurance, plus I'd need a car, but being able to drive would make me able to get to work with less stress on everyone, plus maybe make it so I could babysit on the side and take classes in person as opposed to online. I'd also be able to get back into therapy, which would be amazing, but another $60 a week. The independence that driving would give me is staggering and a bit scary.  \n3. Should I start paying my mom the $100 a month? Is that even a reasonable amount?\n4. What do I do to raise my credit score? I have a card I pay off every month, rarely spending more than $20 on it. \n\nI ***never*** want to be in a situation again where someone can control me by controlling my finances. I want to build a strong foundation for myself to become an independent, competent adult. \n\nHelp?","name":"t3_360n9h","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-15 04:27:04","week":20}

{"id":"3613pa","author":"MrActuary","body":"So, after I started my first real job about three months ago, I checked my credit score on Mint and it was at 822. I've had a joint credit card with my parents that I use, which they pay off and it's got a 20,000 limit I think. Right after I started my job, I applied for my own credit card, and I got the Amazon Chase card with a $500 limit.\n\nToday I checked my credit score again, since it's been 90 days since the last one, and now it's at 770. Trying to figure out why the drop happened.\n\nMight or might not be relevent, I set up the AutoPay and it was default set to pay the minimum balance, which it did of about $25 two weeks ago. There was still 250 remaining, which I paid off today. I also reconfigured the autopay to pay the entire balance on the card since I don't really need to leave a pending balance on the card.\n\nMy question is, did I do something to get that 50 point drop? The hard credit inquiry, if I'm reading right, should only have dropped my score by ~5 points. I'm thinking it might be the high utilization on the $500 dollar limit credit card? Maybe it's because I didn't pay the full balance? Any ideas so I don't repeat the mistake again? Mint shows the reasons for a high/low credit score, and everything seems to be in the green other than a lack of &gt;5 credit lines. Even utilization shows really low because it's summing up the usage of the credit card and dividing it by the total credit limit on both cards.","name":"t3_3613pa","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-15 07:20:00","week":20}

As a serial wantrepreneur spread thin between my day job, my Kindle publishing, and my freelance editing and writing jobs, I've barely had time to breathe, much less keep my head on straight. Don't get me wrong - this is the stuff I live for. I work about 16 hours a day, striving for the days when I'm making a living with no alarm clocks or pants required. Pants are evil. I hate them. I don't want to wear anything but booty shorts for the rest of my life, and if it means I start a hundred businesses before I get there, by god will I.\n\nA week ago, in a fit of rage and frustration, I accidentally stumbled upon my current venture. I've never done anything quite like it, so its involved a ton of research and work and I'm loving it. The only issue was that I couldn't quite find what seemed like a solid supplier for an essential part of my product. I searched Amazon, I searched Alibaba and Aliexpress. Nothing seemed quite right. I've kind of been putting it off (shame on me), but it's caused a perpetual feedback loop of not being able to really be productive because how can I do anything without knowing the dimensions of this element. It affects packaging, weight, design, labelling, the works. It's been stressing me out to hell and back finding a hundred different ways to phrase what I'm looking for in hopes that Ali or Amazon turns up what I'm looking for.\n\nToday, I remembered to breathe. I just punched what I was looking for into Google, and by god if the sky didn't open up and angels descended as about a hundred sites came up with exactly what I was looking for.\n\n**Moral of the Story** When it doubt, simplify. Stop making things complicated for yourself; it only leads to burnout. What entrepreneurial issues have you had that were solved by KISS? Currently struggling with something? Talk about it, maybe you're too close to the problem and need an outside point of view to find the simple route for it.","name":"t3_362q9r","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-15 18:31:21","week":20}

{"id":"36345n","author":"deerseason","body":"I will update this as the process moves along, just in case other people could use the help.\n\nIn taking advantage of the eBates 16% cash back promo from Staples last week, I bought two items - a 1TB SSD and a new video card. \n\nBoth items were for sale on amazon for cheaper (the SSD was 380 versus 450 on Staples, the video card was 320 versus 350).\n\nI purchased the items on 5/13 and should be arriving sometime next week.\n\nI got the eBates rewards this morning (5/15) of 16%. It showed as two separate orders, one for each item.\n\nThis morning I also saw that the SSD went on sale for a ridiculous price of 336 (you can still get it!).\n\nI called Chase Ink card services and they forwarded me to the benefits department (888 320 9956).\n\nThe guy on the phone asked for the purchase information (date, price, competitor's date and price, etc). He then emailed me a claim form that I am supposed to fill out and attached the necessary documents to:\n\nI need to show my original order showing price and last 4 CC number, and the current price with date of the lower-priced items (he suggested taking a screenshot with the computer's clock in view)\n\nThe rule states I have 21 days to file a claim, and then the form itself needs to be filled in within 45 days of having filed the claim. He also told me that tax and shipping is not included in the offer, and claims are limited to 500 dollars per item and 2500 dollars total benefit per year.\n\nI'd never done this before so I wasn't sure if this all needed to be done before the price went up, which could very well happen immediately. Apparently as long as I showed proof at the time and it happened within 21 days, I should be fine.\n\nOne weird thing is Staples always takes forever to show on my account activity. And today something weird happened:\n\nIt's showing my original order (of 800+ dollars) as having been refunded to me, and is now only showing the purchase of the video card (350+). It looks like, that like with ebates, they are splitting up the order into one for each item. The annoying thing is it still isn't showing the SSD purchase as of this moment.\n\nI will probably just wait a few more days before sending in the claim to make sure the purchase shows up in my statement properly.\n\nAnyway, if all goes well I should have made out quite well for myself:\n\n$882 original purchase price (with tax)\n-$130 eBates rebate (ebates did not count tax in the rewards)\n+24.50 TopCashback rebate (the 3% I would've gotten back if I'd used Topcashback normally)\n-153 (Amazon price difference)\n=$623.5\n\nPlus around 3800 worth of UR points via Chase, depending on how rewards work with my refund. Hopefully I don't lose rewards, at which point it would be as high as 4100.\n\nIf I'd bought this on amazon even with the sale price it would've been 715 dollars and 3600 worth of UR.\n\n","name":"t3_36345n","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-05-15 20:18:14","week":20}

My referral code is HGSK9E and you get 50 points for using it. \n\nIt's a really easy-to-use app that offers redeemable points when you download and run the suggested apps on the list. They are mostly game apps, and you can delete them as soon as you get rewarded (within five minutes usually). Points can be redeemed for Amazon cards, PayPal, or other apps. 600 points = $1 for Amazon, and depending on the offers, you can easily make $5 within a day or two. It's a little more work-intensive because you manually have to press the download button, but comparatively, that's much better than the 20 day for $5 Bing Rewards ratio.\n\nThis app works in the U.S., but I also noticed that it works in other countries too.

{"id":"364z0o","author":"capincus","body":"The first thing you should know about books is the more valuable they are the longer they will take to sell. Books are great for ridiculous profit margins because there are so many of them and no one really knows what they're looking at, but they can take a lot of time to sell if they're rare/niche.\n\n**Condition-** the most important part of value on any book whether it’s from the 12th century or 2015 is condition. A book that’s worth $50 isn’t worth $1 if the cover is off and 6 of the pages are loose from the page block. At the same time an $800 book might be worth repairing if it’s damaged or selling as is at a reduced price. This is true for whatever platform you choose to sell on and I’ll go over each of those at some point.\n\n**Amazon-**whether you’re doing MF (Merchant Fulfilled – shipping out each book by yourself) or FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon – sending shipments to Amazon warehouses to have them shipped out from there) what this will come down to is scanning. Scanning is the easy part of selling books; it's just tedious. You might have to go through 30-40 books to find a single one worth selling, unless you start sending into FBA and taking low margins per book, but with MF it’s just not practical to ship out every book that’s worth $5 if you’re paying $4 in fees. The basic app setup for scanning without paying any monthly fees or using technology outside of a smartphone are the same for both MF and FBA:\n\n**Sales Rank-** one of the most important meters for selling on Amazon is the sales rank. Books is one of the larger categories that fluctuates usually around 60 million total items. This means that anything under a million in books is a pretty decent rank, under 100,000 should be a pretty quick sale, and even up to 2 million is worth picking up cheap or with decent profit margins. Sometimes the profit can be so high on books that it’s worth spending a couple bucks to sit on a book with a ridiculous sales rank because even if it takes forever the profit is potentially in the hundreds. To get a better idea of what sales rank means in actual sales or for a particular item camelcamelcamel.com can show you historic prices for most items on Amazon. Changes in price (spikes) generally mean a sale and if there isn’t any data that doesn’t bode well for a sale in the near future, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it isn’t worth a shot if the cost is low enough.\n\n**Flow by Amazon-** you can scan through covers in bulk and then go through them one by one to see if any have value. **Pros:** This is the fastest way to go through books for Amazon value without a barcode scanner. **Cons:** This is not the most accurate system for older covers so some of them won't read properly, just make sure to set these aside and look at them closer. There can also be multiple listings at different prices so if you find a book worth something poke around a little bit at the other ones and check the different sales ranks.\n**Amazon Seller App-** scan barcodes or search Amazon for current prices. **Pros:** This is a more accurate way to look at current prices than Flow and includes a calculator to show the exact breakdown of profit after fees on both MF and FBA, and from there it takes literally about 3 seconds to list the book. **Cons:** You can only scan 1 book at a time and only if they have a visible barcode, otherwise you have to type in the name taking even longer.\n\nIt’s not really a competition between the two apps though so I don’t know why I even did pros/cons. Just use both as you see fit. Basically scan with Flow then check out anything that is potentially valuable in the Seller App.\n\n**EBay-** EBay is the site I use to sell most of my books but everything here really applies to the value of books in general for any platform (online or not) that isn’t Amazon. Amazon is great for selling books where the specific copy of the book probably doesn’t matter, one copy of The Hobbit is pretty much the same as any other copy to an Amazon buyer, and it is to the scanning app as well. Scan any popular book that isn’t brand new and you’ll find they tend to be a cent each, what Flow can’t tell you from most covers is that if that Hobbit is a first edition it could be worth thousands of dollars. Tons of people scan through books wherever you can find them, if you’re lucky enough to find a fresh source maybe you’ll find a few that were overlooked or just haven’t been scanned yet. But with just a little bit of knowledge and critical thinking you can find a whole shit ton of money sitting there because the 10 billion scanners didn’t want it.\n\n**Tools-** Ebay app and bookmark to vialibri.net (search engine for rare book sites).\n\n**First editions-** The biggest value that isn’t accounted for by scanners is in first editions. The first thing you need to be able to do is identify one and towards that end [Glenn Larsen has already written a better guide than I could]( http://www.whiteunicornbooks.com/home/glfirsted.html). This guide is a must, keep it bookmarked and refer to it often in your sourcing. Besides that there are a few things to look out for: be careful of book club editions if there is no price on the front inside dust jacket flap it’s probably a book club edition and worth a fraction of the true first (only really worth it if the true first is worth &gt;$200), if the dust jacket is clipped it’s probably a BCE or at the very least you can’t prove it isn’t and thus it is valued as such, if there is a small round circle indentation on the back cover under the DJ it is probably a BCE (specifically BoMC). Avoid reprint houses they may look like firsts but they’re reprints (hence the name), the most common ones I come across are Grosset &amp; Dunlap, A.L. Burt, Blakiston, Triangle Book Company, Collier’s, and Saalfield there are a couple of exceptions to these (G&amp;D published the firsts of all the popular children’s series like The Hardy Boys) but it’s generally safer just to avoid these publishers at all costs. \n\n**Note:** in book collecting terms the first edition refers only to the first printing, a first edition 7th printing is not a first edition and just because it says first edition on the copyright page doesn’t mean it is if other factors say otherwise (the Harry Potter books for example will say First American Edition if you go buy one that was printed today but will have the number line for 127th printing). For most books only the first printing is worth anything but if that first printing is extremely valuable then the next few printings can still definitely be worth selling (good examples are The Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird where the firsts are so valuable/desirable that even a 2nd-10th printing can still fetch you tens or hundreds of dollars).\nNow not every first edition is worth money and what determines the value has almost nothing to do with age. It’s a simple formula: rarity x desirability = value. So if a book is super rare but no one wants it it’s worth nothing (you’ll see people trying to sell a one of a kind signed cook book, or a super-rare 1970 reprint of Pride &amp; Prejudice for lots of money, these people are stupid). If a book is in high demand then it can be worth more even if it’s less rare. With this formula in mind a little bit of critical thinking can help you mentally scan through large amounts of books without looking every single one up on eBay or vialibri.net. \n\nFirst it helps to know a little bit about the authors: I know Dickens lived/wrote in the early 19th century so if I see a Dickens book that looks like it’s from the 1950’s I can skip it since it’s obviously not a remotely early edition. For more modern authors there are some easy ways to narrow down which of their books are valuable. James Patterson is extremely popular so the desirability for his books is there, but he’s been extremely popular so 100,000 book first printings bring down the rarity to the point where only his first few books when he was the least popular are rare enough to be worth anything.  Same thing with Stephen King, Tom Clancy, any popular author at all. For authors that don’t top the charts this same thing generally applies but there is more leeway since even their later books don’t get shipped out by the boatload. In this case it’s important to look at their most popular books, or award winning books, or the book that really jump started their career. Elizabeth Strout for example wrote 2 books before her 2008 Olive Kitteridge won the Pulitzer Prize, a first edition of these earlier works isn’t worth much but a first of Olive Kitteridge is worth an easy $50 because of how popular it is and the prize it won.\n\n**Antiques-** The second area where eBay can make you money that scanning will miss is in old books. The biggest mistake everyone ever makes is buying some book from 1890 “because ohmygerd it’s so old it’s amazing” and thinking they’ll get rich. But here’s the thing old doesn’t really matter. There are millions of books from the 19th century, even 18th century books aren’t rare, hell 17th century books aren’t anything special. If you find a book that was printed before 1500, buy it. If you find a hand-written book from before then look into it before you buy it. But anything from 1500-2015 is only valuable if it’s special in some way. First editions are great here but there is also more room for some profit in revised editions and slightly later printings than in more modern books so do a little research before you drop any significant amount of money. But don’t think just because you’ve found a first edition from before 1900 that you’re suddenly rich. You can buy any of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s first editions besides Uncle Tom’s Cabin for under $100, and fill an entire shelf with Rudyard Kipling, J.M Barrie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle firsts for a few hundred. The same rules apply here as in modern books, popularity of the work is important for there to be any value (Barrie’s early works for instance are worth almost nothing till you get to his middle works where anything with Peter Pan in it is worth a shit ton). Basically just have your smart phone ready.\n\n**How to tell what a book is actually worth-** so you think you’ve found a valuable book how can you be sure before you buy it? If you can’t find a sale price then you aren’t sure. EBay sold listings are generally the only decent place to look for sold listings. If a book consistently sells for $200 then it’s probably worth $200. If you don’t see any sold listings and there are 56 different copies asking $200 then it probably isn’t worth $200. Check eBay listings and vialibri.net listings because even if the lowest copy on eBay is at $200 if you can buy 12 different copies through vialibri for under $10 then it’s unlikely to be rare enough to sell on eBay at the mark-up even if there are no low priced copies.\n\nThat’s all I can come up with for now, feel free to ask any questions you might have. If you want to see some examples check out my inventory at stores.ebay.com/pinksbooks and if you want to be a doll like my page at facebook.com/pinksbooks\n","name":"t3_364z0o","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-16 06:45:26","week":20}

I get great pay for being 19 at $12.00 an hour with a chance of a $1.00 raise when \"certified\", commission and a $3.50 an hour bonus per quarter depending upon performance. Frankly, the money is pretty great when you get your commission compared to my old Walmart. Still not enough money nor focused enough on business to fulfill the skillset I need to develop.\n\n\nI come from a long line of self-employed and entrepreneurs and despite the pay, I am not happy when my job is not geared towards my goals. My college degree is geared towards Aerospace Engineering and the focus 10 years down the line is a start-up focused on space tech. I don't have 1 or 2 \"big ideas\" for a new product or business, I have hundreds. In the end, I boiled it down to one focused on a niche that I believe I can dominate with some good ole focused intention. I just don't know where to start yet or even how to estimate the cost in the beginning! \n\n\nThe next step for me is get everything together by either alibaba or wholesale in the US. My marketing platform will start off on Amazon and Etsy, so a big thing is making enough product and shipping it to Amazons central locations as well. I need to get a: specialized glass tank, a small submersible water pump and a few other key features that can be made easily. Where do I start from here?\n\n\n\nTldr: I am making a unique product for sale on Amazon/Etsy. Not much startup capital, not sure where to get more or even if I need to. Building a brand is easy, but I don't know where to start in manufacturing (wholesale from Alibaba or US?) nor how to keep costs down and profit high on a new product.

{"id":"366e7o","author":"Garwald","body":"Earnably Guide 2015 | Last updated: 5/23/15\n  \n#Earnably: [[REF - Start with 100 pts]](http://earnably.com/r/407) [[NON]](http://earnably.com)\n  \n#General\n  \nEarnably is the newest GPT website as of the last 24 hours. It has many of the offers currently available on other reward site such as Persona.ly, PeanutLabs, SuperRewards and more. Earnably is available in all countries although some offers may only be available for members from certain countries. You must be 18 or older to create an account and there is a limit of 1 account per household.\n  \n#Earnably's Goals\n  \nAccording to the creators their three main goals are:\n  \n* to have a **quality looking website**\n* to have **higher payouts than most other sites**\n* to be a **friendly and social company that puts its members first before profits**\n  \n---\n  \n#Points and Rewards\n  \nWhen you join with the referral link you will start with 100 points, worth $1.00. That means an exchange rate of 1 point equaling $0.01. Currently the only available reward is Paypal,* so make sure to add your Paypal email. Payments are automatically made to all members who have over 500 points within the first week of every month.\n  \n*[Amazon will likely be added within the next month](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/360i9i/earnably_new_gpt_website/cr9zy6o)\n  \n---\n  \n#Offers: Earn Points!\n  \nThe current Offers available on Earnably are from the usual networks to earn points. Examples include: Persona.ly, Matomy, OfferToro, WallAds, Peanut Labs, and more. *It is highly suggested to disable adblock as cookies are used by advertisers to track your participation in offers.*\n  \nBe aware that Earnably states that \"There is nothing we can do if your offer doesn't track.\"\n  \n---\n  \n#Deals: Do not award Points\n  \nDeals will NOT earn you points for completing. It appears that these are affiliate programs that they have signed up for as a company in order to generate revenue. Examples of some of these deals include signing up for Amazon Prime, Audible, Namecheap, Qmee and more.\n  \n---\n  \n#Contests: Earn Points!\n  \nEarnably currently has three contests where you can try to earn some extra points: Referral Contest, Points Contest and Twitter Contest. You are automatically entered and there is no limit to how many times you can win.\n  \n**Referral Contest: Monthly**\n  \nThe top 3 users who refer the most new members in a month will be rewarded! The contest restarts at the beginning of every month.\n  \n* 1st place: 750 points ($7.50) and lifetime VIP\n* 2nd place: 500 points ($5.00)\n* 3rd place: 250 points ($2.50)\n* 4th place: 100 points ($1.00)\n* 5th place: 100 points ($1.00)\n  \n**Points Contest: Monthly**\n  \nThe top 5 users who earn the most points in a month will each receive 100 points ($1.00) each. The contest restarts at the beginning of every month.\n  \n**Twitter Contest: Weekly**\n  \nEach week, Earnably will randomly choose one of their Twitter followers and give them 100 (or 50) points just for following them on Twitter. In order to win, you must be following [@Earnably](http://twitter.com/Earnably) on Twitter and you must be able to receive direct messages from Earnably on Twitter. The contest runs once every weekend.\n  \n---\n  \n#Refer Friends: Earn Points!\n  \nReferring friends will earn you 10% of their earnings for life and start your friend off with 50 points. You can increase your referral percentage by becoming a VIP.\n  \n---\n  \n#VIP Membership\n  \nVIP members are handpicked by Earnably and are given exclusive VIP benefits. Anyone can become a VIP by earning lots of points or referring new users. Benefits include:\n  \n* Early access to new site features\n* priority support\n* ad-free browsing experience\n  \n---\n  \n#Other\n  \nIf you found this guide useful I'd appreciate if signed up with my [[referral link]](http://earnably.com/r/407) which will also start you with 100 points. If not, here's a [[nonref]](http://earnably.com) link.\n  \nI will keep this guide updated with Earnably's newest updates and changes. If there are enough new updates in a short amount of time I will post an updated guide.

{"id":"367cq3","author":"aclb5","body":"About a year ago, I conducted [a small experiment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2599ad/here_are_the_results_of_my_10_experiment_with/) that was well received by /r/entrepreneur. I had two goals for that experiment which were to have fun and to learn. People shared two general thoughts in the comments: \"Thank you for sharing!\" and \"You should have added some more content so the site added some value for the visitors\". With all this in mind I decided to conduct a similar experiment but this time put some effort into creating content, and then share the results with you all again. \n\n**The Setup:** I decided to create a review based website with reviews that have Amazon referral links. I decided to review drones because drones are one of the \"cool products\" people are interested in these days and there is certainly a segment of people interested in reviews. I spent a few hours thinking about my ideas for the site. I created a website with Weebly, wrote some reviews, connected to a domain name. Creating the website and reviews took about 5 hours of time and cost $39 total. Next I set up some Reddit Ads, which didn't take long. I decided to run the ad in two places: /r/Multicopter and the Technology Buffs Collection available within the Reddit Ad system.\n\n**The Results:** Spending $30 on my Ads got me 31,000 impressions delivered to my target audience. Here is a picture of the ad: http://i.imgur.com/LGDrB8D.png\n\nMy CTR (Click Through Rate) was 0.373% and my CPC (Cost Per Click) was $0.26, which was $0.05 higher than my previous experiment. However, the Ad targeted to /r/Multicopter performed significantly better than the more general technology buff ad. This is a good bit of knowledge to learn: honing in on a specific target audience is likely a better decision. Here is a picture of detailed traffic statistics of the Ads: http://i.imgur.com/uEQV5Sd.png\n\nOver the course of the 4 days my Ads ran I received 150 unique visitors to my website. I set up tracking with Google Analytics so I could get more detailed data than Weebly offers. \n\nHere is the Weebly data: http://i.imgur.com/V85q0Jr.png \n\nWith Google Analytics I was happy to learn that the average user went to 4 pages and stayed on my Website for 3 minutes - people were reading my reviews! Here is the GA data: http://i.imgur.com/tKywq3r.png \n\nMy end goal was to get people to click on the referral links, and then hope they buy things on Amazon within the next 24 hours. In all, I had 64 clicks which amounts to a staggering 43% of unique visitors clicking my referral links. Surely, someone must have bought something! Wrong... For all the clicks, I earned nothing, zero, zilch. Here is the data from Amazon: http://i.imgur.com/bukiBpI.png\n\nUnfortunately, just like my last experiment I did not earn any money. However, I had too much fun with this I will keep working on it and will certainly share the progress with you all as I go. My plans for now are to keep adding more content, starting with a blog/articles section. I also plan to try my hand with social media marketing and SEO to generate organic traffic which is much better than paying $0.26 per visitor! All of this is new to me so I expect to learn a lot more along the way.\n\nFor those wondering, the site is www.droneguru.co.\n\nHope you found this interesting, you learned something, and maybe even were inspired to try something on your own.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas in the comments. I'll be sure to update after I make some progress.\n\nEdit 2: Here is some more interesting data from GA, called User Flow: http://i.imgur.com/ih20G6q.png Some comments mentioned that my ad would have performed better if people went directly to my review, which would reduce the number of clicks required for a conversion. This data shows that is absolutely true (as expected).\n","name":"t3_367cq3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-16 23:41:32","week":20}

{"id":"3694pf","author":"uberplex","body":"Hey everyone, this was originally a comment I wrote for the latest \"reddit ads, amazon affiliate experiment\" post, explaining the proper way to do affiliate marketing - I decided to post it here since it ended up being really long and so more people could see it.\n\nIn this post I'm talking about when people send traffic directly to their review page for an amazon product:\n\nThe way that you've currently built your system is that people only have ONE EXPOSURE to the products that you are promoting.\n\nIndustry stats say you need between 4-7 exposures for a customer to buy\n\nWith this technique of driving traffic straight to your review page, you're only getting one exposure...\n\nAnd the worse bit is when you want more exposures you're going to have to pay for ads AGAIN\n\nThis is the right way to do affiliate marketing:\n\n* Send ads (fb is the best) to a opt-in page for a free gift that the target niche would be interested in. I don't know anything about your niche but let's just guess \"How to make your drone faster\"\n\n* People get that free gift which is ideally a video (or pdf) and through that free gift you're establishing AUTHORITY (you're showing that you actually know stuff) and RAPPORT (by providing FREE VALUE people will trust you more). You can't convince people to buy if they don't trust you, until you show that you are an AUTHORITY your recommendation means NOTHING\n\n* When people got that free gift they were automatically added to your autoresponder series, this is a set of automated emails that go out on eg. day 1, day 3, day 5 etc. after opt-in. And it's in THOSE EMAILS that you then promote products\n\n* BUT in order to get them to trust your recommendations, to like you and always buy what you recommend you need to provide MORE VALUE in your emails. So you send out what's called \"content\" emails, where there's no selling just free value that the niche would be interested in. You should send in this sequence: welcome email --&gt; content --&gt; content ---&gt; promotion ---&gt; content ---&gt; promotion --&gt; content ---&gt; content ---&gt; promotion\n\nAnd that's the secret to being a successful affiliate. \n\nThis way, your building trust with your list and providing value. AND you're increasing the amount of exposures that people have to your products MASSIVELY. Instead of just 1 exposure, it can be hundreds in a year.\n\nAnd the cost of sending emails is so small, the cost is entirely negligible. It's as if it's free if you do affiliate marketing right and make money from it.\n\nYou're supposed to spend money building an ASSET - your list! That you can then continually turn to to make money from. That's what you need to invest your traffic into\n\nAnd don't think you need to spend time making loads of content, just emailing your list cool articles and videos from the internet (not all the time) is a quick way to provide value.\n\nAnd I've said it before in a previous post.. if your goal is just to make money online.\n\nDON'T get into the amazon affiliate programme or google adsense?\n\nWhy? Because you need to be moving SERIOUS TRAFFIC to make any kind of good money with amazon affiliate or adsense\n\nAnd you're just a beginner (I assume) - you don't know how to drive even 100 visitors, let alone effectively monetise 100 visitors\n\nLink to previous post \"There's a lot more to affiliate marketing than just Amazon...\" http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2wnsue/theres_a_lot_more_to_affiliate_marketing_than/\n\nIf you want to know some great tools for setting this kind of stuff up in terms of the opt-in pages and autoresponders PM me\n\nComment below if you've got any questions or any vehement objections and I'll try my best to answer them\n","name":"t3_3694pf","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-17 13:14:55","week":20}

I did not create the ASIN and multiple people sell on it (both MF and FBA)\n\nI have had the listing changed back to the original description (and then the person tried adding another supplementary item, which I have also just had removed!). The ASIN is now going to be locked to prevent this.\n\nWhat happens to the customers who ordered a glass and expected to receive a glass and a straw? They will have a legitimate claim to return the product. I cannot easily resell my product if it is returned because of the way it is packaged. I have mentioned this to Amazon.\n\nI don't see how I am liable but I am worried that Amazon could tell me to go fuck myself. Would I have any recourse? Would I be able to take action against the person \"vandalising\" the ASIN?\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated :)\n\n","name":"t3_3699wf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-17 14:37:45","week":20}

[Credit Karma](http://www.creditkarma.com) and [Credit.com](http://www.credit.com) allow you to get a general estimate of your TransUnion/Equifax and Experian scores, respectively. They're free, and they don't do anything bad for your credit report.\n\nDiscover was my first credit card (as a secured card), and I've had nothing but great experiences with them. You will periodically run into acceptance issues, but that's limited to smaller/local businesses - any major US retailer will accept all 4 credit card brands.\n\nI don't have a Freedom, but the ability to earn 5x Ultimate Rewards (Chase's loyalty program) points when combined with their premium cards is pretty enticing; however, since you are pretty new to credit, that payout won't happen anytime soon until you've built up your history.\n\nThe Sallie Mae card was actually my 2nd card; it's actually better if you're living by yourself since the max spend is pretty low for 5% cash back ($250 for gas, $250 for groceries, $750 for bookstores including most Amazon purchases). I think Sallie Mae is a slightly easier rewards card to get since it's geared towards students with student loans, but YMMV.\n\nJust to note: while Discover It and Freedom are both good intro cards, Discover and Chase are still moderately selective - definitely call their reconsideration lines if you apply and get a pending message or decline!","name":"t1_cr577l9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-11 06:28:05","week":20}

If you don't have credit, you may want to consider a secured card. This basically means you apply for a card and put down a deposit, where that deposit becomes your credit limit. \n\nIf you do have some sort of credit already, you may want to check the Chase pre-qualified offer site to see if anything comes up. Those are usually pretty solid, so if you get an offer, you're usually pretty likely to get approved if you apply. Discover's \"personalized offer\" will show something even with fake info, but some people say it's more likely to be a real offer if you have an actual percentage given for the APR rather than a range.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm a young single person (not a family of 4), and I really like the Sallie Mae MC since I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and my local Target codes as a grocery store. I actually think the $250 caps for gas/groceries each month might be pretty limiting if you have to feed or drive around a bunch of other people. But if you always eat out/don't have a car/don't buy books or things from Amazon, it probably doesn't fit well with your spending habits.

They will allow you to see your full credit report from TransUnion &amp; Equifax, as well as a credit score (not your FICO, which is what most banks will use to look at creditworthiness, but it'll still serve as a pretty solid indicator of where you are). \n\nI ask mostly because I know Chase is a bit selective for their card. Do you have a job right now? Putting down that you have a solid and consistent income stream is pretty important for them as well. \n\nAll that aside, I have a Freedom (it was my first card), and I think it's a really fantastic card. 1% on everything + 5% special categories every quarter (winter is generally Amazon, which is awesome) + if you shop through their Ultimate Rewards site, you can get anywhere from 3-8% extra gravy on online shopping. I always check the site if I'm going to be buying anything online, and I've earned a ton that way.\n\nI also have an American Express Blue Cash Everyday-- it's another no annual fee rewards card, 1% on everything, 2% on groceries (and I think a kicker on gas?

{"id":"cr5hsdg","author":"garnacerous24","body":"Here's what I've been up to in order to drive traffic to my new website. I do know a good amount of SEO, but I've gotten slightly jaded on the matter, and am spending more time trying to get my traffic from as many different sources as possible so the next inveitable Google update doesn't take 20% of my customers away. (http://thecolporteur.com):\n\n1. Get a twitter account and go to tweepi.com and buzzsumo.com they are both subscription sites, but also offer free services. On buzz sumo, you can find \"influencers\" in your niche. For instance, I typed in \"history\" and found a bunch of twitter accounts with 100k + followers. I then type those names into tweepi.com and follow the people who are following these influencers. Essentially, you're finding a nice target audience that has already proven that they would like your site (since they already follow someone who is similar). If you follow them, a chunk of those people will follow you back. I was able to get about 1,200 followers within 2 weeks or so using this method. I probably could've gotten more, but it does take some time and you have to weigh the work vs rewards. I notice that about 10% of the people you follow will follow you back if your site is good. After a week or so, you can unfollow the people who don't follow you back. \n\nOnce they follow you, make sure you post some good relevant information that they would want to read, then use that to point them towards your website.\n\n2. Use paid advertising if your website is good enough to make people stay. I like facebook advertising because you can get really specific with who you target. If you're an international business, you can keep your costs down by targeting people in markets outside of the US/UK. I've been able to get it under 10 cents a click, but other people like Jon Loomer can do under 4 cents per click (http://www.jonloomer.com). Similar to twitter, make sure you post good content on Facebook so your new fans will actually want to come back for more.\n\n3.Another trick I'm testing out is using MTurk to drive some cheap traffic. MTurk is Amazons task market, where people get paid for doing grunt work (surveys, translation, etc). I created a task to search for my website and click the link, then provide the title of an article to prove they went there. This should drive a few hundred people to my site for about 5 cents per hit and hopefully the content is good enough where a few of them stick. I haven't tried this method before, so we'll see how well it works.\n\n4. If your site is entertaining, or has the potential for \"viral\" content, you can try stumbleupon as a source of traffic. It's a platform that allows people to \"surf\" the web. Stumbleupon will pick a random website for the user to go to based on their interests. You can either submit your site manually, or you can use them and pay for advertising. If you pay, Stumbleupon will slip it in between other normal sites. If you go the manual route and its not popular, Stumbleupon will stop showing it pretty quickly. One thing to note is that stumbleupon users have a VERY short attention span. You have to capture their attention in under a couple seconds to have a chance. \n\n5. Try to get some online press. This has a bit to do with SEO, but also works as a separate form of traffic. find some sites that might compliment yours and offer to cross promote for them. Find some online news sites and submit a press kit and see if they can write an article about you. Try to find a unique angle that would make for an interesting story. I included a link below with some help for this.\n\nThese are a couple of articles I found helpful:\n\nhttp://blog.clarity.fm/the-hackers-guide-to-getting-press/\nhttp://www.quicksprout.com/2015/05/08/how-to-improve-your-facebooks-organic-reach/\n\nEdit: Ignore the bullet point numbers, they apparently get re-formatted when I submit the comment.","name":"t1_cr5hsdg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-11 16:17:42","week":20}

{"id":"cr5lyd2","author":"ImInterested","body":"Personally I view entrepreneurs as people who define new business models that either create new industries or new business models for a given industry.  [Tom Monaghan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Monaghan) with Dominoes Pizza.  [Fred Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_W._Smith#Business_career) with FedEx.\n\nI would say they could also have taken an idea that was being done on a small scale and made it hyper successful.  Ray Kroc with McDonalds, [franchising] was done before McDonalds but the picture at the top of the page is a McDonalds.\n\nI have all the respect in the world for someone who opens a standard pizza shop.  I don't view them as an entrepreneur, they are a business person.  The first pizza shop that started making deluxe slices loaded with a variety of condiments was entrepreneurial.\n\nA dictionary definition of entrepreneur - a person who organizes and operates a business or businesses, taking on greater than normal financial risks in order to do so.\n\nThe dictionary does not reference new business models but new business models inherently have more risk.  Plenty of people told Fred Smith there was no market for overnight shipping.\n\nThe word entrepreneur has more flair so it has become very popular.  The rise of the internet created an entirely new way to conduct business and many people were entrepreneurs in pursuing/creating new business models.  I don't view someone making money through Amazon affiliate site an entrepreneur, someone may come up with a way to do this and make 10X what most make in that industry.  They would be entrepreneurial.  \n\nI would say if you are following an established business model ala /ridealong your a business person.

{"id":"cr5ndjh","author":"bumpgrind","body":"Took a look at your website for a few minutes. Here's some high-level feedback:\n\n**Stay focused on value**\n\nBefore I make any recommendations it's important for me to know what are the most popular areas of your website? What do website visitors use the most? The reason I ask this is because this is the most important way for you to ensure continued success. The more value you provide to your visitors, the more organically your traffic will grow.\n\n**Monetization**\n\nNext up I'd like to hit on monetization. Because any business is only sustainable with adequate cashflow and can only flourish with sufficient positive cashflow required to reinvest within the business. You should really focus on maximizng your revenues. Although this requires work you really should focus on obtaining products that you recommend and selling them for profit instead of leveraging 3rd parties. While you may earn 10-15% when you sell a backpack or camping shoes via affiliates, if you were to sell directly you could easily triple your profits (e.g. $80 shoes earns you $12 commissions but could earn you $36 profits if you were to sell them yourself). If you go this route you would only want to sell products you believe in and limit the quantity of items you keep in stock. You would also want to consider leveraging Amazon FBA (fulfillment by Amazon) and having them take care of your order fulfillment, shipping, customer service, etc. Although it'll bite into your profit margins initially, longer-term it ensures sustainability because you won't be expending your time packaging and shipping products, instead you can focus this time on growing the business.\n\nAnother monetization idea is to get advertising sponsors for each section. For example, collect the website traffic stats for this page: http://thesavvybackpacker.com/using-money-in-europe-atms-credit-cards-debit-cards-exchange-rates-currency-confusion-and-more/ and then approach credit card companies to pay a monthly fee for their ads to be placed here. Alternately use affiliate links that pay for credit card applications versus just ads where you can gain $25-250 per applicant.\n\n**Design**\n\nI would recommend a more visually appealing design. Once that matches the feelings of backpacking, sense of adventure, hostel traveling with a European touch. \n\n**Link building**\n\nThis definitely will help. Seek out 3rd party blogging sites and seek out opportunities to write guest blogs on your/their visitors most popular topics. Always link back to your website.  Do this regularly, a few times each and every month. Slow and steady this can really pay off. \n\nAlso on your website right now, all of your articles should be easy to share via social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.); this can really build up some viral inbound links to your website and generate some serious traffic and rank.\n\n**Full-time gig**\n\nOnce the website covers your cost of living and suitable cash to reinvest into the business you will be able to plan this as a full-time gig if you so desire. I would advise against it until then unless you've got 1-2 years of living expenses in savings and you are confident in the historical trend of revenue increase, but still you should proceed at your own risk.\n\n**Content**\n\nYour content is great; most URLs are carefully planned for each article as well. Some of them are suboptimal however and I believe you may not be researching keywords before choosing the titles. If I were writing your articles I'd urge you to use more bullet point form and imagery. People often don't read paragraphs of text anymore and while this is useful for SEO, at least including a bullet-point form summary of the highlights at the beginning will really help motivate visitors to read the article and/or capture the value from the article quickly if they weren't willing to read it in its entirety regardless. Think about what you read when you visit sites, most people don't read full articles anymore (and it's debatable as to whether or not they ever did).\n\n**SEO**\n\nYour site is fairly well optimized in terms of URLs, page titles, header titles and content. You need to fix a typo in your title tags causing a bit of issues \"Important Planning Activities That Are Easy To OverlookGuide to Budget Backpacking in Europe &amp;#8211; The Savvy Backpacker\". Strive to use 70 characters or less (reference: http://blog.powermapper.com/blog/post/Page-Title-Length-for-Search-Engines.aspx) in your titles and be careful of issues when assembling titles (e.g. \"OverlookGuide\" should be \"Overlook - Guide\". Also spend time optimizing your image filenames and ALT tags on each of your articles should be named appropriately. For example:\n\n- URL: http://thesavvybackpacker.com/hostels-in-europe-guide/\n- Rename hostel1.jpg to hostels-in-europe-guide-1.jpg\n- Change ALT tag from hostel1 to \"Hostels in Europe Guide\"\n\nFinally see above re: building inbound links via social media, guest blogs, etc. This will add **huge** value to your ongoing efforts; although it takes time and requires that you dedicate time each and every month to the effort.\n\nGood luck!\n","name":"t1_cr5ndjh","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-11 18:59:17","week":20}

A lot of the gyms would say no but the ones that said yes I guess they had no contracts in place. I don't do this so much anymore as it took up a lot of time. Yeah, I could also get deals on bulk buys and would sometimes offer them to the gyms. \n\nI'm just a middle man and Amazon is just a platform. There are still companies behind some of the Items getting sold (not many).

The seller wants to sell and if they buyers wants to buy then there is usually no issues... Amazon or no Amazon.\n\nThe thing is Amazon always has huge sales on treadmills anyways. If a gym or person looking for equipment sees the deals then it's usually enough to talk them into it.

Stores like CVS and Walmart have an incentive to get you into the store so that you buy more stuff, but as soon as Amazon starts to seriously impact their profits as much as people not coming into the stores would Walmart will crush them as far as goods sales goes. Amazon has a lot of other things going for it, but it would be fairly trivial for a CVS or Walmart type store to offer 30 minute delivery to most of the United States if they wanted to, but they're not jumping into that arena until they are forced to because it's really just a race to the bottom.

Eliminate that person, and I'm going to buy from Amazon because I like them, all else being equal.\n\n\nAmazon really knocked the crap out of ebay long ago.

Case and point, there's a 3D printing supplier I buy from somewhat regularly that sells only through Amazon (unfortunately) and if they had a site I'd start using it in a heartbeat.

They don't play a \"tiny role\", as you claimed; they are instrumental. \n\nThey are not necessary, they are a luxury. \n\nThis is my job. I work as a Frontend Engineer and UX Designer (this is what your HIC is called in the real world). We employ no artists and my degree is in Computer Science. In my last job we employed 1 designer who worked for multiple teams. That position would be first to go in a pinch, because the position wasn't needed but they were nice to have. It also paid 25% less than our lowest paid code monkey.\n\nThey are employed more heavily on the marketing teams web development. This is probably where you will find an overwhelming percentage of art degrees in technology. Even here they account for a small portion of the team (or teams), unless they are in a smaller shop and can do their own HTML/CSS. I have actually personally known several of these guys who went back to school for SE/CS or IS because they were getting paid considerably less than the people they were working with.\n\n&gt;Please, take a look at the R&amp;D positions offered in the large companies I mentioned. \n\nWhy? True R&amp;D is a tiny microscopic portion of the industry when talking about jobs.  \n\n&gt;Look at the endowments that they are giving art and design programs with a tech focus. \n\nI'm sure they are. It's pretty much of the only hope they have of being employed and somewhat useful. Not much need for painters and sculptors.\n\n&gt;Look at the extent to which they actively recruit students from these programs. Go ahead. \n\nYeah, not that much.\n\nThey do however recruit for CS heavily. Did you know Amazon actually tries to interview every single fresh CS/SE/CE graduate in the entire US? \n\nProbably not. But they do. Talk about actively recruiting!\n\n&gt;Strange that those people playing a \"tiny role\" are being offered large salaries by the most prestigious tech companies.\n\nLarge salaries by art standards. Still paid less than their Engineering peers. I actually have friends working in art across all sorts of industries. Even the guys who create some of the most amazing concept art for some of the worlds largest companies, get paid less or about the same as a fresh grad, who really isn't that good at coding, would make in the same area.\n\nIt seems you've just got this idea in your head about all these things... but no real world experience and no actual data to back it up.

Are you interested in sysadmin, networking, or coding?\n\nI can speak from a networking perspective. It's a good field, it's growing, and it's more difficult to outsource than others. To get started in networking, first get some entry level certs from CompTIA. I'd get A+, then get Net+. From there, you can start pursuing your CCNA or similar. Current hot topics in the networking world is wireless or SDN. Wireless has funky RF math but if you understand the unique challenges it offers you'll be in a good shape. SDN (software defined networking) is looking like it will finally \"hit\" in the next few years and it will require some programming knowledge, so I'd brush up on Python.\n\nIf you want to break into wireless, I'd first get your Net+ and then start working through the CWNP program.\n\nAll of this can be learned from books you can get on Amazon or through tutorials. It will take some time, especially if you're starting from scratch, but it's a marketable skill that's in decent demand. A CCNA can get you on your feet if you have the patience for it.\n\nI graduated with a dead end degree too, then four years in I started self studying IT and made the jump to a new career.

Think about the order for 2 days or more and the  decide if it's worth it. Really ask yourself if it's necessary or worth the cost. \n\n4) if you're younger,  don't splurge on investments like nice furniture. You may end up moving multiple times in the future,  and buying expensive furniture now will only cause you a headache. It'll get dinged up and you'll get upset each time you move,  or the piece may not work well at your new place. \n\n5) use a library for books and movies.  It's fucking free already! \n\n6) Begin saving some money. You sound like a younger person,  so I recommend to start saving now to get the best return on investment. Open a Roth IRA and deposit $50 a month into the money market associated with it.  Once you're at $500-1000 in balance,  consider buying a healthy stock (con edison, Apple,  GE,  Morgan Stanley,  etc).  Hold onto this stock for the long haul,  and begin saving for the next stock to buy. \n\n\n7) don't emulate the lifestyle of your parents.  If your parents are financially comfortable,  they may have a nice car or a good sized house with beautiful furniture and an outdoor patio or something.  But it took them years of financial hardship to get there.  You aren't at that level and need to start saving and cutting excess costs out in order to get to where they are. \n\n8) cut cable and just order Internet with Netflix and Hulu plus. If you're an Amazon prime member,  you can use that too. Try to borrow someone's HBO account for HBO GO. \n\n9) If you shave with those mach 3 or similar razor cartridges,  switch to a double edge razor. Simpler razors that are SIGNIFCANTLY cheaper, blades are recyclable, and it doesn't cause pimples or ingrown hair folliculitis. It takes a little getting used to how to shave,  but youtube videos helped me and now I love it. \n\n10) have a savings goal, monthly,  quarterly,  yearly, and longterm. Ideally you should be saving about 20% of your income for retirement. Try to work your way to that and always reassess your savings plan when your income changes. \n\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cr6ngwr","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-05-12 17:35:11","week":20}

So they expect YOU to be Amazon and pay for their return shipping and their buyer’s remorse and anything that doesn’t make your product perfect once they receive it. The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was when a buyer tried to return two separate products after having them for two months and after raving about how happy she was with them, suddenly they didn’t work out for her but she couldn’t really return them in accordance with Amazon’s policy and I didn’t want them back after she used them.  She kept opening and re-opening A to Z claims when she was clearly in the wrong and having to defend myself was a waste of time. In the end, Amazon ended up refunding her out if their pocket and allowing her to keep the product as well. It was total fraud and I would never sell on there again. And the commissions are just too high, 15% for what I was selling, that’s even higher than eBay including Paypal.

{"id":"cr776qc","author":"DeenB2","body":"&gt; in one go based on a single (a few) person's experience but yours is no better,\n\nThat's precisely what I wanted. It's merely to offset it, by making another anecdote. (Note that I put anecdote there, anecdote != data.)\n\nIt's very true that there's many people saying bad things about Neobux, but people are saying the same things on Clixsense (and yes, I did note you said similar PTC sites) and other things. It's really inevitable with reviews especially like buying things on Amazon, there's always going to be that review. When left unchecked it might paint those sites on a light which they don't deserve. As for defending it, I just went like, \"Oh, someone posted that Neobux is a scam but I am using it very normally and getting paid might as well post my experience too.\" Someone who is [older](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/35orkc/neobux_scam_banned_on_payout/cr6odnk) than me is already downvoted and in the lowest part of the thread, and it's going on for this post too. If you lurk around the Neobux forum, there's plently of people just doing minijobs (like Mturk, maybe, haven't tried) that earn by doing tasks and they always post about it. People always say that the rented referral system of neobux is a scam. But there's always minijobs, everytime this is mentioned people always ignore this portion of that site. It's like people saying the entire Reddit is bad without visiting the niche subreddits.\n\nI just want to say that Neobux is very strict in particular with their rules, and doing something innocently but is not allowed in the TOS, and then saying they get banned... I really do not know. I mean, I am not getting banned, other people too. So I can't really tell, but as for me I am still there.\n\n(As for the first post in this account, it's not really my first post overall. I am not really an active participant in reddit, so it's just mostly lurking for months and making an account when I feel like posting.

{"id":"cr7gn0z","author":"haltingpoint","body":"Some other wisdom to add from someone working at a SaaS company...\n\n* The SaaS business model is complex. [This is a great guide](http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/) to understanding key metrics for it.\n* Growth might not be meteoric, but recurring revenue is amazing in that it builds over time.  Acquisition volume may be low, but you need to ultimately understand their lifetime value to determine what a reasonable CAC is.\n\n* Be careful of falling into a trap of assuming that the growth of the customer base will sustain itself.  It will eventually slow % wise, and churn will creep up on you.  Eventually, you can end up at a point where the # of customers churning each month is higher than the # of new customers acquired. Manage your cash flow accordingly.\n\n* Churn is the #1 enemy of many SaaS companies.  Here's a free tip worth its weight in renewal fee gold... Know all the big data breaches at Target and other retailers? What's the first thing that happens? Credit cards get cancelled in droves.  For many businesses, this can often mean that someone will forget to update their card in your system, and their account may expire for lack of valid payment.  If you have high engagement (DAU/MAU), they might notice and fix it, likewise if you are a key piece of a business.  However for a service that is more passive, this can mean customers who would have continued paying you forgot you existed.  Accepting payment through services like Amazon and Paypal mean that someone is exponentially more likely to keep their CC updated within those services, and you don't need to ask them for a new form of payment to keep them on.  Adding these other forms of payment, while often a massive headache, can easily be worth the cost long-term.\n\n* Build out event-based analytics ASAP.  Google Analytics supports it, and at lower volumes KissMetrics, Mixpanel, etc. can be good solutions (they are overpriced at high volumes).  You need to understand how users are engaging with your product.\n\n* Cancellation surveys should be a regularly monitor dashboard.  Remember that the majority of people cancelling may never fill out a survey and not be represented, so don't be afraid to pick up the phone or send an email and engage with cancelled users 1:1, especially early on.\n\n* PR can be an amazing investment early on with the right PR folks.\n\n* Digital media can be expensive, especially if you have a limited budget such that you won't easily/quickly acquire statistically significant data sets (I do digital media for a living, trust me here).  Still, the data is invaluable, and if you know what you are doing, you can be really efficient.\n\n* Find ways for customers to spread the word.  Study models like Dropbox's where they largely grew off of their referral program.\n\n* Customer support is not a cost center. It is one of your most valuable company functions. Done properly it ensures happy long-lasting customers in a business model where LTV is everything.  The cost to acquire a new customer is typically several multiples (often times 5x) the cost of retaining an existing customer.  Plus, happy customers can be your most efficient and effective marketing channel.\n\n* Educate your customers on how to use your product.  Force it in-product, do it via email, a blog, etc. Never stop educating. You will bang your head against the wall the first time a customer says \"I cancelled because you couldn't do X\" and you've been doing X for years but they just didn't know about it.\n\n* Automate all the things.\n\n* Get a real email platform that can do complex marketing automation ASAP.  However understand that by building out everything in such a system, you are trading convenience and efficiency for lock-in.  Imagine building tons of complex automations in a product with no easy way to port the logic elsewhere, and then wanting to switch.  Not fun.\n\n* Don't skimp on lawyers or accountants.  A single nuisance patent suit can easily sink a new startup as can a surprise audit and tax bill from the IRS.\n\n* Build up a cash reserve and manage cash flow.  You *will* encounter lean times, and you will have unexpected expenses.","name":"t1_cr7gn0z","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-13 06:58:04","week":20}

{"id":"cr7weos","author":"jmo10","body":"Just to add some complaints because I think Noah reads r/economics:\n\nBill Easterly later clarified with Thaler what he meant but he didn't tweet it:\n\n&gt;What I meant was that any fix to irrational behavior would still have to be designed, approved, and implemented by other individuals who are also themselves subject to irrational biases. Sometimes the fix will be possible and a clear improvement, other times not so much.\n\n\n&gt;How about sales and discounts? Just raise the base price and treat the real price as a discount, and behavioral economics will make people more eager to buy.\n\nMaybe. But you'll definitely see contractions in sales numbers in most months as customers expect sales during certain times of the year. And so, instead of consuming non-perishable items throughout the year, they save up money to purchase multiple goods during one or two periods (e.g. Black Friday to Christmas). Some businesses require more constant streams of revenue so it's not a feasible business model for every business.\n\nThat also gets ridiculous as people wait for the best sales available. \n\nBut the idea just doesn't make that much sense to me. If there are two stores (A and B) with identical items and located close to each other with well advertised prices, how is that plan supposed to work out? Assuming by real price Noah means the competitive price, if store A decides to increase prices for most of the year and then decrease prices to the competitive price only during a handful of periods while store B decides to keep the competitive price year round, guess who's going to lose business?\n\nThat's the damn problem I have with most retailers. Even with their discounts, their prices are about as good as the prices Amazon always has. And it's easy enough for me to find information on competing prices because every device has internet access these days.

If you want the full scoop, listen to the thing. It's 28 minutes. If more podcasts had transcripts the world would be a better place.\n\n\"Don't look for shortcuts\"\n\n\"Don't 'find' success, 'earn' success. Be Amanda Palmer and build an audience slowly, don't be the guy who got an audience quickly.\"\n\n\"Don't just look for an audience/customers. Become a part of a community that trusts you.\"\n\n\"The companies that people respect don't act the way 'hustlers' act.\"\n\n\"Build a legitimate audience of people that want your product. Don't just sell to your friends via Kickstarter funding.\"\n\n\"Don't start something without anticipating the moment when things get really difficult.\"\n\n\"Have 'resources' before you start a Kickstarter. Have customers ready to buy your thing, then just have them buy it via Kickstarter!\"\n\n\"Create a good product. Don't go to market with the first piece of crap you come up with.\"\n\n\"Good taste lets you tell good products from crap products. If you can predict successful Kickstarters, you have good taste. If you have good taste, you can make good products.\"\n\n\"I am not correct that often. I don't have a formula. It took me 10 years to learn how to tell the difference between good books and bad books. I thought the internet wouldn't work. I thought ebay *might* work.\"\n\n\"Products that would be *missed* are products that work. American Express would be missed. Chase Bank would not be missed.\"\n\n\"When you look at something, do you think that people like yourself like things like this?\"\n\n**Things I agreed with:** Work hard. Build an audience before you go to Kickstarter. Be prepared for the rough spots. Create a good product. Develop good taste. Developing good taste takes a long time. Know that you know very little and admit that you know very little.\n\n**Things I disagreed with:**\n\n\"Build your audience slowly.\" I don't see anything wrong with getting an audience quickly. There's nothing wrong with sudden hype, provided that you've worked hard and created a good product.\n\n\"Get most of your Kickstarter money from your pre-existing audience.\" A pre-existing audience is very beneficial to get things going initially, but you can run Kickstarters for 30 days. Why does it matter if you get funded in 3 days due to a huge pre-existing audience when you could still get funded in 30 days if you have a smaller pre-existing audience? How long does it take to build that pre-existing audience, and could you trade the time you're spending building that audience for a shorter period of time spent doing promotion via Kickstarter?\n\n\"Earn trust, earn respect, don't be perceived as a hustler.\" This makes you feel good but I don't think it's necessary for business. Apple is perceived as this wonderful company. Google, Amazon, other major corporations are thought of the same way. But Microsoft? Oh, they're a bunch of assholes. And yet all these companies are huge, successful, and engage in harmful practices that should be criticized regardless of how much you like their products. I feel the same way about the little guys. There are lots of little guys doing great work and making great money that are PERCEIVED as hustlers but seem to me to be legit. There are lots of guys who are PERCEIVED as authentic but seem to me to be hustlers. Appearances don't matter so much if the product is good.\n\n\"Be part of a community.\" Communities are often full of idiots. Talking to people who want your product is a good thing. I don't think you have to be constantly active, babysitting every idiot who happens to like what you're selling. The people who are constantly involved with the community via forums or social media usually end up incredibly bitter about the whole thing. Look at all the people who have Twitter meltdowns. They're interacting with the community!\n\nI think he has a lot of good points, but there's also that kind of whiny element to it. I really dislike the whole \"You have to *respect* the customers. You have to *engage* with the customers. You should be *grateful* for the customers.\" approach that so many take. I think your job is to create a great product that people love - not to create a personality that people love. I think this whole \"get the customers on your side, rah rah\" kind of talk is ultimately very selfish and egoistic. It's *less* selfish to simply say \"Here's my product. It's great, you'll love it, enjoy it.\" and take yourself out of the picture. It also frees you to be your own person and not worry about what customers think of you, which is very healthy if you want to be a whole person and not just a businessperson.\n\nIt's not that you treat your customers like crap, but you also don't line them up so you can suck their dicks. Because for every sweet load you swallow, there's gonna be a lot more jerks that just want to cum in your eye.","name":"t1_cr7y6vm","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-13 19:38:00","week":20}

I know people usually put however much in checking and pay from there, but I like my system. I'm getting a PhD and I cannot be spending so much time making sure my money is where it needs to be, since every bill is very variable, and I also hardly make any money, and live close to the edge of my balance. My focus needs to be on my research.\n\nI'm therefor switching to a high yield checking (1.59% APY) so all my money can go in there, and I don't have to worry about not having enough in one account over another, or getting my account closed for going over the federal savings transaction limit. But having all that money in one place worries me. Like I said, I hardly make anything, but it would be hard to go without that money if it got stolen. But I don't think it's too much of a risk because I put everything on rewards credit cards and pay them off. So the only place my debit card would get used is at ATMs and on Amazon (to hit the necessary transactions/month to qualify for the high APY by buying myself gift cards). As long as I report my wallet stolen ASAP and make sure my ATMs aren't sketchy, it seems like there's no way I could get my money stolen (my bank has 2 factor auth so hacking is very unlikely).

Early well-child visits are also expensive, we paid a total of about a hundred of copays.\n\n* Diapers about $25/mo (Amazon mom)\n* A year's supply of wipes was about $10/mo\n* Toys are up to you; we still haven't bought many, but people buy them for us.\n* Clothes are also largely discretionary; our nanny went and spent $120 (of our money) on 100 pieces of clothing. That's probably enough for a year if you want it to be. You could also easily spend $1k.\n* Crib, Crib mattress, changing table, dresser, etc. ran us $300, about half new and half used. Be sure to buy a new crib. Rockers, bassinets, Pack-and-plays, etc. were all gifts or loans, but if you had to buy new I'd imagine it'd be another $300 or so.\n* Food. My wife breastfed, so our food expenses through 6 months were nil. Now our kid (1) goes through about $2 of baby food per day, and eats some of our food.\n* Our nanny (35 hours) runs us about $1400/mo (midwest).\n* Two car seats and one stroller so far, total $200.\n* Hidden costs in travel: your hotel requirements change, you may drive when flying is more economical, you may choose to purchase airline club day pass while connecting, you may check luggage that you didn't have to check before, you may have to rent car seats.","name":"t1_cr85v2m","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-13 22:51:11","week":20}

I feel kind of overwhelmed by all the to-do's, but that's half the fun. What is not so fun is simply not knowing how to prioritize everything.\n \nI know having a viable product that people want to buy is #1. I'm in testing right now, waiting on more supplies to come in currently so we can make demos and get market feedback. In the meanwhile, should I put branding &amp; marketing at the top of my list? Finding bulk suppliers to minimize the cost per unit? Looking into FBA since I don't have direct competitors on Amazon? Developing content for the non-existent site so we don't go in bone dry, or is that a waste of time if the worst case scenario pans out and we find there is literally no interest in the product?\n\nI'm a one-person team, so I feel really scattered with this driven-yet-vague focus. I start designing hangtags and labels, then start to wonder about the dimensions of the product, then wind up on the ali sites looking for vendors of the containers I'll need. Find a container I like the look of but isn't quite the right size, refigure the numbers on my product to see how it would alter my cost per unit to raise/lower the amount of product to meet that container.  Remember that my product isn't even finalized yet so those numbers might not even be accurate, feel weird and empty and directionless.\n\nI feel like I'm in quicksand, just slowly sinking into classic wantrepreneur burnout. I really believe in this product though, so I don't want that to happen. What's the best way to prioritize this?

{"id":"cr88owm","author":"IAmDanimal","body":"Some points can be redeemed directly for statement credit at about 1 cent per point, others can get you a gift card (such as Amazon, Target, etc.) at 1 cent per point. The statement credit is a TINY bit better (since then if you spend with your card at Amazon or Target for example, you get another 1% back, whereas if you use a gift card you don't get that 1% back).\n\nA lot of the points/'miles' are better for travel though, since you can find flights that are cheaper in points than they are in real money, and some cards give you a discount in points if you book your travel through them (Chase Ultimate Rewards, for example, gives 25% lower prices if you pay with points when you book through their site). For example, I got a flight that was normally about $123 (if I booked through other sites) for about $98 worth of points. That means each point was worth 1.25 cents.\n\nBasically, if you spend a lot at gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, or Amazon, then a card with higher cash back or points at those places is a better option. If you plan to pay for large purchases (electronics, furniture, etc.) with the card, then a card with a flat 2% back is probably a better option.\n\nMany cards also offer signup bonuses for spending 'x' amount in the first 3 months, for example. These bonuses can be worth more than the extra cash back you would get from a card with a higher cash back percentage, depending on your spending, so sometimes it's worth it to find a card with a great signup bonus and go for that (although you need to be mindful of annual fees eating up the extra cash back you would get, if the cards you're looking at have annual fees).","name":"t1_cr88owm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-14 00:06:53","week":20}

I'm bored, so I started looking around to see what ideas came to me. \n\nI think people like to give and receive gifts but they are also tired of just having random stuff.  So I came up with an idea for a gift set of items that would be very useful to a particular situation. As a soccer mom, i keep a kit of items in my car throughout the season. Many are consumables or things that get lost and replaced frequently. So, wouldn't i love to get a gift basket (except don't give me another cheap - ass basket) full of those items, along with a flask for me, ha ha. I've thought up a few different ideas for gift boxes that would be meaningful and useful, because they contain useful items but also demonstrate that the giver knows you well. They could be displayed nicely in a box instead of another stupid basket -- obviously I've got thing against gift baskets.\n\nI want to do more than just market these boxes locally. I purchased the materials to make 20 just to try it out, and I'm going to have custom boxes with my logo on them. I'd like to go ahead and put them on Amazon and see if I can sell them. But I'm not sure how to categorize them. They certainly aren't groceries or health and beauty baskets.

That said, there are very likely some ways to avoid some complexity of running a micro business. \n\nIf you are selling something look into existing larger company platforms for doing so. Here in the states Amazon provides a platform to sell stuff, advertising (of a sort), payment processing and some tax reporting which means your job is easier. Naturally you pay for this advantage. \n\nAs a student you will have access to some great resources for starting and running a business. Most schools have entrepreneurial classes and/or clubs. Search for them and take advantage of them. If they are only for higher level students sit in anyway if there is any way to do so. I would ask a professor if he can recommend a CPA and/or lawyer for a free initial consult about setting up a business. He'll probably be blown away you are thinking ahead. Even the CPA/Lawyer benefit from these initial introductions - you are just starting out and if you find you trust them they could be doing business with you for decades.\n\nAs for what to sell, I think the key is finding something you know at least a bit about right now. Think about hobbies you have and accessories for them. Think about what you need and can't find locally. Think about what people might trust you to recommend.

Anything that sells on Amazon will sell on eBay, with varying rates of ROI. You're probably basing this off sold listings. Also check active listings. You don't have a lot of competition and the ones that are there are priced way high. You could unload them super fast with your Amazon price. Besides, selling them fast is relative. Enterprise class hardware is just not going to sell fast because typically only businesses will be buying these, and there are way less businesses than average consumers. Id say for purchases don't buy this kind of stuff unless you know the market you're targeting and how long you will sit on them. Don't impulsively jump on a potential profit without first pausing for a second and looking past the dollar signs in your eyes at the bigger picture. Sounds like you found a solution here on reddit, I'm interested to see how many of your interested buyers actually come through. It's much easier to flake out on a purchase here than on eBay or Amazon. \n\nEDIT: sorry if this comes off as lecturing or aggressive.

{"id":"cr8stql","author":"nath_leigh","body":"We can now be fairly certain that these occupations will experience job losses due to autonomous vehicles.\n\n**Taxi and Bus Drivers** - One study found, for example, that an average 2-mile taxi trip in New York City costs $8 to $13, depending on traffic conditions. It estimated that a fleet of 9,000 driverless cars could replace the city’s fleet of Yellow Cabs and operate for an average of 80 cents for a 2-mile trip. A more than 10-fold difference. Order custom taxi's to suit your current needs like 1,2,4,6 seater cars, pickups or vans to optimise fuel use. Choose cars with TV's, game consoles or tables to get work done.\n\n**Truck and Delivery Drivers** - Trucks can travel continuously, no breaks, holidays or sick days, less logistic route or shift planning required, more time on the road. Most people would like items delivered when they are home, companies won’t have to worry about getting staff to work evenings, could have a custom delivery van wait outside which sends an alert to you to collect package, could also combine with Amazon Air. Diners, motels, gas station shops, places that are just businesses along the highway will lose customers as less people driving on highway.\n\n**Car Manufacturers and Car Salesmen** - A car is often a person’s second largest capital expenditure, after a home, yet a car sits unused some 90% of the time. Optimising use of cars will mean less need to be made Columbia University's The Earth Institute forecasts the reduction of United States' fleet of vehicles by a factor of 10. Car usage being optimised will mean less cars will need to be manufactured or sold.\n\n**Mechanics** - following on there being less cars being made then less maintenance work would be needed. Less car repairs are required due to reduced number of crashes and less vehicle modifications due to majority not owning cars.\n\n**Doctors/Surgeons/Lawyers/Insurers** - autonomous cars would be much safer, professions would have less work to do as less injuries to drivers and pedestrians, less insurance claims or injury lawsuits.\n\n**Traffic Cops, Driving Instructors and Parking Wardens** - people are not driving so don’t need to learn, cars will follow the road rules and will not need to park.\n\n**Train and Plane Industry** - may lose some customers as self driving cars can travel faster, Broggi believes that, “speed limits of up to 100 miles/hour (160 km/hour) are absolutely possible by 2040. Think of custom cars with TV's, game consoles or beds in, people will prefer not having to share journeys with other people(crying babies). Would allow people more comfort, ability to recline chair back or more space for leg room.

{"id":"cr900ld","author":"treycook","body":"As a rule of thumb, *only things that you can afford.* Use your credit card as if it were a debit card -- a direct line to your bank account.\n\nThis offers a few advantages:\n\n- If you do \"overdraft,\" you aren't charged with overdraft fees like you would with a traditional checking account / debit card. You just have to pay a bit of interest next month.\n\n- Rewards. Debit cards don't offer rewards, generally speaking. With certain credit cards (you probably won't qualify for any/many rewards cards yet, but will within a few years of conscientious credit building), you can get 1-2% cash back, or some cards do 5% cash back in rotating categories. E.g., Spring is gas stations, Summer is restaurants, Autumn is pumkpin patches (kidding), Winter is Amazon purchases. Basically, so long as you pay your bill in full every month (set up auto-pay), your money is worth 1-5% more. The moment you begin paying interest because you didn't pay in full, you negate these rewards.\n\n- Better buyer protection/convenience. Credit cards offer better protection against fraud, theft, and some are better handled overseas than most debit cards.\n\n**Important note on credit card utilization!**\n\nUtilization factors into your credit score. Generally you want to keep your utilization (the current balance) under 15% of your credit limit. Here's the cool thing -- you can pay your balance before it is due, and that knocks your utilization back down to 0.\n\nSay I have a CC with a limit of $1000 and I've made $150 worth of purchases this month. I'm already at the threshold where my utilization is no longer \"excellent,\" but if I simply go to my account online, I can pay the $150 now and my utilization for the month is back at square one.

{"id":"cr91yqi","author":"nath_leigh","body":"Taken from the website.\n\nWe can be fairly certain that automation technology will be capable of performing many of the jobs in the  Service Industry. We have already seen the rise of automation in retail via the installation of self checkout in shops and its set to increase. \nMany new projects will be in the general merchandise sector, notably in mass merchandisers and certain speciality retail subsegments.\n\nRetail workers are still needed to stack the shelves and help customers but each of these look like they could be done by robots well within 25 years time. Amazon is working on getting items from shelves using robots pickers for their fulfillment centers. How long until the reverse is possible and all the shelf stacking jobs people perform are no longer needed?\n\nRobot hand technology which can be used to interact with human tools is advancing, NASA has been making great strides in development of robotic limbs, they are about 15 years from creating robotic hands that perform as well as humans. \nMoley Robotics says that when the commercial robot chef launches in 2017 users will be able to select one of 2,000 dishes from their phone and the robotic hands in the automated kitchen will make it. The hands to be able to pick up and put down utensils, stir food a pan, and then safely turn a hob to the correct temperature. The robotic chef, complete with a purpose-built kitchen, including an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink How many peoples job require this skill that could soon be replaced for the above mentioned \"chef\" robot which costs just £10,000 (around $15,000)?\n\nFor the upcoming Darpa Robotics challenge in June, robots will have to demonstrate roughly the competence of a two-year-old child, giving them the ability to autonomously carry out simple commands such as “Clear the debris in front of you” or “Close the valve.” Once this is achieved, how long until these 1st generation of Agile Robots are improved and applied to other tasks and zones?\n\nCompliant Robots like Baxter which are safe to work along humans and that even children can program, have just entered the market targeting low and medium end manufacturing. Baxter has a base-price of $25,000 (£19,000), the equivalent of an average US production worker's annual salary. These are the first generation, they will get better software and hardware and lower in price. As they are refined they will be able to be applied to many other future applications and combined with more features such as wheels so they are mobile, robotic hands so they are dexterous, and powerful AI so they can understand their surroundings and work out how to complete various tasks autonomously. They will work 24/7, with no breaks, holidays, sick days, lateness, distractions, strikes or wage rises.\n\nAdvances in AI are allowing more people to be replaced with software e.g. Customer Service Workers and Call centre staff. \"Automated intelligent assistants are already hard at work doing customer support, sales, marketing, retail, healthcare, utilities, education, and hospitality, they are designed to recognize real-world implementations that are the pinnacle of real-time natural language understanding, knowledge management, machine learning, and conversational technologies.\" \"Apple’s Siri and Google Now rely on natural user interfaces to recognise spoken words, interpret their meanings, and act on them accordingly. Moreover, a company called SmartAction now provides call computerisation solutions that use ML technology and advanced speech recognition to improve upon conventional interactive voice response systems, realising cost savings of 60 to 80 percent over an outsourced call center consisting of human labour\"\n\nA recent study by 2 researchers at Oxford found nearly half of U.S. jobs, and 70% of low-skill jobs, could be susceptible to computerization over the next two decades. The study found that occupations within the service industry are highly susceptible, 92% for retail salespeople, 97% for cashiers, 96% for general office clerks, 81% for fast food cooks, 96% for restaurant cooks, 87% for food preparation workers and 94% for wait staff. The study also found that there is a 94% probability of accountants, auditors, paralegals and legal assistants all being replaced by software within 20 years.\n\nIt's not just service jobs, these jobs below have an 80% or higher probability of computerisation in 2 decades time according to the study too. \n\n* Welders, Cutters, Solderers, Brazers.\n* Land Scaping, Painting, Coating, and Decorating Workers.\n* Electrical and Electronics Installers and Repairers.\n* Construction Laborers, Roofers, Plasterers,Floor Sanders and Finishers, Carpet Installers.\n* Cement Masons, Concrete Finishers, Stonemasons, Brickmasons and Blockmasons.\n* Structural Iron and Steel Workers, Jewelers and Precious Stone and Metal Workers.\n* Tailors, Dressmakers, Custom Sewers, Barbers, Butchers and Meat Cutters.\nCarpenters, Glaziers and Home Appliance Repairers were also listed at 72%.\n\nMark Walker - \"Historically, humans have contributed muscle and brains to production but we are now being outcompeted by machinery, in both areas, in many jobs.\nMachines are encroaching in the last area that we have a competitive edge. So, unlike the displacement of labor during the First Great Transformation, there is no untapped category for surplus human labor to migrate to.\nEven supposing new sectors of the economy open up, their demand for human labor is likely to be very weak since these new sectors too will be faced with the question of whether to employ robots or humans.\n\nThe cost advantage will lie with robots for the most part, and so there will be weak demand for human mental labor in the future just as the demand for human muscle dropped precipitously in the past.\"","name":"t1_cr91yqi","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-05-14 19:08:39","week":20}

When I private label it, I send the draft over to them and legal looks at it and changes some wording.  Depending on your product and ingredients, I believe I could help.  I have a list somewhere or terminology that is okay to use and terminology that is not okay to use.

If you are not creating new ingredients, you are able to use claims based on previous approved ingredients.  I am not an expert but from my understanding, that is what most people do.

Similar to the discount you get when shipping items in for FBA.\n\n  I've tried pricing the shipping on items and the lowest is always around $10 which is higher than the shipping credit Amazon seems to give. I'm wondering how it works and how people are able to price MFN items so much lower than FBA listings.\n\n  For example, [this coffee](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDKDM4). Best shipping rate I found is a USPS flat rate box for $11.30 (coast to coast). FedEx is slightly higher and UPS is almost double.\n\n  I have other items that would need to use UPS but the shipping cost would be huge. It would be cheaper to ship it to Amazon and have them reship it through multi-channel. Unfortunately, some items are flagged \"hazardous\" and Amazon won't accept them.\n\n2. How should I package/prep coffee bags to ship? Is dropping a bag or 2 in a flat rate box good enough? I would think they need some kind of protection from heat and moisture. Would poly bags or shrink wrap be good enough? Does there need to be some kind of moisture absorbing packet thrown in?

I am VERY skeptical of anyone below 99% positive feedback.

I wanted something from Amazon that was out of stock, so I threw it on my wishlist to remember to go back for it, but then ended up buying it on eBay from a seller in the UK. The shipping specified something like a month and a half. \n\nI told someone (who sometimes surprises me with wishlist gifts) about the item just because it was cool and I thought they'd like it, too. A few days after, I got an amazon box with a wishlist slip. To avoid the awkward \"hey, so, did you buy me this?\" dialogue, I went to the eBay sale to figure out wtf was going on. A lot of the feedback described the same thing. I went back to the Amazon listing and saw there were only used items available, it was still out of stock (still is actually), and the used/indie seller items were the same price I paid for the eBay auction without the free shipping I received. \n\nI'm guessing this particular seller didn't realize the item was out of stock, but still needed to make good on the sale. At the end of the day it doesn't bother me. I got my item for the price I would have paid anywhere else. \n\nThat said, I wouldn't risk my seller/buyer accounts to cross the two.

Cincinnati, STL, and Chicago aren't too far away so you wouldn't be too far from other bigger cities.

IV is an indicator that details the level of volatility in the underlying - aka how likely it is to move heavily because some sort of catalyst has just occurred or is impending.  Low IV means it's *unlikely* to move very much (in either direction), and thus options are very cheap to buy/sell because more of them are less likely to be profitable for the buyers/sellers.\n\nIV just took a dip because AMZN released earnings a few weeks ago, and the dip was what's known as \"IV Crush\" after earnings, because the run up to earnings always causes IV to spike up hard since earnings have the potential to cause large movements in the price of an underlying, thus the spike in IV.\n\nThe GOOD news is...that IV is super low right now. This is a very good time to BUY (long) either calls or puts, because they're dirt cheap.  Assuming you get the direction of the underlying correct (or it trades sideways, which is pretty likely), then you could later resell those options the next time IV spikes up heavily either due to news, or the run up to next earnings, but even this is still not as simple as it sounds - look up more information on \"volatility expansion\" or \"IV Crush\" and see how other traders play volatility for some ideas in how to set up a profitable trade.","name":"t1_craz0a3","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-05-16 14:53:27","week":20}

{"id":"crb262l","author":"ckfighter2","body":"I don't know if Affiliate marketing counts as ecommerce because I am not holding inventory and handling the transaction myself. I do think there are similar principles in terms of finding a market and a niche and being able to convert the traffic that you send.\n\nI went with Amazon's engine mainly because I wanted to focus specifically on the selling. For me the reason why the initial ideas didn't work is because they had fundamental flaws. I wasn't in any kind of special niche and there was really no reason for anyone to go through my site to buy the product on Amazon let alone find it.\n\nThis lead to me finding the niche that I am working now (items under $20) and it had some hits and misses. Sometimes it would have lots of traffic and great conversions. Other times it would dry up like a desert. \n\nThis lead me to realize that a big part of selling things online is to build a following and have content that can consistently attract consumers that will convert. So that lead me to starting my brand on a YouTube channel where I have one video that is doing well to guide traffic that converts and I have just crossed over 1000 subscribers.\n\nSo for me the main thing that wasn't working out was trying to get a form of consistency. It took a lot of trail and error to figure that out (and I'm only now just getting in a good groove, still a ways to go). The best advice I can give is stay mobile, keep costs down, be able to pivot on a moments notice, and experiment constantly until you find a good groove.","name":"t1_crb262l","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-16 17:10:03","week":20}

{"id":"crb3okn","author":"re_usable","body":"IMO - the best way to learn any new skill or skill set is to reach out to somebody who has done what you are trying to do.  So find a mentor!  \n\nA few things to remember:\n\n1. Don't try to email/call Richard Branson, Tim Ferris, Elon Musk etc.  They will not respond to your emails because A) you're email will never see the light of day in their inbox and B) they are to busy changing the world to help you right now.  Instead try to find a mentor who is 6 months to 2 years down the road from where you currently are - in other words even if you just find somebody that you can talk to who has experience setting up Amazon/Etsy stores and importing products from Alibaba you should consider that a precious relationship and pursue it.\n\n2.  Not trying to be a downer - but you may want to consider first buying and selling a product or service that somebody else makes before you try to sell a product or service that you yourself make.  Less failure points and you can focus on just learning the business side of things first without also worrying about product design and manufacturing (this is a huge challenge).  Doing both product design/manufacturing and biz/dev/marketing/sales for your first business isn't twice as hard -- it's more like 20X as hard or even more.  In other words, try to build your skills piece by piece - this will help your chances of succeeding and will help boost your confidence in your own ability to create and run a business.\n\n3. Go online and read every single article that you can find on how to create successful ecommerce stores, purchase products on Alibaba, run online marketing campaigns, raise money, etc.  This subreddit is a treasure trove of resources that can help you get started on this.\n\n4.  This might be the most important point of them all - because even if you fail to agree with the above points as long as you follow the point below you will at least save yourself from spending all your hard earned money.  The point is:\n\nValidate your product before you buy anything!\n\nWhat do I mean by this?   Well, do two things:\n\n1.  Set up a free website landing page with a picture of your product and some descriptive text, maybe a video of you talking about what you are going to build and demonstrating a prototype of the product that you built out of stuff you have access to right now (or can order just one of for not very much money at all).  Include an email sign up form (set this up through mailchimp) on the free one page website and ask people to sign up if they are interested in purchasing the product once you build it.\n\n2. Post the url for this landing page onto your facebook page, linkedin, this subreddit, and the other startup focused and business focused subreddits, and in a craigslist \"for sale\" post in the appropriate category.  After a week or a month or however long you want to wait go and check to see how many interested people you have that have signed up for your mailing list.  Send out an email to all of your subscribers that includes an image of the product and a few key bullet points about the features/benefits (to remind them if they have forgotten) and ask them to pre-order the product.   Include a link in the email to a paypal account and tell them that you will ship them the product if X # of people purchase the product (you decide what X should be; hint: X needs to be a number such that importing the materials from Alibaba, building the product, setting up a real website, etc, etc is worth it).  If less than X number of people pay for the product you can just refund everybody their money through paypal.  Make sure you tell people that you will do this too that way they know that worst comes to worst they will get their money back.\n\nOf course you don't have to do all this - you can just stop at the newsletter sign up form and make an educated guess that if 100 people are interested some percentage of them will buy.  But the true validation for an idea always comes when you ask somebody to purchase the product/service that the idea represents.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nP.S.  Quora is another amazing resource that I think you would like.  Budget time everyday for self improvement and educating yourself about whatever interests you.  IMO one of the most important traits that any entrepreneur (or any human being for that matter) can poses is curiosity.  Cultivate curiosity in yourself.

{"id":"crb6qfp","author":"SockBaller","body":"I'm long on netflix, so I think it will get to $2k eventually. Not in the next two or three years. Netflix has several advantages over traditional TV networks that make me bullish. However, there are also threats that they face that could derail their ascent to $2k. I'll try to address all of them.\n\n**BULLISH ARGUMENTS**\n\n\n1. No pilot season - Every year a major networks orders an average of 20 shows to pilot, spending $2-$4 million for each of those episodes. Let's just say an average of $3 million is spent (more for dramas, less for comedies). That's total of $60 million spent, not including the dozens of scripts purchased that never get a pilot order. Of those 20 shows, 5-12 will receive a series order. That means each network wastes $15-$45 million dollars  every year on shows that never see the light of day. On Netflix, every show is ordered to series. No money is spent on unused content. \n\n2. Subscription model instead of ad model - Netflix makes all of its money directly from consumers. Ratings only matter when advertisers are trying to set their rates. They pay an ad rate based on the number of eyeballs their commercials are exposed to. Netflix doesn't play that game. They make all of their money directly from the customer, so their only goal is to retain subscribers. I would argue that as long as there is content they want to watch available on the service (whether or not they actually watch it), they'll remain subscribers. Even if they haven't seen exclusive content like Daredevil or House of Cards, they will keep paying the monthly fee to have access to it and watch it someday. \n\n3. Video on Demand - Being able to watch what you want whenever you want it is superior to broadcast. Combine that with an ad-free environment and you're golden. This is what viewers want right now and the number of competitors springing up is proof that the industry is heading in this direction.\n\n\n**BEARISH ARGUMENTS**\n\n1. $10 billion in off balance sheet debts - I've heard this number thrown around a lot. Yes, they have a lot of commitments, but this amount is for content that will be supplied several years into the future. A traditional network like NBC or CBS will spend $2 billion/year on content. (Assumptions: 17 hours of programming/week, 40 weeks of new programming/year, $3 million to produce each hour of content). In comparison $10 billion for several years of content doesn't seem as staggering. Also, you have to factor in Netflix's  deal for Disney content (Pixar, Lucas, Marvel). That was probably an expensive deal.\n\n2. Failure of international subscribers to materialize - A $2k price target assumes most countries in the world will embrace Netflix. In the near future, probably not. In the long term, maybe. Buying Netflix right now depends on how well you foresee them executing their global strategy. If you think they are reaching the upper limit, then it's not a good idea to buy now. If you think Netflix will keep growing to 200 million subscribers in the future, then $600/share is cheap. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. HBO currently has 114 million subscribers, so I think Netflix should be able to get at least that many. Taking into account its lower price point and larger library of content, 200 million subscribers may not be so far fetched.\n\n3. Competition - HBO Go, Hulu, and Amazon are also in the SVOD space, but will they take out Netflix? I'm not so sure they are competitors at all. Traditional networks competed with one another because viewers could only watch one show at a time. Video on demand services don't compete in this way. They only care if you're paying for their service every month. Would paying $9/month for netflix really prevent you from paying $15/month for HBO go? Maybe. But more likely, you're turning to SVOD as an alternative to traditional cable ($100/month). So these SVOD services are cheap in comparison. A viewer could afford multiple services. In the case of a cord cutter, you would want the service that provides the most content that you like. For many viewers, that seems to be Netflix.\n\nThose are my thoughts. I'm long on Netflix, but I'd love to hear arguments against these points. \n\nSources:\nhttp://fightingbroke.com/tv-pilot-orders/\nI also worked in finance for a decade at several major studios/networks.\n","name":"t1_crb6qfp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-05-16 19:43:14","week":20}

{"id":"crbdw2w","author":"illuminerdi","body":"I think you're mistaken. A few things:\n\nFirst I think your usage of short might need some clarification, so I wanted to cover these points. Apologies if you do already know some or all of this, I'm not trying to patronize, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.\n\nWhen you talk about \"shorting\" an underlying, generally you're talking about short selling the equity/stock, in which case you want the price to drop.  You mentioned above that you thought about \"shorting\" AMZN due to the IV being low meaning a jump likely in the future.  If you shorted AMZN stock and it \"jumped\" you would be in a WORLD of hurt, because when you short an equity, you *want* the price to drop further.  If you don't understand how shorting works, I suggest you do a lot more homework before you ever short anything, because shorting is risky and (theoretically) can cost a lot more than longing something, since your losses on a long are always limited to what you paid for the equity (aka 1x the price), whereas your losses on a short are UNLIMITED because a stock could go from $1/share to $5/share in which case you've *lost* **5x** the price of the stock.\n\nNow your post makes it sound like you're talking about shorting (selling) option contracts, which would make sense since this is /r/options; generally speaking, when talking about shorting options, you should also specify whether you're shorting *calls* or *puts*, since you can long calls/puts OR short calls/puts.  So a short PUT would be a bet that the price was going to go up, because you sold a put, the price of AMZN went up, and you made money because the put that you sold was worth less and thus you could buy to close for profit.  Meanwhile if you shorted calls and the price of AMZN went up, you would once again lose money (potentially a lot) because as the price of AMZN increased, the call that you *sold* became worth more, and thus you would be on the hook for that price increase.\n\nNow, as for IV: as far as I know (I admit I could be wrong, but I have not read a single thing otherwise), IV (Implied Volatility) is ONLY relevant to the price of options.  Technically IV is relevant to the price of an equity in the sense that high IV means that an equity has a high *potential* for movement, but that is ALL that it means.  To the best of my (limited) knowledge there is **NO** correlation between high/low IV and a stock's direction, so I would strongly advise against using IV to predict the direction a stock will move in.\n\nIV is not directly tied to the price of a stock - the drop in price is not **why** IV went up.  IV went up because *something happened* (news, earnings, etc) and that *something* caused the stock to go up/down, IV just also went up because as I said, IV is an indicator that a stock is **likely to move more than usual**.  So when stock does move more than usual, of course IV is up, because that's what IV exists for - to quantify the probability that the stock will move, and if it HAS moved then clearly the probability of movement is going to be higher than usual.  At that point one of two things will happen.  IV will remain up because there is still uncertainty as to the future price of the stock, meaning it's likely (but not guaranteed) that it will move more.  It might move back towards where it was (retrace), or it might move *further* in the direction it already moved.  IV does not tell you which, IV just tells you that *more movement is likely*.  This is why IV has such an impact on the price of options: the more likely a move is, the more expensive options become because when movement is likely it means demand for the options is up, and when demand is up, prices are up - that's possibly the most fundamental tenet of the market, as I'm sure you're well aware.\n\nFrankly, from my experience I would strongly caution against using any technicals alone to predict a stock's direction.  You need to learn how to read a chart and how stocks move (Elliot Waves, market psychology, etc) before you can start to even get a basic grasp of how and where a stock is *likely* to move.  Indicators are just \"hints\" that your guess (and it's always a guess, there is no certainty in the market) is right.\n\nLook at it this way: a stock can move up or down, so your base odds are 50% at being right as to the direction of a stock.  Now let's say MACD just crossed over and is diverging, indicating momentum in a particular direction.  Your odds are now more like 51%.  RSI is showing strongly overbought/oversold and aligns with what MACD was showing you, so now you're at something like 52%.\n\nThis does not mean that you should just load up on technicals and trust them to be infallible, they are just guides that you can use to help you determine the likelihood that you're playing the right direction.\n\n**td;dr:** IV doesn't tell you anything about the direction a stock moves, I wouldn't use it as such.  I strongly suggest spending some time with a simulator or paper trading to learn how stocks move, it's a complicated process and you don't want to go throwing money around until you have an idea how it works, unless you like losing money.","name":"t1_crbdw2w","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-05-16 23:53:46","week":20}

I'm in a specific niche w/an affiliate program that's done by the seller of the products directly - that's my main focus. They offer longer term cookies which is helpful. Few people buy on the spot, I think.\n\nBut, I do some amazon myself (same niche) and its like 20-30$ a month in total commish. \n\nAmazon is good in the sense of side-income if you have a highly trafficked site - you just slap it on - then it's just some pocket cash heading your way as you keep chugging along on your main mission. That, and the higher the price tags, the better. So, ideally, it's best with high volume traffic, search engine visibility and high ticket items in order to get decent profit. (At 20/month, I'm not meeting those ideal standards lol). Another nice thing is that if the referral buys anything unrelated, you're credited.\n\nI actually didn't know there was a 24 hour cookie which is kind of disappointing. \n\nI'll agree w/you that Amazon is a very trustworthy place to send them to. I think, though, it's the nature of how your referrals got to it. A more organic approach (getting found on google, as the person has already expressed intent) would be better rather than setting them up for an instant buy - however, that's not something for me to decide - it's up to testing - which is where your experiments come in.","name":"t1_crbp3zu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-17 07:15:39","week":20}

More specifically, I believe the niche you are targeting (drones) is not an impulse purchase, therefore the majority of your visitors aren't going to make a purchase within 24 hours, even if they do find your content compelling.\n\nThis strategy could certainly work, on minimal-risk / lower dollar / less specialty items, especially if vendor's offer Prime shipping. Ultimately, given then 24 hour cookie timeline, I think the only instance in which Amazon affiliate will be profitable are impulse purchases - apps, books, the sub-$10 products that are instantly (or within a day) deliverables.\n\nEven if visitors found your content compelling/useful, by the time they sleep on the purchase and decide to follow through, your affiliate code has expired.","name":"t1_crbqdbj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-17 08:22:54","week":20}

While my other business has LOTS of competition (cycling clothing business), but has a huge market of clients to sell to. I know the money these companies are making based off the sponsorships they are able to do, which gave me a good indication of the profits I can expect at various levels of sales. My guess, 8 million in sales is where I'd be leveling off in a couple of years, but truthfully, I'm not sure that is high enough, it really depends on growth desires.

{"id":"crbtbcj","author":"masudhossain","body":"&gt; Frankly, from my experience I would strongly caution against using any technicals alone to predict a stock's direction. You need to learn how to read a chart and how stocks move (Elliot Waves, market psychology, etc) before you can start to even get a basic grasp of how and where a stock is likely to move. Indicators are just \"hints\" that your guess (and it's always a guess, there is no certainty in the market) is right.\n\nI typically never use indicators as i know they're rubbish and mainly trade off of price action + Fundamental analysis (3 years of forex trading successfully). But the main issue i faced when trading OPTIONS is the fact that my price action isn't very good in the options market (most likely since different people are trading, so different mindsets creating market movements), but i also noticed that most stocks trends are phenomenally easy to determine compared to forex. \n\n\nAs far as fundamental analysis goes, I'm having a tad bit hard time perfecting it for options. I'm a sole believer in using FA+TA to perfect my trading strategies, but it's difficult to tell if a stock is moving purely based off market sentiment (AMZN) or moving based off actually company growth (TEVA). Would you have recommendations for this ? I typically would like to hold my option trades no longer than 30 days. As of right now, i'm doing the TOP-DOWN approach. \n\n\nLastly, the biggest difference between options and forex is the black scholes formula and how much impact IV has on your trades. And i noticed that many times, if the IV is going up, the price of the stock is going down(reason why i want to make this long put trade on AMZN or possibly a strangle). However, when the IV is falling, the price of the stock is usually going UP and if i do a Long Call trade, than the drop in IV will deter my profit gains!! Sure, i can do a credit spread, but I found that limits my profits so much compared to doing a strangle or Long Puts. \n\n\nEDIT: I may be incorrect for some of the things I've said, so please correct me if i am (It's 4am).

{"id":"crbvefr","author":"adaamr","body":"This isn't the right way. There is no right way. \n\nIf I had to pick 1 right way, it's through SEO and organic traffic. \n\nThis way, if people find your website at the top of Google, you don't need to prove you're an authority, because people assume you are one. You're at the top of Google right?\n\nUsing your example on drones. Somebody searches about the best drone, fastest drone bla bla. There you are at the top of Google with your Best Drones of 2015 under $250 etc. They are already interested, more than likely going to read articles and then click through your affiliate link to Amazon or whatever. They more than likely have had exposure to the product, before they even came to your site.\n\nShould you build an email list? Yes. This way people that are interested, and got to your site organically can sign up, and you can bring them back to your site, each time you make a new piece of content.\n\nIf you're going to do affiliate marketing in 2015, you need to be damn good at SEO, and be able to provide useful content on your chosen subject/niche. \n\nThe reason I don't like Amazon is because you can't offer people anything. They click through to Amazon, they may or may not buy. They may move onto another website and click another affiliate link, completely unaware what they are doing. \n\nWith other affiliate marketing programs you can actually give value to your readers. Discount codes and special offers etc. \n\nAmazon is great for Affiliate marketers starting out, as practically everyone can get an account and start right away.\n\nAnother pointer, if you've chosen a good niche, you really shouldn't need to be paying for adverts. With good content and content marketing strategy, other people should want to share your post. This is a pretty important step that people miss.

He borrowed $50k plus from his family, and gave up after 6 mths. He spent around10k on a website, leased a new Trundra, put a lift kit and tires on it. Got more money to move and open a storefront. Then he quit. Then I started my own supplement website with godaddy, for $30 a month. Made a few sales then gave up after a few months. But since then I've bought 100's of domains, made probably over 100 websites. (Taught myself CSS, and figured out SEO) at one point, before I found Wordpress I was pay a web designer to build my sites, but it didn't reallt work out. So I've spent 8 years, and probably over $10k (on domains and Hostings and stuff) I've just did my taxes, and made a little over $8k gross last year (5k profit). This year I've alread made a $10k, about half profit with Adsense (I think that was by April). I figured this out by accident, i would go on keyword planner and find keywords that had higher searches and low competition, then I through together a 10-15 page website. Basically focusing on SEO. I made a lot of theses types of sites, but then realized a site is useless without traffic. I did have success with another site before it was shut down. It was a major brand with deals.com on the end. I put Amazon affiliates ads on it (selling the brand items) I think i didn't make any money for the first few months. Then I made $3 on month, then $25 the next. I was getting excited. Then I made $25 in 5 days, and was shutdown. I found out you can't use someone's elses brand to make money. This site started to appear in searches that related to the brand, that was searched over half a million times a month. This was only like a 10 page site. But back to the other story. So I started to look into paid advertising, and pay for traffic to this site. I believe it had been up for about 2 years. Then I realized that it was paying for itself, and I was getting free traffic. I would pay $5 it would make $5. So I payed more and I would get more traffic. Then I started making a little money from it. But I changed jobs and only worked part time, so I stopped advertising. Then I got on full time and had extra money and started advertising again. This time I was spending a few hundred a month, and would make double or more what I way paying. It would do well for a few weeks then I would really make any for a week or 2 then it would do a little better for a few weeks. I remember I got excited when I made over $100 one Saturday. My biggest day was thanksgiving(my site is food related) I made a little over $400. Then around Easter I think I made $700 in a few days. Then this year I made $3,200 in jan, 2,900 in February, and 3,500 March, and $1,500 in April. It slowed down so I stopped advertising, and I wasn't making as much. Paid like $2000 to make $1,300. I know have a few sites about paracord, and a paracord bracelet store. 2 of the websites come up on the first page, but there's not really money in paracord. I put ads on the sites, and make a few dollars a day from them. I not working on advertising my paracord bracelet store right now, but I'll get a order every month or 2. Side note: I did try kickstarter, and found that you don't get much traffic from them. So you have to do your own advertising. I'm also paying a writer to write articles for different blogs, because I'm not a writer, and I have them post every other day. I haven't made any money yet, and I'm 5 months in. I guess what I'm trying to say, is count on 2 years before you make money from it. Find something that interest you, and there's a market for.","name":"t1_crbzzjb","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-17 17:55:05","week":20}

{"id":"crc0fug","author":"whollyhemp","body":"Yes, buyer fraud is always a possibility (and in my experience, much more prevalent than seller fraud, especially after Amazon conditioned customers to believe that all it takes is their word and they'll receive free stuff), but unfortunately fraud is just another cost of doing business - if PayPal withdrew money from your empty \"intermediary\" account it would just put you into collections and tank your company's credit score, making it impossible to secure lines of credit, sign leases, and so much more. \n\nIf you don't like PayPal's practices, don't use PayPal. Unfortunately they've had a near monopoly on consumer trust when shopping online for years - years of marketing themselves as \"the safer, easier way to pay\" has paid off.\n\nAgain, I'm certainly no PayPal apologist. If you look through my submission history you'll see I've posted some pretty scathing remarks about the company. \n\nBut unless you want to use something with absolutely no consumer protections such as Bitcoin (which due to the *tiny* size of the Bitcoin \"economy\", you'll be lucky to see more than $10 a day in sales), you're stuck with PayPal, Braintree, Authorize, or Stripe, all of which have access to your account and all of which (legally) honor credit card chargebacks.","name":"t1_crc0fug","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-17 18:10:20","week":20}
