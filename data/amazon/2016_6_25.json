{"id":"4owi2l","author":"toilaai939495","body":"Hello. So long story short, I just received a message from a buyer stating that he did not received the item he purchased from me. He bought from me on June 13th, I shipped it out on June 14th and it was delivered to his parcel locker on Friday June 17th. He told me that it was not delivered as schedule, which is not true since the delivery time frame for the transaction is from June 20th to July 4th. Anyway, I sent him a message to check his parcel locker but I doubt it will solve anything.\n\nRight now, I am thinking about waiting for him to open the A-Z claim and see if Amazon will protect me(I purchased the label from their shipping service) However, seeing from this buyer's message, I believe he's trying to pull a quick one. So may I ask for an advice of what to respond the next time he messages me? Any suggestion is appreciated.\n\nUpdate #1: Buyer responded via amazon words(did not dare to contact me directly). However, he actually repeated his previous message, stating that the item did not arrive as schedule(the tracking is showing completely opposite) and requested me to update the status(which I did twice). He also ignored my suggestion about checking his parcel locker in which he mentioned nothing about it. Anyway, I replied to him with the tracking number and tracking link, waiting for his next response. I will keep you guys updated.","name":"t3_4owi2l","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-20 04:34:32","week":25}

{"id":"4p27qg","author":"AXL091","body":"My family is at a financial cross roads and we do not know the best path forward. We feel that if we make the wrong decision, it could lead our family to financial ruin.\n\nWe live in the Dallas Ft Worth area in Texas and housing pricing are rising on a daily basis with any nice house in the $250k range having bidding wars when they go on the market (several major corporations have, and are moving to the area causing a big sellers market).\n\nSeveral of our home owner friends are saying to buy now before it gets worse, however I still get that sinking feeling in my stomach that getting in debt with a $300k mortgage is all a scam and to buy a home now is the worst time. My wife wants stability and a home that is ours.\n\n**In our area, the only way to avoid a bidding war is to:**\n\n- Purchase a more expensive home that may have been sitting on the market longer.\n- Purchase a home with issues that others have passed up, or to build with a housing developer (McHomes with tiny back yards for $270k in a bad location away from highways, or $311k near the highway)\n- Build a McHome in Ft. Worth for $270k in an area that could rise in value (ft worth is growing thanks to Amazon, Facebook, and other companies that are moving there…we have been told...)\n\n**What we would like, however may not be the best for our family:**\n\n- Have 20%+ down payment to not have to pay private mortgage insurance\n- For my work, I design, build and sell physical widgets (lately is 90% sales for my salary job).\n    - It’s a salary position and I can work on my own stuff on the side.\n    - In a perfect world, I would have a 1,000 - 2,500 sq ft insulated workshop (Heat &amp; AC) on a property that we can have all my equipment, materials, and a design/development studio with a house on the property for my family in a good school district or close to good charter schools (Wife, 2 kids, mother).\n- Continue to do great at my salary job, build, and grow my own businesses.\n- Have some chickens on the property for the fresh eggs, etc.\n\n**Family Details:**\n\n- My credit score 800+, Wife: 770+\n- Wife and I are in mid 30s.\n- Me: Salary Job making $125k annual (decent medical insurance but no 401k), Have job security for rest of year, 2017 should be ok for job security, 2018+ all determined on my performance, luck and our industry.\n- $4-10k per year from second jobs, selling stuff online, delivering pizzas on the weekends and afternoon, my own business sales.\n- Wife is out of work and pregnant with our 2nd (due in Jan)\n    - Wife has good prospects in getting a job in the next 2 weeks making $15-$17 an hour without benefits (I don’t see them hiring her full time because of the pregnancy)\n- We have one 3 year old child (no pets)\n- We help take care of my mother financially, she has minimal social security income and no savings (she is retired and not able to work, however is able to help with our child).\n- Debts: Condo with tenant (we currently break even from rent for the mortgage, insurance, property tax, and HOA)\n    - $72k left on mortgage at 8% interest rate (have not been able to refi because the value of it the last few years has been under 75k, it just recently shot up to 120k zestimate and that may not be the actual comp due to all the repairs it may need. refi’s for investment properties are stricter then conventional)\n- Car, 3k left on loan at 1.74% interest\n- No credit card debt\n- Wife has 40k student loan debt that we pay $240 a month on, it’s a useless degree that has not helped her much in getting a job, however it is a degree from an accredited state university.\n- Cash Savings (bank, savings accounts, emergency savings): $67k\n- Retirement (Roths and IRAs): $38k\n    - ***We would like to avoid using $20,000 from our retirement accounts for the house down payment that the government allows for a first time buyer to use without penalty (we have to pay taxes on it and cannot withdraw any earnings)\n    - We don’t see how else to come up with the down payment for a more expensive home, unless we can purchase a home under $250,000 (older smaller home without a workshop).\n\n**The Challenges:**\n\n- My current workshop that I work out of is at one of my co-worker houses.\n- Co-Worker is getting older and frustrated with this setup and wants to move to the country in ft worth or somewhere else in the next few years or sooner.\n- I may need to be more self reliant to build my own personal business and to do my salary job.\n- My mother lives at my co-workers house that we use as our workshop.\n- Finding a house with land and an already built workshop within 20 miles of my co-workers house is proving to be difficult.\n- Found one property with workshop and land for 350k that may work and others for $500k+ that are not possible for us to afford.\n\n**Potential Options:**\n\n1. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,200 sq ft house with a workshop and 1 acre land for $350k\n2. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,000 sq ft house with 1 acre of land for under $270k, may not have a workshop (or maybe a small 500 sq ft one) and would need to build a propper workshop on the property in the future.\n3. Buy a small house with 4 bedrooms 1,800 - 2,200 sq ft of space for under $250 (no land but may be able to use  small garage as as tiny storage/workshop)\n4. Kick out our tenant of 10 years and move into our 2 bedroom 900 sq ft condo (72k left on the mortgage with 8% interest rate, zestimate of 120k, however it needs a lot of work to get it fixed up to sell or rent again). Would be rough to have wife, 2 kids in a small space.\n5. Hope my landlord is open to selling me the 3 bedroom 1,400 sq ft house I am renting for under $225,000\n6. Buy a track home in ft worth for $270,000\n7. Find a property in the Dallas Ft Worth area with enough land to build a workshop in the future around $250,000 and commute to my co-workers house workshop until I can transfer everything over in the future when I can save up to build a workshop. I would potential need to have a long drive to my co-workers house for work.\n8. Keep renting our current 3 bedroom house, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving\n9. move into a less expensive rental property, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving\n10. To be determined!\n\n**Refinancing our Condo:**\n\n- We know we need to do this, we just don’t know when to do it based on what the best path forward is.\n    - If we refi today, if we are going to buy a house, we limit our down payment amount and maybe mess with our credit score (hard credit pulls, less money in bank).\n    - If we refi after we purchase a home, then we may need to wait a bit to afford the refi costs.\n    - The condo breaks even currently with our tenant.\n\n**Potential Tax Benefits:**\n\n- We have a company we formed in 2010 that is on a shelf.\n- If we reinstate that with the IRS or form a new corp, we should be able to deduct a good portion of our mortgage, property and expenses for a workshop.\n- We spoke to a CPA and he confirmed this should be possible.\n\nThank you for reading this wall of text, this has been a great exercise to write out our options.\n\n**TLDR:** Should we buy a house or not in the crazy Dallas FT Worth area?  Baby on the way, never feel like we have enough money, would love to own a 1-2 acre property with a workshop for my job and personal business, however going smaller with less debt may be the better option.","name":"t3_4p27qg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-21 03:47:41","week":25}

{"id":"4p4w3d","author":"its_never_too_SUNE","body":"I've spent a good amount of time going through Wal-Mart SEC filings the past several days. I know you guys don't like reading a wall of serious research so I'll keep it short and sweet. \n\nCompany has plenty of cash and cash equivalents. They have a favorable debt position. Increasing investments in property and equipment. Their cash flow from operations is solid and they don't need to rely on financing cash flows to pay the bills. Solid dividend and they have pretty expansive geographic coverage. \n\nNow here's why I think this is all important. Wal-Mart took a shit a little while back, shareholders lost money and everyone is like oh no muhh cash. Perfect,   they are so cheap right now it isn't even funny. A P/E ratio below 16, compare that to Amazons 560+ P/E. We all know Wal-Mart is not Amazon, obviously, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out they already took a hit from seemingly like they were behind and Amazon is their largest (albeit different) competitor.\n\nWal-Mart is poised to have tremendous gains from the adaptation of smart technology. Increasing use of automation has the potential to streamline their processes and increase their efficiency overall with of course large upfront costs. They are in a position where pursuing this is a necessity, especially with Amazon looming on the corner swinging it's dick at Wal-Mart shareholders. \n\nNow you could argue that Amazons P/E ratio reflects all the benefits from rapid expansion of automation and technology, at this point it seems that Wal-Mart's does not. This is where they are undervalued. \n\nPersonally with upcoming automation and technological improvements I'm seeking out areas that will benefit from this the most given that I'll probably be out of a job in 25 years and nobody can rely on UBI being feasible or implemented. I think Wal-Mart is at a point where it is cheap, and it can really take advantage of automation since it already has expansive distribution and other facilities. The ground work is there and I bet my ass they are moving towards utilizing their current networks and improving them with automation. \n\nPersonally I want a piece of the automation pie. This is just one of many avenues I am taking to get their. Make your own choice, but I'll bet Wal-Mart will be above  $100/share by the end of Q1 next year. \n\nTL;DR: if this wasn't short enough for you, Wal-Mart will be above $100/share in less than a year.","name":"t3_4p4w3d","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-06-21 16:32:42","week":25}

{"id":"4p5pu7","author":"i_cant_do_this_","body":"Hi everyone!\n\nMy first time posting here, and seeking advice on my 3 CC portfolio. A bit about my consumer habits:\n\n23 years old, pays everything in full and on time, decent CC score, not a frequent traveler (so no need for great airplane/hotel benefits), spend large amounts of money in short spurts in a small time frames during the year buying tickets (~1-2k, unpredictable timing based on concert announcement times), eat out decently (40-50% of the time), would love good CB cards (reward points are fine too, but I'm not too familiar with redeeming points for benefits) with no annual fees.\n\nCan you guys give me your thoughts/advice on my 3 CC choices right now? Should I keep them? Which ones should I get rid of? Any new card suggestions to replace the ones I get rid of?\n\n1) Citi MC Double Cash Back (almost 1 year old)- $2.3k limit \n\n2) Wells Fargo Visa Platinum CC (3 years)- $1k limit \n\n3) Wells Fargo American Express Propel 365 (opened this year)- $7k limit\n\nI really like the Double Cash back (no annual fee) so I plan on keeping that one. All my daily expenses right now go on that card, since it's the only card that I take on me when I go to work and stuff. I pay this off monthly in full and on time.\n\nI personally dont like my Platinum card (no annual fee) that much, but it's my oldest card so closing it would be a bad idea. Recently, I lowered its limit to the lowest allowed and have stopped using it completely other than an automated monthly $10 amazon credit reload which I just pay off fully monthly on time also. At the end of the year, I plan on renewing my Amazon Prime with the credits. The sole purpose of this card will be for CC score purposes since it is my oldest card by a long shot.\n\nI would like to have an American Express card ($45 annual fee), but I opened it with my mom when we went to Wells Fargo together. If I could go back, I would have not opened it with Wells Fargo and tried to branch out to another bank or provider. I dont like the idea of having 2 CCs with the same bank. What should I do about this card? Keep it? Switch to an American Express with no annual fees (this one is $45 annual fee, but first year waived)? This is the card I use for big purchases, including my ticket purchases.\n\nI'm not interested in \"churnning\" and would just like to have 3 stable cards. But I'm down to sign up for a card, reaping the benefits/sign up bonuses, then downgrading to a no-annual fee card. The amex card can be a co-brand card or amex issued card, doesn't really matter.\n\nReason for only decent credit score: When I started buying tickets, I was not aware that the utilization ratio was something that affected my score. Stupid, I know. I thought as long as I paid everything off (I even paid them off early), my score would be ok. I was using 70-80% of my credit limit so my score dropped to mid/high 600s. I've learned my lesson and have adjusted accordingly.\n\nI'm all ears!

{"id":"4p6mzg","author":"AXL091","body":"My family is at a financial cross roads and we do not know the best path forward. We feel that if we make the wrong decision, it could lead our family to financial ruin.\n\nWe live in the Dallas Ft Worth area in Texas and housing pricing are rising on a daily basis with any nice house in the $250k range having bidding wars when they go on the market (several major corporations have, and are moving to the area causing a big sellers market).\n\nSeveral of our home owner friends are saying to buy now before it gets worse, however I still get that sinking feeling in my stomach that getting in debt with a $300k mortgage is all a scam and to buy a home now is the worst time. My wife wants stability and a home that is ours.\n\n**In our area, the only way to avoid a bidding war is to:**\n\n- Purchase a more expensive home that may have been sitting on the market longer.\n\n- Purchase a home with issues that others have passed up, or to build with a housing developer (McHomes with tiny back yards for $270k in a bad location away from highways, or $311k near the highway)\n\n- Build a McHome in Ft. Worth for $270k in an area that could rise in value (ft worth is growing thanks to Amazon, Facebook, and other companies that are moving there…we have been told...)\n\n**What we would like, however may not be the best for our family:**\n\n- Have 20%+ down payment to not have to pay private mortgage insurance.\n\n- For my work, I design, build and sell physical widgets (lately is 90% sales for my salary job).\n\n- It’s a salary position and I can work on my own stuff on the side.\n\n- In a perfect world, I would have a 1,000 - 2,500 sq ft insulated workshop (Heat &amp; AC) on a property that we can have all my equipment, materials, and a design/development studio with a house on the property for my family in a good school district or close to good charter schools (Wife, 2 kids, mother).\n\n- Continue to do great at my salary job, build, and grow my own businesses.\n\n- Have some chickens on the property for the fresh eggs, etc.\n\n**Family Details:**\n\n- My credit score 800+, Wife: 770+\n\n- Wife and I are in mid 30s.\n\n- Me: Salary Job making $125k annual (decent medical insurance but no 401k), Have job security for rest of year, 2017 should be ok for job security, 2018+ all determined on my performance, luck and our industry.\n\n- $4-10k per year from second jobs, selling stuff online, delivering pizzas on the weekends and afternoon, my own business sales.\n\n- Wife is starting new job in July (work from home) making $15.50 with benefits and is pregnant with our 2nd (due in Jan).\n\n- We have one 3 year old child (no pets)\n\n- We help take care of my mother financially, she has minimal social security income and no savings (she is retired and not able to work, however is able to help with our child).\n\n- Debts: Condo with tenant (we currently break even from rent for the mortgage, insurance, property tax, and HOA)\n\n- $72k left on mortgage at 8% interest rate (have not been able to refi because the value of it the last few years has been under 75k, it just recently shot up to 120k zestimate and that may not be the actual comp due to all the repairs it may need. refi’s for investment properties are stricter then conventional)\n\n- Car, 3k left on loan at 1.74% interest\n\n- No credit card debt\n\n- Wife has 40k student loan debt that we pay $240 a month on, it’s a useless degree that has not helped her much in getting a job, however it is a degree from an accredited state university.\n\n- Cash Savings (bank, savings accounts, emergency savings): $67k\n\n- Retirement (Roths and IRAs): $38k\n\n- **We would like to avoid using $20,000 from our retirement accounts** for the house down payment that the government allows for a first time buyer to use without penalty (we have to pay taxes on it and cannot withdraw any earnings)\n\n     - We don’t see how else to come up with the down payment for a more expensive home, unless we can purchase a home under $250,000 (older smaller home without a workshop).\n\n**The Challenges:**\n\n- My current workshop that I work out of is at one of my co-worker houses.\n\n- Co-Worker is getting older and frustrated with this setup and wants to move to the country in ft worth or somewhere else in the next few years or sooner.\n\n- I may need to be more self reliant to build my own personal business and to do my salary job.\n\n- My mother lives at my co-workers house that we use as our workshop.\n\n- Finding a house with land and an already built workshop within 20 miles of my co-workers house is proving to be difficult.\n\n- Found one property with workshop and land for 350k that may work and others for $500k+ that are not possible for us to afford.\n\n**Potential Options:**\n\n1. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,200 sq ft house with a workshop and 1 acre land for $350k.\n\n2. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,000 sq ft house with 1 acre of land for under $270k, may not have a workshop (or maybe a small 500 sq ft one) and would need to build a propper workshop on the property in the future.\n\n3. Buy a small house with 4 bedrooms 1,800 - 2,200 sq ft of space for under $250 (no land but may be able to use small garage as as tiny storage/workshop).\n\n4. Kick out our tenant of 10 years and move into our 2 bedroom 900 sq ft condo (72k left on the mortgage with 8% interest rate, zestimate of 120k, however it needs a lot of work to get it fixed up to sell or rent again). Would be rough to have wife, 2 kids in a small space.\n\n5. Hope my landlord is open to selling me the 3 bedroom 1,400 sq ft house I am renting for under $225,000.\n\n6. Buy a track home in ft worth for $270,000\n\n7. Find a property in the Dallas Ft Worth area with enough land to build a workshop in the future around $250,000 and commute to my co-workers house workshop until I can transfer everything over in the future when I can save up to build a workshop. I could potentially have a long drive to my co-workers house for work.\n\n8. Keep renting our current 3 bedroom house, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving.\n\n9. Move into a less expensive rental property, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving.\n\n10. To be determined!\n\n**Refinancing our Condo:**\n\n- We know we need to do this, we just don’t know when to do it based on what the best path forward is.\n\n- If we refi today, if we are going to buy a house, we limit our down payment amount and maybe mess with our credit score (hard credit pulls, less money in bank).\n\n- If we refi after we purchase a home, then we may need to wait a bit to afford the refi costs.\n\n- The condo breaks even currently with our tenant.\n\n**Potential Tax Benefits:**\n\n- We have a company we formed in 2010 that is on a shelf.\n\n- If we reinstate that with the IRS or form a new corp, we should be able to deduct a good portion of our mortgage, property and expenses for a workshop.\n\n- IRS allows up to 10k in deductions for Farms per year.\n\n- We spoke to a CPA and he confirmed this should be possible.\n\n\nThank you for reading this wall of text, this has been a great exercise to write out our options.\n\n\n**TLDR:** \nShould we buy a house or not in the crazy Dallas FT Worth area? Baby on the way, never feel like we have enough money, would love to own a 1-2 acre property with a workshop for my job and personal business, however going smaller with less debt may be the better option.","name":"t3_4p6mzg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-21 22:03:47","week":25}

{"id":"4p6zj0","author":"rskenshin","body":"Hey all, just wanted to share my experience for the past 9 months of churning and my first major redemption. [Here is a picture of all the cards that I applied for.](Https://imgur.com/a/BgSSY) thanks to this community for helping me learn the basics and nuances of churning. A bit of background info – 23 years old, graduated 2 years ago, and have been working full time (only time with income necessary to get approved) for about 2 years now. I discovered this sub about a year ago through r/personalfinance and spent 3 months lurking before deciding to get into the game. I really was only interested in cash back at the beginning but saw that the mileage bonuses were more lucrative and changed my approach soon afterwards. I have a small side business which allowed me to reach minimum spend easily so I did not have to MS much.\n\n**Cards signed up for:**\n\n1. 09/2014 - BOA Cash Rewards ($100) – First credit card signed up for. Had a blank credit history except being an AU on my parent’s card.\n\n2. 05/2015 – Fidelity Investment Rewards (No bonus) – Wanted a 2% CB card and this complemented my investment &amp; 401K account. Last card before discovering r/churning.\n\n3. 09/2015 – Discover IT ($50 x 2) – Jumped in the Apple Pay promotion hype. Was able to spend about $4K that was included in the promotion through it. This is the only card I tried MS via VGC but didn’t get past Discover except for the first courtesy credit.\n\n4. 11/2015 – Chase Sapphire Preferred (50K + 5K AU) – Applied as soon as the bonus was raised from 40K to 50K. This is my everyday spend card with the freedom when I am not meeting minimum spend.\n\n5. 11/2015 – Chase Freedom (15K + 2.5K AU) – Applied same time as CSP\n\n6. 11/2015 – AMEX Delta Gold (50K)\n\n7. 12/2015 – BBVA NBA ($200) – Big NBA (Celtics) fan. Sadly, that factored in my decision to get this.\n\n8. 01/2016 – Chase United MPE (50K + 5K AU)\n\n9. 01/2016 – Citi AA Platinum (50K) – Loophole was shut down by the time I got the world elite card so I was not able to get this bonus more than once.\n\n10. 01/2016 – AMEX Premier Rewards Gold (50K + $100 x 2 credit) – IMO, one of the most lucrative sign-up bonuses available. $200 through the MPE app for Amazon GC and 50K MR for a waived annual fee is amazing. Also a very good every day spend card.\n\n11. 03/2016 – Amex SPG Personal (35K) – Applied as soon as the bonus was raised from 25K to 35K\n\n12. 03/2016 – Amex SPG Business (35K) – Applied same time as personal card\n\n13. 05/2016 – Amex Platinum Mercedes-Benz (75K + $200 x 2 credit) – I usually check this subreddit at least once a day and somehow missed the 100K offer for the regular plat by about 2 hours. Applied for the MB version as a consolation.\n\n14. 06/2016 – BOA Alaska MileagePlan (30K + $100 statement credit)\n\n\n**I also signed up for the following bank bonuses:**\n\n1. Discover Checking ($300) and Savings ($100)\n\n2. Citigold (50K AA miles) – I still haven’t received my miles even though they were supposed to be posted by 5/29/16 which was confirmed through chat. Contacted them a few times. Just a headache dealing with Shitibank and this isn’t worth the effort I‘m currently putting into it.\n\n3. TD Bank Premier Checking ($300) – Just signed up last week\n\n**Total from bonuses only (includes future bonuses such as doubling of Discover IT signup bonus):**\n\n$1100 Cash  \n\n\n$600 Amazon GC via MPX App\n\n\n72,500 UR \n\n\n50,000 Delta Skymiles\n\n\n55,000 United\n\n\n100,000 Aadvantage \n\n\n125,000 MR \n\n\n70,000 SPG \n\n\n30,000 Alaskan \n\n**Fees paid:**\n\n$475 Amex Platinum MB\n\n\n$75 BOA Alaska (offset by $100 statement credit)\n\n\n$30 (so far…) Citigold Checking\n\n**First major redemption:**\n\nI had been planning to book my family a trip to Hawaii and was trying to no avail to find 25K RT via Delta through Korean Airlines. I came across a post for a 1 day sale through United for 17.5K one way and decided to jump on it. I probably did not use the best means necessary for the following redemption but finding availability in a tourist area during high season was difficult. With that said, I was able to book the following vacation over the 4th of July on just points for my mother, father, and sister. I referred my mother for the CSP and she transferred me all her points which helped with this redemption. I plan to use my remaining points to hopefully travel to Europe and Asia sometime in the future with friends.\n\n1. BOS &gt; HNL (stop in SFO): 17.5K x 3 = 52,500 United miles\n\n2. 5 nights at the Royal Hawaiian: 25K a night with the 5th night free through Starwood = 100K SPG. Had some referral bonuses and bought 7K SPG to reach 100K.\n\n3. HNL &gt; OGG: 7.5K x 3 = 22,500 Delta miles (Hawaiian Airlines)\n\n4. 3 nights at Hyatt Regency Maui: 60K Hyatt\n\n5. OGG &gt; BOS (stop in SFO) – 17.5K x 3 = 52,500 United miles\n\n6. Rentals cars were paid for in cash by them.\n\n**Totals:**\n\n105K United (55K from Chase United MPE filled in with Chase UR)\n\n\n100K SPG (Amex SPG Biz &amp; Personal)\n\n\n60K Hyatt (From Chase UR)\n\n\n22.5K Delta (Amex Delta Gold)\n\n \nThanks for taking the time to read this post and thanks again to this wonderful community for helping everyone in their churning goals!\n","name":"t3_4p6zj0","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-21 23:12:20","week":25}

Frost also has a few branches here albeit slightly far (25-30 min away). Chase &amp; Bank of America is over 40 minutes away from me, and I'd prefer a branch within walking distance. \n\nIf your curious about my experiences with USAA, read below:\n\nI recently had an issue where my USAA Platinum Visa and Debit Card would decline things constantly. Amazon, WallMart, Petsmart, HEB, Kroger, Macy's, and even UPS. It was embarrassing, and to make it worse the department I needed to speak to is not 24/7 instead it's (7:30am to 8pm). Midnight preorder for new game and it's declined? Better ask a friend to use there CC.....\n\nIn the end I got new plastics from USAA to replace the old cards as one of the Reps recommended, and the issue is still the same, \"Address mismatch and declined due to address being not the same\". \nEven though I copied and pasted the address from my USAA profile to Amazon and the other merchants. Same billing and shipping address, been living here for over ten yeas. Same story, they would say to check with the fraud department to view the backend, fraud department would say it's nothing on the backend, and would pre-auth amazon or other places and it would still decline, so I'd get transferred back and forth and told to retry again...\n\nIt got so bad that I started just transferring money via USAA Transfer to family members so they could buy me things.\n\nFinally I had enough and applied for other credit cards (Barclaycard Ring and American Express Blue) and have decided to move my banking away from USAA.\n\nI expect to keep a $2k balance temporarily, but typically it's less (about $1600 on average). Free cashiers checks and money orders would be neat as then if I'm unable to get to a branch to deposit cash I could do it elsewhere (really only 5 times a year when selling phone or anything on craigslist). \n\n**All in all I'm just looking at my options for banking, and please don't recommend Ally, or any online bank, had enough of Online banks/FCUs.** \n\n[Screenshots of a few declines around the time I started noticing it happen (Q3 2015 to present).](http://imgur.com/a/jpubr)\n\nCredit Score is 727, went down a bit after the hard queries at Amex and Barclay, but it should be good enough for any bank I assume.","name":"t3_4p8cyg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-22 04:14:03","week":25}

{"id":"4parbi","author":"30yroldheart","body":"Here's the scoop. I have a full-time, reliable job. I've acquired credit card debt over the past three years and I'm looking to pay it down and start putting more money away in my savings and health savings account. I have recently begun to cut all unnecessary expenses (including a $300-$400/month membership to a private club, new clothes, Amazon purchases, etc). My current credit score is 622... not good.\n\n\n**Monthly net income: $3,100**\n\n\n**Current debt:**\n\n\n$10,279.28 debt consolidation loan (13.990% interest rate). I owe $447.10/month ($315.35 towards principal, and $131.75 towards interest). I consolidated debt about 1.5 years ago from three different credit cards. I have paid off about $8,000 towards the principal to date.\n\n\n$4,830 Visa credit card through my bank (14.23% interest rate)\n\n\n$502 Premier Rewards Gold Card via Amex (no interest rate... I pay this charge card off every month)\n\n\n**Monthly Expenses:**\n\n\n$96 phone bill\n\n\n$700 rent\n\n\n$92 auto insurance\n\n\n$75 gas and electric\n\n\n$600 monthly spending (groceries, gas, entertainment, dining out, etc)\n\n\n**Starting July 2016 I will be paying the below amounts towards my debt** \n\n\n$500 or less/month towards Amex card (I never allow myself to spend more than $500/month so I can pay it off)\n\n\n$400 towards Visa credit card\n\n\n$500 towards debt consolidation loan\n\n\n$100 for Savings Account (currently, I have about $500 in there now... pitiful, I know)\n\n\n**Potential expenses coming down the pike for me:**\n\n\nMy car needs some work done. Right now, it's worth $1,000-$1,500. I'm willing to put some money into my car because I really don't want to have to get a new (used) one. I don't have a car payment at the moment and I'd like to keep it that way so I can focus on paying down my other debt.\n\n\n**Medical bills** I recently had a heart attack and was in the hospital for 2.5 days. I haven't received my bill yet but I'm thinking that I will owe around $1,200 after insurance. I will continue to have bi-monthly medical appointments for the next 12 months. Additionally, I spend $18-$25/month for medications. My HSA will be depleted after this. I had saved $1,300 over four years so I will need to build that back up again. I haven't factored that into above yet, however.\n\n\nOne other upcoming change to my income... starting with my July 2016 paycheck, I will likely receive a small bump to the tune of $100 extra/month for performance and cost of living. This would bring my net income to about $3,200. If that's the case, where should I direct that extra $100?\n\n\nSo what do you all think? Am I on a good path? What would you change? Thank you in advance for your advice and guidance. I'm committed to paying down this debt and eventually, getting rid of it. I'm embarrassed that I let it get to this point and I want to make this right and get my credit score back up.","name":"t3_4parbi","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-22 15:55:15","week":25}

She has carried a balance on it with 75% utilization for two years or so now because she had emergency surgery followed by a leukemia diagnosis... Now back surgery. She hasn't really worked much.\n\nShe's got a Cap one with a $2,500 limit and a Barclaycard Apple VISA with a $9,700 limit. All of her credit scores are 790+. (Pretty good for a disabled and sick woman with restricted income, I know!!)\n\nTo make a long story short, we don't shop with Best Buy anymore. I had an awful experience there as an employee, so we don't do business with them anymore. \n\nThat, plus the 29.99% APR is brutal. She is paying the card off come August, as she gets a lump payment around then... And should *hopefully* finally have the health nightmares over with and get back to working.\n\nWe don't know if we should cancel the card and then get something like an Amazon.com card, an AMEX of some variety, or another Barclaycard product called Ring with an 8% APR to replace it, as we have started buying electronics/movies/etc from Amazon instead of Best Buy.\n\nHowever, I'm afraid for her to close it because she's had it since 2011 and I don't want her score to take a huge hit. But, I don't know if the hit would be bigger on her closing it at request or Citi closing it from dormancy.\n\nAs far as her other accounts go, she's had that Barclaycard Apple VISA since 2013, Cap One since 2002, and she has about 10 other various auto loans/revolving store accounts/mortgages/etc on her credit history between 2000-2016.\n\nThanks for the input. :)","name":"t3_4peuak","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-23 05:58:51","week":25}

{"id":"4pglt8","author":"StockJock-e","body":" Home Depot — Nomura upgraded the home improvement retailer's stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral,\" saying the company is gaining market share and competitive advantages, as well as benefiting from an improving overall market.\n\nBlackBerry — BlackBerry posted a breakeven quarter, compared to consensus estimates of an eight cents per share loss, but revenue was well below forecasts. The company did give a full-year forecast that calls for a loss of 15 cents per share, smaller than consensus, and said it is on track for 30 percent growth in software and services.\n\nAccenture — The consulting firm matched estimates with earnings of $1.41 per share for its third quarter, with revenue exceeding Street forecasts. It also raised its full-year earnings forecast, as margins expand and new bookings grow.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals — The drugmaker's stock was cut to \"neutral\" from \"overweight\" at JPMorgan Chase, which cites ongoing core product challenges.\n\nBoeing — Morgan Stanley began coverage on Boeing with an \"overweight\" rating, citing significant margin expansion opportunity, as well as the stock's recent underperformance. Separately, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said demand for passenger jets is getting stronger, telling French newspaper Le Figaro that there will be demand for 38,000 new jets over the next 20 years.\n\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond — The retailer reported quarterly profit of 80 cents per share, six cents a share below estimates. Revenue also missed the mark as comparable store sales fell by 0.5 percent during the quarter. However, the company did affirm its prior profit outlook for the full year.\n\nIntuit — Goldman Sachs added the financial software maker to its \"Conviction Buy\" list, saying Intuit is doing a better job of retaining customers and due to increased confidence in subscriber growth for the company's QuickBooks Online service.\n\nTwilio — Twilio will begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange after pricing its initial public offering at $15 per share, above the expected range of $12 to $13 per share. The company is a provider of tools for app developers.\n\nRed Hat — Red Hat earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, matching Street estimates, with revenue also above forecasts. However, the distributor of Linux software gave a weaker-than-expected current-quarter outlook due to costs related to its newly announced acquisition of software provider 3scale. Red Hat also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.\n\nBarnes &amp; Noble — Barnes &amp; Noble said sales at existing stores should be flat to up one percent for the current fiscal year, as the bookstore operator moves to increase customer traffic. That's a better outlook than some analysts had been expecting.\n\nBank of America — The bank is near a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case involving the safeguarding of client accounts, according to The Wall Street Journal. The paper said the settlement is expected to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland — RBS has gotten a number of bids for its Greek shipping finance business, according to Reuters, in a possible sale that could be worth up to $3 billion.\n\nViacom — Ousted directors can remain on the board for now, according to a Delaware court judge's decision, until a final determination is made on controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone's mental competence. Redstone moved to replace five directors last week and his National Amusements petitioned the court to affirm the move, but those directors filed suit to invalidate the dismissals.\n\nGeneral Electric – GE reached an agreement to sell its French consumer credit unit, GE Money Bank, to private-equity firm Cerberus, pending approval by regulators.\n\nAmazon.com — Amazon was fined $130,000 by the Federal Aviation Administration for allegedly mishandling shipments of dangerous chemicals. \n\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/23/early-movers-hd-bbry-bbby-rht-twlo-ge-vrx-more.html","name":"t3_4pglt8","subreddit":"StockMarket","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjuv","created_utc":"2016-06-23 14:59:33","week":25}

{"id":"4pk70f","author":"uxdr_entrepreneur","body":"After being a reddit lurker for a while, I’ve finally got up and want to give something back! In this post I want to share with you tips, tools, and a process that I will use to build my second startup with a budget of only $600 while traveling the world, pulling from lessons I learned from my first startup (which is still alive &amp; well!). I know that there are a ton of people out there who want to leave their 9-5 jobs, see the world, and build something that supports their life and their future, so I wanted to spread the love.\n\nI plan to be as transparent as possible and update you guys throughout the process!\n\n(Read time = 10-15 minutes)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst, the quick story: \n&gt;I started a location independent startup last year, and hit $300K sales in 1 year. During the last year, I’ve been able to travel the world while doing this, from Hawaii, to New York, to London, through Europe, and now I’m traveling in Asia with my business partner and a full-time contractor, who both joined 2 months ago. We work with freelancers and customers (startup to Fortune 500) around the world: U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, Bulgaria, Ukraine, India, Philippines, Vietnam, and Australia. Our dream is to continue to build a remote culture, and inspire as many people as possible to do the same or come join us.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Proof:**\n[Images from the last year](http://imgur.com/a/2G2Lr)\n\n(If you guys want any more proof, my LinkedIn, for example, just ask and I’ll share. Reddit seems to flag down some urls as spam).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore I dove into this world, the whole idea of \"start a business\" alone was intimidating to me. It NEVER crossed my mind that there was ALSO a possibility to do this from anywhere in the world. How could I start a business? I didn’t even go to business school! Don’t I need a once-in-a-lifetime idea that will change the world? What if I fail? What about my friends and family? Will I get lonely? What if I run out of money? What I eventually realized is that these are all just FEARS - little tricks your mind plays on you so you stay in a safe, secure place. In reality, there’s no way to discover the answer to these questions until you try it yourself and go all in. For me, to discover this (it took a LONG time), it was about taking baby steps, setting daily and weekly goals that I could accomplish and be proud of, learning something new every day on my own, and connecting with people that could help me grow. \n\nAnd with that, let’s get started, one step at a time.\n\nFirst, we’ll cover starting the business, which needs to be generating some income before you can become a globetrotter. Then we’ll cover some of the basics of remote working and traveling (I wanted to cover remote working and remote company culture in-depth, but the post got too long. Please let me know if you guys are interested and I can add that to /r/entreprener !). The advice will focus on LOW BUDGET solutions. In my humble opinion, you will be surprised to find out how many places there are in the world that are way more awesome AND cheaper than where you are now.\n\n**What We Need:**\n\n\n1. Discover the right business idea\n\n2. Create a simple business plan\n\n3. Web presence (website or profile)\n\n4. Market &amp; Sell!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Costs**\n\nSince this isn’t the complete $0 startup plan, I’ve included some of my top picks that made my life much much easier over their free alternatives, all for under $600\n\nDomain: FREE with Siteground hosting\n\nHosting: Siteground - $3 / month. Exit halfway through purchase for discount offer.\n\nWordPress theme: $15\n\nWebsite Set-up: UpWork.com developer - $300\n\nDesigns: Fiverr or UpWork - $100\n\nImagery: iStock - $20\n\nAmazon Mechanical Turk: $25\n\nBetaList: $99\n\n*Total: $562*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Steps:**\n\n\n**1. DISCOVERING THE RIGHT BUSINESS IDEA**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOkay so I lied, you don’t even really need a business idea (at least to start out)! I think it’s easier to pick up a new skill or leverage an existing one, and start selling your services. You’ll discover your business idea as you learn about gaps in the market (skip ahead 3 paragraphs if you want to jump into discovering the business idea). So as it turns out, there are tens of thousands of people willing to pay for a beginner to help build their businesses on freelance sites like UpWork.com. \n\nFirst, you’ll need to learn the basics of a new skill. Are you creative? Try visual design, user experience design, or marketing. Are you logical? Try programming. Are you organized? Try administration or project management. \n\nPlaces to learn your skill, for free:\n\n-Coursera.com course content is free, and you can pay for certifications\n\n-Alison.com free courses\n\n-Google search “learn &lt;skill&gt; online free”\n\n-Khan Academy\n\nAfter you pick up the basics, create a profile on UpWork.com, search for people posting work with your skill, filter by clients looking for entry-level freelancers, and apply! Don’t give up, it might take a week or two to land your first contract. Also consider having a friend or family member hire you for the first short job so you can get a rating on your profile! *As you work and learn, keep your eye out for common problems or interesting opportunities on the internet, as you can turn them into business ideas.*\n\n1.1 THE BUSINESS IDEA\n\nA good business idea is something that people need, are willing to pay for, and will generate a profit. If you don’t have a business idea, head over to the [Business Idea Generator](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3253-business-idea-generator.html), which has suggestions based on your personal style. You could also build a business out of a skill you learned, such as Amy’sWebDesign.com. Since we do have a startup business idea that we will be implementing over the next month, I’ll use that to guide the discussion.\n\nSo the business idea we’ve chosen is to “Create hand curated email newsletters sent directly to your subscribers.” With a quick search on Google, we find that there are a ton of automated email marketing tools, and there are a ton of content curation tools, but there is no tool that does both the custom content curation and sends out the email newsletters, freeing up the business owner completely from having to manage email newsletters.\n\n1.2 THE SIMPLE BUSINESS PLAN\n\nAlright so let’s head over to the [Lean Business Canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/) so we can put together a quick business plan to later test to see if people need it. Create a free account. We’ll fill out some of the basics. The problem we are solving is that entrepreneurs and small business owners don’t have the time to search for great content on the web, build out a custom newsletter each week, send it out, and ensure that subscribers find the newsletter useful and interesting. We’ll solve that problem by hand selecting top content weekly for each industry, such as Health &amp; Wellness, or Growth Hacking, automatically build a newsletter, and schedule it to send. We’ll also want a way for people to be able to log in and change / approve newsletters themselves, as we will likely need to win their trust.\n\nAlso let’s create a Google Doc to list out all of the login usernames and passwords we are about to create over the next few weeks! (You’ll definitely thank me later).\n\n1.3 TEST THE IDEA\n\nTime to go recruit mom, friends, acquaintances, etc, to see what they think about the business idea. There’s also sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where we can send surveys built with Google Forms to hundreds of people for as little as $.05 / each. \n\nLet’s refine the value proposition until people can understand it within 30 seconds. It’s essential to ask them if they will use the product or service, AND how much they would be willing to pay for it. Also it’s important to ask questions that will help fill out more of the Lean Business Canvas.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**2. THE ACTUAL BUSINESS PLAN**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet’s go through these 20 questions from [Entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241122) that we should be able to answer at a basic level in order to validate the startup idea. Then it’s time to revisit the Lean Business Canvas from 1.2 above to expand the details and make updates. \n\nIf you are confident this is the business idea you want to build your startup with, continue reading. Otherwise, revise until you are ready to move forward.\n\n2.1 BRANDING\n\nDespite what you might think, defining a brand early on will help with many business decisions moving forward, as well as prevent numerous issues down the road. Building the brand identity involves defining customer values, business values related to customers, and the company presence that will affect customer trust and willingness to make a purchase. A brand is also how customers will remember a company in the future. If people like the brand and product, they will refer it to others.\n\nUsing the free version of Frontify.com, it’s easy to build some simple brand guidelines. What feelings do you want potential customers to feel when they arrive on your website? What values do you want to portray to people? Once these values are defined, then choose brand colors, a logo, typography, a company name, and even the type of content you want to provide to people. \n\nOne VERY important thing to do while choosing a company name is to make sure that the domain name is available. Let’s go to GoDaddy.com and play around with names. We tried variations of “EmailCurator.com” and “ContentCurator.com”, until we finally stumbled across a cheap, available domain name: [ContentCurator.co](http://www.contentcurator.co/)\n\nOne thing worth considering is that if you can come up with a memorable logo, or catchy tagline, it is more likely to stick. This can be a warm and welcoming mascot, an attractive arrangement of shapes, or a tagline that brings out emotions when people read it. For example, we will use “Did you get CCed yet?” for our tagline because it’s relatable to a common phrase, to email, and to our brand abbreviation (ContentCurator = CC). This creates various anchors for people to remember the company in the future.\n\n-Google Search: “Psychology of Color”. Read.\n\n-Brand Color Picker at paletton.com - pick one color, it gives you related colors\n\n-Free logo design service at Logodust.com\n\n-[Advice on choosing fonts](https://designschool.canva.com/font-design/)\n\n-Free Google Fonts\n\nThe branding phase definitely VERY important, but also not something to stress about or over think. Your brand will be further refined or expanded as you get to know your customers more!\n\nYou would be surprised how helpful your friends, family, colleagues, or girlfriend/boyfriend will be in this creative process. Bring up your company ideas in a casual dinner conversation or even directly ask for help. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**3.0 WEB PRESENCE (website or profile)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEverything up to this point was basically free. We will start to accrue costs for setting up the actual website. And since we don’t want to build a full blown, expensive SaaS web application right off the bat, we will launch a “beta launch” site first. This allows us to market our startup idea and attract people to sign up for free so we can gauge interest. If you want to offer a service, you can skip building a website altogether to start generating sales right away; just go create an account on UpWork.com or other freelance website and start selling your services!\n\n3.1 BACK-END STUFF\n\nThere was one thing we wanted to make sure of before spending money. And that was to ensure we could focus on the content curation, and not have to build another email builder / sender tool. So we reached out to various email management tools, such as Publicate.it and Goodbits.io to see what would be the best solution for building and sending emails. In the process of speaking with the founders of these companies about their tools and how they might fit, we were lucky enough to strike up a partnership with Goodbits! Never be afraid to ask!\n\n3.2 BUILDING THE BETA LAUNCH REFERRAL PROGRAM\n\nFor ContentCurator.co, we are setting up a landing page to encourage people to sign up. Once signed up, we direct people to a referral page where they earn extra rewards. To do this effectively, we made use of free code available on GitHub and hired a dev team. \n\nWe decided to use the domain services at GoDaddy for $12/year, as well as Webflow’s hosting services for $15/mo. However, if you want to build a WordPress website, the SiteGround plan I mentioned in the “Costs” section is best. To build the landing page and referral program using the code on Github, we’ll go to UpWork.com and hire a development team at $12 / hour to do around 25 hours of work, or $300 total.\n\nSide note: Another alternative is to set up a landing page that accepts payments before actually launching your service! This is also easy to do. To learn how, check out how [Ryan Kelly did it](http://pearanalytics.com/blog/2010/how-i-set-up-and-sold-a-product-using-unbounce-wufoo-and-chargify/)\n\n3.3 DESIGN\n\nWhile we wait for proposals from development teams on UpWork, we need to design our landing page and referral rewards page so the dev team knows what to build! At a minimum, we’ll write out text copy that goes on the landing page, while hiring a designer on Fiverr or UpWork to design what the page will look like. We want a quality banner photograph, so we’ll purchase a couple “non-stocky” photos from iStock ([ironically, this can be done!](http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=1594#.V2FCz-Z950s)). Then we’ll post a job, invite designers, and choose one with a design style similar to what we need for the brand.\n\nOnce the designs are ready, and we’ve hired a dev team, it’s important to stay involved throughout the time the development team is building the website. Ask for multiple updates throughout the day and provide feedback to the dev team.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**4.0 MARKET AND SELL**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s important to prepare for launch as the beta launch website is being prepared. This can involve reaching out to potential partners, reaching out to bloggers and magazines, creating a media kit, creating social media profiles, and more. \n\nWe want to keep our initial plan simple: Attract, Capture, Convert. This will change and become more complex overtime, just as the first business model did. \n\n4.1 ATTRACT\n\nThere are several places where you can submit your startup to, but we’ve come to appreciate what the guys at Betalist.com do. They seem to be the go to in beta launches, and this will be the perfect platform to (hopefully) start to attract interested people to subscribe. It’s $99 to get featured, but well worth it with the amount of coverage you could potentially receive. \n\nStartuplister.com is another option, but we will not be using this until we have our actual beta SaaS application  running smoothly.\n\nWe’ve will also create a hit list of blogs and journalists to start reaching out to and ranked them based on authority, number of followers etc. We won’t reach out to all of them, but a few that we think might be interested in our service or could be useful for them. \n\n4.2 CAPTURE\n\nAs we attract subscribers, we want to make sure we can capture them. \n\nMailchimp is a simple, free and easy to use email service. When first starting, Mailchimp offers great solutions and an easy to use interface. You can segment users into different lists, depending on what lead mechanism or trigger they download, or just have a general subscription list.\n\nOn your website you will want some sort of tool to capture email addresses or subscribers before they abandon your website forever. We will use Gleam.io to go with our custom built code, which then feeds into our Mailchimp account. Once people are in the system we can automatically send them updates, thank you emails etc. But no spam, ever. Only high quality content and promotions. If you went the WordPress route, we definitely recommend Optinmonster.\n\n4.3 NURTURE AND CONVERT\n\nSince subscribers will know we are in Beta mode, we want to make sure we can send them updates on our progress, any press mentions, milestones, etc. We simply want people to know what is going on, and keep them excited about the service. \n\n*Thank you Email via Mailchimp*: Earlier we talked about a referral program- our goal is to make it as easy and exciting as possible to refer a friend or colleague to our service, and offer a good enough incentive to do that. The Thank you email will be another reminder to share with friends for rewards. \n\nAgain, it’s important to make it as easy as possible for people get to and share your content. AddThis.com is an easy way to add Follow Buttons for your social media accounts. \n\nAs the company grows, there will be a more robust marketing plan implemented with various channels, downloadable content, advertisements, etc. For now we are trying to keep the costs as minimal as possible. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DIGITAL NOMAD, LIFESTYLE DESIGN, REMOTE WORK**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, onto the fun stuff...working remotely and travelling the world! This is as much a part of the business as anything else. We consider much of the travel and lodging as an expense, just as you would have to pay for an office if you were a brick and mortar company. But actually, the costs are way less than you think if you do it right, and are willing to be open to different working environments and living situations. \n\nSo how do we go about planning where to go, when, and how and keep costs low? \n\n*Virtual Assistant:* Having a virtual assistant is key. We are constantly working 50+ hours a week and travelling nonstop. Typically we give our assistant parameters of what we are looking for, and she or he will set up the rest. You can find an assistant on UpWork.com for relatively cheap. \n\n*Tools:* There are a ton of travel websites, apps and services, but we’ve narrowed down the ones we consistently used.\n\nSkiplagged - For the traveller that is okay with only carry on luggage. You can find secret “layover” flights that are often cheaper than the advertised price. We’ve consistently found cheaper flights on this website than any other, especially within the United States. \n\nGoogle Flights - They make it easy to see what days are the cheapest to travel on, and are always on par with other flight companies. \n\nAirbnb - This is always my go to. However, in some cities it is becoming more expensive, or even banned (Berlin). If you are travelling by yourself it will be more expensive, but great with 2+ people. \n\nHostelworld - If travelling alone hostels are always the most affordable option. There are always reviews. Hostels tend to be placed near city centers, and you always will meet interesting people. As more people are travelling, it seems like the hostels are competing to provide better services. \n\nNomadlist - We use this to find the best places to live and work overseas. It rates wifi, cost of living, nightlife, culture, etc. Other “nomads” post reviews and places to stay and things to do. It’s amazing resource that has guided a lot of my travel choices. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n--------\n\nAnd you’re off! We’ll be updating you guys throughout the process here on Reddit, answering questions, etc. If you guys are interested, we can follow up with additional posts about our plan after month 1 for building the actual web application and building the remote company culture. We can also expand on the lifestyle design, digital nomadism, and remote work, just ask!\n\n--------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo to wrap things up, my E-book  'HOW TO BUILD A $300K REMOTE BUSINESS WITH NO UPFRONT COSTS IN 1 YEAR' has a special price of  $9.99 just for redditors….. \n\nJUST KIDDING! :)  \n\nOn a serious note, feel free to ask me anything, I’m happy to answer questions about remote culture, the remote web service industry, and web application development. PM me. And if you read this through to the end, don’t wait, go start your next venture now. \n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT Thanks for all the great questions and interest so far.

{"id":"4pl3yq","author":"Cece1616","body":"Hello,\n\nSo this is my situation:\n\nI rented while in university. My landlord loved me, kept telling me he wanted me stay forever, that sort of guy. Graduated in 2009, went to teach English in Asia for a year. Came back in 2011 intending to teach abroad again; ended up staying to take care of my dying dog and father and also found myself just unable to function. I compare it to being a frog in a pot of water coming to boil, my brain was turning into a jumble (it was getting bad by the end of college actually, I thought it was just stress). I just couldn't think straight, my anxiety went through the roof, and my self-esteem and happiness plummeted since I appeared to be watching both my father's and my own mental faculties dissolve. I became very, very suicidal, and when I ran out of savings I stopped paying my student loans. Applied for a deferment, and when that ran out, did nothing. It was supposed to be encouragement for suicide. But I couldn't yet because of my father and dog. Eventually after I believe six months I applied for (and received) another deferment. In 2013 was when they died, and my friends took me in. I started volunteering. My friends kept mentioning how ADD I am. Finally in early 2014 I really couldn't stand it and reached out for help, hoping ADD medication would sort my mental issues and allow me to function. Ended up being diagnosed very hyperthyroid. Was told I'm not ADD, but that I appear to be because of said hyperthyroidism. Joined AmeriCorps, and in March 2015 began renting a room in a large house with other young women (still here today). \n\nIn July 2015 I killed my thyroid (via radiation treatment) and in August went on artificial thyroid medication. I have to be on it for the rest of my life. And I cannot begin to say what a difference it made, even that first day going on it. In the afternoon, I remember this calmness descending on me. I was very very surprised by this (but, in a calm way) and on my bike ride home pondered in deep puzzlement what could have happened that for the first time in over half a decade I no longer felt so physically tense that at any moment I was about to snap. Realized it must be the artificial thyroid hormones, though I wasn't expecting it to make me physically feel so much better. As I told my doctor, it was like my entire being and mind had been feverish for years, but I didn't realize it until the fevers had been extinguished. My doctor told me I had been messed up for so long that I had no idea what 'normal' is, and he's right. My doctor also used to tell me (in trying to convince me to irradiate my thyroid) that my thyroid had destroyed my life. He doesn't know my history, but just speaking to me could see what a mess I was.\n\nI really cannot begin to emphasize how much better I am now. I was so suicidal for so many years, and am so honestly not anymore. It just cannot compare, how I feel now to how I felt then. I just honestly thought my brain was breaking down, I couldn't think straight because I was stupid (and getting stupider), couldn't reason/manage routines/use critically thinking at all because my brain was strangled by anxiety that I'd never be able to control. Also, too, I just honestly do physically feel so much better, hyperthyroidism was debilitating and terrifying for me (my brain was in constant panic mode, my doctor told me when diagnosing me, because my thyroid was attacking my brain, which naturally freaked out my brain, being 'poisoned' constantly by excess thyroid hormone).\n\nAnyway I was previously so hopeless at being able to function at any difficult job, but after my AmeriCorps stint/frying my thyroid I managed to (eventually) find employment via two part-time jobs. One is two days a week at $12 per hour. The other is three days a week at $17 per hour (both eventually wanted me full-time, but I am very loyal to both jobs...I cannot believe how lucky I am with my employers and co-workers, they all mean a lot to me). It took me a few months to find these jobs (which drained my savings yet AGAIN ohmygosh), and it took forever to get up to 40hrs per week, but lo, now I am financially secure and can plunk down a check for a new apartment, with first/last/deposit (and still pay next month's rent for my current place. And not starve). I track all of my money using Mint and in January for the first time ever got credit cards to build my credit, three of them (Target, Amazon Prime and Capital One). Haven't paid any interest/always pay on time and keep my borrowing ratio down below 20% (currently only $2600 in total available credit, but due for a credit increase next month). So that's all well and nice, but I am kinda being destroyed by my non-payments for my student loans. I currently owe around $7500 and am in repayment (auto pay), but those several months of being too suicidal to care in 2012 are really...REALLY hurting me. I've read that late payments are on your record for 7 years, and one lady online who worked for the Dept of Ed explained how difficult it is to get late payments removed.\n\nThe thing of it is, if it were just me involved, I'd just stay in my current place another year. Then maybe do some subletting so I have history with more landlords. Look for renting with a private landlord (like my current sweet landlady). Only, I am (very very) happy to say that I am married. My husband's from another country and we're hoping to have his visa this autumn. I obviously need to find an apartment for us, and since he'll be coming here essentially unemployed (perhaps doing a little bit of work remotely for his current employers) but also from another country, it'll be up to me be approved. Co-signers I feel are out of the question, since I don't feel I know anyone I could ask to co-sign for me. My sweet landlady doesn't have any other places either :(\n\nI am not applying for any apartments with any rental agencies as they are just too strict. It's rather crazy, to sponsor my husband's visa I have to prove I can support him and sign a document vowing to do so for 10 years (even if we get divorced, so he doesn't go on public assistance), but let's just say even Uncle Sam is less strict than rental agencies. 'Mom and pop' sort of rentals are out there -- they're more expensive but most distressing of all is that all tend to be available 'immediately' or in a couple weeks. I really don't want to move until I have to (since my housing costs will double once I do move from renting a room to an apartment), and though there are plenty of places available in September, even from non-rental agencies (eg apartment complexes rented by their owners), I am worried about my credit history and lack of rental history. Plenty of sources online advise being honest; prepare for viewings like you would for a job interview, and explain tactfully about how you've reformed your ways. Is this really worth a shot? I can't for a moment imagine saying (in preparing them for running a credit check), 'you'll see some late payments in 2012, because I was suicidal and didn't care, but that's only because I was hyperthyroid and didn't know it. It's cool though, I'm hypothyroid now, and am much better now, thanks'. sigh :(\n\nI would like to find a way to tactfully infer my situation and ask their opinion if it's worth it to apply before applying (and spare myself some humiliation and save some money, and not waste their time). How should I go about doing this? Should I go about doing this?? I am just so eager to get an apartment for when my husband's visa is approved, we'll have been married two years this October.\n\nThank you very very much for your time and for reading, and I look forward to any advice given :)","name":"t3_4pl3yq","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-24 06:52:51","week":25}

{"id":"4pnhra","author":"ObviousReminder","body":"About a year ago, I wrote and published an ebook/guide under the Business Tips category on Fiverr.com. I didn't know much about the site at the time, but thought I could at least sell a few copies there while I gained momentum on Amazon where I originally posted it.\n\nThe guide I wrote has to do with a certain field in ecommerce that I have years of expertise in. I wrote an in-depth guide how to do what I do. To my surprise, it was a HUGE untapped niche on Fiverr at the time and it exploded.\n\nIt was slow in the beginning, maybe a sale every other day. After a few 5 star reviews were left, people gained trust and more orders came in, more positive testimonials came in, followed by even more buyers. Within 3 months of it being live of Fiverr, I was getting 2-3 sales a day.\n\nI eventually added gig extras to my gig that would attract my demographic and the contents of the guide. I got real creative with it, and that increased sales even more. \n\nWhile I was putting my faith in Amazon to sell this guide, Fiverr has completely blew it out of the water. I mean, it doesn't even compare. This surprised me, since Fiverr isn't typically a place one would go to buy an ebook. Suppose I used the right keywords, published it at the right time.\n\nI told my cousin about it who is a complete expert with iMovie from Apple to consider writing a guide about it, she eventually did and is pulling in about $50/week.\n\nThe best part? The work is already done. You have an ebook already typed up, you upload the file (PDF, .docx, etc) to the buyer with a nice little message (which you can copy and paste everytime to save more time) and click send, done.\n\nHere's an overview and breakdown of my sales: http://imgur.com/KsAtKY4\n\nHere's more proof: http://imgur.com/63CNVsE\n\nI know this may sound easier said than done, but if you have an expertise, or just something you're really good/knowledgeable at, there is a market and demographic of people willing to PAY YOU for the information inside your head. It worth a shot in my opinion.\n\nJust wanted to share with /r/beermoney, since it saddens me to see real go-getters like the people of this subreddit to settle for pennies on the dollar with surveys and such.

{"id":"4pqaxc","author":"nerdyfkup","body":"I'm going to start with some background. I live in California, in a decent neighborhood but last year when I bought a graphics card for my computer it never got delievered (i believe somebody stole it off my porch) but  regardless I called amazon and they were pretty cool about it. They refunded me and I went and bought it at a local frys. \n\nNow my current situation: I'm 20 years old and I wanted to build a new gaming computer. I am not currently working, but have about 2000 in savings from when I was working. Live with parent so no expenses except for 50 bucks a month for Comcast and 20 bucks a month for Netflix/Hulu. I have no credit as far as I know (maybe having a comcast account made my credit score go up?) anyway...\n\n\nI got approved for an Amazon (synchronycredit) credit  card with a 4000 dollar limit. I thought WHOA, there was no interest for 12 months so i figured great I could buy my gaming computer and pay it off over a year with no interest. This was perfect for me. \n\n\nI bought a bunch of different computers parts and after taxes it came to around 1500 dollars. All the parts were coming in 3 different shipments. On one day got the biggest package with the computer case. The next shipments were both coming the next day. They never came, I got a notification that my items were delivered (which was weird because my dogs go absolutely crazy when ever a package is delivered) went outside to grab em, there was nothing.  I searched around the side of the yard and I even creepily looked at some of my neighbors houses to see if the guy dropped it at a different house, Nothing.\n\nAfter I called them, and messaged them, and emailed them. They contacted the shipping company which just happened to be amzl_us (amazon's shipping company) which of course said it was delivered at the right address at the right time.They basically said since this is a second time that a product has been reported missing.  They will not issue a refund and/or replacements. Holy shit right? I have no idea what to do. I know I can do a payment reverse/charge-back but I looked into it and the synchrony credit company says 2 billing cycles for research into the issue. Now call me crazy but since that company is basically owned by amazon ( i think) i'm almost 100% sure they will side with amazon. Also when I told an amazon customer service rep that I would be considering a charge back they said my amazon account would be terminated and I would not be able to get my prime membership money back.\n\nSo i'm pretty sure I am screwed out of my products and money. I don't know who to contact (amazon pretty much has complete control of the whole process). \n\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do I go to fight this?\nWould it hurt my credit score to fight it, or should I just take this loss? to protect my credit score? ( I am planning on trying to move out and would probably need a good credit score) \n\nEdit: An Amazon customer service Rep clearly stated that my package was mistakenly marked as delivered. I also have the chat log for proof.\n\nAlso I hope this is the right subreddit, I might move it over to legal advice (im not sure)","name":"t3_4pqaxc","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-25 03:17:52","week":25}
{"id":"4pqp8t","author":"lordkev","body":"So, I just got a suspension notice and have no idea why. I normally sell FBA, but figured I'd cross-list some stuff and see if I could make some extra sales. I had no performance warnings previous to suspension. It was a relatively new account (about a month old), but I had six positive feedback and zero negative, and no resolution cases ever opened. Basically, the chain of events was:\n\n1. User purchases an item.\n2. User messages me asking me to send it to a different address.\n3. I reply saying I'm sorry, but I can only send it to their confirmed address and ask if they'd like me to refund the order.\n4. User replies and says no, they'll pick it up from their old address (which was in a different state).\n5. I changed the quantity on that listing to 0 to make sure I sell no more as I'm relying on my Dad to ship that particular item from their house and we just had a death in the family.\n6. Less than 30 minutes later, suspended.\n\nThe e-mail, eBay rep and supervisor I spoke with were extremely unhelpful and wouldn't provide me with any reason aside from that it was a permanent ban and that \"for this type of suspension it cannot be removed\" or something to that effect.\n\nPossible reasons I can think of:\n\n1. Item was a brand new Microsoft Surface keyboard cover. Is this restricted or something? I sold others in the past.\n2. I do have two accounts that I've used for buying and selling in the past. One was a personal account, and one for a previous venture selling on eBay that I still use mainly for buying stuff today. I haven't used the first one in years and years. Neither have any issues with feedback or suspensions.\n3. I was using Amazon multi-channel fulfillment to fulfill my eBay orders and Joelister to cross-list. I didn't think this was against any rules...?\n4. I'm a US citizen, biz is registered in the US, and everything is shipping from the US (either Amazon MCF, my parents), but I do access my account exclusively from where I'm living currently (abroad).\n\nAnything I can do to appeal? Anyone had any luck? I mean, I'd be happy to try to clear up any discrepancies but they won't even tell me why it was suspended.","name":"t3_4pqp8t","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-25 05:03:12","week":25}

{"id":"4pttis","author":"enterprisecaptain","body":"I am thinking of switching to a new credit card. I've had an Amazon CC for &gt; 10 years (and I will continue using it for Amazon) that has a $20K limit, but I want to get a card that's more travel/miles-friendly, so looking at Sapphire or Venture card.\n\nHowever, my real question is this: The applications ask for income and bank account balance. How important is the bank account balance in determining credit line? I want a minimum of $20K credit line, possibly more (we occasionally put very large expenses on it--never paid a dime of interest).\n\nI ask because we just bought a house and our savings took a big hit of course.

Pay ranges from $1-$30. I don't like doing these.\n* **Offers** - General spam email signups only, not a good point turnout.\n* **Coin offers** - 2 coins = 1 point. Ranges from 10 coins to 200 coins for common offers. Not that reliable after a few.\n* **Tasks** - Crowdflower tasks \n* **Games** - Tripeaks solitaire vs other people for best score. You may bet points.\n* **Videos** - 1 point per video.\n* **Radio** - 1 point every 10 minutes of listening, must submit captcha for attention filter.\n\n\n\nAsk on the R1 chat box or forums and the unanimous answer for earnings potential are surveys, hands down. Every Legend and Elite member use the Your-Surveys router as do I. Once you get your demographic questions out of the way, qualify rate for me seems to be about 80% of the time. Your-Surveys is a bit slow on the weekend if you do more than 10+ surveys a day. The most I've ever done in a day was around 25 surveys.\n\n\n**Contests**\n\n\n\nA few times a year R1 hosts earnings and referral contests, a new one has started for summer from June 24th to September 13th.\n\nRank earnings % bonus is still earned, but does not apply to the contest leaderboards so everything is fair regardless of rank. \n\nUS and International regions have two separate contests to keep offer consistency fair.\n\n* Prizes\n\n\n\n **Place - US - Intl**\n\n\n\n* 1st - $200 - $60\n* 2nd - $150 - $50\n* 3rd - $100 - $40\n* 4th - $80 - $35\n* 5th - $60 - $30\n* 6th - $55 - $25\n* 7th - $50 - $24\n* 8th - $45 - $23\n\n\n\nand so on until 20th place decreasing by $5/$2 approximately each place\n\n\n**Quick Tips**\n\n\n\n* For signup use your real email as gift cards and electronic rewards are emailed to you! Never have I gotten unsolicited content.\n* Survey routers such as Your-Surveys, use your real email or one you will remember as your email is used to sign into your demographic profile. Use consistent information in your profile demographics or you will be banned (watch out for screener attention questions).\n* If you are doing coin offers/offers, **do not** use your real email, use a spam one. You will be bombarded with spam and that's not fun.\n\n\n\nI think that's everything. Hopefully this will help people looking for a new site to try out. If you have any questions or need anything, let me know and I will help to the best of my ability.\n\n[Non-Ref](http://www.rewards1.com/)\n\n\n[Ref](http://www.rewards1.com/lakesbrian)\n\n\n\nEdit: Messed with formatting","name":"t3_4purdh","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-26 00:33:41","week":25}

I came up with a new Beermoney site that rewarded you for scanning QR codes. Everyone was very supportive and gave me advice and suggestions to improve the site. Last year I made the promise to myself I would fix every issue with the site by this time next year (now).\n\nA lot of problems came with the site; how I was going to pay for it, where to host, how to advertise...etc. Being only 15, it isn't exactly the easiest thing to get a job. Never the less, I started a few gigs on Fiverr and managed to earn myself enough money to sustain the site until all the bugs were fixed. It was a bit of a challenge but I knew it would all be worth it in the end. One year later, here I am. I've fixed all the issues, added all your suggestions and re-designed the whole site.\n\n\nFor those that still haven't a clue what I'm talking about, here is a brief explanation of what Scan Gifts is;\n\nScan Gifts is a luck based interactive game rewarding you with gift cards or codes for a winning code. Scan a QR code falling from the header with a QR code scanning app on either your smart phone or tablet, winning codes will bring you to an encryped link which will self destruct after opened. Losing QR codes will lead you to a notification telling you to try again.\n\nI have worked out a system that will reward visitors instantly and quicker than any other site. Think of it like a lottery that you don't have to pay for. Scan a few codes in the morning as a daily routine, it'll only take you about 5-15 seconds to know if your code has won or not. By the end of the week your almost guaranteed to earn a code or few. Codes added daily include but not limited to: Xbox Live, Steam, PayPal, Amazon and Weebly credit.\n\n\nAn Imgur album of your comments and suggestions and what I've done to fix them:\n\n[- Album](http://imgur.com/a/FKxDY)\n\n\nThe site:\n\n[- Scangifts.com](http://www.scangifts.com/)\n\nA Twitter account I have set up to Tweet every time a new code is added:\n\n[- Twitter.com/scan_gifts](http://twitter.com/scan_gifts)\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this site is some use to you and am of course open to any other suggestions you many have.\n\nThanks,\nJohn :)\n  ","name":"t3_4pzfok","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-26 22:04:09","week":25}

{"id":"d4geuqb","author":"szanten13","body":"I would say: look for a distributor. Most likely a niche website, don't look at them as competitors but more like potential partners. However you won't be able to charge the same amount as you would to regulars, but then you wouldn't have to bother with sending each one out individually but only a big batch once.\nI have not look into this but another option would be to get Amazon to distribute and sell it for you, then just advertise your Amazon link through sending \"test\" batches to culinary blogs and yt channels, however to make this a viable venture you'll need to do the math, when you do cut the corners not in your favour as to be more realistic.\nIn order to spread the fixed costs such as sending taste samples to influential people, you'll need to sell in high volumes, I have no idea how much olive oil can 10 (since you get half) olive trees make.\nIf you go with the Amazon option you definitely will need whatever certifications you need, unlike if you would just sell it to your colleagues, whom would probably like that.\nI say, either go big (find a distributor, acquire required certifications, increase your output through buying more oil from that company in order to spread the fixed costs on more units) or informally sell it to family and friends, or even for favours. The first option will definitely take time and a lot of work without guaranteed profit.\nI would personally suggest the more laid back, Italian option (that's not an insult, I love how Italians work to live, not live to work), sell it on the side. It obviously bears small risk of illegal activity but the government isn't on the hunt for illegal olive oil distributors, it's almost the same thing as selling jam made from your own garden, they won't bother as long as you don't make thousands a month.\nI wish you all the best and I wish I could try some of that olive oil here in Britain, I'm a huge fan but there aren't many options available here.\nEdit: sorry for the wall of text, no idea how to space it out on mobile.","name":"t1_d4geuqb","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-20 10:10:13","week":25}

But in that case, as you said, you would have to be sure to produce a certain amount of olive oil every year. And this is rather difficult with \"only\" 20 trees as every years harvest is different. \n\nI think your second option would be more viable. A lot of people do this and earn a decent amount of side income. This will probably not make us millionaires, but you can still earn some nice money with selling it to friends, colleauges or maybe even local restaurants. A nice little website however, as well as selling it on Amazon would be an option too. I think in august, when I will be in Italy, I will hold some talks to this local olive oil business. Maybe sell his amounts too?\n\nThanks again.

{"id":"d4gs9yk","author":"jmacupdates1","body":"Here's some advice from me in no particular order.\n\n1) 5k per year (assuming for 4 years) means 20k in total student loans. This is a very manageable total and I wouldn't worry too bad about it. A rule of thumb I like is you shouldn't incur more than half of your likely first salary out of college (not applicable in all situations, but still good).\n\n2) Don't buy books in the bookstore. You can find them much cheaper online - Chegg, Amazon, Textbooks.com, etc.\n\n3) Working during college is a great thing. Even 5 or 10 hours can make a big difference, especially if you can find work in your area of study. It's a perfect opportunity to earn money and add to your resume.\n\n4) If you think you can handle it, look into becoming an RA. That's a good way to knock out your housing costs and earn extra money.\n\n5) Your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest while in school, so if you're able to pay those off in college, that's great. Don't cut yourself short though.\n\n6) Alcohol is expensive. Consume (and spend) responsibly.\n\n7) If you have a meal plan, don't waste meals. Obviously it's nice to get out occasionally, but from a purely financial standpoint, you're already paying for those meals. If you eat out somewhere, you'll pay for that and lose out on a \"free meal.\" \n\n8) Get a credit card, if you think you're up to the challenge. If you think you'll spend more than you should and not pay it off every month, then don't. But if you're responsible and don't spend what you know you don't have, and pay it off in full every month (I'd recommend Autopay full statement balance), you can take advantage of sign-up or referral bonuses, cashback, etc. It's also good to have as a backup in case of emergency. You'll need credit at some point in your life. You might as well start early and build it now.\n\n9) Look into budgeting. I didn't really do it in college, but I have since. The earlier you track your expenses and income, the better you'll be at it when you actually have good money coming in (and more expenses going out).\n\nThese may or may not all apply to you, but these are some things I did in college that worked well for me.

{"id":"d4gz670","author":"chewie_were_home","body":"So my parents are in this situation, dad makes very little and mom only has social security. They put themselves in this situation (were gifted 300k from my grandmother when she died just about 8 years ago, then blew every penny) so I'm in no way going to feel bad for there situation or kill myself trying to help them. And my entire family agrees with me on this. But I do try to help them from time to time and give them some good advice to help them help themselves. \n\n1) get them to drop cable, this was a huge plus for my parents mentally and financially. \n\n2) make sure they are maxing out all of there state help. Medicare(Canada version of course), welfare, food stamps or whatever Canada has setup for that. Unlucky for my parents we live in a state that didn't expand Medicare so they are on the hook for medical bills for a while. They have so much of that piled up it doesn't really matter to them anymore.  But they are using the tiny government help they do have to the max and we made sure if it not to burden the family. \n\n3) look into help any local church may offer. My parents ended up getting a great load of help from a local church. They got old beater the church donated so my dad can drive to work and through the church they found a place to rent for 500 a month in an ok part of town in a small/old but livable house. \n\n4) assist them with making things cheaper for themselves. Kitchen appliances so they cook for them selves instead of going out. Netflix and a 35$ Amazon tablet so they don't care about TV. Used bikes and better shoes so they go out and stay healthy more. \n\n5) I perform car mantinence when I can to save them money. (We have no public transport here) \n\nIt's tough trying to help people that don't want to help themselves. The best you can do is try to encourage them to make better decisions. Don't kill yourselves trying to help people that only take advantage of you.  Everything you give just accept it's gone and don't worry about it being repaid, that mindset helps you understand what your really giving. \n Good luck it's a tough break. It could be worse though at least Canada has an ok healthcare system for people like this, not true in the states.\n\nEdit: try to get them to be open with the family on there true financial situation. When my parents lost there house everything looks really well for them until they called me looking for a place to stay. They literally didn't pay there house note for a year and half before the process of repossessing even started and told no one. They had not saved one dime in there lives turned out even with multiple huge windfalls. Had they been honest with the family from the start we could have helped before it went to far south.","name":"t1_d4gz670","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-20 20:55:03","week":25}

So unless you are trying to get started in a very crowded niche (top competitors have 500-1000+ reviews), the free reviews game is all but over.  \n\nWhy?  After the product is discounted by a certain percentage, the purchase is no longer classified as a \"verified purchase\" (I have found non-verified purchases have minimal or possibly no impact to the overall product rating). Further, I believe Amazon did away with super URLs, which when given to a reviewer, made a sale appear like he or she searched your target keywords and subsequently bought an item (producing a sales rank boost). Finally, I think buyers have caught on and Amazon has gotten enough bad press that they met just end the program in its entirety.  I no longer think this is a viable option for sellers.\n\nTo answer your question, I tried out AmzTracker.  The system worked well enough.

{"id":"d4idm2n","author":"its_never_too_SUNE","body":"&gt;This is going to be a long slog at best.  No fast gains here (if any gains at all).\n\nOh definitely. And this is has very speculative components, the catalyst is the advance in tech and automation that is undoubtedly on the horizon. \n\nI understand it doesn't lead to revenue creation, but Wal-Mart has adequate revenue generation as it stands. Personally I don't think brick and mortar is entirely dead, online retailers are edging in a greater market share that's also undeniable. Wal-Mart as a company is in a position where it would only benefit through adopting automated tech and plowing cash into research of that or supporting smaller firms that will. \n\nThis is my hypothesis for why Wal-Mart is undervalued. They already took the hit on their value from the threats of efficient delivery services and online retailers. Yet they are still in a great financial position, a position that has few obstacles for pursuing automation tech. \n\nYes it is speculation saying Wal-Mart will pursue automation extensively but it makes logistical sense. They have always sought out tech that brings out efficiency and they've even stated they have an interest in automation and other helper like software and equipment. \n\nOne thing that sets physical retail apart from online retail is the ability to sell a product readily on demand. Sure Amazon can bring 2 day delivery or rapid delivery but it's definitely more expensive than heading down to Wal-Mart to get the same product. This is Wal-Mart's advantage, automation has the potential to reduce their costs overall (after upfront investment costs). They can improve their margins this way and have every reason to. From there it is entirely plausible they could cut prices even further and drag more consumers from competitors. \n\nEverything is about competitive advantage. Amazon is after their market share. Wal-Mart does lose sales to online retailers but they still have increased revenue generation. They do have certain advantages over Amazon and automation can only increase those advantages. Of course Amazon benefits from these as well. \n\nI just don't think Amazon can entirely take Wal-Mart's market share for reasons I touched on briefly.

When clicking on the book you could send the user to an overview of a book, instead of sending directly to Amazon. This is probably my biggest complaint, since it undermines the whole concept of your website. Anyone can go on amazon and type in a business book, and find the ones you show. The whole point is that there should be a definitive answer to whether or not it is worth it to buy. Otherwise the site seems unavailing. Maybe have a knowledge learned per time spent scale, or a rating involving the value of that book. \n\n2. You could have a standard template size for the books. Since certain books can go down very far, and some don't it makes it seem cluttered. http://i.imgur.com/moBZQKH.png\nUsing the green border as a guide, you should try to make a standard length that it does not go past.\n\n3. A community vote for the books would be a cool edition, than you can have books by user favorites\n\n4. Maybe have a length/difficulty rating. Maybe you could import some amazon ratings.\n\n5. Add a light background color to the options in the \"I'm interested in ___ books that ___ recommends.\" http://i.imgur.com/ivh7fPF.png\n\nI hope I could help give at least one idea, I can imagine myself using a website like this since I enjoy reading and it can be a hassle to find the best book to read next.

Lots of returns, frustration and bad nights sleep. Folks don't like the smell, heat, and loft/height. \n\nI started designing pillows that put the power back in the customer/sleeper. What we found out is Most manufactures don't care about you getting the right pillow the first time. They want volume. They want you to try their zero loft, 1 loft, 2 loft, etc. Key is make many different versions and sell lots and maybe the sleeper will find what they are looking for. \n\nAfter listening to 6 years worth of customers explaining their needs and desires to fit their amazing mattresses (regardless of style, type or brand) we designed www.VRNaturals.com \n\nKey Features:\n*The power is back in your hands to create the feel and loft you desire. Every pillow is adjustable in regards to the fill. Don't like it because it is too high or too low (just open it up and remove or add natural fill). All pillows come with a cinch storage bag for your fill or collecting other various varmints or random dirty laundry. \n*Organic Cotton Stretch Cover: The most comfortable cool sleeping orderless cover we have found over the years.\n*Natural Fills. Either choose Natural Latex Noodles, Natural Kapok Silk or a combination of the two. These are cool sleeping, odorless, and have natural benefits. Each style has its own unique feel. Blend is the most popular nationwide. \n*They are made in partnership with www.MileHighWorkshop.org. Each pillow helps provide a job of a previous addict or felon...people who couldn't work before, now have jobs. \n*Price: You'll find them for $100-$140 depending on the retailer. You can find them in most Urban Mattress and Most City Mattress. Either online at www.VRNaturals.com or Amazon. \n\nWe have found out that 90% of our customers love them because they get to make them the way they want. \n\nMaybe this will help. \n\nSteve","name":"t1_d4ig8xc","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-21 22:16:32","week":25}

Do you have the capital to import / purchase goods with enough margin to cover these types of discounts?\n\nAlso, shipping to consumers is expensive, and everyone has gotten spoiled by Amazon, who pass much of their shipping costs on to the vendors. You should plan to subsidize shipping costs or people will get sticker shock when they get to the checkout step.\n\nBut have you run the numbers on how much profit will be left over after all that?\n\nHaving run an ecommerce business, I can tell you that price competition is fierce, so if you are positioning yourself as a \"low cost\" provider, you are competing with giants who can afford to lose money on many / most of their transactions (Amazon, for example, who make most of their money on cloud related IT services, and may not even be profitable when it comes to ecommerce.)\n\nAnyway, I would build a very conservative spreadsheet before you wade too deep into any business selling physical products.

{"id":"d4j6pre","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"Personally, my view is that many REITs that I look at are richly valued or overvalued when it comes to p/ffo and other metrics. Certainly not across the board but definitely many. It's understandable with people desperate for yield. I know where I'd like to buy a handful of REITs and in each case the level is 10% or more lower than current price (and I don't think I'm being unreasonable with levels, it just becomes what is an appealing price point/valuation to start a position for a particular company.)  If you tell me that rates will stay around these low levels for years to come, REITs will pull back at times but probably remain pricey. If rates are going higher, REITs are definitely going to pull back and possibly in the manner that they did during the taper tantrum 2-3years ago (although that proved to be a great buying opportunity.)\n\nI sold a little more equinix yesterday at $380 after buying that part of the position at $270ish in Feb at the low. The other data center REITs continue to ramp as well.\n\nThe data center REITs are not cheap but that is the main sector seeing sizable growth not only currently but as a long-term story/theme. I'll keep the rest of equinix but at these levels not taking some profit would be irresponsible. I also own some of the other data center REITS, as well. (Data center reits: dft, dlr, cor, cone, eqix, qts.)\n\nThe other REIT sector doing well is industrial with warehouse space for e-commerce, with companies such as Prologis (PLD), who is a major landlord for Amazon, among many other companies. Healthcare also not bad. Would stay away from mall reits. Don't particularly like hotel reits - it's not that there are not solid hotel REITs with high quality properties as much as the idea that the second there is a whiff of cooling in the economy, these get obliterated, so long term, it feels to me like 3 steps forward, 2 large and fast steps back. Apartment reits okay but I have to wonder if we are close to top of cycle there, with rents the way that they are in many areas and things like Equity Residential (EQR) selling 23,000 of their apartments. Self-storage REITs continue to be big, but are not cheap and could use a bit further pullback.\n\nGilead is inexpensive but has a case of apple-itis; the market wants to know what the next big thing is and until they make a material acquisition the stock is going to wander. Buybacks (a good amount of which were probably done at higher levels....), good news, dividend increases and other things have a limited or no effect. The level of presidential campaign theater over healthcare has also hurt biotech broadly.","name":"t1_d4j6pre","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-22 11:52:24","week":25}

{"id":"d4jgbzo","author":"Juliajones54","body":"We are moving 250 miles away in a week. We haven't moved in 23 years. I am packing a 4 bedroom house myself. It's not cheap to do. The boxes at Home Depot are very stong and they come in small, medium, large, and extra large. Small - like the sizes of liquor boxes are best for books and dishes. I second liquor boxes! Try to get some that still have the dividers in them because they are excellent for moving drinking glasses and bottles of unopened condiments (olives, pickles, hot sauce, etc). We are using a moving company and even though they aren't packing us, they do have used boxes for free and used paper for wrapping breakables so ask your movers if they have any you can use. I put coats in the bottom of boxes to pad breakables, but most of our clothing we have folded into boxes. Our moving company is bringing some wardrobes boxes for the clothes we didn't want to put in boxes. You probably know this, but computer and tv flat screens must be kept upright. Home Depot and I imagine Lowe's has special boxes for flat screens. Or, you can plan to move them in your car. Don't put bubble wrap right on the screens as the bubbles can leave imprints. Tape paper on first. For fragile items, wrap first in a sheet of paper (Amazon has packs of 350 sheets for a good price), then wrap in bubble wrap. Stand dishes up on end and pack everything very tightly in boxes so there is no wiggle room. Pack to the top of the boxes so there is no give when you push down. You can use towels, sheets, washcloths, blankets, socks, t-shirts,  to fill empty spaces. Tape the boxes well on the bottom and top. You don't want the bottom falling out when it's picked up. Clearly mark fragile boxes, and what room you want them to be placed in, or if you want them to go into a garage or basement. Pack by similar items, or by rooms, but keep things organized. Donate, donate, donate, and throw out junk. Be ruthless. If you haven't used it or worn it in a year and unless it's a family heirloom or has special meaning, get rid of it. This includes furniture. I hate yard sales but if you don't, this is the time to have one. Give yourself plenty of time to pack. If you wait till the last minute, you will panic and just start throwing things in boxes. I'm not a great list maker, but using one has been helpful. Google moving tips and you will find tips online. Leave a couple days before the move to clean. We own our home so I've been patching nail holes and painting as I've been going through the rooms. Are you responsible for cleaning any carpets? Make arrangements for any pets so they aren't underfoot the day of the move.  Get a good night's sleep the day before the move, don't stay up all night cleaning or packing. And now, back to packing for me. Good luck! ","name":"t1_d4jgbzo","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-22 17:17:57","week":25}

{"id":"d4jgxxo","author":"carolineschwartz","body":"depending on quality of the items i would assess wether to sell thru own site or amazon. If its stuff you are not restocking i would go with amazon and do the FBA its not cheap but takes out all the hassles of shipping, returns, packaging etc. Having your own site is a big time investment to get traffic thru so best bet amazon. Not sure ebay but start only in one place, don't try to set up a bunch of channels just do one really well and you can make some money. Amazon charges 15% sales fee plus FBA is about 5% extra so you are looking at 20% off your profit. still really worth it if you buy at 13% off sales price. Additionally i would consider selling some of the stuff in big bundles so you get rid of everything faster. do some research for that i recommend ebay for sure you can see what stuff has sold for and get a good pricing idea. You can always set up a sale on ebay with a minimum reserve amount to test out pricing.

{"id":"d4jndmq","author":"BitcoinPatriot","body":"There is something else going on that isn't disclosed. Making $2600 a month (I assume gross) is a little over $30,000 a year. If your debt is current then less than $2500 in debt shouldn't be affecting your score much. The only other thing it could be, but again should only be a marginal \"hit\" to a credit score, is if each of these cards you mention you are at the \"maximum credit\" level. Credit scoring companies do NOT like that!!\n\nFor example say that Zales card has a $1400 limit but you owe $1300. That means you owe over 90% of your available credit. And if the other two cards are like that then that MIGHT hit your score a little. But, again, shouldn't be significant. If you have a low credit score there is something else going on. Pull your credit and see if there is an old delinquent account or something like that.\n\nHaving said that the solution is pay these off ESPECIALLY if they have low credit limits. With the $500 this Friday knock out the Amazon and get rid of that balance. Now you have about $2000. Find some extra money if you don't have it but plan to pay these off over the next 4 months. That is only $500 a month. Offer lawnmowing on the weekend and find 2 or 3 years. That can make you an extra couple hundred a month. Offer to paint houses on the weekend and get two houses a month. That alone after a month or two should have two grand. Or find another way to pick up a few bucks. Or simply cut WAY back on going out to eat or entertainment for a month or two. Talk with the wife and tell her how much better you and she will be a year from now with no debt so let's cut way back for six months or so to get things paid off. Eat a little more chicken and hamburger helper for the next couple months and a little less eating in restaurants and that can easily find a couple hundred a month.\n\nLastly, you say you don't want to get laughed at by your dealership. Who CARES what the dealership thinks:) You should laugh at THEM because you don't have a payment!! Don't talk about getting out of a little bit of debt and THEN talk about taking on massive car debt!!\n\nDrive your car for another year BUT pay YOURSELF that car payment. Say you think you could afford $400 a month for a car payment. Btw, we know that is not true otherwise you wouldn't have $2500 in credit card debt but let's play along for a moment. If you THINK you can afford a $400 payment then open a Capital One online checking account (free with no minimum balances) and put $400 in there. Then next month put another $400 in there. And so on. In one year you have $4800 in there. Now sell your car, add $4800, and buy a little bit nicer car/truck. Notice STILL no payments because THIS car is also paid for. But continue to put $400 a month in the checking account. Say you drive this car for two year but now have almost $10,000 in the dedicated \"car fund\" checking account. Sell your car, add $10,000, and get a NICER car/truck. Notice, STILL paid for. Now continue saving $400 a month. Then in, say, 3 years you have a car worth about $8000 or so sell it, add the now $15,000 saved and buy an even NICER car!!\n\nBuy cars this way and NEVER have another car payment the rest of your life!!

{"id":"d4jwtom","author":"PA_Dsq","body":"1. 740 via FICO.\n2. Citi Thank You Preferred (2006), Chase Amazon (2008), Costco Amex (2011), Discover IT (2012), Chase Freedom (2013), Amex Blue Cash (1/2016), CSP (4/2016), Citi Costco (6/2016)\n3. 2 Biz class RT. Hotel.\n4. 75k UR. 5k UA.\n5. Closest is LGB, SNA and international LAX\n6. France, looking at 10 days so possible a 2nd country such as Milan.\n\nMan, I really wished I knew about churning a lot before but now just looking forward. So my goal for churning is Biz class RT from LAX to CDG in the Fall of 2017. It's going to be possible be a special trip because that's when I'm planning on proposing to my gf by that time of 9 years. Reason Fall of 2017 is also because I'm doing a 1 year medical fellowship and will be completed in September. \n\nAfter doing a bit of research and reading all the helpful info in the forums and other blogs I think I have a plan down. My first question though would be whether or not my new Citi Costco card would count against Chase's 5/24, since it was not a hard pull an automatic I assume it's not... if that's the case then that would mean I would have room for 3 Chase correct?\n\nSo looking at different Biz flight options to CDG, it looks to be about 80k one-way so I would need around 320k for RT for 2. \n\nThis is the order of cards I was thinking about getting, assuming I'm good for 3 Chase cards.\n\n1. Chase United MPE. Unfortunately I only qualify for the 50k after $3k spend.\n\n2. Chase Hyatt. $1k spend. I want this to redeem 2 nights at the Park Hyatt Paris Vendome.\n\n3. Question on the 3rd card here, from what I've read and understand, applying and getting the Chase Ink business card would not count against the 5/24 rule, if so I was thinking another Chase CC to max out my 5/24 so either the Mariott or IHG card?\n\n4. Chase Ink business for the 60k bonus.\n\n5. Citi Prestige. 50k TYP bonus. I like their 4th night of hotel among other things.\n\nSo with tentative plan after receiving bonuses and the spending to get them, I'll be around 200k points combined b/t UA, UR, TYP. Along with a few free nights with the Hyatt and IHG/Marriott card. What cards should I go for after that to get the remaining 120k points I would need? \n\nThe easiest route would be for my gf to apply for some cards and she would be starting fresh on the 5/24 rule (Chase Freedom in 2013). I would have refer her to  CSP (so I can get 10k referral bonus),  Chase Hyatt (so possible do 4 nights at Paris Vendome), Chase MPE if good signup bonus. \n\n\nThanks in advance for reading and any possible advice.\n","name":"t1_d4jwtom","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-22 22:55:24","week":25}

{"id":"d4jycc7","author":"MTRBeast33","body":"Congrats! Well first the bad news is that the $450 AF will post on the first full statement.  This doesn't count towards min spend.   \n1st You'll want to get the United MPX app, people have been having trouble with it but it eventually works.  When you get your Platinum there's a place to set your preferred airline to United.  You then buy (do a test one first) 4x $50 Amazon gift cards on the MPX app and all $200 will be refunded to your card.  This is the $200 per year airline fee reimbursement, you can do it again in January.  Other options is to just buy gift cards on an airline website you like (set your airline on the Plat to that airline first).   \n2nd:  Global Entry fee waiver.  Going through this myself, super easy.  You apply, it posts $100, they refund $100.  According to my friend he put his wife on the same card and a second set of $100 was refunded, seen a few other sources saying this is true, so get your GF Global Entry too.  Gets you TSA Pre Check (along with the global entry) for 5 years.  Will save you probably dozens of hours over the next 5 years.   \n3rd:  Go to the Plat Benefts section on your login, bunch of other stuff to sign up for.  Go through all of them, free Hilton &amp; SPG status, free rental car status, all pretty useful.  \n4th:  One of the things you'll sign up for is the Priority Pass, it gives access to a very large number of lounges.  The Platinum itself is the pass for you+1 other to get into any Centurion Lounges.  There aren't a ton of them, but they're pretty amazing.  \n\nSome other good info in here: https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/4insnv/how_to_maximize_the_value_of_the_amex_platinum/\n","name":"t1_d4jycc7","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-22 23:27:51","week":25}

With an AF of $475, if I can only redeem $100/yr in MB accessories, the AF is a bigger hit. \n\nIs there something I'm missing about the AmEx MB Plat benefits that matches with the $200/yr airline credit on the AmEx Plat?\n\nThanks!","name":"t1_d4ka96h","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-23 04:26:13","week":25}

{"id":"d4kcbu8","author":"winkie5970","body":"You can also get line items with a credit card in your monthly statement. And credit card companies generally have better fraud protection. If someone gets ahold of your debit card and pin number and takes money out, you may never see it again. If someone charges things to your credit card without authorization you are often not liable. By using your debit card less you lessen the chances of it getting stolen. Also, fewer transactions make the account easier to keep an eye on.\n\nI think it's not a bad idea to get a credit card (or 2) and use it for the majority of your expenses. You can get cards with no annual fee that give cash rewards (Amazon has a nice card if you shop there at all). You can pay off the balance each month and incur no interest. And it will help you build your credit which can help with any loans you may need to take out in the future, like a mortgage.\n\nI use 3 credit cards for my expenses:\n\n* PNC CashBuilder - 1.75% cash back on everything\n* American Express - 2% on groceries\n* Amazon Chase - 3% on Amazon purchases, 2% on gas and restaurants\n\nI don't carry balances on any of these accounts so I am literally making back money that I spend at no cost to me.\n\nFinally, anything beyond a 6-month emergency fund you should be investing if at all possible.

Buy anything you want on it. Anything you like at all. Reload it only on the 1st of every month and do not use any this card for required purchases and don't use any other card for the BS purchases.\n\n3) set a goal for something. For instance, that item you really want. Say you have $100/mo on the card but you're only spending $50. You still want that $100 but instead of moving $50 there, move the remaining amount to a separate fund that'll be used only for this one item. That way you can still have an expensive item that you yourself are saving up for as a way to reward yourself while saving money overall.\n\nTo be honest though, a lot of this is gimmick.

Create a bank account for your business, both of you get debit cards for the account and start the account off with the same amount of money each, like $250 each or $500 each depending on how much you want your starting capital to be. \n\n2. Link anything related to your business to this account. If you source, use the debit cards for the account. If you buy supplies, use the debit card. If you plan on using Amazon FBA, link the bank account for your payments. If you are doing ebay, transfer the paypal funds to that account. \n\n3. Once a month, or once a week, or whenever you guys decide is good, pay yourselves the same payment to your personal accounts from the business account. I wouldn't take any profits until you're past your starting capital actually in there that way you're never \"negative\". (Your $500 will be below that as soon as you start buying things, so let's say when it get's to $700 from your sales you pay yourself and your father $100 each). Of course, also make sure to put some profits aside for tax purposes and save all of your receipts. \n\nHope that helps. The whole point is to keep your money, your father's money, and money earned from the business separate from each other. It can get mighty complicated if you mix personal purchases on both of your personal debit cards with business purchases, and if payments from amazon and paypal are going to one of your accounts and you're trying to split those.

Many millennials have put off raising families to further their careers / clear debt. If they were to start having babies, a huge amount of money will hit all baby-related companies, and Carter's is very well positioned. \n\nOverall, Carter's has good margins and a great product. It's at a P/E of 23, which is comfortable enough given their growth expectations. EPS has consistently risen. They started a reasonable and small dividend fairly recently. They did a very well-timed share buyback in February at the bottom of the dip. Their debt burden is insignificant compared to earnings. This is a great company.\n","name":"t1_d4l6axr","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-23 21:04:22","week":25}

{"id":"d4l6wlq","author":"williemax","body":"Try EAC. Here's my rundown and it's mostly anecdotal so take it with salt. Erickson Air Crane partakes in firefighting, logging and heavy-lift operations, they're based in Oregon and recently purchased Evergreen Aviation- the own the Spruce Goose, a massive wooden plane. Evergreen also owns a museum and water park in McMinnville, Oregon, this is undoubtedly the largest single tourist attraction in McMinnville.  Their profit margin is slim, but the ubiquitous Erickson Helicopter won't disappear, it is the standard for heavy lift operations. So who will take care of Erickson? They probably won't recover from taking on the pile of diarrhea that is Evergreen, but I expect a biz like TXT or maybe UTX to be interested in the longterm success of Erickson. Erickson owns several TTXT-manufactured Bell helicopters, but the pride is the Erickson AirCrane- it is a beauty to watch take water from a river and dump onto a raging wildfire, or to see pick up a load of Amazonian hardwoods.

They'd be getting similar cards, with overlapping categories. Getting both is wasting a 5/24 slot that could be used for a card with a much better sign-up bonus, and it doesn't get you a CSP or an Ink+ faster because a thin file is very sensitive to inquiries and new accounts.\n\nI agree that the Freedom arguably beats out discover over 2+ years (I think it's pretty much a dead heat until one year at least), but getting both is overkill and wasteful, especially when you consider that the Ink+ essentially makes the Freedom obsolete, since through store gift cards, the Ink+ earns 5x UR on Amazon, chain restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and all sorts of other things.","name":"t1_d4lgb7v","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-24 00:45:28","week":25}

They did make it up to me (they gave me $20 or so site credit, which I do not plan to use) but it was annoying what happened.           \nI ordered granola bars, 2 tubs of cat litter, and some individual bagged pretzels, with 2 day shipping. Ordered on Monday, scheduled shipping Tuesday, delivery Thursday. First complaint was, this is not 2 days, but that's fine. The label was created Monday, and Fedex said it would leave Tuesday and arrive Wednesday. Neat! (Their facility is about 2.5-3 hours from me). However, that's when things went down hill. The package never left their facility. On Thursday, after it didn't arrive (when they told me, Fedex said Wednesday, so 1 day late) I emailed their customer service to say 'hey, I don't think my package shipped, can someone confirm?' Their response was \"wait a couple days it will probably show up.\" This was annoying, as I needed the damn cat litter.            \nLo and behold, it never shipped. I got an automated email Saturday saying nope, your stuff never shipped. So they would be doing a re-shipment. The box shipped Monday and I got it Tuesday. Unfortunately, they put all 4 of my items in the same box. The box pretty badly torn, and the cat litter smashed all the pretzels. I emailed and complained, and they sent me new pretezels, as well as store credit. I haven't gone back to them since. I may give them another shot in the future, but for now, I'll stick with Amazon.

We're not mediocre, we're kicking ass. I'm confident that we're one of the best vacation values on the planet in terms of what you get for your money. \n\nOur last customers of the season left this morning and so now we're essentially off until October.

{"id":"d4mk7v4","author":"isparavanje","body":"There are many people who care about progress more than profits. How about giving greenpeace unlimited funds? Or is it that you disagree with how greenpeace operates, and prefer Tesla?\n\nHis approach and work ethic *should* be rewarded. So go reward him by voting with your goddamned wallet, not by skirting the rules. You completely misunderstand how the market economy works. It's the equivalent of a democracy in the fiscal sense; if the people think a company is worth supporting, they will buy the products even if the products are slightly worse or slightly overpriced. And that *is* happening, mind you; the Tesla S is really good, but also really expensive for what it is, and people are still paying for it.\n\nHe doesn't lack the funding, not for Tesla. Tesla used to lack funding, not anymore. Right now, Tesla is bleeding money for the same reason Amazon was bleeding money for almost a decade till a couple years ago, that all profits are being funneled into expansion. It's not necessarily a bad thing if done right, companies in the expansionary phase aren't expected to make net profits. And if he lacks funding for Solar City, the democracy failed him, people don't like his product. If homeowners would rather not vote for his product with their wallets, then it makes no sense to use even more taxpayer money to support him. Your cause isn't the only cause, and a democracy is a democracy. Perhaps your approach is better in a totalitarian state. Maybe after Trump.\n\nSee, the thing about democracy is that if the ship is sinking but the people don't want to do anything about it, then nothing will be done. That is the nature of democracy. As someone in this system, the only thing you can do is a) try to educate people about the issues at hand, and b) vote. Similarly, in the market economy, you can vote for a company by buying the products. If the populace would rather not vote for a company by buying the products, why should the government foot the bill? The government is supposed to represent the people.\n\nNow, his practices are bad because he is undermining that system. He is in effect diluting the votes for Tesla, by putting them into a company the populace does not support. And the reason for not supporting Solar City is simple to digest; why should a homeowner bother with solar? Sure you might save a tiny amount of money if your utility company has nice policies and you live in an area with plentiful sunlight, but in the end it's more efficient to have solar farms and it's a whole lot of hassle anyway.\n\nYes, climate change is a unique problem. However, that doesn't undermine the core principles that the country is based on. If you prefer a non-representative approach where an autocratic government picks and chooses companies to fund, you could always go to China, renewable energy has been making a lot of inroads there (I'm not joking)\n\nFinally, you are way too absorbed into the personality cult of Musk. He's not a saint, and he's not a savior. He's a mostly ethical and very intelligent businessman. I give him credit for that. But he is not the sole driver of change. I have already mentioned repeatedly that the change has already been set in motion, and it will happen, with or without Musk. He is also not the best person in humanity; maybe one of the best, but even then, only a maybe. That doesn't change the fact that both the investors and the consumer market has spoken, no one likes the Solar City business model, and he shouldn't be using a more stable company to bail it out.\n\nIn short, you are an idealist when it comes to environmental issues, but either a ruthless pragmatist or an ignoramus when it comes to economic and political issues. A real idealist would recognize that democratic ideals are important as well, and that the environment needs saving, but within the democratic framework. If \"we, the people\" want to embrace climate change with open arms, then you have to work to change that, not try to get the government to enforce new rules in a non-democratic manner and cause a backlash.\n\nMost importantly, the core reason to not funnel unlimited funds into Tesla is because it is a listed company, and the shareholders are not government entities. In other words, eventually, the shareholders have veto power, and they are going to be able to vote Musk out whenever they want, and turn Tesla into a for profit enterprise operating solely for business profits but which has been uplifted by taxpayer funds. In a similar vein, there is no guarantee that Musk is altruistic now and will remain so forever. Hence, it is useful to put enough funds into Tesla that it begins to threaten the incumbents, so as to \"awaken the giants\", so to speak, but no more, for one should not be promoting a monopoly in any market. And the giants have been awoken, the major auto manufacturers are scrambling to get their own electric car lines out and negotiating charging infrastructure deals. In addition, Panasonic has ramped up battery production by almost an order of magnitude. Thus, Tesla has served its purpose as a driver of change, and has transitioned into a normal for-profit enterprise. It'll be sad if manufacturers who ignored electric cars stand to make more, but Tesla already has the first-comer's advantage. They earned it. And it's up to them to not throw it away.\n\nPlease actually read the points instead of reiterating your same tired arguments over and over again. You're halfway idealistic, but not really idealistic enough.","name":"t1_d4mk7v4","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-24 20:27:17","week":25}

If you are in an area where space isn't expensive, it might be slightly easier, but in a small town you are literally trying to create a market. I didn't even open the doors. \n\nWotC requires you to have a brick and mortar before they will allow you to purchase product from a distributor. That's difficult in and of itself, but ok. I can understand because they don't want people just buying wholesale and then glutting up eBay and Amazon with online only stores because they want to foster community. The problem is that once your doors are open, you are in it to the death. If your small profit margins don't cover your first handful of months, you are already screwed. Then you get Warhammer involved and it's a whole other can of worms. The rules that Games Workshop set up are ridiculous and the investment involved with getting their products in a store is also a pain in the ass. Combine that with small town thinking, a small market and peoples tendency to shop online for better prices and then just use your store as a place to meet up and play and possibly just make small purchases and trade and you are fighting a losing battle. \n\nLong story short (if this gives you any indication of how bad I found the market in a small town), I decided to actually open an arcade/family fun center instead.

They may have their own crappy product in the works, and it's easier to go ahead with crap than figure out how something superior works. \n\nAnd sometimes the smaller company product is complete crap and the company wants some key personnel instead. These are usually scientists and pioneering research and development engineers who may represent a decent percentage of anyone working in a cutting edge field. \n\nGo ahead and have your friend send the ideas. They'll end up in the trash. The company may later come out with some project they were going to do anyway that bears some slight resemblance, then your friend can get all excited about suing them. \n\nOnce he gets tired and has blown through any money he might have exploring legal recourse (he has none), tell him to post to [SomebodyMakeThis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/). \n\n== And Now The Finale ==\n\n\n[How Google Perfected the Silicon Valley Acquisition](http://time.com/3815612/silicon-valley-acquisition/) Google has used acquisitions to expand its workforce and launch new products since before it was a household name. Recently that strategy has become the modus operandi for technology firms in Silicon Valley. Facebook is using its fast-growing cash hoard to take control over sectors both adjacent to its core product (WhatsApp for $22 billion) and far-flung from social networking (Oculus VR for $2 billion). Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon are doing the same, making big-ticket bets by buying Minecraft developer Mojang ($2.5 billion), Tumblr ($1.1 billion) and video game streaming site Twitch ($970 million), respectively. Even Apple, which long eschewed splashy acquisitions in favor of much smaller, less public buys, says it bought at least 30 companies during the last fiscal year, including the $3 billion purchase of Beats.\n\nThat you and your friend appear to not know how ideas get into companies, this bodes ill for either of you turning an inquisitive eye towards how properly developed products get into a customer's hands, making for a rude awakening. It's not enough to have an idea you like, company executives and customers have to like them a whole lot too. That these two groups are as mysterious as the leprechaun or unicorn to idea guys is not a news flash to anybody. \n\n[Nobody Likes the “Idea Guy”](http://www.riskology.co/idea-guy/)\n\n[There's no room for The Idea Guy](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2188-theres-no-room-for-the-idea-guy) ","name":"t1_d4ndk8w","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-25 12:20:40","week":25}

This means that when you receive bitcoins, you recognize income in the amount of its current value at that time. So if the bitcoin is trading at $100/coin, you would recognize $100 of income. Then when you sell the bitcoin, you will have either a gain or loss. So if you later sell the bitcoin when it is trading at $200/coin, you will report $100 of gain on your taxes.\n\nAs far as how much taxes you will pay, it is going to be quite a bit. You will probably want to file a Schedule C (for Businesses) on your taxes.\n\nAll of your income will go on this form (whether cash or property), and your expenses will also be deductible. For instance the cost of your computer will probably be deductible, as might some of your living costs under the home office deduction, and anything you are buying for your work like any fees paid etc.\n\nThis will give you your net income for the year. Assuming $2000 cash/wk + $1000 Amazon/wk + $1200 bitcoin/wk, your total income would be $218,400 a year. From this amount you would subtract your expenses.\n\nOn the $218,400 you would pay 2 taxes. The first is Self employment taxes. This is calculated as a formula, but is around 15% ($32,760) for a good estimate.\n\nThe second tax you will pay is Federal income tax. At $218k of income, you are in a pretty high bracket. The total tax on that amount would be $56,000, and you would be in the 33% tax bracket.\n\nThis is all assuming no deductions or other items. You will also probably have some state taxes on top of this as well. A safe estimate of the amount of tax you will need to pay is probably around 45-50% of your total income (Self Employment tax+Federal+State). \n\nObviously I have simplified A LOT of stuff, but am more than willing to help out if you want more information.

{"id":"d4o88ed","author":"devospice","body":"If you want to be extra safe just take 30% of whatever cash you make and put it in a separate account then file your taxes quarterly.  The quarterly taxes are \"estimated\" payments and then at the end of the year when you file your taxes for the year everything gets reconciled and you'll get a refund or pay what you owe as per usual.  \n\nThe Amazon gifts complicate things a bit.  Don't take my word for it but I believe you have to claim the value of the gifts as income, so you may have to set aside a little extra from the cash income to cover it.  \n\nAnything you buy for your business is deductible.  Sex toys, lube, lingerie, whatever you happen to use is all deductible as a business expense.  Although you may want to separate your personal assets from your business assets and set up an LLC.  That's easy to do online through [LegalZoom](http://www.legalzoom.com/) or [BizFilings](http://www.bizfilings.com/).\n\nTaxes really aren't that hard to figure out once you get into it, but as other people have said it would probably be a good idea to get a professional CPA to help you out.  \n\nGood luck, and congrats on the success!","name":"t1_d4o88ed","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-26 04:53:03","week":25}

If they have a bunch of black grease around them, or if they look torn, REPLACE THEM IMMEDIATELY. \n\nYou can buy a set of new ones for the driver and passenger's side for around $100 on Amazon.

I was relieved to see this because I am considering moving somewhere that I won't have access to Menards on a regular basis anymore.","name":"t1_d4otz1r","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-26 20:06:04","week":25}
{"id":"d4ov2uj","author":"uptonbum","body":"Socks, underwear, dog food, occasional small kitchen appliances, a nice Chromebook, bedding, towels, suitcases, umbrellas. \n\nThere are even great foam mattresses for $300ish or less (I have one - love it) on Amazon. Maybe a new cell phone when yours dies or it's time to get another. Rechargeable batteries. Velcro/hook-n-loop tape. OTC medication. Backup battery packs. Air conditioners, fans, space heaters, shower curtain liners.\n\nEssentially anything that pops up that you'd need to buy. \n\nFor the items you think you might want to buy, keep them sitting in your cart and check them every once in a while to see if prices have fluctuated.\n\nWhile Amazon Pantry prices are sometimes more expensive than the stores available via Google Express, there *are* routine sales and items can be purchased for cheap on Amazon. Last week I stocked up on TP, toothpaste, deodorant, body wash and snacks for way cheaper than I thought possible. For me, I've had good luck checking every week to see what's on sale or has an available coupon.","name":"t1_d4ov2uj","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-26 20:36:41","week":25}
{"id":"d4ow6wk","author":"Bittergrrl","body":"I'm in Canada and I use a shipping company that carries my packages over the US border and ships them USPS. After using them for the last four months, this week they really hurt my feelings when they told me it's against their policy to ship to Amazon.com FBA warehouses.  There goes my main source of flipping income :-(","name":"t1_d4ow6wk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-26 21:07:34","week":25}
{"id":"d4oxqbj","author":"pogirl","body":"What's the best place to sell a slide projector? I have a Kodak Carousel 4600 Projector that I got for free at a yard sale. I see 'em on Amazon/Ebay for ~$50, but I don't think I have all the parts so I'll probably sell it for ~$20. I just am not sure where someone would buy it or who I'm looking to sell to... I'm in New Orleans and I'd rather not ship it, but if that's how to get the best profit then I guess I will.","name":"t1_d4oxqbj","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-26 21:49:57","week":25}
{"id":"d4oxr27","author":"SecularNotLiberal","body":"Do you like art? Go online to poster sites and find ones you like. Cheap frames can be had at target or online for $10 or less. \n\nAmazon also sells some lightweight big tapestries and drapes for $15 or so that you can hang up in your apartment to give it a splash of color and to decorate the walls. I have about 3 tapestries in my bedroom. ","name":"t1_d4oxr27","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-26 21:50:29","week":25}
{"id":"d4oygo9","author":"superfly360","body":"If you plan on selling more than a couple things, they're pretty much necessary. Even a cheap inkjet will be sufficient, along with a ~$20 scale which you can get from Amazon. They will more than pay themselves off within your first few sales, from savings on shipping, gas, and time.","name":"t1_d4oygo9","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-26 22:10:01","week":25}
{"id":"d4oyzs3","author":"oscarpaca","body":"Just ask a parent to set up an account for you. I honestly doubt eBay would even give a shit, even if they found out, which is incredibly unlikely. The only platforms really worth selling on are places with a big user base, or sites that are specifically for those items (e.g Poshmark for clothes) otherwise your best bets are eBay, Amazon and Craigslist.","name":"t1_d4oyzs3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-26 22:24:31","week":25}

{"id":"d4p25pp","author":"kvn9765","body":"It's very difficult to advance in a no growth company or field (advancement through death), it's best to work at a company that's growing.  For example, if you were a nobody but got a job at Amazon &amp; just happened to get in early on the AWS team, your odds to success greatly improve.  Making 6 figures before age 30 is doable, I did it.... but it involves a good deal of luck.","name":"t1_d4p25pp","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-26 23:49:27","week":25}
{"id":"d4p2e5r","author":"ihatenuts","body":"From the Amazon Book Review\n\n&gt; It might be easy to say that a book so replete with spelling and grammatical errors on nearly every page should not be taken seriously as a work of literature. NO! This is shortsighted and ignorant. Much like Lorne Armstrong, the man, Lorne, the novel, is a monumentally flawed creature. But this is by design. Trevor, a French Canadian, whose native tongue is not English, I believe deliberately avoided proofreading or spellchecking the final manuscript as a tribute to its imperfect subject. At some point, the myriad of errors simply becomes part of the novel and enhances the story. It reminds us: who are we to judge? This was a brilliant play by Trevor.","name":"t1_d4p2e5r","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-06-26 23:55:51","week":25}
