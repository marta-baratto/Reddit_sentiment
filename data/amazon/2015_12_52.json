{"id":"3xmvor","author":"MrEngleman","body":"This is the business opportunity I see.\n\nProbably many of us have heard of companies that produce book abstracts for busy business people. \n\nBut businessmen are not the only busy people in the world. We are all busy. So I'm not sure why the popular summary services like getabstract only focus on business people. And even if some people are not busy, everyone likes the opportunity to use their time more efficiently and get more done in less time.\n\nSecondly, regular people may not care so much for business books, but one thing do they care about is improving their lives, which is why the self-help/self-improvement industry brings in $10 billion a year in the US alone.\n\nThere are many self-help books out there that are worth their weight in gold in the help and wisdom they provide, but many people are overwhelmed with all the self-help material out there and do not know which particular books would be best for them. And even more importantly, many people do not have the time or focus to read a 200-300 page book.\n\nSo what if I pick 10 popular self-help books, turn them each into 4-5 page abstracts, and then put all the abstracts together into a slim, non-imposing book titled something like \"The top 10 self-help books of 2014: Read them all in just 50 pages\". New editions could be released each year. And I could do releases focused on particular topics, like \"The top 5 books on defeating procrastination of 2014\".\n\nIt could become a series like the \"For Dummies\" series, titled something like \"Without the Fluff\".\n\nI understand that publishing companies might be worried about canalization but there are several companies that already convince publishers to give them abstract rights. \n\nFor example, according to getAbstract's website, they started their business with 100 abstracts in 2000 and now they have 10,000 abstracts in their library and relationships with over 450 publishers:\n&gt; We work with renowned publishers such as Penguin/Random House, Hachette, McGraw-Hill, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Perseus, Simon &amp; Schuster and more than 450 others. Our publishing partners send us regular updates on future titles as well as their latest catalogs.\n\nTheir success proves that there is a way to convince not just some, but lots of publishers that cannibalization won't be an issue.\n\nI want to basically do exactly what they are doing, but with a different genre and I want to put several of the abstracts together in one book that can be ordered off Amazon, so people don't have to figure out themselves which books are the best.  \n","name":"t3_3xmvor","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-21 00:36:19","week":52}

{"id":"3xnd0d","author":"mk712","body":"Hey folks,\n\nFollowing the [Visa checkout reminder](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3xkyrp/reminder_15_visa_checkout_promo_chase_freedom/), here are a few other reminders of things you should do before the end of the year.\n\n**1) Activate the Q1 categories on all your 5% rotating cards**\n\nSeriously, do it now or you'll forget, it only takes 30 seconds:\n\n* [Chase Freedom](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/activate)\n\n* [Discover It](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html)\n\n* [US Bank Cash+](https://cashplus.usbank.com/?redirect=cashplus)\n\n* [Citi Dividend](https://citi.com/credit-cards/template.do?ID=dividend-quarterly-offer)\n\n**2) Use the airline reimbursements on your eligible cards**\n\n* Amex PRG ($100) and Amex Platinum ($200). Don't forget to select an airline before you make the charge. Refer to the FlyerTalk dedicated threads to see what works and what doesn't for each airline: [Alaska Airlines](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1300459-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-only.html), [American Airlines](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1646825-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-aa-only.html), [Delta](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1300461-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-dl-only.html), [Hawaiian Airlines](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1380649-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-ha-only.html), [JetBlue](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1300475-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-b6-only.html), [United](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1646865-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-ua-only.html) and [Southwest](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-express-membership-rewards/1300482-200-airline-fee-reimbursement-reports-wn-fl-only.html).\n\n* Citi Prestige ($250). Careful with this one as Citi looks at the statement end date rather than the transaction date, so the charge would have to post before your December statement ends for it to count... in other words, it is most likely too late. If your statement ends late December then you still have time: *anything* charged directly by an airline should count for the reimbursement.\n\n* Citi Expedia+ Voyager ($100). Based on the statement date, so same warning as the Prestige.\n\n* Chase Ritz Carlton ($300). They've been tightening things up with gift cards so careful with that, but if you are flying for the holidays it's a great opportunity to upgrade your seats. Here's the official [list of eligible expenses](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/24994121-post2343.html), and refer to the [full FlyerTalk thread](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/chase-ultimate-rewards/1356263-all-ritz-carlton-rewards-card-offers-consolidated.html) for the latest data points on non-eligible expenses.\n\n* City National Bank Crystal Visa Infinite ($250 on each card including AU), again refer to the [FlyerTalk thread](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/credit-card-programs/1676781-city-national-bank-crystal-visa-infinite-usa-ny-de-ga-tn-nv-ca-exp-12-31-15-a.html).\n\n**3) Use your expiring Amex offers**\n\nThere are a bunch of good Amex offers expiring December 31st that you might have added to your cards and forgotten. Notable examples:\n\n* $10 off $200 on Amex gift cards ([combine with coupon and portal cashback](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3vj3cu/manufactured_spending_saturday_week_of_december/cxnymkv) for ~7% total discount)\n\n* $25 off $200 at NewEgg (they sell VGCs, you should be able to get 2 x $100 VGCs for $189.89 after activation fees and shipping fees)\n\n* $20 off $199 at Best Buy (only excludes e-gift cards and corporate gift cards, so regular gift cards will work)\n\n* $10 off $20 on Uber (don't drink and drive!)\n\n* $15 off $60 at Amazon (Amazon balance reload would trigger it)\n\n* $50 off $100 at AirBnB (gift cards work but it's not straightforward, refer to the existing threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3weg9f/amex_airbnb_offer_not_redeeming_when_buying_a_gc/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3rcl07/amex_offers_50_off_when_you_spend_100_at_airbnb/) for details)\n\nHappy holidays!","name":"t3_3xnd0d","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-12-21 02:56:30","week":52}

{"id":"3xs64x","author":"jtstowell","body":"I entered this trade on Sunday (it filled this morning), good-'til-cancelled, bidding a bit less than ask on the basis that volatility and time decay were my friend. And here's why: I walked into a Wal-Mart store over the weekend.\n\n\nI had planned to purchase a small gift or two, just browsing around the store for items I thought might be appreciated. I've been to this particular store many times before, and it's generally clean, well-maintained, has a reasonably friendly staff, and stocks decent quality merchandise.\n\n\nThe place--and I realize this is not an original observation on a larger scale--was a total shit-show. It must be under new management. The floors were dirty, the merchandise dominating the Christmas displays was cheap garbage, and the workers looked utterly depressed, exhausted and unhappy. If this is even partly representative of how Wal-Mart as a whole is being run these days, they're fucked.\n\n\nI bought a sack of potatoes and some bananas, and left. There was nothing in that store that I wanted to burden anyone with as a \"gift.\" (Not entirely true: there were some flash drives that were priced right, but they were locked to the display and I would have had to talk to one of the unhappy workers, who weren't even around when I needed them.)\n\n\nI also left with the impression that their earnings call in February is going to be a bloodbath.

I was thinking about how I can start utilizing and engaging this momentum to keep building upon my social instead of just posting and waiting, and contests came to mind.\n\nDo you think it'd be too early to start a small contest, having people enter by following us on Instagram, or sharing our website on their social networks? Should I wait a little longer until our following is a bit stronger? ","name":"t3_3xxfbz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-23 06:12:48","week":52}
{"id":"3xxnwq","author":"bowserstein","body":"I've been selling stuff on eBay for a few years, but maybe had about $1000 in sales tops each year. Mostly just getting rid of some games or stuff I was done playing.\n\nBut this year I got into flipping some stuff because I found a market and really went after it as hard as I could. I'm ending the year with about $80,000 in revenue with a pretty decent ROI (about 30-40% I'm guessing). My question is... how much of a nightmare will taxes be next year?\n\nAll my sales were through eBay and Amazon, so there is a record of everything for the entire year. I would buy all my shipping supplies and stuff through eBay or Amazon, and always printing my shipping through the sites as well, so there should be a good record of all that too. I just have a feeling that there's something I'm missing with this as I've never dealt with this volume of sales before. I really have no idea how taxes with this stuff works at all. Could someone please guide me on how to handle this so that I don't lose money, or worse, get in legal trouble? I'll be around to answer any questions to help give more context if needed.

I asked my friend to order it for me (who lives there and has Prime). The phone turned out to be defective and I called Amazon. Their CC \"transferred\" that order to mine as a gift and instead of cash, gave me GC balance. I cannot transfer out this balance to another account nor can I use it (since I am no longer in the US). Instead, I now have ~ $300 stuck which I desperately need the cash for. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions how I can do this?

{"id":"3xypdj","author":"Landohh","body":"So as the title states, I have a bunch of debt and I just don't know how to deal with it anymore.  I'm living week by week, working a job that I can't stand only making 12.75/hr.  I don't have any education under my belt other than a High School Diploma.  \n\n6 thousand of it is my car loan which I have refinanced once already and got my rate down from the initial 13% to 8.2%.  That loan is now through my credit union. \n\nOne credit card is through another credit union and I had to take it out because I had to put a new motor in said car.  I couldn't afford it and they wouldn't give me a loan because my (then) credit score at the time didn't have a long enough history/wasn't high enough.  The rate on that one is 18%\n\nThe rest is credit card debt I have accumulated over the past 3 years due to horrible spending practices.  I was living on my own and the months I couldn't afford stuff I just through it on my cards.  I was incredibly stupid and opened up an Amazon Store card, another credit card through my credit union, and two credit cards through Capital One.  My initial plan when I got my first one was to use it sparingly and build p a good credit score.  Well, as you have been reading, I did not follow that practice and now face what seems like an absolute wall of debt that I don't see a way of working around.\n\nI've given up at this point.  I can't get a better job because of my education.  I just did a bunch of damage to my car and have no way to pay for the probably $600+ repair i'm going to need to fix it.  My payments ad up to more than 350/month and that's making just over the minimum payment.\n\nBankruptcy seems like a valid option to me at this point.  My credit score will be ruined, and it will be pretty hard for me to get anything I need out of anything (housing loan, apartment, anything) but I really don't see another choice.\n\nI live at home with my parents.  The 3 years I talked about earlier is when I moved out with my girlfriend at the time.  We had plans to get married but after our third year she dumped on me that we weren't going to continue to live together, that she was mad at me for where I was in my life, and that she was seeing a friend of mine.  So I was forced to move back home about 6 months ago and just deal with it.\n\nI can't continue living like this.  I've tried budgeting and I've tried literally spending NOTHING except for on bills.  I'm still drowning with what looks like no escape.\n\nIf you guys can give me another route other than bankruptcy or something (like winning the lottery)\n\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all of the solid advice guys.  You are definitely right.  There is no easy way out of this so I just need to accept what needs to be done and get to it.  I guess I needed the kind words more than anyting","name":"t3_3xypdj","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-23 15:05:14","week":52}

{"id":"3xzh2g","author":"buyhomeorpaysloans","body":"Currently I have about $50k in savings, mostly recently received from an inheritance, but some from savings. I am totally debt free aside from ~$35k in student loan debt, all government provided, no private loans.  I make about $40k/year but am likely to have a raise/promotion to about $45-50k by mid next year (2016).\n\n\nI am conflicted on what to do about paying off my loans as I also want to purchase my fist home very soon. For reference I live in a “boom” city where housing prices are skyrocketing and do not look to be dropping or even leveling out any time soon. I can still purchase a decent home for about $200k in a half decent neighborhood that will likely become very desirable neighborhood in about five years from now.  If current trends remain a $200k home will be worth two to three times as much in 5-7 years. I am not looking to flip it though. I just don’t want to be priced out of the market completely as I am afraid I will be within a couple of years.  I am located in Austin, Texas so I do not expect a downturn or bubble popping as three of the top tech companies (Apple, Oracle, Amazon) are building large offices to employs thousands within about 6 miles of the neighborhood I am looking at.\n\n\nI would likely have a roommate for the first couple of years of having the mortgage that I would charge around $600/month for rent, which would significantly decrease the economic burden. \nWhich would make more sense, Pay the entire loan, pay most of the loan leaving around $10k left af a low interest rate ~3%, or dump most into the down payment of a house and just keep making monthly payments on my student loans (around $300)?\n\n\nAlso, is it reasonable/possible to attempt to settle the loans for a lesser amount while not in default?\n","name":"t3_3xzh2g","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-23 18:45:33","week":52}

{"id":"3y000n","author":"gr8sk8","body":"Hello fellow flippers,\n\nI recently received my first INAD case and need some good advice on how to deal with it.  I listed a rather higher-end messenger bag new with tags on eBay, took detailed photos viewed from all sides, inside &amp; out, &amp; even embedded a youtube review (not mine) describing the bag, it's features, &amp; how it looks in use in the real world. My listed measurements matched the manufacturer's product description page, the Amazon product page, and any other page I'd found that describes the bag for sale.  The buyer who bought it received it quickly via USPS Priority, then messaged me a few days later thanking me for the wondeful bag, but stated they had made some \"error\" in the way they \"pre-measured\" for the bag and that it was too big for them and asked if they could return it. The item was listed without returns accepted, so I messaged them back saying I wasn't sure how to proceed since the item was listed without a return option and would have to call eBay about it. I asked if they could clarify about their \"error in pre-measurement\" (what they said didn't make sense to me) and also asked if they still had the product tags and whether they were still attached to the bag. I didn't get any answer to my questions from them, a couple of days passed and ding, the buyer opened an INAD case. In their message to eBay they said the bag's measurements were significantly different than what I listed, they added a couple of inches to the height and and length and said they need to return it. To give them the benefit of the doubt, if they're measuring the item flat and empty I can imagine the height and length of the bag might borrow some material from the width and have such exaggerated numbers, but the bag is a 3-dimensional object and the measurements are given as if the item were in use. Not sure what good a flat bag would be to anyone. So I replied to the case with links to the manufacturer's page, the amazon page and verbosely described how they may have measured in error. The case seems like either buyer remorse or they may have bought it as a gift for someone who didn't want it. Of course, I didn't say any of that, but did ask my questions again about their \"pre-measurement\" comment about measuring prior to purchase, and asked about the tags, none of which have been answered yet.  The case escalation date has come and gone and I don't know how to proceed, still radio silence from the buyer. The last conversation with an eBay rep assured me in broken english as best I could understand that I could be assured that when escalated the crack team of professionals at eBay would conduct diligent research and find in my favor, but I know that's a load of malarkey. From what I've read on /r/flipping it feels like most cases go in the buyer's favor or worse even when there's insurmountable evidence to the contrary. Without any communication from the buyer and the case still open, I can't do anything except accept the return and lose shipping both ways and possibly get a used item back in place of the new one or worse get an empty box of nothing back. The lower eBay reps said that I could escalate the case myself, but what's the likelihood of common sense prevailing? If by some Christmas miracle eBay sides with me, can they buyer still open a case with Paypal?  If not, they can most certainly still dispute it with their credit card - would an eBay case closed in my favor carry any weight there?  Even if closed in my favor, is there any mechanism for me to still work something out with the buyer - it feels like it would be better to lose a few bucks in the short term and get the bag back rather than lose a cc chargeback, lose all the money and even the bag as well.  The item's sale price was a little less than 2/3 of Amazon's price, if I were to get the bag back new there might be room to make back a few bucks of any losses.\n\nThis is where the wisdom and hindsight of /r/flipping would have helped me. If I had had a return policy and established process in place defining that the buyer pays original and return shipping and even a re-stocking fee would have helped absorb a lot of this hassle. It doesn't help in an INAD case, but it might have helped avoid the case altogether, if this were truly a buyer mistake or buyer remorse and they followed the return process honestly.\n\nBesides a return policy is there any other way to protect myself against chargebacks with Paypal, or is there any better, safer way to accept money from strangers? It's unnerving read all chargeback or scam horror stories and to walk around for up to 6 months with the Sword of Damocles hanging over our heads, that any previous purchase might be reversed  without merit or even the item's return with a simple string of lies. While the pen may mightier than the sword, is a (false) tongue mightiest of all?\n\nSo what collective wisdom does /r/flipping have to offer?\n\nTL;DR: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good fight!","name":"t3_3y000n","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-23 21:01:26","week":52}

{"id":"3y36ut","author":"GoldenTileCaptER","body":"To get a few things out of the way:\n- I realize I took out student loans willingly\n- I realize I don't have it the worst in the world\n\nAt 26, I finally have a decent salary, $45k which I think is pretty legit for someone starting in my field (government, environment, education/outreach), but I am basically paycheck to paycheck. Thanks to a previous job where I was able to save 50% of my net pay, I have a safe buffer in my accounts in case I miss a paycheck, but it's not enough to live on beyond a month. I feel like I'm stuck constantly. My net worth is basically stationary. Cost of living is very high where I live and work, and it's a landlord's market. Everyone wants a F/L/S and there is no negotiating. I'm living with ~$80k in student loans due to going to an expensive state school, feeling invincible as an 18y/o, poor guidance, lower-middle class parents who couldn't help me with college (besides co-signing) but somehow made too much money for me to qualify for free aid, and the ridiculous cost of education these days. Due to previously mentioned poor paying but profitable job, I am currently only paying on $50k of my $80k in loans (not paying the government loans). Am I going to be burdened with this for the rest of my youth? How do I mentally overcome this? It's beautiful outside, I live on a south florida island, but I am stuck inside worrying about money and trying to not spend any more of it.\n\ntl;dr\n\nhow do you overcome the crushing weight of student loans or debt in general? Am i missing some great resource to help people with this? I have incredible credit somehow, but SoFi recently rejected my appeal to refinance half of my private student loans (which would have lowered my monthly payment AND reduced my payback time) so I'm back to square one. I am now in the top earning percentages in my area, yet I can still barely afford to live in a 1br apartment with a girlfriend, buy food, and pay my loans. Forget saving for a new car or enjoying the island life around me, thinking about home ownership, or having a dog until I'm in my mid thirties. Halp, pf.\n\nEDIT: Working on formatting a budget here. Will get back.\n\nEDIT: 1.) This is from YNAB and the numbers are my 3-month averages (Since that's when I moved and started this job), I've been using YNAB for almost a year at this point. I stick to it pretty well. If there are ($##) next to something, that's what I try to contribute and stick to for the month. Some of the things (like Alcohol, fishing license, junk food, household goods, and holiday) are much higher than they normally will be due to having just moved and it being the holiday season.\n\nEDIT: 2.) I'd also appreciate advice on whether I should look into purchasing a house down here. I plan to stay in this job (if I can afford to...) for probably at least 5 years. Zillow says mortgage+total cost of ownership could put a 2br/1ba house around $1200/month. Is that even an option to be looking into that? Finding a down payment will be tough, but I'm handy, not too worried about maintenance/furnishings/etc. I just need a roof basically.\n\nAlso, should I keep making interest+ a little payments on the federal loans? That would definitely mean no chance at saving up for a down payment or anything really at this point. I think I can count on 120 payments worth of non-profit/public sector work safely, it just depends on if my IBR payment will go up.\n\nIncome\t\n\nWork #1\t$2892.81\n\nMechanical Turk\t$2.86\n\nAmazon.com\t$0.13\n\nChange Jar\t$6.08\n\nCredit Union\t$2.00\n\nTotal Income\t$2946.55\n\n\t-----------------------\n\nExpenses\t\n\nGroceries ($300)\t-$181.89\n\nInternet ($33)\t-$7.47\n\nRent ($1300) + $100\t-$1483.33\n\nStudent Loans ($900/month)\t-$530.00\n\nInsurance/Registration ($45/6 months)\t-$75.51\n\nFuel ($50)\t-$64.04\n\nCar Repairs and Stuff ($30)\t-$7.17\n\nBetterment.com ($100)\t-$100.00\n\nTaxes and Fees ($30/12 months)\t-$8.37\n\nHolidays and Gifts ($15/$100)\t-$42.48\n\nMedical/HSA ($1500 Deductible)\t-$14.58\n\nBuffer\t$10.97\n\nPO Box ($5/$56)\t-$24.03\n\nHousehold Goods ($12)\t-$46.45\n\nLifetime Saltwater Fishing License ($305)\t-$6.41\n\nRestaurants ($50)\t-$61.28\n\nFishing\t-$6.00\n\nGarden\t-$5.83\n\nRecreation\t-$13.70\n\nBooks\t-$7.15\n\nPlan To Eat\t-$13.00\n\nAlcohol ($20)\t-$19.56\n\nEntertainment\t-$1.43\n\nJunk Food\t-$16.27\n\nTotal Expenses\t-$2877.13\n\n---------------\n\nNet Income\t$69.43\n","name":"t3_3y36ut","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-24 16:21:00","week":52}

{"id":"3y55tr","author":"slothery","body":"I don't know if it's luck or karma or something else but I have the worst time with trying to be financially independent. \n\nSome quick examples:\nI did some research on shoes as the numbers seem to look really good. Nike is the #1 in its market and even Nikes own customers made more last year reselling Nikes than the #2 business. Considering this, I thought it would be good to start reselling them. More research pointed me to a pretty good direction and bought a few pairs of special / limited release shoes without much success of reselling. \n\nI've also tried selling and reselling used iPads and such without much success either. There doesn't seem to be a lot of competition in my area either.  \n\nI am not sure if I am just expecting too much too fast or if I don't have well planned out marketing ideas. My budget is pretty low as I work full time with a 2.5 kids, wife, and house setup.  I don't know if more research is the answer, more money or what. I ALWAYS have a ton of ideas but no way or means to kick them into action. I constantly look on alibaba to see if there something I can \"just start with\" and I look to Amazon all the time with top/hot items that may be good to sell.  It seems too, the areas I know well, cars, electronics, tools, shoes are always so flooded.  I do have a problem with pretty much any competition where if there is any in a market, I don't like to touch it.  It's depressing bc there are really good areas I can make money I think but my mind says there is already too many people taking your business away. \n\nMy luck just works out to be a \"buy high, sell low\", wrong time/ market mind.  I can't seem to make sense of this pattern and it's really frustrating me.  I do tons of research but nothing is paying off.\n\nI would appreciate any advise! Thoughts, concerns, and especially suggestions and thought pattern changes.\n\nThanks so much!","name":"t3_3y55tr","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-25 03:27:43","week":52}

The company is also engineering its own unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, with the intention of delivering packages.\n\nAll of these developments indicate that Amazon does not want to rely on third-party shippers like FedEx and UPS.

{"id":"3y96wq","author":"SJ0","body":"**Best Cashback on Amazon**\n\n*work in progress, please correct and/or add information when possible*\n\n**Occasional 5% via Rotating Category**\n\n1. **Chase Freedom** offers 5% cashback on Amazon in 4th quarter. When you \nuse Freedom, you earn Ultimate Reward (UR) points and the points do not expire.\n2. **Discover IT**  offers 5% cashback on Amazon in 4th quarter. You earn flat out cashback.\n\n*Note:* The 5% cashback is generally offered for up to first $1,500 spending. These things may change as these programs often attempt to compete with each other.\n\n*Which is better?*\n\n* If you only value cash, then both are basically equivalent. \n* However, if you equip your Freedom with Ink+ or CSP and wish to redeem your Ultimate Reward points for travel, then Freedom is better.\n* But, generally speaking, more or less everyone has and should get both of this cards. Both cards complement each other very well.\n\n**The Discontinued Beasts**\n\n*The following cards are discontinued and can no longer be obtained:* \n\n1. **Citi Forward** offers 5% cashback on bookstore (which includes amazon). When you use Forward, you earn Thank You (TY) points and the points expire after 5 (?) years.\n2. **Barclays Sallie Mae** offers 5% cashback on books (amazon included) for first $750 each month. You earn flat out cashback. \n\n*Which is better?*  \n\n* If you only value cash, then Sallie Mae is better since TY points are not 1:1 i.e. 1 point is not equal to 1 cent. However, do note that you can get 1:1 value if you redeem for loan, mortgages, etc. \n* If you have Thank You Premier or Prestige card and wish to redeem for travel, then TY points are more valuable. \n* There were some old data points suggesting, at times, 5% was not generated on amazon via Forward. When in doubt, buy amazon gift card.\n* If you have either of these cards, keep them forever. They're one of the no annual fee cashback card till date.\n\n**What Else?**\n\n1. **US Bank Cash +** offers 5% category on bookstore (which includes amazon). You've to select bookstore category every quarter. This card offers flat out cashback.\n\n2. **Amazon Rewards Visa** by Chase offers 3% on amazon.\n\n3. **Amazon Store Card** offers 5% statement credit for amazon prime users.\n\n*Which is better?*  \n\n* You should pretty much never use Amazon Reward Visa on amazon since you will most likely be accepted for at least one 5% card.\n* Amazon Store Card should be avoided for pretty much the same reason as above. You can easily find a credit card that gives you 5% at amazon and more!\n* There were some old data points suggesting, at times, 5% was not generated on amazon via Cash+. If in doubt, buy amazon gift card.\n\n**The Hard Way - Requires Leg Work**\n\nYou may use other credit cards to buy amazon gift cards at stores.\n\n1. **Ink Plus/Cash** offers 5% at office supply stores (ex staples). So, you can buy amazon gift card at staples and thus effectively earn 5% cashback. Note Ink Plus/Cash earns UR points.\n2. **Blue Cash Preferred** offers 6% at grocery stores so you can do as above. However, this card has an annual fee of $75.\n3. **SimplyCash from Amex** is similar to Ink except it is issed by Amex and earns cash back.\n\n*Which is better?*\n\n* I think Plus/Cash is a must have for it offers 5% on essential bills as well. However, I do understand that Blue Cash Preferred can be a good choice for some, in which case go ahead and make a use of it for amazon as well.\n* SimplyCash is a good substitute to Ink. However, do note that Ink earns UR and thus can be more valuable should you choose to for travel.\n\n**How do I use it?**  \n1. Freedom when possible (I value UR points more than TY points)  \n2. Forward will be next in line (I value TY point above 1 cent)  \n3. Next, Sallie Mae since (in my experience) it always gives me 5% at amazon.\n\n**A Closing Note:**\n\nIf you're making big purchases, do it with a credit card (as opposed to gift card) that provides price protection, return, extends warranty, etc.","name":"t3_3y96wq","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-12-26 05:55:44","week":52}

{"id":"cy68ntc","author":"TerranBarron","body":"Comparing these stocks against each other is strange. They're all in very different industries (except FB and GOOG). \n\nBut I'll bite on the speculative analysis since I enjoy shooting myself in the foot by procrastinating on some work I'm shockingly behind in. \n\nNote that I'm ignoring conversations of PE simply because the argument that \"everything is priced in\" is true. It's absolutely true that AMZN is priced as if it'll own global retail. GOOG is absolutely priced as if it's ads will globally dominate. But your question about bubble-type behavior is basically asking \"what will cause analysts to question their fundamental assumptions on these companies.\" So I'll provide a fairly qualitative analysis. \n\nI think of these companies in the following ways. \n\n1) NFLX\n\nNetflix probably has the weakest moat of all 3 companies. Their strength is their clear ubiquity. It's on every platform and built into most modern TVs and that's their biggest strength for the short term. The concern is obviously that their content deals are completely unprotected. The only barrier to a competing streaming service is money. And all of the companies looking into creating a streaming service have way bigger pockets than Netflix. I don't know if there's any secret sauce that Netflix has that allowed the creation of things like House of Cards, but I suspect that if Amazon offered David Finch and Kevin Spacey an extra $10 million, the show would jump ship in an instant (ignoring obvious contract exclusivity). Which all comes back to Netflix's strength... Its huge user base and effective \"default\" service for most paying customers. To me, the biggest risk to this are all the $35 pucks, sticks, and chrome casts. How much protection does the \"default\" provide if a $35 dongle makes it irrelevant? This is why analysts are watching subscriber growth so closely. There's a constant worry about users tipping to new/other services. So, that's what I'd think about if you're looking for a big bubble-type drop. I'm not sure I can see any bubble-type jump though obviously profits and  subscriber growth (particularly in new high value markets) would be a good thing. \n\n2) AMZN\n\nTo me, AMZN is in the best industry. People like to talk about smartphone growth and online advertising growth, but e commerce often gets ignored in these conversations. In developed (and developing nations) e commerce continues to grow 25-40% a year and unlike those other 2 industries, there's no sign of it slowing anytime. Furthermore, in western countries, AMZN has a near monopoly. And to make e commerce even more impressive compared to smartphones and online advertising, look at the potential market. Smartphones are nearly saturated in developed countries. Online advertising is a bit more complicated, but by some metrics, the addressable market is saturating. For E commerce, in the US (the most mature market), e commerce only accounts for 10% of retail sales. So if you think the e commerce market will eventually grow to be 60% of retail sales, that's 6x growth for AMZN. Of course, this is all priced into AMZN ridiculous stock price. So basically, I think AMZN is the hardest stock to buy confidently. Everyone knows that e commerce is the future and no one knows how AMZN won't dominate that future BUT no one knows how big and how fast that future will arrive. So if you're looking for a drop you only need to look for 2 things. How fast is e commerce growing and how much does Amazon control that market. Profits are an aside that can lead to significant drops, but the real concern will be with the size market itself. Since that's the real goal of all the analysts high prices. Basically, if next Christmas online sales growth drops from this year's 25+% down to 5%, except the stock to crash. (Yes, in aware that in ignoring AWS. While probably important overall, it's not particularly important to the bubble conversation)\n\n3) FB\n\nA monopoly on personal relationships, and a proven ability to monetize on them. Seems like a great business from my perspective (though extremely creepy). I don't know this company that well, but their numbers are impressive. The management has been shockingly prescient at predicting/anticipating the market. (The Instagram buy has got to be one of the smartest buys in the current age of Internet companies. Securing s spot in the messaging wars with WhatsApp wasn't too shabby either). I think the stock is assumed to have a monopoly, and analysts are just watching to see how well they can monetize. I don't think there's any near term risk to the social network so it's just a numbers game. Obviously large subscriber decreases would be the best time to short, but at least to my eyes, that seems impossible anytime soon. \n\n4) GOOG\n\nSlowing growth and weakening IP (web search is obviously less valuable than it once was), but it has plenty of other tricks up it's sleeve. I find GOOG to be a very scary stock to own personally. Last quarter clearly showed they have plenty of ways to make profit, but I constantly worry about existential threats to their moat. Search is great, and services are great, and Internet is growing, but GOOG has weak spots. Internet is growing dramatically in places like China. But GOOG has effectively zero presence there. I worry that this trend will continue with other growing countries like Africa. (Though their recent pushes into India is a good sign that they're trying hard to fix this problem). Ads are continuing to grow, but they still show very little ability to monetize outside of North America. Looking at their financials, provide a somewhat shocking picture of how undiversified their profits are. To me, it remains to be proven that web ads can be monetized as well in countries other than the US. IF, I see strong profit growth in countries outside of the US, than that's a clear indicator to me that GOOGs business does have the ability to scale globally. Currently, that's not clear to me. The greatest recent success that GOOG has shown is clearly Android. Without Android ALL of these threats would  be 100x worse. The web would be transitioning to a closed platform that GOOG would have no direct presence in (apps). Amazingly, GOOG's success in cutting off global iPhone domination secured their presence in this current generation of Internet usage. Hence, their successful monetization of mobile. (As an aside, I think this is a great sign of the agility and foresight of the management considering that modern Android was a reaction to the iPhone. Though of course, this comes after the failure to anticipate or out maneuver Facebook and other social networks). So, if you're looking for a bubble, look for continued drops in Adwords monetization as well as lack of monetization in regions outside of the US, or signs of FB directly eating into Adwords. And I guess if there's a drastic drop in Android (prolly impossible). If you're looking for a bubble-like jump, look for ads to boom in areas outside of the US or some successful way to monetize the Internet in China.

{"id":"cy6qpm6","author":"DigiSmackd","body":"There are several extensions that do this and much more.  \n\nCamelcamelcamel, Priceblink, etc.. I use both of those.  In addition to letting you know of a lower price, you can also set up alerts and see some price history.\n\nThe key is in the ones that cover the largest variety - limiting yourself to checking just one competitor isn't much due diligence.  (Don't mean that as a knock to your extension, but as a general rule when price comparing) :)\n\n\n*further note:  These apps may indeed be a dime a dozen because of the incentive for devs to inject their referral/affiliate codes into their \"results\" means a very lucrative extension for them vs. most standard/free extensions. \n\n***Edit* - Since this post seems fairly well liked, I'll add one more controversial add-on/way to save cash:  The previously mentioned services should save you money on your initial purchase.  But many places (including Amazon) also have policies that allow for you to get a refund if the price of the item you've purchased drops within a certain amount of days from your initial purchase.  Now, almost nobody spends their time checking prices on something after they've already paid for it.  So wouldn't it be great if a service did this for you? AND submitted the reimbursement request for you too?  That's where [Paribus](https://paribus.co/i/Xq06EV) comes in.  Link your account/email and they'll monitor your purchases for you and automatically request a refund if the price drops.  They support a few different vendors but I've only used them for Amazon.  I've gotten about $11 back so far this month alone from Xmas gifts I bought.  So what's the catch? Well, it's 2-fold:  1) The biggest is PRIVACY.  You have to enter your account credentials in order for them to be able to properly track your purchases - that means Amazon(or whatever other vendor you use) and Email.  That's a HUGE red flag for me..so I tried to do a bit of research before hand. I wasn't able to find anything that seemed to suggest the company wasn't legit.  But I wouldn't blame anyone else for choosing to not risk it.  2) They do take a small cut of the refund.  A small price to pay as far as I'm concerned since it's money I wouldn't have otherwise gotten anyhow.  So if you're willing to give it a go, it's sort of the final step in maximizing savings when used in conjunction with the other methods discussed. \n- The link gives us both an extra 5%.  /End of pitch. :)  (No, I'm not an employee or in any other way employed by the company.  Like I said, I'm pretty iffy about the data they request and fully respect anyone choosing to pass on their product)\n\n**EDIT~~3~~4** - Thanks Trevor, Charles, and Steve!","name":"t1_cy6qpm6","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-12-21 18:13:07","week":52}

I have sort of painted myself into a corner, though - I would have to turn off Leanpub sales in order to get the 70% and other benefits of Amazon's KDP select program...\n\nThat said, it is totally possible to just write your book on Leanpub and then publish on Amazon.

Since they only do payment processing I'd hope they are quite secure but honestly it only takes one bug in the right place to let a hacker in. You can trust PayPal as much as any other retailer. Which isn't saying a whole lot really. \n\nI personally use PayPal for ANY site that isn't a big name (Amazon, Target, Apple, etc). It reduces my risk significantly. I only have a credit card registered with them. Limiting the number of sites you give your credit card to limits your exposure. However, as we've found out there is just as much risk in the real world (brick and mortar stores, Target and Home Depot hacks originated from physical stores)\n\nA few rules of thumb online:\n\n- only use credit cards for payments. There are fraud protection laws that apply to credit cards vs debit. If you lose money from debit fraud it's likely gone, if credit then the credit company basically erases the debt you owe (if deemed real fraud). That being the case, credit card companies try really hard not to have fraud charges.\n\n- If a site looks shady or too good to be true, then it probably is. Don't risk your credit score to save $5.\n\n- use different passwords for every site you use. I know this sounds annoying but there are plenty of password vaults out there. I prefer keepassx. If a site offers two factor authentication (text/call/email/etc on login) then use it.

{"id":"cy82c1m","author":"dont_know_what_i_am","body":"35 year old severe bi-polar.  I have been happily married 11 years.  When I am on my meds (Which is every single day for 22 years) I do pretty good.  I still get short manias (which range from sorta blissful to rage) but major depressive episodes about 2 times a year.  Those depressive episodes are difficult for me and my wife.  But even with those we are very happily married.\n\nThe first thing you need to do to is find a way to motivate yourself to stay on your medicine. So... motivation... hmmmm...\n\nThe easiest thing we can do avoid/reduce manic episodes is keep taking your meds all the time, the same time, everyday.  We are not just taking them for ourselves.  We are taking them for your spouse as well.  I submit to you that not taking our meds is one of the most selfish things we could do to our spouses. Love = taking your meds.\n\nActually the number one thing we need to accept is that out illness will never go away.  It is a disease.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the way our brains are wired.  If you believe you can be healed or you will suddenly wake up and be symptom free forever you will never take your illness seriously enough to stay on your meds.  Its hard to accept.  But these are the cards we have been dealt.\n\nOne reason people stop taking their pills is due to the serious side effects they cause. I have been on five or six different combinations of pills through my 22 years of dealing with this.  There are 3 FDA approved drugs for bi-polar. And lots of non-sense off-label drugs that irresponsible doctors prescribe. So... my advice is find a good combo of drugs that do it for you.\n\nAnother tip.  Find a good doctor and show up to the appointments... that is very hard. There is one good doctor out there for every 10 lousy ones.  If you don't like him/her find a different one. Don't settle.  \n\nOnto my advice about the impulsive behavior (in your case manifests itself in binge shopping).  I suggest you never get Amazon Prime... holy cow that even gets to me... free shipping!  Stay way.  Its almost irresistible. I think shopping online in general might be something to avoid.\n\nPlease remember.  Taking your meds = Loving your spouse.  They are marrying the best imitation of yourself.  Your better angels. Be that person as much as you can.  Take your meds.\n\nLots of love to you :-)  Good luck.\n","name":"t1_cy82c1m","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-12-22 20:13:12","week":52}

{"id":"cy8blph","author":"arctander","body":"Content middlemen suffer the same problem: licensing of copyrighted materials with little to no control over pricing.\n\nYou've seen Spotify, Pandora, Napster (legal version), Slacker Radio, Rdio, etc.. all complain about the cost of content and the subsequent lack of net revenue. The same thing applies to Netflix, Amazon Video, and Youtube Red. Their cost structures are at the mercy of the copyright holder and yet their pricing is being attacked on all fronts by the competition.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of declining margins, Netflix, Amazon, and others are creating studios and generating their own proprietary content. This mimics the behavior of HBO when it too found itself at the wrong end of the licensing equation.\n\nEarlier this month Pandora or Spotify complained that Apple had ruined the digital music business. I think the article was flawed in that it didn't get to the root of the problem - Apple is willing to sell content as a loss leader to drive ancillary hardware revenue. \n\nIf your business is purely based on content that you license from others and your competition is willing to run their content business at very low margins, how do you survive? You have a few choices: 1) build an ancillary revenue stream; e.g., kindle or firestick; 2) reduce your licensing costs and increase margin by having your own library of content; e.g., House of Cards; 3) sell your startup fast; e.g. Beats Music. Apple makes a paltry sum on media sales, it's all about the hardware revenue and keeping all other music &amp; video services at bay.\n\nApple doesn't even have to defend its position in media distribution. It is the perfect moat. The copyright holders will defend against anyone using media without paying and Apple is fine as long as they continue to pay, regardless of what they charge.\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cy8blph","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-23 00:05:53","week":52}

{"id":"cy8crvf","author":"donvito","body":"Ha, story time: I'm from Germany and some time ago I made a private seller account on Amazon.de to sell off my old books and shit.\n\nThen, years later, I decided to sell a product I imported from China. Problem: I'm not allowed to sell it with a private account because I run a business (issues with taxes, vat, customer protection laws, etc.) So I would have to change my \"private\" account to a \"business\" account. \n\nShould be easy, right? Yeah ... nope. Amazon Support in Europe has no clue how to do this. They need to contact the guys in the USA so they can \"reset\" the account. But that takes time because the US people have their real jobs to do, too (according to some amazon seller central forum posts that can take up to 3 months in which your account is inactive).\n\nSo after almost a dozen calls with Amazon's support they came up with the ingenious idea that I should close and delete my current Amazon seller account and create a new one. Of course the positive feedback I received would get lost. And just opening a new business account and keeping the old one for private stuff could (and would) lead to a ban because having two accounts is verboten. \n\nResult of the story: I still have the shit I wanted to sell sitting in a corner (partially because I read through their support forums and the stories of banned accounts, verification issues, idiotic senseless bureaucracy, etc. aren't really encouraging).

In other words, for Jet to make money, the amount of revenue they get from the subscription fees + the products they sell has to be roughly equivalent to a normal site that *just sold the products* - so the strong odds are that for each individual user, they will wind up paying the same as if they had just paid full freight for the products in the first place, when adding in the costs of subscription. **So it is predicated on *duping* an audience that is *self-selecting* for price-sensitivity.**\n\nThat, dotcomrade, is *fucking stupid*.

{"id":"cy9h2xb","author":"CardFellow","body":"&gt;Ads as in any old ad you see on any page, ie. paid for businesses that want to reach customers. Walmart, Target, Amazon, anyone who wants to advertise.\n\nOkay, the business that wants to advertise pays for the ad, but how does that change any of the payments beyond that..?\nI'm not sure I'm following.\n\nMaybe we're not working from the same understanding of how processing costs work. \n\nThere's 3 pieces to processing - interchange costs (which go to the banks that issue credit cards to customers), assessments (which go to the card brands - Visa, MC, etc.), and the processor's markup, which the processor gets for handling the transaction. \n\nSo who's getting paid with the ad money, all three entities still but because it's coming from ad sales, the business will be able to lower the costs of the product? Does the business have to handle the ad sales themselves?\n\nThe processor is still going to be necessary because they facilitate the money changing hands (from the customer's bank to the business's bank) but now there's also going to be the added work of the video. Will there be another entity in the middle now to facilitate the ad side? (Handling the ad sales to businesses, coordinating with the processor to get the ad on the payment page, etc.?) If so, wouldn't that just add another cost and ultimately be more expensive processing?\n\n&gt;As far as industry standards go, I'm puzzled as to why someone hasn't come along and made a new Youtube without ads yet. \n\nAgain, you're ignoring the major difference - YouTube is a free service. To some degree people accept that ads might be a thing because they're not otherwise paying for the service. With an ad on top of a payment, it's consumers already paying for something and then having to watch/see ads for the privilege getting to the payment page. I don't see it sitting well. \n\nAside from that, there *are* alternate non-ad video channels, things that do get frequent use (like Vimeo, Facebook's video uploader, etc.) and YouTube doesn't require video uploaders to put ads on their videos. And, in the same way that some people close a YouTube video if it has an ad, some people would abandon an online shopping cart that makes them watch a video before paying.\n\n&gt;That being said, I don't see a lot of competitive advantage being derived from NOT covering transaction costs. 2% for businesses is quite a chunk of change. \n\nI'm not sure I'm following you. Not a lot of competitive advantage how? In not making your customers watch ads in order to pay for their purchase? Think of it this way - if you have two options for purchasing the same product, and one company makes you watch a 30 second ad in order to make a purchase and one doesn't, who are you going with?\n\nIt's not that the larger company isn't passing along the costs to consumers, it's just that they've built them into their price. If a business isn't building their processing costs into their product pricing, that's an issue they need to figure out how to resolve.","name":"t1_cy9h2xb","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-24 00:18:48","week":52}

{"id":"cy9s7om","author":"Nundercover","body":"I think there are potentially a few factors:\n\n1.  There are still people who do not shop online period.  There are also people who do not purchase consumables online.\n\n2.  Consumables (shampoo, hair dye, make-up) may be in the moment purchases or not as well planned to either order in bulk or have a secondary unit when their original runs out.\n\n3.  Lastly I think women need to try and test make-up in store as well as see colors clearly in person since those can be challenging to view on a screen.  I know make-up is not a large majority of Sally Beauty Supply, but I just thought it was a good example.  Similarly how Ulta, Sephora and MAC all have locations that have been very successful.  To most of us men, something like lipstick is simply a color.  To every woman there is so much more such as texture, feel and ingredients used.  Even further the color on the package isn't the color on you.  People come in all shapes, sizes and most importantly shades.  The same red lipstick will look very different on 10 different women due to the different colors of their lips.  This is similar across many product lines and specifically pertaining to color.\n\nIn regards to people knowing what they want and strictly looking for replenishment then I would definitely think Amazon could take market share.  This is where these companies (Sally, Ulta, Sephora) I think strategically need to focus on their online experience and get very good at replenishment.  Possibly offering a discount for a year round (monthly) supply type service.  Also building great customer profiles.  What have you bought in the past (reconnect people with products they liked but can't remember exactly), what are complimentary shades and colors?  Then finding products that work well with that customer and helping them curate their product selection.  Ie we noticed you have all products with XYZ ingredients, this would fit that profile.  Or you can't have ABC chemical because of skin irritation so here are great solutions.  People with similar skin tone loved this and here is what it looked like on them and so forth.  \n\nIn the beauty supply industry I believe it is critical to have some in store interaction, product trial and samples that are complimented by great customer profile development and an integrated online experience that allows for easy reorder / historical purchase management.","name":"t1_cy9s7om","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-12-24 06:38:55","week":52}

It's easy enough to just buy a domain and point the DNS servers to Shopify and it's done. If you go this route and need help, just PM me, takes like 2 minutes. \n\n&gt;What is the situation with paying taxes? What's the rule of thumb for how much you have to pay Uncle Sam at the end of the year with an online store?\n\nWell...there's Fed tax rates, state tax rates, self employment tax and any applicable sales tax.

Unfortunately, I'm running out but the product is expensive at my local store. Oh wow, amazon sells the same product for 50% less. I don't need to purchase it again at my local store and pay more for a product I can get the next day. \nBusinesses profit from returning customers. Many times, I go to a store and try a sample of what they sell then if I like the product, I'll go on amazon and buy it for cheaper. Fragrances come to mind. I go to Nordstrom to try a few fragrance samples. I find one that I like and then I buy online and save $50. That's the future. Back in the day, you didn't have a choice. Even in the recent decade, local stores could maintain competitive edge until the online industry blasted off (primarily Amazon and eBay). Now, there's no way local stores will keep competitive edge until they change their business model. Look at Best Buy, for example. They were about to go out of business. They made a bold move by price matching amazon and other online sellers. HUGE move. Now, they're not as printable of a business as they used to be before the Internet boom but they still remain profitable. Soon, other companies will follow suit besides a few niche industries like fashion and food. \n\nUnlike fashion where everything differs vastly. I buy a medium Gucci black graffic shirt which fits me great. I buy a Gucci slim fit dress shirt in medium but it doesn't fit me. This you can only know by going to the store. Sometimes even knowing the exact measurements won't help until you actually put it on. So, there's a huge hurdle in that industry. \n\nAs for virtual reality, I see you don't know much about it. If you're in the business field, I suggest reading up on it as its going to dominate the future market--especially marketing and advertising.

Another benefit to a brick and mortar store is being able to get advice on the spot.

{"id":"cy9v4pb","author":"_DrPepper_","body":"You are right and some people do enjoy having person to person contact. Unfortunately, that's our generation. This new generation only knows the technological way. I look at my nieces and nephews and they are completely enveloped into this world of  technology. They spend all their time on their phones, tablets, laptops, social media etc. Their world revolves around sitting in their chair/bed all day long. It's physically unhealthy. Worst part is, we are just getting started with autonomous driving, drones, virtual reality, and more social media. Life is become one humongous illusion. We live our lives as someone else. Anyhow, that's a different topic. My point is that having goods delivered by drones will be the cool thing and then eventually it will become the convenient thing. That's how these things work. It's all hype then they figure out the kinks to make it as convenient as possible so you don't even have to leave the comfort of your bed. I didn't even mention robotics and having robots clean your house like those vacuum robots do already. We are becoming inept as a civioization. Soon, virtual reality will be so real that there's no need to travel to Paris. You can do it from the comfort of your living room. That's how they will sell it at least. People buy into hype and business people love to sell hype. It's the same ol game except technology has advanced so much that biologically we cannot keep up. \nThey buy their video games online so they don't have to go to the store and they can play it instantly. \n\nYou mentioned hiking. That's awesome. It shows you live life the old school way like me. Unfortunately, that's what it is going to become--old school way of living. Where people travel, went to grocery stores to get food went to brick and mortar stores to get goods etc. It's evident the industry is changing when I see my own parents and other older people ordering goods from online retailers like Amazon. I in no way support this new model, it's just reality. I'm passionate against it. Unfortunately, hype always wins. You see how much reddit loves virtual reality and how companies like Google and Facebook are dying to get their hands on it and implement it into the market as soon as possible. \n\nI'm actually not so passionate about technology in the sense of virtual reality. Lethargy is a real thing. As a medical doctor and business owner, I can tell you that once lethargy sets in, we are more inclined to take the shortcuts in life. As we gain weight, changes in our brain chemistry occur. Depression sets in and we use virtual reality as an escape much like heroine without the physiological side effects (as we know...Def some brain chemistry changes occurring which results in more serious physical changes). The next thing scientists are trying to do is to transfer our brains into robotic bodies which will make life easier in the near future. I mean, they are already doing head transplants, so it's not really too far away. 3-D printing of organs (a company I worked for in So-California). There are pros and cons. Unfortunately, we are not adept for such a drastic change. Evolution occurs over a long period of time. We can't evolve as fast as technology and the industry want us to. Thus, there's going to be a lot of weird/freaky stuff happening in the next 50 years. I hope once we reach the stage of having our brains transferred to robots that I will be long dead and gone, plzzzzz. Haha \nAnyhow, thanks for your comment. Really appreciated the sincerity and honesty of it. Your point about varying opinions is very true. I just don't see how the future is not going to make us technologically dependent.

You could not get the entire Amazon catalog for instance, only a couple of categories.\nSince they do not rely on an internet connection, the scanning is much faster.  As a dedicated device for one job, they can be the correct solution. For more general scanning, not so much.","name":"t1_cya3odx","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-24 17:01:59","week":52}

Your embedded services are still yours to change and they are where you can create value sufficient to demand a higher price. \n\nDeveloping embedded services is much like developing a product. To do something that others can't easily copy you have to understand your customers and see needs that others do not or serve needs that it is infeasible for them to address. More specifically you should consider how the product could get into the users hands, how they could use it, how they could be trained for it, how they could be told about it, how they could pair it with other products.

They have a number of models available and I believe are headquartered in or around Charlotte, NC. Keep in mind that you will have competition from the big name online and brick and mortar vendors (Amazon, Target, REI, etc.) as nearly everyone seems to sell them.\n\nAs a suggestion, regardless of what brand you decide on, and assuming the brand you carry uses tires with tubes (as opposed to solid plastic or rubber tires/wheels) it might be worth it to offer tire/tube services for when your customers invariably get tube punctures/failures. Typically tubes will run you around $2.00/ea wholesale and sell for $6-$8 retail depending on market/region and the tube replacement service/labor itself will run $10-$15 retail depending on market/region. Tools needed to complete the service are tire levers (~$3-$5 and expect to replace them with some degree on regularity), a good bicycle floor pump (~$50-$100), and a right angle pump adapter (~$8). The only other needs would be the aforementioned tubes on hand and someone with the experience/skill to change a tube quickly and correctly. The whole job should take 5 to at most 15 minutes depending on your choice of documentation for the service. Many places will do a tube change service \"on the fly\" without collecting any customer information whereas other places will collect customer information for the service as a formality. I will not recommend, suggest, nor comment further on that choice as that gets into legal advice and IANAL.

Angry christmas shoppers were all over social media and news stories calling them out on missing shipment dates.\n\nSecondly, it hurts their relationships with very important partners like Amazon. Maybe I'm going a bit out of my way to defend late shoppers here, but when someone goes to Amazon Prime and clicks \"Two Day Shipping\" while looking at bold letters exclaiming \"Order by this time to receive box by Christmas\", I find it hard to judge people too hard for actually expecting their shipment on time. Amazon actually went out of their way to email customers and, again, put the blame on failures of their shipping network.\n\nAmazon is shipping on Christmas because they don't want a repeat of this scenario, or at least they want to manage it better than last time.","name":"t1_cyb6id0","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-12-25 21:00:20","week":52}

{"id":"cyb7dya","author":"Engineer_Bob","body":"It highly depends on your habits of where you shop. For example, yes it's true a store will give you 10-15% off for signing up for a credit card. It's not a bad idea if you shop there a lot. Will it cause an inquiry? Sure. After 12 months it won't count towards your FICO score and will fall off at 24 months.\n\nBut getting a store card just for that initial percentage off doesn't just stop there. You'll get exclusive offers in your e-mails or for signing up on the site and letting them market to you as an owner of their card. You'll get deals that a normal shopper wouldn't get.\n\nStore cards are great if they make sense and if they're offered by Synchrony you can get credit limits of $5,000+ within 6 months. The two store cards I really like at the moment is Amazon Store Card (6/12/18/24 month promotional offers depending on how much/what you buy) and Walmart MasterCard though they have a store version. But Walmart also offers 6/12/18/24 month financing depending on what you buy on both of those cards.\n\nWhen you are looking at a credit card you should research everything about it. And also read the terms and agreement for the APR, how they charge interest, what your grace period is, cash advance fees etc.\n \nOnce you've been reading MyFICO forums or Credit Boards; you'll see that a lot of news stations that talk about credit don't know what the hell they're even talking about. You would think they'd have at least someone on staff who cares about their credit enough to actually contribute to a short segment with factual information.\n\nAlso keep in mind that while you can compare some things between Person A's credit history to Person B'S credit history; EVERY person's credit history is unique. Think of it like a social security number where no one's number is ever the same. While there is general information about how to have a great score; in the end it all comes down to what YOUR credit history is.\n\nAnyways. Just pay your credit card bill in full or at least the minimum payment on time, every time. That's the secret to having a perfect credit history. Try not to pay interest wherever you can but depending on the situation maybe you won't have that luxury and will have to carry a balance for a few months. Don't sweat about it. Just pay on time every time. Oh and a bit of advice. \n\nAlso to game the FICO score system, generally one card reporting 1-9% is best but can vary on the % depending on your credit history. Also you'll want 2-3 cards reporting. A lot of people have been saying you want an installment loan but I think I've seen that there's 800+ scores over at myFICO where people just have credit cards with no installment history.\n\nI think I was credit obsessed all of 2014 and spent 4-6 hours every night just reading everything I can about credit. Be careful or you'll get sucked into it all. Also I highly suggest credit unions for banking.

{"id":"cybwkgq","author":"bumpgrind","body":"I have purchased and ran a few dropshipping businesses and here's my experience:\n\n- Most sites on Flippa are scams - fake stats, websites setup on Shopify with previous customers, sales &amp; transactions imported - their accounts always have little to no history because they replicate and sell their site and then create a new account to do it over and over again. How do you catch this? There are many ways. Check their products in the ecommerce store and search the name, description, SKU and/or images (e.g. tineye.com or google.com/images) and you'll find all the previous and future sites they sold.\n\n- Most dropshipping businesses, with products overseas, deal with ~15-30 day delivery times. This results in an incredibly high chargeback rate and an even more incredibly high amount of dissatisfied customers and back/forth emails and negative reviews on your social media channels. If  you want to run a business that sells product, choose a niche, ship all product to yourself and/or Amazon FBA and then sell directly through them. It's way more expensive to setup but you actually have a chance for success. Or, find dropshippers in the US (and have them ship you product to verify quality and timely shipping; there are a *ton* of garbage dropshippers).\n\n- If the business makes $1,000 profit a month and they aren't selling for $12-18K+ then it either requires a hundred hours to do the work; or, it's not really making $1,000 a month. Nobody in their right mind would sell a passive revenue stream of $1,000 a month for any less than 12-18 months cashflow equivalent.\n\n- If you get access to their ecommerce store (e.g. Shopify), review all transactions and statistics. You may notice a high bounce rate, a lot of their traffic from overseas, and a ton of repeat customers (but very few customers). You may also find reviews (e.g. \"This is an amazing product ~ David\") and then you can search Google to find out how many times the site has been replicated. If it has been replicated more than once, don't buy, it's a scam. There are full time scammers that leverage Flippa, etc. and sell sites they simply replicate.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n- Choose a niche. Riches are in the niches\n- Find your own wholesaler(s)\n- Ship product to yourself, or better yet, to Amazon and use their FBA service. Also sell through Amazon, you can increase your revenue ten-fold if you can find an in-demand product and compete with other sellers.\n- Create your own site (using Shopify, Bigcommerce or similar); buy a visually appealing template, don't try to customize it, just focus on increasing traffic and exposure and selling your quality products\n- Focus on sales, sales, sales. Gain organic traffic, create social media channels, gain fans &amp; followers, make interesting posts 3x a day.\n\nEven with the above you'll be challenged along the way, but you'll learn so much as you go through it that you'll be building real-life business skills. Once you finally get a formula that works you'll be able to replicate those successes and create other businesses targeting new niches. Your momentum will build upon itself.

For example, if you ship First Class USPS and your package is even an ounce heavier than Ebay suggested, your customer will have to pay the difference. This can mean a lot of angry customers, as they may have their package held hostage until they go to the post office to pay.\n\n\nA shipping scale that does it's job can be found for under $20 on Amazon. It's a great investment for the peace of mind.","name":"t1_cyc5ahc","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-12-26 23:18:06","week":52}

I started FBA a few months ago after seeing everyone go on about how easy it is. It IS stupid easy. Anyone can make money from Amazon FBA if you can get through the headache of dealing with suppliers and shipping companies.\n\nThe SaaS product is because I am getting tired of the affiliate game. Maybe that is not really the right wording, but I want to experience the other side. There is something I do do daily that I want to take the headache out of, so in the process of creating something that will save me time, and hopefully others that do the same.\n\nT shirts I stumbled on about 3 months ago. Everyone on this sub and everywhere else will tell you never to go into the T shirt biz because it is over saturated, but I found something that is working well and will probably write something up here in due time (probably after I hit my goal).\n\nThe Authority sites are something else I enjoy. I have a few that I am working on right now in different niches. I also plan to give my IM blog a lot more love this year because I have been so busy lately and have not posted at all (maybe 3 posts all year). A few of these sites are focused strictly on small keywords and no link building as more of an experiment. My bread and butter for the last few years have been smaller affiliate sites. After selling a few for friends in the 6 figures, I want to create bigger sites I can sell for at least 7 figures in a few years time to fuel the last item.\n\nWhich brings me to rental units. I want to funnel some of the money from my bigger sites into rental units. I am about to move to a new state, but seeing as how property is not that expensive in my current area (large college town), I should be able to find a good location before I move to rent out with a decent size down payment.\n\nWho knows what 2016 holds, but I am aiming high!","name":"t1_cyc7p5d","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-12-27 00:43:05","week":52}

AAPL is priced at a lower valuation because the market is skeptical that the iPhone can continue to drive EPS growth in the way that it has in the past, and more-so, there is doubt that they can continue ramping their product pipeline the way they have in the past. The to-date progress of the Apple Watch is one of the reasons why the market is skeptical. \n\nGOOG is perhaps overvalued, but it is not overvalued the way that the rest of the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix &amp; Google) are. I don't think its fair to say their valuation has no basis in reality. They trade at a much more realistic multiple than those comparables. \n\nGOOG may not pay a dividend or repurchase stock, but they are sitting on top of around $12bn net cash on their balance sheet and it is a lot more reasonable to assume that the cash will be returned to shareholders via GOOG than say Amazon, for example. \n\nMy opinion is that it does not take a rocket scientist to come to GOOG's valuation. It is high, but not unrealistic.

{"id":"cycd4ew","author":"Twentey","body":"1. If you spread your risk across many companies, that is called investing. I would argue that investing is generally done with the purpose of preserving wealth, rather than to build wealth. Anyone can buy shares of publicly traded companies. Probably won't make you rich though. Fortunes are not made by diversifying. If you diversify to reduce your risk, you will also reduce your potential gains. If you take a look at the Fortune 400 people, the great majority of them have become successful by starting their own companies, not by investing.\n\n2. I think that many people forget that a college degree is an investment. It's not a guarantee to anything. You take on a loan because you expect the degree to pay off in the future in the form of an increased chance to earn a higher salary. However, having a degree does not magically entitle a person to become rich. Possessing a rare skill that is in high demand is probably a better proxy for that.\n\n3. Yes, Walmart certainly has driven many companies out of business. If you can find a way to do what Walmart does cheaper, you can drive Walmart out of business. That's how capitalism works. Either you become the lowest-cost producer or you invent a product or service that adds value. Currently, Walmart is feeling a lot of heat coming from Amazon.

I decided to get serious about it as a New Year's resolution.

That took a few months of paying down and a line increase request. I also started working a side gig one or two nights a week to fund wedding and savings independent of my normal income. \n\nAs of today, I have $264 in credit card debt that will be paid off entirely in January. No interest, and it only exists because Freedom offered 10% cash back through Amazon over the holidays.

{"id":"cycteet","author":"Jerry_Seinsmelled","body":"Hi Centuriondk,\n\nI think I can give you a little help. I currently work in currency derivatives trading. However, I spent 2 and a half years in the wealth management industry, so I am very familiar with questions like yours.\n\nTo touch on your index fund(s) question; while your 401k plan my not offer any funds that specifically track an index per-se, it does offer blended equity funds, which for all intents and purposes can be considered index funds. Take for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund. This fund's top 5 holdings include: Facebook, Google, Home Depot, Amazon &amp; Regeneron. All of these companies are major components of the S&amp;P 500 index.  If you look at the fund's historical performance it almost perfectly follows the S&amp;P 500 (it actually outperforms the index by a small %). Without going into too much detail, you are pretty much safe to assume that all of the funds available to you are closely following some type of index, whether it be a Large Cap equity index like the S&amp;P 500, or a Small Cap Index like the Russell 2000.\n\nAs far as morningstar ratings go; while these are a great indicator of how well the fund has performed over the years, it is not a perfect rating system. One of the major components of the rating system is time. Therefore, some funds that may have performed well over the last few years, may only have a 3 star rating, or no rating at all, just because they are a relatively new fund. Which brings me to my next point, what funds to pick.\n\nI would strong suggest allocation your investments between several funds, aka diversification. You mentioned that you have been out of college for about 8 years, so I am guessing you are probably around 30 years old. Which gives you a relatively long investment horizon. Thus, should be taking on a little more risk then say, some one who is 60 and about to retire. I would suggest something around a 70% Equity/30% Fixed Income/5% Intl split, maybe even 75/25. This split should be broken down further to something like this:\n\n70% Equity\n* 75% Large Cap (JPMorg., Invesco, Blackrock, etc...)\n* 15% Mid Cap (Janus, Ivy, Columbia, etc...)\n* 10% Small Cap (Victory, Janus, CBA, etc...) \n\n30% Fixed Income\n* 60% Income Bonds (MetWest Tot., Prud. Tot.)\n* 40% High Yield/Income Bonds (AB High Inc)\n\n5% International \n* 100% Intl Blend (MFS Global, Artisian Intl)\n\nPersonally, I would check out each of the funds and see what they are invested in, how they have performed relative to the market, and their expense ratio. Once you have made your selections, I would set it and forget it for the next few years. Do not let the market dictate your investment choices. In the long run, the market always realizes a positive return, and the diversification will help guard you against large losses in the case of a market down turn. I would hold off on reallocating your investments for 3-5 years.\n\nI hope this helps! Best of luck.","name":"t1_cycteet","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-12-27 17:41:30","week":52}
