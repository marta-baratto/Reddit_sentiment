{"id":"3i4p9d","author":"Fishering","body":"Hey, I remember seeing a post many months ago about getting paid to exercise. I have a fitbit and I already am aware of a few sites that will pay me to use it, so this post will really just be a way to inform some of the new users of these types of sites/apps that will pay for exercise, and maybe help find some new ones that you might know about.\n\n#[AchieveMint](http://www.achievemint.com)\n\nAchievemint is an app/site that pays you to connect an app (fitbit) and as you live life you will gain points on achievemint. You can get points for logging weight, water you drink, the steps you take, the sleep you do, and the food you eat. The app could be viewed as passive. You just link your fitbit account and as time goes on you will get more points. 50,000 points = $50. Yup, takes forever to reach that.\n\nSorry to say that this site currently has a waiting line to get in for new users :(.\n\n#[Pact](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gympact.android)\n\nPact is an app that pays you to make a pledge to exercise/eat healthy each week. This could be viewed as a gamble, because if you don't complete your goal, you will end up losing money and paying other people who do complete their goal, but if you do complete your goal you will be making money. \n\nNote: iOS and android. Search for 'Pact'.\n\n#[Walgreens Balance Rewards](https://www.walgreens.com/balancerewards/balance-rewards.jsp)\n\nThis is part of walgreens rewards program. Once you sign up you can link your fitbit account and you will earn points for each mile you walk/run. It is very easy to use, and works similarly to Achievemint. 5000 points = $5 in rewards to spend at walgreens. \n\n(Question: Does anybody know if you can spend the rewards points on gift cards in store/online? Thanks.)\n\n#[Fit Studio](https://www.fitstudio.com/) (Shop Your Way)\n\nI actually don't use this, but I know a lot of people might like it anyways. \n\nShop your way (Sears/Kmart) is a site where you can buy stuff, and you can earn rewards points to spend on SYW as you use fitstudio. Link your fitbit to fitstudio, and after you walk 15 miles you will get 5000 rewards points ($5) to use on http://www.shopyourway.com. \n\nSo.... Why don't I use this? Well, I don't like most of the stuff on SYW.. It all seems expensive, and also all the points you earn expire exactly one week after you earn them, so the most you can ever save is $5 for the most part. Oh, and not to mention that only a very very very select few products on the site even allow you to use points to purchase... Like less than 5% of the stuff on their site applies, so that's pretty shitty.\n\n#[***NEW***: WellCoin](http://www.wellcoin.com)\n\nThanks to /u/broomlad for mentioning Wellcoin. Wellcoin is a site where you log healthy things you do in exchange for Wellcoins. The site looks very neat to use and looks easy to gain coins. The biggest downfall of this site is that the only rewards you can redeem for seem to be discounts on products or products which you may/may not be interested in. Either way, I think the site looks cool, but if you're an Amazon or PayPal fan, you will probably not be seeing that on this site. \n\n#More????\n\nIf anybody knows of any other sites/apps that can be used to make money with your fitbit, please leave a comment :) Let me know if you have any questions as well. I should be able to help as much as I can.","name":"t3_3i4p9d","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-08-24 00:35:21","week":35}

{"id":"3i4t88","author":"[deleted]","body":"## Different ways to use Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP)\n\nParts of this series:\n\n- [Different Ways to use American Express MR Points](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3dwl1z/faq_different_ways_to_use_american_express_mr/)\n- [Different Ways to use Chase UR Points](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3i1kdl/faq_different_ways_to_use_chase_ultimate_rewards/)\n\n\nWhile many folks in this sub spends hours figuring how what card to use where to earn the most points/miles, the more complicated part of this hobby is the redemption of those points.  Almost every day, we see people struggle with trying to use the points they've earned, and getting frustrated in the process; or they redeem the points in a way that others consider sub-optimal.\n\nThis short guide describing some of the ways you can use the Citi ThankYou points (TYP).  TYP has been a Citi incentive program for a long time, and has very messy rules with regards to earning, expiration, transfer, and redemption.  For this guide, I am going to focus on the TYPs you earn from currently available products:  ThankYou Prestige, ThankYou Premier, and ThankYou Preferred.\n\nIf you earn TYP from older products, such as the Citi AmEx cards, Citigold checking account, Citi Forward cards, or other Citi products, the options for redemption in this guide may or may not apply to you.  Your best bet is to visit www.ThankYou.com (Portal), login, and see if you can find a particular option.\n\n**Note: TYP are worth AT LEAST 1 cent per point!  If a particular redemption option gives you less value, you should think about redeeming them in other ways to maximize the value.**  \n\nLike most convertible points programs, Citi provide you a number of options to use your TYP.  This include shopping with with points on the Portal, shop at Amazon, trading them for Gift Cards, booking travel directly on the Portal, transfer to travel partners, cash back, statement credit, and paying Student Loan or Mortgages..\n\n####**Cash Reward (cash back)** \n\nThe Cash Reward option allows you to into convert TYP to a check made out to you by Citi.  This is a pretty bad redemption option, as Citi will send you a $50 check for 10000 points, valuing the TYP at 0.5 cents each.  \nThis mechanism is less flexible than UR points where Chase can just transfer money to your bank account.  The valuation is also terrible as compared to UR points, where Chase values them at 1 cent per point.\n\n####**Statement Credit** \n\nThe Statement Credit option allows you to into convert TYP into statement credit against your spending in certain categories:\n\n- Dining\n- Entertainment\n- Utility Bills\n- Gas\n- Groceries\n- Drug Stores\n\nThis mechanism is less flexible than UR points where Chase can just transfer money to your bank account.  But there are enough categories here that almost everyone can get the full value out of their TYP.\n\nThe rate of conversion is 0.75 cent per point.  To get a statement $52 for the dinner last night, you can redeem 6933 TYP.  This does not seem like a great deal, but maybe a way to spend small lots of TYPs you have in your account that is expiring.\n\n####**Mortgage payment** \n\nAnother way to get cash back from TYP is to use it to help pay your mortgage, at the rate of 1 cent per point.  If you have a mortgage, you can request Citi to send you a check, with your mortgage lender being the payee.  This option is not found easily on the Portal, but does come up when you search rewards for ‘mortgage’.  If you have a mortgage, this redemption will give you much higher value than statement credit or Cash Rewards.\n\n####**Student Loan Rebate** \n\nAnother way to get cash back from TYP is to use it to help pay your student loan, at the rate of 1 cent per point.  If you have a student loan, you can request Citi to send you a check, with your lender being the payee.  This option is not found easily on the Portal, but does come up when you search rewards for student loan’.  Again, this redemption will give you much higher value than statement credit or Cash Rewards.\n\n\n\n\n####**Shop with Points**\n\nFrom the TYP Portal, you can shop for merchandise directly.  A variety of products are available, from large appliances to computers, sporting good, luggage, etc.  You might be able to find a good deal, but a spot check shows that a Oster 16 Speed blender, selling for $41.70 on Amazon, will cost you 7100 TYPs.  This is an effective valuation of less than 0.6 cents per point.  Again, this is a situation that you really can’t get good value, unless you have some small lot of points that are expiring, and you want to get some value of out the,\n\n####**Gift Cards**\n\nFrom the Portal, you can shop for gift cards from a large assortment of merchants, including  Avis, Bed Bath and Beyond, Best Buy, iTunes, CVS, Macy’s, Lowe’s, etc.  the conversion rate seems to maintain the 1 cent per point valuation for the ones I checked, so a $25 iTunes Gift card will cost 2500 points. Double check the particular gift card to make sure the valuation is consistent.\n\n####**Shopping with Points at Amazon**\n\nTYP offers you the option to shop with points at Amazon.  This is only available to you if you have a TYP earning credit card.  You first have to link the TYP credit card at Amazon, and then you have the option to pay with TYP at checkout.  The reported value for TYP in this case is 0.79 cents per point, which makes this a less than desirable way to use your TYPs.\n\n####**Booking Travel Through ThankYou Portal**\n\nThe Citi ThankYou Portal also allows you to book Flights, Cruises, Hotels, Cars, and even Activities using your TYPs.  The actual value you will get is complicated, depending on which Citi TYP card you have.  \n\n**Citi Prestige**\n\n- 1.6 cents per point for AA Flight (6943 pts for a $111.10 AA/US Ticket)\n- 1.33 cents per point for other airlines ( 7375 pts for a $98.10 AS ticket)\n- 1.00 cents per point for Car Rental\n- 1.00 cents per point for Hotels\n- 1.00 cents per point for Cruises\n\n**Citi Premier**\n\n- 1.25 cents per point for AA Flight (8888 pts for a $111.10 AA/US Ticket)\n- 1.33 cents per point for other airlines ( 7848 pts for a $98.10 AS ticket)\n- 1.25 cents per point for Car Rental\n- 1.25 cents per point for Hotels\n- 1.25 cents per point for Cruises\n\nIf you only have the Citi TYP Preferred, you do not get any bonus multiplier, and will only get 1 cent per point when redeemed against travel.\n\nThe best value using TYP here, is having a Citi Prestige, and use the TYPs to book travel on AA.  The 53,000 TYPs you get for signing up for the Prestige will buy you $848 worth of AA flights.  \n\nThe odd thing on these values, is that while Citi Prestige offers you better value when redeeming for flights, when redeeming for rental car or hotel, you are better off using the 1.25 cents valuation on the Premier.\n\nThere are advantages using the TYP Portal to book travel.  First of all, you are basically booking through an Online Travel Agent.  If you book a flight, it is as if you paid cash for the flight.  You don’t have to worry about award seat availability, and you will earn more miles for the flight.  You can also redeem for things you normally can't redeem for using airline miles, such as Car Rental or a concert.  At a glance, the TYP portal prices seems as competitive as the Chase UR portal for the same flights.\n\n####**Transferring to Hotel Partners**\n\nCiti TYP can only be transferred to Hilton’s HHonors program.  1000 TYPs converts to 1500 HHonors points.  This looks like you are getting 50% more value, but is really not that good of a deal.  HHonors redemption value runs typically around 0.5 cents per point, unless you are planning to stay at one the few Category  1 or 2 Hilton hotels.  Just booking the room directly from the Portal using TYP will probably get you better value.\n\n####**Transferring to Airline Partners**\n\nCiti partners with a number of airlines, and you can transfer TYP into the program for those airlines.  When you have miles in an airline program, you now redeem the miles using the airlines award chart.  This can lead to some really good values, some awful values, but also a lot of limitations.  You have to study various airline award charts to find the best values, and then you also need to find availability of awards.  \n\nUnlike Chase UR and American Express MR programs, Citi does not have a solid domestic partner for transfers.  Also, these partners award charts don’t really have the sweet spot like the short distance Avios redemption for 4500 Avios.  So if you are looking for a domestic flight, redeeming TYP through the Portal is a often a better option.  As a matter of fact, if the airfare is low enough, a TYP portal redemption can be cheaper than an Avios, distance based redemption.\n\nTYP can be transferred to the following airline partners:\n\n- Asia Miles (Cathay Pacific)  \n- EVA Air\n- Etihad\n- Air France/KLM Flying Blue\n- Garuda Indonesia\n- Malaysia\n- Qantas\n- Qatar\n- Singapore Airlines\n- Thai Airways\n- Virgin Atlantic\n\nSome sweet spots that are often talked about for partner transfers:\n\n- SQ : 35,000 Miles for RT to Hawaii\n- SQ : 57,500 Miles for Suites from JFK-FRA one way\n- VS : 80,000 points for RT to London\n\nThe one thing many churners wish for is for Citi to allow a 1:1 transfer of TYP to AA.  Unless that happens, the best use of TYP for domestic travel will probably be the 1.6 cent redemption for AA flights.  Unlike other transferrable point programs, the TYP transfer partners don’t enable a lot of premium cabin travels options, except on SQ.\n","name":"t3_3i4t88","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-24 01:06:40","week":35}

Everything was great except the salary negotiation process and I ended up settling for a very low salary. The big mistake I made was to let the recruiter know what was my compensation was in my previous company (Company A). I was earning around $85k in Company A and my current employer (Company B) pays around $105k. Even though this is a good bump in paycheck, Glassdoor data says that engineers with my level of experience make around $130k in the same company. This company is known to work people to the bone, but also pays more than industrial average.\n\nSome history: I started working for Company A in the east-coast in a city where cost of living was absurdly low. So $83k was a lot of money. However due to personal circumstances, I requested an internal transfer and moved to SF Bay area. Before the move I requested Company A's HR to make a salary adjustment and they increased it by $2k and called it done! This was the reason I switched to Company B. However, revealing my numbers to the recruiter totally screwed things up and I'm now wondering how I should go about fixing this. I'm assuming if I talk to the HR/hiring manager and just ask for a raise, it'll be shot down. Not to mention, it might sound too greedy given that I've been working here only for 2 months. I would greatly appreciate advice on how to navigate this situation.\n","name":"t3_3i5iws","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-24 04:30:14","week":35}

Stocks are an extremely liquid asset, so people entering and exiting doesn't pose any sort of major risk, other than a flash flood coming from the tears of  r/investing and r/stocks.  Junk bonds, on the other hand, are about as liquid as a boulder; they are rarely traded a , so selling a bond in a secondary market usually means you will have to take a nice haircut.  Your average mom and pop likely doesn't have the acumen nor the risk tolerance to stay in an illiquid asset when it is going down, and if risk creeps up, many will look to exit their positions.\n\nBut if mom and pop are exiting their junks, who is going to buy?  Hedge funds?  Fat chance; a lot of the smart money, especially Carl Icahn, have already admitted that they are short junks and are looking to make a killing from these guys running into trouble. Other mom and pops?  Fear just hit, no way they are getting in.  The issuers of the ETF? They are having enough problems finding cash to pay those leaving the fund.  They can attempt to sell their bonds, but it takes time to find a buyer, especially one that won't be demanding a huge haircut from a seller they know is having liquidity problems.  Banks? With the implementation of the Volcker rule, they legally cant do that.  So if there is no one willing to buy the asset, what happens to the value of the asset? Simple; it tanks. So then what happens?  The ETF has to then sell its junk bonds in order to provide cash for those leaving their fund, but since junk bonds aren't liquid, they have to sell those bonds at a discount, lowering the value of the fund, and causing more panic as people see their portfolio drop.  The negative reinforcement cycle is complete. \n\nNow, you will be looking at the market with your shorts, and it will be like 2008. There will be big moves down, followed by somewhat smaller moves up, with bigger moves down following that.  People will be scared, but they will become a small bit more used to the volatility.  But when one of the big two junk ETFs (HYG and JNK) fails, then everyone will lose their mind. This could be your 7 to 8 percent drop day when you see this happen, and will only cause the junks to freeze up more. The Federal Reserve will then commit to not raising rates for the rest of the year or for a further 6 months, but the damage has already been done.  \n\nThe Possible Yolos:\n\nHere are some trades that you could do to take advantage of this in order of most risky to least risky\n- HYG Dec/Jan puts - If you short these funds and they fail, you win. I prefer HYG as you will pay a smaller amount on fees than with JNK.\n- Momentum stock puts - the guys like AMZN, FB, TSLA, NFLX\n- Short momentum stocks - same guys as above, just without leverage\n- Short indexes - Nasdaq historically has bigger pullbacks in corrections than the S&amp;P and DJIA, so favor QQQ inverses\n- Long treasuries - I would go midyear treasuries (5-10 yr notes), but all treasuries should fare well\n\nLet me hear what you think, if you have anything that blows my argument out of the water, I'm glad to hear it, as well as any possible yolos.

{"id":"3i6p8j","author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm Alex, a designer from Sheffield. I'm currently running my fourth Kickstarter project (a map-based t-shirt project called Citee), which is doing quite well, and I'd like to share a few things I've learned along the way. Compared to some Kickstarter projects, mine are only modestly successful – but I'm more than happy with what I've achieved. Feel free to ask me anything.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCitee map t-shirts on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/szabohaslam/citee-fashion-city-maps-printed-on-t-shirts \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Why I turned to Kickstarter.**\n\nBack in 2011 I hated my job – to the extent of loathing the very fabric of existence. Having trained and worked as a designer for some years, I found myself back in education after being made redundant (the recession was tough on the design industry). So there I was, employed as a cover teacher in a secondary school, depressed to the point of suffering anxiety attacks on the journey to work. One Friday, after a particularly bad week – or month (or year?), I decided I'd had enough and started on a plan to escape.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBy now design was 'something I used to do', and little more than a hobby. So, when I created my first set of silkscreen prints, the problems were threefold: I was broke; I didn't have any friends with printing equipment; I didn't have any contacts to promote my work. But, spurred on by the thought of going back to school, I looked for ways to get my ideas off the ground. Kickstarter seemed like the best option: I knew the buzz around a successful project would put me on the radar of design agencies, and get me out of the rut.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFour years later I'm working in a design studio and running my fourth project. These are a few things I've learned. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**You need a good product or service.**\nIt sounds obvious, but Kickstarter is awash with failed campaigns – it's not always obvious who they're meant for. You need to offer something that fulfils a need, and identify your target audience early on. Be clear on your objectives.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Study successful (and unsuccessful) campaigns.**\nExamine the practice of other creators – especially if your project is similar. What do they say about themselves? How do they present rewards? Which blogs or journalists covered them? Google is your friend: narrowing your search range to the funding period of any given project will provide data about the promotional activities of the creator – use Kicktraq (very handy for building a media list).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tell a story.**\nIt's not enough to have a good product. You need to make it personal. Who are you? What are your skills and experience? Where did the idea come from? Why do people need your product? Why should we trust you? People like to know what they're investing in and, if you can engage them at an emotional level, you stand a better chance of succeeding.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Build and maintain your network.**\nI'm no recluse, nor am I shy, but networking and communicating with people doesn't come naturally: I like sitting indoors, curtains drawn, watching bleak films or listening to Aphex Twin in the dark; it's safe to say building a network was especially hard for me (and still is). I'm lucky to have a supportive network of friends, who share my work across social media. That goes a long way: without them, I'd never get any of my projects off the ground.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not brilliant when it comes to social media, but there are simple things you can do to build an audience. Follow people with similar interests and engage with them. Run competitions – 'RT and follow to win my product' – and ask individuals for feedback. You don't necessarily need 60k followers on Twitter, just a few supportive people who will lend a hand. Remember the people you're reaching out to are humans, not robots: they don't exist to give you money or plug your products. If you find you have repeat backers, reward them with something. Show people that you're grateful for their support, and they're much more likely to come back in future.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nReach out to journalists who you think will be interested (do your research), and be nice to them - they're doing you a favour by covering your project. Talk to people who engage with your campaign and thank everyone who shares it. If you get a lot of sales leading from a blog, offer something in return (maybe write an exclusive article or send a gift).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEach campaign I'd say I pitch to about 150 bloggers and journalists: on average maybe 10-15 of those will reply; I'm doing well if five of them decide to publish. It's frustrating that such a labour-intensive activity (researching 150 websites and tailoring emails to suit) doesn't yield many responses: I don't know whether bloggers aren't interested in my work, which I can do nothing about, or whether I'm pitching badly, which is something I can change – if only I knew what to improve (I'd love to hear from someone who gets a lot of press coverage).\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Find a champion.**\nI was incredibly lucky with my first project: two prominent musicians liked what I was doing and shared my project across their networks – reaching exactly the sort of people I needed. Your champion could be a journalist or a niche blogger; they'll add credibility to your campaign and help reach your audience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Welcome constructive criticism with open arms.**\nSometimes you across a great idea for an additional reward to your campaign, or correct a mistake in your pitch, if you listen to backers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSuggestions on price can be tricky. You need to make sure your prices are competitive, but don't enter into a race to the bottom: there will always be someone willing to sell products cheaper. I can't compete toe-to-toe with Allposters or Society 6 on price, so I don't even try. If people like your product and your story, they will support you; if not, they shop somewhere else. That's life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Be nice to haters.**\nI've had people get in touch for the sole reason of informing me my work is 'crap', that they could do it better, or that I'm a con artist because posters sold on Amazon are cheaper. Politely thank them for their message, and move on – you're wasting time engaging them further. Accept you can never please everyone (nor should you try).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Support fellow creators.**\nIf you spot an interesting project that isn't doing so well, and you can see a flaw or a way to improve, tell the creator. Share their campaign with your network. Put them in touch with a journalist who you know would love to write about exactly this sort of project. Be nice to people, and they'll return the gesture – every time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Post updates.**\nThis builds trust, which is important if you experience delays during fulfillment. If you plan on running more than one campaign, you have to make sure you build a good reputation: I've been pretty shocked by some creators who don't fulfill rewards for several months, but won't offer a refund or explanation. If you want to build trust, don't be that guy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nMy third campaign had a protracted series of issues that began when a supplier ran out of stock. That held up my printer, which in turn held up my box manufacturer and left me weeks behind schedule. I would've had a lot of angry people if I hadn't kept everyone informed. Some backers asked for refunds, which I wasn't obliged to give – but I issued without question; the delays weren't my fault, but maintaing a good reputation was more important than pocketing money.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What I would do differently.**\nLots of things! My experience with bloggers and journalists has been mixed, and most don't reply so I'm a little puzzled by what I'm doing wrong.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo far I haven't taken out any adverts, mainly because I can't afford them. I have a feeling a well-placed ad would go a long way, but it's risky: if it doesn't work, my profits are diminished (many website or magazine ads are so expensive they'd completely wipe out my budget). I'd love to hear from anyone who had some success on this point.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nTake a look at https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/szabohaslam/created to view all of my campaigns.","name":"t3_3i6p8j","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-24 12:18:54","week":35}

Accept you can never please everyone (nor should you try).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Support fellow creators.**\nIf you spot an interesting project that isn't doing so well, and you can see a flaw or an easy way to improve things, tell the creator. Share their campaign with your network. Put them in touch with a journalist who you know would love to write about exactly this sort of project. Be nice to people, and they'll return the gesture – every time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Post updates.**\nThis builds trust, which is important if you experience delays during fulfillment. If you plan on running more than one campaign, you have to make sure you build a good reputation: I've been pretty shocked by some creators who don't fulfill rewards for several months, but won't offer a refund or explanation. If you want to build trust, don't be that guy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nMy third campaign had a protracted series of issues that began when a supplier ran out of stock. That held up my printer, which in turn held up my box manufacturer and left me weeks behind schedule. I would've had a lot of angry people if I hadn't kept everyone informed. Some backers asked for refunds, which I wasn't obliged to give – but I issued without question; the delays weren't my fault, but maintaing a good reputation was more important than pocketing money.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What I would do differently.**\nLots of things! My experience with bloggers and journalists has been mixed, and most don't reply so I'm a little puzzled by what I'm doing wrong.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo far I haven't taken out any adverts, mainly because I can't afford them. I have a feeling a well-placed ad would go a long way, but it's risky: if it doesn't work, my profits are diminished (many website or magazine ads are so expensive they'd completely wipe out my budget).

{"id":"3i7284","author":"[deleted]","body":"Today’s optimist sees nothing but growth today-and-tomorrow.  The optimist sees growth today through an increase in opportunities in stock.  Over the past six years, those who have invested into nearly any stock have seen growth in their portfolios at an exceptional pace.  Those who invested into Victoria’s Secret (LB) at $6.26 on March 6, 2009, for example, would have netted a 1,198.56 percent gain today (August 19, 2015) at $81.27.  In addition to believing that growth is occurring today, the optimist believes that growth will occur tomorrow.  By spending six years in growth, the bullish investor is forgetting the events of 2007 and 2008, ones which led to collapse of stock price.  Without past memories, the amnesiac bullish investor will willingly invest into any trendy company so long as the price of the company continues to increase.  There is no need to time the market since the market will continue to rise in price. \n\t\nThe optimist will believe the growth will last forever due to the fiscal policy of the Federal Reserve.  In contrast to decades prior, when the 1970’s brought a time of high interest rates, today’s interest rates are next-to-nothing.  With cheap money beckons cheap gains.   Those who have easier access to money have easier access to stocks that takes advantage of the cheap money.  Today’s climate has seen record amounts of mergers-and-acquisitions through cheap debt.  Charter Communications, a debt-laden cable company, has acquired Time Warner Cable through cheap funds. No doubt, the optimist that seeks easy money will love easy gains. \n\t\nOptimists invest almost exclusively into securities.  The only land that allows for significant growth above interest rates comes from stocks.  The lack of inflation, the Federal Reserve preferring stocks over bonds, and belief that prosperity will prevent default, have all caused bond yields to shrink to record lows.  Yields in European countries now include negative percentages.  In other words, those who invest into Switzerland bonds, for example, will lose money once they pull out their money.   The optimist, therefore, has established a permanent resident in the city of Stocks. \n\nThe optimistic speculator of today will brag to his or her colleagues of his or her portfolio. In said portfolio contains a variety of securities trading at lofty P/E ratios.  Be it Facebook, Netflix, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Under Armor, and/or Amazon, today’s speculator looks for the securities equivalent of Kate Upton, the “it girl.”\n\t\nMeanwhile, today’s pessimist is worried about the current affairs of the market.  The pessimist realizes that the growth of gains will not last forever.  In fact, based on historical events, it would appear as if growth will slow down in the upcoming years.  Those who invest today will not experience the same gains exhibited by the optimists from two years prior; nor would today’s pessimistic investor want to invest into today’s market either. When a company such as Facebook has a higher valuation than Proctor &amp; Gamble, when Netflix has a higher valuation than CBS Corporation,  history shows that irrational exuberance will eventually catch up to irrational investors. \n\nMuch of today’s money used to purchase stocks comes from cheap money, funds made cheaper by the lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve over the same six years.  In a world of balance, the raising of the interest rate will lower stock prices; and in this same world, those who made gains today will lose them tomorrow.   \n\nThe pessimist is concerned about bond yields.  In a world where risk today is the same as risk five years previous, yields in both corporate and Government have decreased significantly.  One disturbing indication of the lowered bond yields involves a world where Solar City bonds have a return similar to American bonds.    \n\t\nThe value investor looks for stocks that are hated by the mass market.  Said investor metaphorically drives around at midnight without any headlights to guide him or her towards a certain value security.  Rather, it is instinct and logic that allows the value driver to traverse towards the destination.  While the collective market believes that Nathan’s, Michael Kors, Lumber Liquidators, Micron Technology, and oil stocks will end in burning flames, the value investor sees these stocks as paradise. \n\t\nTomorrow brings the opposite for both today’s optimist and pessimist.  When tomorrow comes, the roles will be reversed. Whereas today’s optimist is full of joy, tomorrows will be full of sorrow.  While today’s pessimist holds back, tomorrows will push forward. \n\t\nTomorrow’s pessimist will look in their portfolio and notice that many of their stocks that they held yesterday have been corrected towards a fairer value.   History shows this as fact.  The Yahoo of 1999 that closed at $108.17 closed at $4.34 in 2001. The investor who paid $2,073.76 in 2000 for AIG watched as their stock declined to $7 in 2009. Likewise, the investor who paid $69 for Twitter in 2014 is now seeing the stock at $27.60. Contrary to popular belief, timing the market is everything.  Those who invested into Microsoft at its’ peak in 1999 has lost 6.57 percent of their original value in 2015, despite years of steady growth and value investing principals. \n\t\nTomorrow’s pessimist will lament over the easiness of receiving funds during the peak of the market from a lowered interest rate.  Tomorrow’s pessimist will lament in the same way that they lamented in 2008 when they invested into bank stocks that collapsed due to the nature of their investments from cheap interest rates.  Tomorrow’s pessimist will also lament over investing into heavily leveraged companies that, now held to accountability, collapse under their weight.  AT&amp;T in 1999 bought TCI Communications from John Malone in a heavily leveraged deal in order to establish telecommunications supremacy.  The problem was that the funds came from cheap means through a lowered interest rate.  Once accountability was set forth, AT&amp;T discovered that they were unable to combat their debt, eventually becoming insolvent with massive short-term debt. \n\t\nThe pessimist of tomorrow will weep as their returns on former popular stocks plummet.  The former optimist will have held onto their stocks under the notion that the speculative companies will have recovered in price. This will prove not to be the case as in a market correction, formerly overvalued stocks will become more efficient via matching the price with value; and while the stocks of yesterday were high in price in contrast to its’ value, the price today would be low in comparison to its’ value.   Some of tomorrow’s pessimist will escape to bonds under the idea that price fluctuations in securities will affect bonds.  However, the speculator will realize that not only have yields collapsed due to the actions of the speculator, but many companies involved in the bond market collapsed due to a burgeoning of debt.   \nIn contrast to tomorrow’s pessimist, tomorrow’s optimist will be hopeful of the future. While the price of a stock during tomorrow’s market may be significantly lower than in the years prior, the value of many stocks has increased.  More risk arbitrage opportunities open up for the optimist.  Over a six-and-a-half year period, the stock of Dillard’s increased 1,815.11 percent .   While the stock had tremendous value – even in the market correction of the late-2000’s, the stock decreased in price simply because nearly every other stock did. The optimist of 2008 may have invested into the stock when the pessimist was selling; and in the process, may prove to increase their long-term income.  \nThe optimist of tomorrow will welcome the actions of the federal  reserve in increasing interest rates.  As interest rates rise, the stock price decreases.   As the interest rate rises, securities are held to accountability more compared to when the interest rates were down.  The optimist of tomorrow buys securities tomorrow in the same vein that a young female might buy bras-and-panties at a Victoria’s Secret semi-annual sale. \n\t\nBonds, convertibles, and preferred securities,  will become prevalent for optimists of tomorrow.  Companies that the investor knows have the capability of surviving yet are considered by tomorrow’s pessimist as in dire straits is a company that, while higher in yield, will be beneficiary to the opportunistic investor.  It is this reason that Warren Buffett was able to invest heavily into Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and Harley Davidson, companies whose fixed-income yields greatly surpassed the yields of yesterday’s optimist. \n\nToday’s pessimist has nothing to worry about in terms of today’s market.  It is true that the pessimist of today has little-to-no-returns to show for in comparison to the optimist of today.  However, once the snowball effect takes place in a bursting market, the pessimist will convert into an optimist, having been given numerous opportunities to use risk arbitrage.  Meanwhile, the optimist of tomorrow must not interfere in the actions of today’s optimist. As Luke 9:60 said, “Jesus said to him ‘let the dead bury their own dead.’” ","name":"t3_3i7284","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-24 14:44:25","week":35}

Basically offering to come to any location and take photos, and information of the items you want to sell and list them online on any platform and sell them. I originally asked for 10% of the sale, which didn't work out too well with my first customer. IT was alot of work with a lot of small collectibles. Took about 3 weeks and I only made about 80 dollars.\n\nI ended up giving a try with the Amazon FBA program which I really loved at first. I was buying things at thrift stores and selling them and making a pretty good profit. But, it wasn't consistent enough for me. So, I bought about 100 iPhone cases from Alibaba and was ready to give that a try. Within 12 hours of the cases hitting the Amazon warehouse, I sold 33 cases and made my money back and some. The next day I received a Cease and Desist letter from the company who made the cases demanding me to stop all sales of their cases. After numerous emails and no response, I got the cases returned to me and ended up selling them to a local wireless store for cheap just to get rid of them.\n\nThat brings me to today. I saw how fast the cases sold (they weren't a huge name brand, I actually never even heard of them until I bought them) so I started my own brand. I contacted numerous suppliers with my own design and one company got back to me. They didn't do the design I initially had thought of, but they sent me something that I did like, but was already done before. There isn't that big of a competition for these types of cases, and I find them very very useful. I had started the brand \"BomBox\" and my logo is only on the sides of the case (under the sleep and volume button). I wanted minimal branding and I wanted to do it differently than the others. I also ordered 500 cases (half for iPhone 6 and half for the 6+) initially to see the response I get before I expand to the other types of phones.\n\nI have shown off the case in public to about 20+ people and they all have the exact same reaction.

{"id":"3ia1jp","author":"[deleted]","body":"**An atmosphere of fear has continued to set into equity markets** and last time when I told you to be worried I never expected [this kind of response.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3hwo1s/you_lost_3_in_your_portfolio_today_lets_take_a/) It was very humbling and I just wanted to reach out and say thank you r/investing for such a great discussion Friday and Saturday. I also did not expect [this kind of response]( http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EVIX+Interactive#{\"range\":\"1d\",\"allowChartStacking\":true}) in the market place to what is without question a market correction in China.\n\n**Welcome to one of the most volatile markets of the decade!** This is a rare moment and you should cherish it because we don’t experience days like today very often. Well, try to forget about your portfolio, cherish this moment, and then keep reading. In fact, the Volatility Index hasn’t hit this day time high of 53.29 since the 2008 Financial crisis. So what are we to think of this? We have a growing population, a growing economy, earnings are still growing here in the U.S… I have always taken issue with the way unemployment is measured in the U.S. but it’s still better than it was in the aftermath of 2008. We don’t have a liquidity crisis. We will get to keep our homes this time. Why is everything nominally tearing downwards when our real lives seem just fine? This is something worth talking about. Here are my thoughts:\n\n**The futures curve is not a prediction of future prices.** Say what? That’s right, let me say it again for emphasis: The futures curve is not a prediction of future prices. I don’t care if its corn oil or concentrated orange juice. But this is a common perception of futures curves, and we all woke up to a radical downward shift in futures curves, so what is happening? In academia when calculating the true value of a futures contract there is one variable we use called the *Convenience Yield.* In simple terms, the convenience yield is the implied value of having downside protection in holding a futures contract. If you were able to buy a future today on say (the value of your own portfolio) for $X amount, and sell it a few months later when you were more certain of the economic value of your portfolio (what you could buy with it and sell it for) you would put value to the convenience of downside protection. This is why futures contracts are not future prices, there is value in certainty.\n\nSo what am I getting at? Markets are not perfectly efficient. Say what? I am full of surprises today aren’t I? Okay so markets are perfectly efficient, they will adjust entirely to the financial news of today over time, a year from now hindsight will be 20/20, this will be a blip in market movements. But today, do we know what will happen in China? What if the Fed raises rates? What if NK goes to war? Our market is not perfectly incorporating future events because they haven’t happened yet, Volatility, Volume, a spike in the Convenience yield? These are all signs of fear, but it’s not 2008 anymore.\n\n**We are seeing an amazing amount of volume in the market data** There is a lesson to be learned from all of this stuff. When ’08 happened many investors reacted by panic selling, today some are taking profits and buying gold off of Fox news. Look you thought the valuations in equities looked a little high didn’t you, at least agree with me that the Shake Shack valuation was hilariously silly. But why didn’t you pour every dollar into a short position, why didn’t I? Because timing the market wrong can bankrupt a strategy based on timing the market right alone. You might think the Fed created this mess, or China did, or irrational investors did, maybe you were calling the top on Friday, or maybe you were calling the bottom, but it’s easy, so easy to type these words. Our risk tolerances prevent us from bearing the pain of being completely wrong in an all in strategy, this is why we diversify, and hope all trees are growing towards the sky. You will lose most of the time in an all in situation because being right in the short run is nearly impossibly expensive, especially for the Chinaman who borrowed on their homes.\nAnd this party looked so good didn’t it? We all loved the returns in our 401k’s didn’t we? We knew something was coming, but none of us had the balls to try and time it because we would have been wrong for the last 7 years. So we wait and retroactively react.\n\n**So what do you think was happening in China** when people were mortgaging their homes to buy equity positions in ridiculously overvalued Chinese firms? Everyone wanted in on the party as long as it lasted, now everybody wants out because the average Chinese investor doesn’t even understand how valuation works. \n\n**The problem in markets today is a valuation problem.** We are entirely different from China in that we are still experiencing earnings growth in the United States, things are good here. But we are entirely similar to China in that on a Macro level we behave just as they do, we are all human anyways. No one wants to leave a party until it’s over, and no one wanted to get out of the market until the last 5 days. \nAnybody can take a buy recommendation on a few stocks seriously and get in the market for the last 7 years and then all of a sudden when all this fear arises. People get scared, they think to themselves “what the hell did I just do, why do I even own Baidu and Tesla, it had a buy rating on Yahoo finance?!” But they don’t have their own target price, or their own valuation. Either red looks like a time to stop and get out to the emotional investor or red looks like buying opportunities to disciplined investor and guys the disciplined investor always wins.\n*So what do we do now?*\n\nHey [u/sayitlikeyoumemeit](https://www.reddit.com/user/sayitlikeyoumemeit) is this your time? [Some people are in tears today,]( https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3hwo1s/you_lost_3_in_your_portfolio_today_lets_take_a/cubakh0) what should we do? I have a few ideas. First, you know what the dividend yield in dollar terms in my portfolio was today? The same that it was Friday, and Thursday, and Wednesday. Guys if you want downside protection and upside potential dividend stocks are a place of safety in times of uncertainty. Secondly, remember how I told you about my rolling vix call option portfolio? Well since Vix is up a whopping 45.34% and is at it’s 5 year high I have a proposal for you: Buy Puts. The stock market can have a correction over three months but that won’t create a value for the implied volatility like we have seen today. Buy the right to sell it at $40 for $20.48 on February 17th and just sit on your hands if you’re feeling lucky ;) I don’t see implied volatility going much higher over 6 months.\n\n**As for Commodities I don’t understand the fuss** Who cares oil is now $37.93? this is a great thing for Uber, a great thing for Amazon, for PepsiCo, and for my discretionary spending (I drive a jeep the gas mileage is quite horrid.) But I do my share for global warming and guys what you have to understand is that cheap oil is great for everyone who isn’t trying to sell cheap oil. We should welcome it, find confidence in the new market equilibrium, and hope this delays getting some fracking runoff in our well-water! \n\nIn conclusion, I’m not calling the top or the bottom, but I am calling the top for volatility for now. Valuations are out of whack, but this isn’t 2008, I don’t believe we should have the same concerns for our market as the Chinese have for theirs. If you are a lazy investor, now is the time to see red as an opportunity to buy. I’m not saying everything is a good deal. But this is a good time to brush up on fundamentals, get a basic understanding of operating cash flow, and hunt for value (and dividend value) understanding that it provides both downside protection and upside potential in the long run.\n","name":"t3_3ia1jp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-25 03:43:55","week":35}

{"id":"3ia8cu","author":"quan1980","body":"I am selling a product that there were no competitors. When another competitor showed up, all of a sudden my front page of \"Most Helpful Reviews\" change from 5 and 4 star reviews to 1 star reviews with 20-30 votes. It was out of the ordinary since it happen almost overnight. And it did not make sense since my 5-4 star reviews may had 5 or 6 votes.\n\nMy sales started to slip and the competitor surpassed me in rank. \n\nAfter a few months, my 5 and 4 star reviews made its way back. And my sales increased and surpassed the competitor. After 3-4 days, BOOM, the 2-3 star reviews are on the front page. But now total votes increased from 20 to 50. 50 people total down voting my 5 star reviews and 50 voting up my 1 and 2 star reviews. \n\nMy 5 star review from a top 1000 reviewer got over 30-40 down votes in one day. \n\n**It was nuts.** \n\nAfter the first round of down votes, I took a daily screenshot of the front page reviews. So I was able to show, for example, the top 1000 competitor review getting a 30-40 down votes overnight.\n\nSo I sent this to Amazon. Usually I would get that \"we forwarded it to the team and if they see anything usual they will make the change in 4-6 weeks\". \n\nThis time I email them with the screen shots. And did not get the usual reply. So I felt that, \"ok, maybe the sceenshots are going to help my case.\"\n\nAfter a follow up email, I got the \"we are working on creating better tools to prevent this from happening\". \n\nSo I am frustrated because my overall review average is 4.5 and the competitor’s is 4.4. And when a customer sees my product page with these 1 and 2 star reviews, I lose sales. \n\nThey probably hired some person with multiple unique Amazon accounts to do the down votes, etc. You can find them easily on Elance.\n\nI believe in competition, but not in cheap shots. At the end I do not have hard evidence that he is doing it, but the circumstances seem to obvious. \n\n**So what do I do?**\n\n1. I felt like hiring someone on Elance to downvote him to even the playing field. But it can be a back and forth war, even though my front page is still 1-2 star reviews. I do not think he will risk upvoting his own product since that may leave a traceable trail in the future.\n\n2. Or I can just undercut him on price and squeeze him out. I fortunately have other revenue streams where I can weather that strategy. For him, this is his only product\n\n3. Or do I call him? On his website he has a contact number. I was thinking about just contacting him and just talk to the guy. But of course I will use a fake number and probably not my real name. \n\nI am just frustrated, I probably will just undercut him and not hire someone to downvote him. Do not want to risk losing my Amazon account. \n","name":"t3_3ia8cu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-25 04:36:13","week":35}

The more I look at the numbers however the further away my goals seem to be. \n\nMy goals are:\n \n * Save up an emergency fund\n * Pay off credit card debt\n * Save for a house down payment (combined with my girlfriend's income, which is much higher than mine)\n * Increase the value of my retirement fund, either by opening a personal IRA or contributing to my American Funds account pre-tax\n\nMy income:\n  \n * Primary Job take home - $2,000/month\n * Second Job take home - $800-1,000/month with tips and quarterly bonus\n\nMy expenses:\n\n * $1,100/month - rent, utilities, insurance, phone bill, gym, toll, gas, and groceries\n\nMy debts:\n\n * Owe $19,500 on car at 2.9% APR ($407/mo for 48 more months)\n * Owe $1,300 on 17% APR - Amazon Chase credit card\n * Owe $2800 on 0.0% APR - Chase Slate (will balloon in 11 months)\n\nMy assets:\n \n * $800 in savings\n * $15,000 in American Funds retirement. it is 100% employer contributed and they do not match further.\n\nI was given a small windfall by my uncle, he had purchased some stocks in 2009 which tripled in value so I cashed them out this recent July for $2500. This is what prompted me to start actually looking at my finances as I was taking the bus/riding my bike for the last 5 years. That was mostly used as a down payment on the car.\n\nMy girlfriend makes a bit more money per month than I do, but has at least $20,000 still in student debt. she has about $4000 in savings already. Our plan is to have $25,000 - 30,000 for a 10% down payment on a house in the pacific northwest. As my girlfriend wants a kid, we've decided that we should get a nest first, then save together for baby expenses until we're sure we have enough laying around for her to take some time off work. She is a teacher and gets summers off and an OK maternity leave. But all of that part is up in the air as we are not yet married. \n\nThe plan:\n\n * Avalanche method to pay off the amazon card. Should take 3 months. \n * Build up the emergency fund to at least $1,500 for one month's expenses\n * Pay off the 0% card in hopefully 3 months.\n * Begin saving all extra money for the down payment savings.\n\nThanks PF and I welcome your feedback.","name":"t3_3ic9vl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-25 17:02:11","week":35}

{"id":"3ictgh","author":"[deleted]","body":"*The original article has some images as well and is properly formatted, so there is a link in the end in case you are struggling to read it here.\n\nI hope it helps and let me know if you have any questions!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you want to start your own business but you don’t have any money to do it?\n\nWould you like to free yourself from a soul stealing job?\n\nOr would you like to have a side income to cover your expenses while in college?\n\nThen, this article has been written for you. Nowadays, it’s possible to earn money from home. There are many ways to do that but I will show you one that works.\n\nAnd that way is by working as a freelancer on fiverr.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know fiverr is a global online marketplace offering tasks and services, beginning at a cost of $5 per job performed.\n\nNow, $5 might don’t seem much to you but running a business on fiverr can be scaled up in a degree that you can make up to $200 per job or more. There are many people on fiverr earning much more than in ordinary jobs.\n\nHow Much Money Can You Earn From Home If You Work On Fiverr &amp; Why It’s Better Than Working a Normal Office Job\n\nNow, before talking about how exactly you can make money on fiverr let’s see how much money you can make.\n\nOn fiverr you can make money in 3 ways.\n\nThese are: normal jobs also known as gigs, gig extras and custom offers.\n\nWhile each gig costs only $5 this can be easily scaled up with gig extras.\n\nFor instance, if someone offers a logo creation service you might pay $5 for a normal logo. But if you want things like higher quality image, extra fast delivery or other deals you can pay for these with gig extras. The price range for gig extras is from $5 to $50 and you can buy multiple gig extras.\n\nFor example someone could buy a logo for $5 and pay $20 for express delivery and another 30$ for buying the full commercial rights. That’s $55 for the seller. If you have only 2 orders like this one per day you make $110.\n\nNow fiverr has a 20% commission so from these $110 you get $88.\n\n$88 x 30 days = $2618 per month!\n\nOf course, this is just an example to show how you can earn money from fiverr. In reality you can make less or more. For instance check out this seller.\n\nRight now that I am writing this article he has 220 open orders that should be delivered in the next 2 days.\n\nThat’s $880 for him in 2 days without counting that many of his orders have gig extras! Even if all his orders are of $5 he is still making $13,000 per month. And that’s only from 1 gig. He is obviously making more money from his other gigs and his gig extras.\n\nThis is to show you the earning potential of fiverr.\n\nWill you make that much? That’s up to you.\n\nIt depends on many factors but most importantly on your existing skills. If you can offer a valuable service like graphic design, writing or translating you could offer your service on fiverr and earn money from home.\n\nBut how is working on fiverr better than a normal job? You can do these thing in real life as well. You don’t need to work from home.\n\nI would say that the biggest benefit is the freedom to work when you want. You don’t have a boss to listen to. If you don’t want to work today you can go to the beach and drink mojitos under the sun. You could never do that if you have a boss.\n\nAlso, the amount of money you make is directly related to your skills, knowledge and effort. The more you know and the more you work the more money you can earn.\n\nOn the other hand, you wouldn’t be able to persuade your boss to double your salary if you were working at a regular job.\n\nTo see the benefits of working online with more details check out this article: 13 Reasons You Should Start An Internet Based Business.\n\nNow, I know that there are countless people online who advertise different formulas of making money online. There are many scammers that want to sell you programs that don’t work hoping that they will make money from you.\n\nTo show you that I am not one of these people I feel that I must show you proof about my statements. I need to show you proof that I really follow the methods I will explain in this article. That I really make money on fiverr.\n\nIMAGE 1\n\nHere are my earnings from the past 1 month and 5 days. It’s $1828 – real hard cash. I know it’s not a fortune; it’s actually peanuts in front of what other sellers on fiverr make.\n\nBut if I were able to make that money without any specific and ultra developed skill then I am confident to say that you could do it as well. And if you are extremely talented or creative you could make even more than I make.\n\nBut even if you only made about $1000 per month – which is certainly possible – you could cover a lot of your expenses. If you live like a Spartan, you wouldn’t need more than $1000 bucks to live decently.\n\nThat money ($1000-2000) can be made on fiverr working only 1-4 hours per day. Could you imagine having the rest 20-22 hours to spend however you want?\n\nYou could use that money to pay your student loans, to pay your college expenses or to fund a side business.\n\nFor me that money is pretty enough to fully live by. I live in Greece. The basic salary here is $800 for 9-11 hours of work. And that’s what about of 90% of people make.\n\nIt’s obviously better to work on fiverr for more money and less time. Of course, in other countries, these $1500 that I make are not too much. But if you hate your job or want money to start your business they are a god sent gift.\n\nNow, before getting into the nitty-gritty details on how you can earn money from home using fiver, let’s explain something extremely important.\n\nIf you want to make money online from fiverr you must live by this principle.\n\nBut it’s not limited on fiverr, it can be applied to everything you do. So read carefully and never forget this one:\n\nTreat Your Fiverr Business Like You Would Treat a Regular Business\n\nWorking on Fiverr is Not a Hobby, It’s a Business\n\nI can’t really stress the importance of this statement. If you want to make earn money online from fiverr you have to treat your fiverr business like you would be treating a big corporation.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nTwo things:\n\n1.That you should act like a professional.\n\n2.That you should care about your brand.\n\nIf you were the CEO of Microsoft, will you be acting like you were playing Monopoly?\n\nWould you be rude to customers? Would you treat it like a hobby?\n\nIf you treat it like a hobby you won’t make money.\n\nDo you want to earn money from home? Then you have to be serious about it.\n\nBut now let’s get into the practical part.\n\nI won’t spend time to explain you the fiverr interface, how to set up you account or other things like that. You can find them easily online or figure it out on your own with a little experimentation.\n\nThe rest of this article is meant to be practical and contain methods that you can start using right now to earn money from home using fiverr.\n\nHere is†how you can use fiverr to create a money-making machine:\n\nFocus On Gigs That Don’t Need Much Time\n\nThat’s a no-brainer. Spending one hour for $5 – basically $4 after fiverr’s cut is not the best use of your time. Your goal should be to spend the least amount of time and make the maximum amount of money.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nYou should sell gigs that don’t take more than 20 minutes to complete. The shorter they take; the better.\n\nIdeally, if you could spend only 5 minutes on a gig and get $5 it would be great. That’s because one hour of work would give you $60. That’s a great hourly rate.\n\nHowever, if you take into account factors like reading and responding to messages, organizing your account and other minor things you would spend more than 5 minutes on a gig.\n\nEven if you could have it ready in just 5 minutes there would be an extra 2-3 minutes per order (or more) that would be wasted on other things.\n\nBecause there is no need to make this complicated, just have in your mind that you should try to sell gigs that don’t require much time.\n\nIf they take much time, you should get paid more. Otherwise they are not worth it. You don’t want to sell your time and soul to fiverr. You want to make money but without sacrificing your time.\n\nI could definitely make more than $3000 per month but this would consume a lot of my time. I prefer making less money and having more time to spend on myself or on other businesses that will bring more money in the long-term. And that’s what you should do as well.\n\nWhat You Can Sell On Fiverr: Start By Focusing On What You Already Know\n\nMaking money from home working as a freelancer depends a bit on your existing skills.\n\nDo you know something valuable that you could sell on fiverr?\n\nSome gigs that have a lot of demand are:\n\nGraphic Design: Photoshop work, turning people to cartoons, creating caricatures, logo design, e-cover creation, t-shirt designs, infographics etc.\n\nOnline Marketing: Do you know how to build backlinks? Do you have any search engine optimization knowledge? Do you know about social media marketing?\n\nWriting: Can you write articles? Can you write sales copy? Can you translate from one language to another?\n\nThese are some standard areas that you could get into. If you know anything from the above you could make good money instantly.\n\nGenerally speaking, you can sell whatever you know provided it’s valuable.\n\nWhat you will sell depends on your skills.\n\nTake a paper and write down your skills, write down everything you know that could be valuable to people. Then go to fiverr and check if you can sell any of these skills.\n\nHow To Earn Money From Fiverr Even If You Have No Skills\n\nEven if you don’t have any previous life experience there are certain services that you could sell easily. Services that are high in demand but don’t require any particular skill.\n\nWhich are these services?\n\nVideo Testimonials\nThey only thing you need to sell this service is to have the confidence to sit in front of a camera and speak English fluently. It’s a very easy gig that can even lead you to become a top rated seller.\n\nMany of Fiverr’s top rated sellers have started by selling video testimonials and if you search for video testimonials on fiverr you will see that many of those who sell them are top rated sellers.\n\nIf you have a pleasant personality, if you can smile and look happy in front of a camera or if you can play the serious business man-type you can certainly do video testimonials and make good money from them.\n\nYou don’t have to look like a model, but the more good-looking you are the better it is.\n\nDon’t worry about the camera in the beginning. Just focus on your presence. Look like a winner, happy, unique and people will pay you for being yourself. But I recommend buying a professional HD camera after a while.\n\nReddit Link Karma\nOk this one is actually very easy – even a baby could do it. Yet, you can make pretty good cash.\n\nFor those who don’t know what reddit is: reddit is a social network which is divided in many subreddits. Each subreddit has a specific topic (Cars, fitness, motivation) and its own moderators.\n\nCheck out this post if you don’t know how reddit works at all. It’s important to read it so you can understand what you are doing and how this helps your buyers.\n\nNow, for this gig you will be selling accounts that have link karma.\n\nThe more link karma an account has, the more authoritative it is considered. Many people want to take advantage of reddit’s traffic but they can’t do it with an account that doesn’t have link karma.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause redditors are very savvy and know when you go use reddit†only to promote your website. The result is that you get downvoted and no one reads your site. On the other hand, if you have link karma it looks like you are an active part of the community and you are more likely to get your posts accepted.\n\nThat’s why many people are searching for accounts that have link karma. So they can promote their links†on reddit and drive traffic to their websites.\n\nHere is how you can get link karma easily:\n\nThere are 3 subreddits where you can get link karma fast and without any effort. These are:\n\n1: Celebs\n\n2: Gentlemanboners\n\n3: Aww\n\nThe first is about sexy celebrities, the second is about sexy celebrities dressed in formal clothes and the third is about cute animals. You can’t imagine how much people on reddit love these things!\n\nAnd here is what you do:\n\nYou head over to imgur.com. Then you use the search filter to search either for a sexy celebrity you know or for something cute like a cat or puppy.\n\nIMAGE 2\n\nLet’s say we want to post in /r/Celebs.\n\nFind a picture of a celebrity you know and then right click on the image and copy image url.\n\nIMAGE 3\n\nThen go to the celebs subreddit -&gt; hit the ìsubmit linkî button -&gt; paste the url in the right field and write the name of the celebrity in the title field.\n\nDo that a few times during the day and let the link karma flow.\n\nReddit only allows you to post once every 10 minutes if you have a new account. After 4-5 posts you will be allowed to post more often: like 3 times per 10 minute. At this point you can post at the 3 subreddits above simultaneously.\n\nSocial Media Services.\nYou can easily sell social media services like Facebook likes, twitter tweets, retweets and favorites on fiverr. These gigs are extremely high in demand since everyone is looking to expand his profile and look popular.\n\nObviously you can’t sell real active followers but you will be able to give real-looking followers and likes.\n\nThere is a website called Addmefast.com. In this site you can like other people’s fanpages, follow people on twitter, instagram or pinterest and in exchange you get some virtual points. You can use these points to drive engagement to your own pages. Or to the pages of the people who buy your gig on fiverr.\n\nHowever, if you do this manually it would take up a lot of your time.\n\nFortunately, you can automate the process using a Mozilla Firefox add-on called iMacros. iMacros is a very useful add-on that can do repetitive tasks for you and save you tons of time.\n\nInstall it on your Firefox and then search Google for addmefast script for imacros. Find a script, follow the instructions and you will be able to gather a lot of virtual points in addmefast that you could use to drive likes, followers and other social signals to your buyers social media.\n\nI would recommend not using your real social accounts with addmefast because you will follow lots of inactive profiles and you don’t want your real profile to look spammy.\n\nBut if addmefast is spammy, why will people buy from me?\n\nI am glad you asked.\n\nMost people don’t care if the accounts that follow them aren’t used by active people. They just want to feed their ego and look popular.\n\nNobody on fiverr or anywhere can sell real-active followers. The best you can do is sell real-looking social signals.\n\nFor instance if a friend of yours has 10.000 followers on instagram do you think that someone else will check his followers one by one to look if they are real or fakes?\n\nOf course not, 99% of people are looking at the overall number.\n\nIf the overall number is high the account looks popular and the owner feels the same way.\n\nThat’s why selling this type of gig can make crazy money! There are tons of people out there who want to validate themselves and feel popular because†of their follower or like†numbers.\n\nConvert Files To Other Formats\nThere are many free converters online that you could use to convert different kind of files.\n\nYou can convert word doc files to epub, mobi or other kind of formats. You could also convert video files. For instance: AVI to mp3 or a YouTube video to mp3.\n\nMany people donít even know that there are websites that let you do this for free. Then they go to fiverr and pay you to do it.\n\nHere is a great free converter I have found: Free Converter. But if you do a quick search in Google you will find dozens more. Pick one that fits your needs.\n\nCreate a Slogan For a Company Or Website\nIf you are a little creative you can brainstorm some crazy slogan ideas for businesses or websites. In case you are not creative you can use these two free slogan generators:\n\nSloganGenerator.Org\nSloganGenerator.Co\nInsert your client’s keyword in these generators, find 1-2 good slogans and boom! You have just earned $5 for less than 5 minutes of work.\n\nSpell A Name Or Logo In Rice Alphabet Soup\nDoes this sound foolish to you?\n\nActually, I have seen top rated sellers offering these gigs and making tons of money.\n\nOne seller I have found selling this service had more than 150 active orders and 1000+ positive reviews. Many people or business owners look for unique ways to advertise their business and that’s why this gig is high in demand.\n\nGenerally, everything that is creative or unique has the possibility to sell on fiverr. One guy is a top rated seller and the only thing he does is filming videos of him wearing different kind of costumes. He is dressed like a pirate or a Samurai and makes a video with your message.\n\nYou donít have to do this to make money. But if you have a creative idea or if you can do something unique, there are many people that would pay for it.\n\nRegarding the soup gig: you only have to buy some rice with alphabet letters from the super market and take a photo of it in a soup. Check out this gig as an example.\n\nHow To Earn Money From Home By Reading These 2 Free Books\n\nThe knowledge in books is unlimited. The only thing you need is to read a book or two on a subject and then you will have more knowledge than the average Joe.\n\nYou can go and sell this knowledge on fiverr. You donít need any particular skills. You only have to be willing to spend an hour or two reading a book. And you can make money from it.\n\nHere is an example on how to do it:\n\nKindle Formatting\n\nIf you have ever tried to publish a book on Amazon kindle you would have noticed how annoying formatting is.† There are thousands of self-published authors on Amazon that donít know how to properly format their books. And they are willing to pay you hard cash for doing it.\n\nAll you have to do is to read the following two books: Building your Book For Kindle and Formatting Of Kindle Books: A Brief Tutorial.\n\nThere are more resources available online and if these books are not enough you can easily find more information with a quick Google search.\n\nOr you can spend 5$ and read this book as well. I donít think this is necessary because†the first two will give you enough knowledge. But if you donít feel confident with your formatting skills you can always read some more.\n\nAfter you have read these books you need to apply your knowledge before selling it on fiverr. Go to Amazon and download their Kindle Previewer.\n\nThen take a book you have bought or download a free e-book from somewhere online and copy paste the content in a word document. Follow all the steps you have learned and try to format it properly.\n\nI would recommend using a short book (about 20 pages). Then use the Kindle Previewer to check if it looks correctly. After you are confident enough with your formatting skills go to fiverr and start selling your knowledge.\n\n2 More Gigs You Can Sell Without Any Skills ñ But With a Small Monthly Investment (less than 50$)\n\nWhich are these gigs?\n\nSpinning Articles With WordAi\nWordAi is the only article spinner I have found that spins articles which look like they are written by human. Most article spinners are just changing some synonyms and the final result isnít readable at all. It costs $49.95 per month but you can quickly make that money back.\n\nHow can you use WordAi to earn money from home using fiverr:\n\nThere are tons of people who are looking for cheap content for their websites. †If you try to write articles on your own you will spend a lot of time on each one. Most articles need some research so even if you are a fast writer they will definitely consume a lot of precious time.\n\nAs I told you above your goals should be to minimize the time spent on fiverr while maximizing the money you make. WordAi lets you do that.\n\nYou just go to an article directory like EzineArticles and find an article on a given topic. Then you use WordAi to change the article and make it unique. This will take 1-2 minutes. After that you should read the article to make sure it makes sense. If itís necessary you might need to change some things to make it more readable.\n\nBut this will definitely take less time than writing an article from scratch. When you have your content ready you should use a plagiarism checker to make sure that Google doesnít consider the article as duplicate content.\n\nHere are two free plagiarism checkers that you could use: 1 and 2. Alternatively you can use copyscape, which is paid but still very affordable ($0.05 per search).\n\nVideoscribe Whiteboard Animations\nVideoscribe is a paid tool that costs $20 per month and lets you create whiteboard animation videos. These are extremely high in demand on fiverr as more and more small businesses use them to advertise their services.\n\nAccording to Adelie Studios 74% of all internet traffic by 2017 will be from videos and this proves why this type of gig sells so well!\n\nHow to use Videoscribe to earn money from home using fiverr:\n\nIf you think that creating whiteboard animations is difficult then you will be surprised when you actually see how easy it is. You donít need any previous experience in graphic design or video editing.\n\nSparkol Videscribe has 3-4 tutorials that explain you how the software works. After you watch them you will be able to create pretty good animations and sell them on fiverr.\n\nHow To Find The Right Category, Title &amp; Tags For Your Gig\n\nOne of the most important aspects of selling on fiverr is optimizing your gigs to be easily found in searches. If you donít use the right categories, title and tags then no one will find your gig.\n\nNow that you know what you can sell on fiverr letís see how you can set up your gig correctly:\n\nCategory:\n\nIMAGE 4\n\nThere are several methods to choose the right category but I will give you the simplest one. It depends on what you want to sell so let’s say you want to sell article writing services.\n\nThen you search for your keyword in the search bar and press enter. Afterwards, you have to check the left sidebar and see which sub-category is the most used one.\n\nFor this example it’s Articles &amp; Blog Posts. As you see many people put their gigs in the ìcreative writingî sub-category. But that’s wrong as more buyers will look for their desired service in the subcategory that pop-ups first:\n\nIMAGE 5\n\nTitle &amp; Tags:\n\nFor your gig title you should better use a short one that is descriptive and indicates the value of your service. Fiverr allows you to use a maximum of 80 characters but gives you a warning when you use more than 60 characters.\n\nHowever the shorter the title is, the better it converts. Generally a length about 50 characters is great:\n\nIMAGE 6\n\nAlso fiverr allows you to capitalize one word and you MUST take advantage of that as it makes your gig stand out.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right tags the only thing you have to do is to see what other popular gigs are using. Search for your desired keyword and look what tags the top 3 sellers use. Then pick some of these tags for your own gig.\n\nHow To Automate Deliveries And Minimize Time Spent On Fiverr\n\nAs I told you before, one of the most important things you must do on fiverr to be successful is to minimize the time you spend and maximize your profits.\n\nYou canít imagine how time-consuming some tasks can be.\n\nFor instance: if you try to reply to each message you get and write what you did for each order you delivered you will lose tons of time.\n\nThere is a very useful plug-in that can minimize the time you spent and make your interactions on fiverr a little more automated and faster.\n\nIt’s called EverCopy. What it does is that it allows you to copy and paste quick notes easily from your browser.\n\nIMAGE 7\n\nEverCopy is very practical and it will save you a lot of time from the following tasks:\n\n1.Delivering Orders\n\n2.Reviewing Orders\n\n3.Reminding Buyers To Review Your Gig\n\nYou only have to write one generic message once for each of these cases and save it with EverCopy. From that point the only thing you have to do is to click copy and paste which takes less than 2 seconds.\n\nThree Things You Must Do If You Want To Succeed On Fiverr\n\n1. Always Have a Video For Your Gigs\n\nThis one is extremely important! Fiverr tells you that gigs with videos sell 220% more.\n\nDon’t ignore them!\n\nEven a short – 30 second video could help your video rank better and get more sales. Fiverr is not explaining how exactly having a video helps but itís probably a part of their algorithm.\n\nWhat type of videos you can use:\n\nMake a video filming yourself talking to the camera\nIf you canít make a video on your own I would recommend using a free video editing software to make a video with some slides explaining what you do.\nYou can pay $5 on fiverr and tell someone to create an animation video for you.\nIf you are just camera shy you can record your screen with a screen recording software. Just speak and record your voice explaining what your service is about. You could also show a graph or an image relative to the service you offer.\n2. Always Overdeliver Until You Get The Ball Rolling\n\nEvery beginning is hard. The same happens with fiverr. When you are a new seller you will have to give more than your competition does if you want to start making money.\n\nFor instance let’s say you are selling ìreddit link karma.\n\nIf you see that your competition is selling 500 link karma for $5 with expected delivery in 7 days you must offer 800 link karma and expected delivery in 5 days. That’s how buyers have an incentive to buy from you.\n\nOtherwise they will choose him because he will be already established and has some reviews. Buyers prefer Level 1-2 Sellers or Top Rated Sellers because they are already trusted.\n\nIf you want to have a chance of making money you have to give more than your competition(in the beginning). When you become a Level 1 or Level 2 Seller you will be able to give less or charge more for what you are selling.\n\n3. Understand That If You Want To Be Successful You Must Offer Exceptional Customer Service\n\nWhen you interact with buyers you must always be polite and make them feel appreciated.\n\nUse words like ìplease, you are welcome, thanks in advance, wish you have a great dayî in your messages.\n\nIt doesnít take much time but it gives the BEST return on investment. Make your customers feel like they are special and they will highly reward you for your kindness.\n\nHow To Always Get 5 Star Feedback &amp; Make Your Way To Top Rated Seller\n\nIf you want to become a top rated seller you must have 4.7-5 positive rating.\n\nHowever top rated sellers are manually picked by fiverr and just having high feedback doesnít guarantee that you will be picked. But if you want to stand a chance you MUST have more than 4.7 positive rating.\n\nI donít have any negative feedback at all. All my reviews are positive (4.9 average positive feedback) and I have maintained a 99% positive feedback.\n\nIMAGE 8\n\nIf you achieve that you have done your part and you are increasing your odds of being picked by fiverr. It’s not difficult to do this and here is how:\n\nAlways Be Offering Refunds:\n\nIf a buyer is not satisfied, don’t jeopardize your rating for $5.\n\nGive him his money back even if you have done the work and he won’t leave you a negative review. That’s why it’s important to not spend much time for your orders. The more you spend the more disappointed you will feel if you give a refund.\n\nNever Be Afraid To Cancel Orders:\n\nIf you see that a buyer asks too much, needs a lot of modifications or looks like a troublemaker cancel the order immediately and give him his money back.\n\nIf you cancel the order he can’t leave you negative feedback. He will get his money back and both of you will be happy.\n\nSome people on fiverr expect too much for $5. Donít spend your precious time to give them the entire world. If you need to cancel then cancel.\n\nDon’t sell your soul for $5. And don’t sell your soul for $50.\n\nI cancel more than 20 orders each month and many of them were large ones ($40+). Yes I might have lost an extra $500 or more but so what?\n\nI didnít lose 2 most important things: My time and my positive rating.\n\nBe Extremely Polite &amp; Genuinely Help Your Buyers\n\nAlways tell them that you are interested for their satisfaction and that you wonít be happy until they are.\n\nThis encourages them to leave you a positive review or at least it prevents them from leaving a negative one. Or cancelling the order.\n\nHow To Persuade Buyers To Change Any Negative Feedback And Maintain High Rating\n\nThere will be many times that someone will leave you a negative review. For me it has happened 5 times but I was able to remove it. If you see that someone leaves you a review under 3 stars, then contact him immediately and ask him why he wasn’t satisfied.\n\nThen offer him to modify the work. If he doesn’t agree or if he asks too much just tell him to give him a full refund.\n\nAgain you have to show your buyer that your number one priority is his satisfaction.\n\n99% of people are not dicks and will appreciate a full refund. In return they will remove the negative feedback. If someone is a dick and doesnít agree for anything you offer then just move on.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginally posted on: http://victorpride.com/make-money-from-home-with-fiverr/","name":"t3_3ictgh","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-08-25 19:14:11","week":35}

It was called [RootSuit](http://www.rootsuit.com/) until recently, and it's possible you saw us on [Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FltWGFcXcg).  I also run a free business accelerator - [52businesses](http://www.52businesses.com/), where we launched or helped to launch a new business every week for a year.\n\nWe're beginning to work on our Halloween Campaign for our new [Shark Costume](http://www.amazon.com/Center-Shark-Suit-Costume-Large/dp/B00U0GOIPM).  One of the best skills / concepts I learned from 52businesses is to ask people for help but make sure that you return value to them.  I've had an idea I'm very excited about that I'm ready to test here.\n\nI want to ask the community for help with marketing ideas for this product.  We will think through most of the ideas, put some into practice, watch the results and publish everything in a case study, giving credit to those who helped.  This way, we get some awesome and creative ideas that we never would have thought of on our own.  People who submit ideas get credit and exposure through our posts here, on our blog, and our social media.  They also get to see how their ideas perform so that they can iterate for their own purposes.  Finally, all of the info will be public so that everyone can learn from our work!\n\nI hope yall like this idea and participate in whatever way makes sense for you.\n\nQuestion 1:  We need ramp up our SEO efforts ASAP.  Our [Shark Suit on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Center-Shark-Suit-Costume-Large/dp/B00U0GOIPM) is ranking very well for \"shark costume\" and other similar keywords.  We want to focus on this page in terms of SEO.

It was fun, but now I have a zillion miles that will take me years to get through. Oh, and all these are still open except the United, so it's probably time to start thinning the herd.\n\nSide note: and I'm not saying this is the case, it's just a guess, but I always keep about $7-8k on 0 percent balance transfers purposefully, acquired 36 new cards in 1.5 years and was never denied for a credit card except once with Barclays. My opinion is the banks like to see people who have a good credit score AND carry a good size balance without going overboard. 75k salary. I do have about 18 years of credit history, but not sure if that really counts for much. I think they just like money.\n\nAnyone else hit too fast and get burned out?

{"id":"3igkad","author":"TheFadedBull","body":"Hey guys,  first watchlist im putting up for this sub. I trade mostly weekly options so thats what this list will focus on.  I am not in the business of predicting moves, I am in the business of capitalizing on the moves that happen.  So for this list, I will have both calls and puts being mentioned on the same stock.  Who knows where this market will head at open today.  I can most certainly see us fading down to mondays close before heading back up again, but take that with a grain of salt. \n\n**$AAPL  107 calls or 105 puts**.  Im leaning towards puts here, at least for the open.  106.15ish can be a problem so well keep an eye on that.  Like i said, we could be fading to mondays close whn the bell rings so ride them down there, and reevaluate the trade.  On the upside is 107.50- 108 http://imgur.com/ndA71pS\n\n**$PCLN  1220 calls  or 1180 puts** \nhard beast to tame, but she pays well.  1220 has been a wall, not just this week but in the past as well.  I cant tell where this one will open as it rarely has any vol in premkt so it could gap up $15 out of nowhere at the bell.  I suspect 1210 or around there.   Looking at 1220 calls to ride to that wall, and hope for a break over if things go our way.  If we fade at open, look for the 1180 puts.  These are expensive options, so dont grab a huge postion.  5-10 will do just fine as they move so much  http://imgur.com/NRxjZ2j\n\n**$CMG 720 calls or 685 puts**  I typically hate shorting the guac, but in this environment i just want to make some money.  The strikes here are a bit further out than the others as it likes to gap at open as well.  Lower liquidity than the other names listed so spreads could be an issue.  720 has been keeping it down and 685 is support from the last year.  be careful with this one  http://imgur.com/GFjWHBd\n\n**$TSLA  230 calls or 220 puts**   I have so many support/resistance lines on this one as I have traded it heavily in the past.  230 has been keeping us down this week and 220 is mondays close.   As with the others, wait for the morning shake out before deciding to enter  http://imgur.com/yb9dAnK\n\n\nKeep an eye on SPY and /ES for the direction well be heading this morning.  Dont rush any of these.  Also, its to be noted that PUTS are priced much higher than calls as we stand right now.  You can do the same thing Ive just done with just about any stock.  Look for the the next strike out on the upside or the downside,  then look for some possible levels that have been a factor as of late.  AMZN, NFLX, GOOG  any of those will work just as well.  These guys move so much that the options get such a nice net change.  5-10 contracts each is ideal.\n\nAny question or comments, please let me know.  Also, keep in mind this was written between 8-830 this morning so theres an hour before the bell so there could be some moves before the bell.  in that case, just switch up the strikes to fit accordingly.   You want the next stirke otm or a few out for calls or the next strike itm for puts.\n\nthanks and stay profitable\n","name":"t3_3igkad","subreddit":"StockMarket","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjuv","created_utc":"2015-08-26 14:35:27","week":35}

{"id":"3ihmvg","author":"jcadem","body":"Hey all,\n \nFirst off, this is a great subreddit and I've enjoyed perusing it lately.  I'll outline a little context and my question first, then get into some details.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Context**\n\nI've started my own furniture line called [Novello + Steele](http://www.novellosteele.com), it's flat-package furniture so it can be shipped and assembled easily but unlike IKEA it's all made of high quality, local, and sustainable materials, hand made and finished by me.  I'm confident in my cost analysis, profit margins, and competition research but am less sure of my marketing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**My Question**\n\nDo you fellow entrepreneurs have any tips or suggestions for online marketing, increasing visibility, and in general, generating interest?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**More details**\n\nI'll start by saying that my prospective customers are young professionals, out of college and looking to furnish a home with quality but affordable furniture.  The idea of furniture that can be disassembled and reassembled without falling apart appeals to them because we move more than ever before and nobody likes to pay high shipping costs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy marketing theory is to gain a little traction by word of mouth in Oklahoma City, selling pieces in boutique stores etc, as well as approaching architecture firms and realtors to see if they will use my pieces to stages houses (each piece can be disassembled and reassembled without breaking like particle board) while I grow the internet marketing with more and more photos of the pieces being used.  I also have friends and friends-of-friends who run boutiques and interior design studios in LA, Chicago, and NYC which will help out after I can afford to produce a large inventory.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI noted that I have an instagram account, I'm not the greatest at hashtags, [case and point.](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/pleasesomeonebuymepizza/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI followed [this tutorial](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205814568-Increasing-your-site-s-visibility-to-search-engines) for my website which is hosted by squarespace.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI have one fairly popular LA based online store (curates and sells textile goods from South America, we share a similar prospective customer base) that is going to blog about my stuff, probably even selling it on their site, and an OKC blog lined up to do a post / professional video on myself and Novello + Steele.  I suppose my plan after all this is to approach like minded blogs to gauge interest and try to get featured around the net.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nThe other thing I've started is, I applied and was accepted to sell on [Amazon Handmade](http://services.amazon.com/handmade/handmade.htm) and figured out at which point in sales it would be feasible / profitable to also take advantage of amazon fulfillment (pretty soon, actually.) This will open up a huge customer base, I think.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nAnyway, that's about it.  I'm starting production of the pieces this week / next week and should have the final packaging designs done and ordered.  In three weeks I should have a full inventory and gobs of photos of the furniture, boxed and unboxed.  I'd like to avoid a facebook page just because I don't want to get stretched too thin on the social media stuff, is there a way to mirror instagram posts automatically on facebook?  Unpaid intern?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHere's [just a couple screenshots of my backend spreadsheets,](http://imgur.com/a/7HKCz) by inputting my stock and number of orders per piece, it tells me exactly how much of each material i need to buy to fulfill all my orders and replenish ideal stock.  I also can track all my costs per piece and per order cycle.  Excel!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n \nUh, that's about it.  Thanks for reading and any input you might have and above all, thanks for being a group of innovators and thinkers.","name":"t3_3ihmvg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-26 19:21:49","week":35}

{"id":"3ihquq","author":"Alien20801","body":"So the little investing I've tried has had a decent result...last year I signed up with td ameritrade and put around 5k in about 7 different popular brand stocks...Now, a year later, I'm up around 800. And after watching them somewhat closely just to try and learn I've started wondering how you could really go wrong?\n\nIt's not like the stock market ever just ends so even if I bought high and my stock went down the next week, month, or year this is the excact opposite time to sell like the others? Maybe I'm missing something but say I bought stock in a major company that looks to be growing quickly like Amazon or even an older company like ford they could almost never end because they would get bailed out since they employee so many. Yes there stock may go down for a year or 2 or even 3 but it's got to go back up right? So me being young I could buy a few of these companies stocks and either sell whichever stock has grown when I need money if I'm buying something like a house/car and then keep another stock that may be having a bad year...\n\nThe only things I could think flawed  with this idea is just because the stock went up doesn't mean it was worth it with inflation? Or if you were older or in a situation you would need the money a certain time? Or obviously I could be way wrong and companies actually often end up never coming back from a stock falling?\n\nSo can someone could explain this..i looked it up a little but got mixed results...I've seen others ask similar things and people often just say this would never work and you there are experts for a reason which I understand an expert would be best to maximize your earnings but is there something major I'm missing or could I have success doing this?

You may be able to combine the credit with the promo code TENBUCKSNOW which takes $10 off your first order greater than $35.  I'm unable to verify this as I've already placed a few orders.**\n\nHey guys, you may have heard of Jet, a company started by a former Amazon employee that seeks to beat them and every other retailer on the prices of *everything* they sell.  They even provide a link to their competitors on each product page so that you can verify you're getting the best price.  Basically, it's as if Costco and Amazon Prime had a baby.  It's a membership only site, but they let everyone try it out for free for 3 months just for signing up.  They're also offering $15 off your first order of $50+ as long as you enter a referral code during checkout.\n\nI love absolutely love the site and have saved just under $50 already within my first 3 months of using it. They have a whole bunch of neat features designed to save you money like discounts for different payment methods (Visa/Matercard debit cards get 1.5% off each order, and credit cards get 0.5% off each order).  They also have what's called \"smart cart\" items that take a dollar amount off your total based on how efficient it is to ship that item to you.  There's even a shopping portal where you can get \"Jet Cash\" (store credit) for shopping at 600+ other online retailers.  Also, shipping is free on order over $35.\n\nAll in all, there are a lot of reasons to use Jet in my opinion, especially if you're cash conscious and trying to get the most with your money.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.  I'd love it if you sign up with my referral code since we'll both get $15 credit, but you can sign up without it as well if you'd like and not get the credit.  I don't work for Jet, I just figured some fellow Redditors might appreciate this offer.\n\nYou must place your first order by 11:59PM EST September 1, 2015 to qualify for the $15 credit.\n\n**Here's my referral code; just enter it during checkout on your first $50+ order: FC7D22B**\n\n**[Here's a non-ref link to the site.](https://jet.com/)**\n\nP.S. They even have a beer brewing kit for sale :D","name":"t3_3iim5b","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-08-26 23:21:48","week":35}

I was tired of hearing about stocks making big moves at the end of the day and felt this would help better discover new investment/trading opportunities sooner than later.   Nothing like this has been attempted on a mobile device and I wanted to be the first.\n\nI added a few complementary features to help me keep track of the stocks (push alerts using Amazon SNS - awesome btw) and integrated StockTwits so I could quickly see everyone's thoughts on the stock movement.\n\nGetting this out was a serious challenge.  We had many hurdles and on a monthly basis I considered shelving the project.  One of the hardest was getting Apple's App Store to play nicely with our app - it worked fine in the Sandbox, but once in production it was a different story.\n\nNow I'm happy to have crossed the finish line.  People are finding MOMO and I have even shared with Howard Lindzon, Founder of StockTwits and Robinhood and received favorable feedback.  That said, its a costly app to run (datafeed and 5 AWS instances) and could use some visibility and marketing ideas.\n\nI've done much of the basics - we were put on Betalist, sent a press release, etc.  I'd like to get on Product Hunt (anyone?), but other than that I could use some ideas.  As you can see MOMO is a niche product tailored to active investors and traders, but I think there is appeal for people struggling to find stocks outside of the popular names.

They are my bank.\n\nB.  [Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/blue-cash-everyday/25330?linknav=US:CCSG:BlueCashEveryday-LM)\n\n* 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) (includes Kroger and Publix, my go-to)\n* 2% cash back at U.S. gas stations (includes all US gas stations)\n* 2% Cash Back at select U.S. department stores (pretty much the big ones in the malls)\n* 1% CASH BACK on other purchases\n* Cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit.\n* No Annual Fee\n* 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months.

{"id":"3ioblw","author":"LoopholeTravel","body":"After the \"PLATINUM ORGY\" from yesterday's post, I imagine that a lot of you are eagerly awaiting your shiny new Platinum cards!  Some of the extra benefits (in addition to the 100k MR's) are pretty great, but can be tricky to fully utilize.  Two of my favorite are:\n\n* **$100 Global Entry Fee Credit** – Global Entry allows you to bypass the lengthy lines at customs upon reentry to the USA. You simply scan your passport and fingerprints, answer a couple questions, and you’re done! There is an application process, and a $100 non-refundable fee (regardless of approval). When you charge the fee to your Platinum card, you will receive a $100 statement credit. You can also use this to purchase global entry for someone other than yourself – perhaps a spouse, parent, or child. Global Entry also includes TSA Precheck, and both are valid for five years!\n\n* **$200 Airline Fee Credit Annually** – This benefit will allow you to get statement credits for airline fees (not direct ticket purchases) up to $200 per calendar year. This means that you can utilize this benefit **TWICE** (3x if you get the card in December) during your first full year of membership! You must designate one specific airline for these fee credits.\n\nThis benefit has an amazing loophole for those who shop on Amazon!  First, select United Airlines as your airline of choice for the credit.  Then, download the MileagePlusX app on your smartphone.  Use the app to purchase a $200 Amazon gift card with your Platinum Card.  The purchase will code as an airline purchase and trigger the statement credit!\n\nAnother way to use this perk is to buy airline gift cards I purchased $200 in Southwest gift cards to cover the security fees on the reward flights we take with our Companion Pass. \n\nI wrote a [guide](http://loopholetravel.com/2015/08/27/how-to-maximize-the-american-express-platinum-card-benefits/) explaining 7 more benefits of the Platinum card.

{"id":"3iovmu","author":"doctaO","body":"My birthday is in 40 minutes and I've been drinking and playing Halo all night. For some reason, this has given me some inspiration to make this post. Here's some bullet points of what I've learned over the past few years that isn't discussed too much here in /r/PF.\n\n1. When making a decision on whether or not to buy luxury items, convert it to an hourly wage. \"Hmmmmm, this video game costs $60. I make $20 an hour at work. Will I get more than 3 hours of enjoyment out of it?\" If yes, make the purchase.\n\n2. Similarly, assign an hourly wage to effort you put in to maintain frugality. If you make $20 an hour and spend 3 hours clipping coupons for the grocery store to save $15, it's probably not worth the effort. Your time can be spent elsewhere.\n\n3. Increasing your income is easier than you think. /r/PF typically focuses on expense reduction. This is great and a critical part of personal finance. But, increasing your income is not impossible! Think outside the box. I personally earn around $700 - $1000 a month passively through a combination of the below bullet points.\n\n* Credit card churning (/r/churning). I regularly make $100 - $500 in a month from doing this.\n* Credit card rewards. Separately from churning, it's possible to earn between 2% and 5% cash back on credit    cards using rewards intelligently. I earn $20 - $80 a month doing this.\n* buying websites (Flippa.com). I currently net $300 - $400 a month for a blog i bought for $2.85k.\n* drop-shipping items from Alibaba to Amazon\n* Lending on LendingClub. Even asking for a raise at work. I will teach you to be rich gives great advice on how to approach this.\n* Credit Unions. Some hard searching will often yield high interest rate savings or checking accounts. I earn about $25 a month from this.\n* Dividends. This is an obvious one. I earn $300 - $400 a month from these.\n* Participating in medial studies.\n* Online surveys. I actually think these are a waste of time, but they work for some people!\n* US Equities tender offers. Fairly often, companies will get acquired via a tender offer. \n\n&gt; In corporate finance, a tender offer is a type of public takeover bid. The tender offer is a public, open offer or invitation (usually announced in a newspaper advertisement) by a prospective acquirer to all stockholders of a publicly traded corporation (the target corporation) to tender their stock for sale at a specified price during a specified time, subject to the tendering of a minimum and maximum number of shares.\n\nMany of these tender offers have advantages for odd lot shares that you can take advantage of. I have made transactions that have netted over $1k literally risk free by participating in these.\n\n\n4\\. Passive income is king. When I see $1000 in my account, I don't think \"Great, I've got an extra $1k saved!\" I think \"Great, I've got some extra income of $2 - $8 a month.\" As I've mentioned above, there are many many ways to put your money to work.\n\n5\\. Frugality is about value, not saving money. I see a lot of posts here about people taking pride in going to such extremes as having 0 cars for the entire family. This is great for some people, but I don't think it's worth the sacrifice for most. For example, I bought a new Toyota Corolla in 2008 for $16000. Today, it's probably worth $8000. So, I've paid about $1200 a year (plus gas and insurance) for the privilege of owning a car. It saves me at least 30 minutes to drive to work vs. biking. And I earn approximately $100 an hour. And I work approximately 250 days a year. So I theoretically earn $12,500 per year in \"hourly wages\" by driving this car vs. biking. That's almost the entire cost of the car each year.\n\nThat's all I've got for now!","name":"t3_3iovmu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-28 06:59:35","week":35}

I cancel the card, am issued a new one, and I'm on my way. Since that incident, I planned to only use the card for emergencies, and therefore, I never activated the card once I received it. \nFast forward to today. As I am paying bills, I notice a balance of almost $8 on the account. Investigating, I see that it is for 2 purchases made from Amazon UK (I live in the USA).  I go to the bank, explain my situation, and they cancel the card and issue me a new one. What the bank was unable to answer and this is my main question, was how someone was able to make charges on a card that was never activated. The bank clerk told me that Amazon has all of the info on file. Once I get home, I look up my Amazon info. There is no history of the \"order\" from Amazon UK, and the credit card on file with Amazon is for a separate account. \nI still have to call Amazon, but now I am on my way to work. \nI'm sorry for the rant, I'm just confused and am losing faith in the banks. Thank you. ","name":"t3_3iroiy","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-28 22:20:29","week":35}

{"id":"3iuxag","author":"odwraca","body":"So about 3 weeks ago we came up with a larger niche idea, lots of competition and high dollar prices. We were actually reviewing small online ecommerce businesses for sale when we ran across the idea. All of our chosen manufacturers enforce a strict M.A.P policy to ensure our profits. As of this past Monday, we launched the site on Shopify and uploaded all of our inventory to Amazon. This is where it all went wrong... \n\nWe had set a budget that we did not want to pay for the pro account from Amazon, so I had to individually upload all the products by hand (about 300). It was tedious work, but did not take long. While doing this, I was probably slightly intoxicated (at least that is the excuse I am using) and set all the products to \"Match lowest price\". I mean, all the vendors that sell on Amazon adhere to M.A.P right? \n\n4 days after launch, partner texts me and tells me we got our first sale on Amazon!!! Yay! I quickly login and start to tally up the total to see how much profit we made. Low and behold, the product was not only under the M.A.P provided by the vendor, but so much so that it ended up costing us $90 to sell it. I told our partner I will pay it 100%, my bad. He laughed, I laughed and took a shot of whiskey. \n\nSo moral of the story...\n\nALWAYS double check your prices, especially on Amazon where fees are as high as 15%. After some quick research, if you are selling more than 40 items a month on Amazon, upgrade your damn account. It is basically free at that point.\n\nWe are however, THRILLED to see that we made our first sale! \n\nUpdate: After thinking about how to twist this into something positive, I am not only going to tell the customer what happened, and inform them that I will be fulfilling the order anyway. I will also be telling the Manufacturer of my mistake and why it happened, with the list of others that are selling above MAP.

I absolutely trashed my credit score when I was 18 and I'm looking to start fixing it. As soon as I get my credit report in the mail I'm planning on looking at managing my small debts that show up on the report, (just a few things like DWP, the library, a router never returned to ATT, an eviction, a lot of stuff like that I let build up to a big mess) but in the mean time, I've been told I need to start building good credit. I'm definitely responsible and financially stable enough at this point in my life (I'm 25) to start putting small things, like my cell phone bill, on a card and paying it off every month. But I have no idea what I should be looking for in a credit card (aside from low interest rates, but I don't plan on paying any interest, because I intend to pay the whole balance every month), where I should get a card, or if anyone will even give me one with my extremely bad credit. I wish I could tell you more about my credit score, but I haven't looked at it in 5 years, I can't remember the number, but I do remember being in the bottom 5th percentile of Americans. So that's not good. But that's another post for another day when I get mine in the mail.\n\nAnyway, I keep seeing advertisements for this Amazon visa card when I'm doing my internet shopping.

But is this even a good idea for me right now? I'm nervous for some reason.

{"id":"3iyq6a","author":"tinkersdamn","body":"I've been selling on AZ FBA for 4 years, but I buy books for my personal use as well. \n\nRecently I bought an American History textbook. It was listed in Acceptable (MF) condition, and since I was okay with that, I didn't read the listing too closely. \n\nIt came in the mail, and it turned out to be a private edition of the same textbook. Not the same ISBN. \n\nSo I don't know if this is usable. Is it the same book, or what? So I look up the ISBN, and I notice this book is worthless. Penny books for pages. So now I'm a little annoyed. This seller listed a book under a different ISBN hoping someone either wouldn't care or wouldn't make a fuss. Either way, definitely against the TOS. \n\nSo I politely ask for a refund. \"Sure, just send the book back.\" Ahem, will you be reimbursing me for the shipping? No direct answer to that, just a suggestion that I use the book anyway, since \"it has the same page numbers.\" \n\nAnyway, I pushed, and I got him/her to say they would refund the shipping money. But I'm positive that they will turn around and relist it exactly as before, and I'm feeling pissy about that. \n\nSellers like that make us all look bad, not to mention it's direct violation of the TOS. \n\nI want to file an A-Z claim to trigger Amazon to investigate this seller (looking through the reviews, it's definitely happened before.) My husband says that to do so would be bad karma. So maybe I'm still seeing red about having to send four emails to get a refund, but I figured I would see how the larger community views these practices. Maybe this is just standard operations for textbook sellers. \n\ntl;dr MF seller selling different editions of a book under the most profitable ISBN; am I justified in filing an A-Z claim on this even after being refunded?","name":"t3_3iyq6a","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-30 17:41:04","week":35}

{"id":"cudvfo6","author":"alvingjgarcia","body":"Hey MagneticSoup,\n\nI wanted to try and give you some advice and insight into the world of fulfillment since a lot of your questions are around that. Though I am not going to be able to help you out with all of your questions I'll try my best to answer those I do know about. First off, I am an entrepreneur with about 8 years owning and operating my own businesses and currently own about 4 different online businesses and work as number 2 on a software startup, Shipedge, which is actually a warehouse management/order management system that is targeted for Third Party Logistics(3PLs) and Fulfillment Companies (Companies that handle the type of work that you will probably be needing really soon). Basically a 3PL or Fulfillment Warehouse store inventory for online retailers (eCommerce) and track the inventory and ship out your orders for you as they come in. You pay them a fee for storage and then pay them back for shipping costs (either upfront or as you go). So I would begin looking into nearby fulfillment companies if you are expecting this trend to continue to last, since eventually you will be spending way to much time fulfilling orders and not enough time tending to your business and helping it continue to grow. Let someone  else manage the fulfillment and you manage your business.\n\n1. I would look into nearby fulfillment warehouses and see if their rates fit to what you are realistically doing right now. If not then yes in the meantime rent out a storage unit and try to fulfill as many as you can. Once you get to the point of it being overwhelming then look into fulfillment companies nearby to handle this for you.\n2. If you expect for this recent rise in momentum to die down soon then yes hire someone temporarily to help. If you are able to jump on the momentum and help it keep going and trending upwards then refer to step one and get a fulfillment warehouse. They will track your inventory and orders and allow you to keep track of everything yourself/order purchase orders(replenishments) to re-up your inventory and keep track of every single product and order/dollar.\n3. I would look to trying to get a line of credit or loan setup somehow. Once you start getting into territory where you have more orders than you can fulfill its like throwing money down the toilet. If you get a line of credit or loan and manage to keep up with sales you will be able to pay it back and make way more profit in the long run.\n4. I do not know much about Wholesale deals but usually they are offered a better price that is based on Minimum Order Quantity so it depends on how many you are selling. If you mean buying wholesale then I can't help you with that either. I would just make sure that you try to aim for 50% revenue on every product you sell. Obviously you will not be able to get this much for some things but that is the goal. You should be able to make 50% profit on every product so if you pay $10 for an item try to sell it for $23-25 (the extra $3-5 would be for other costs such as marketing, overhead, etc.). That is general advice so tailor it specifically for what you need done.\n5. I would look into software that is out there for this. There are stand alone order management systems out there that can help you though some are more outdated than others so do your research. I would look through some software options on www.softwareadvice.com or www.capterra.com since they are like a search engine for software options. If you go with a fulfillment company they will handle all of this for you.\n6. SKUs are used by warehouses to keep track of inventory and I would get into the habit of applying a SKU to each item. A SKU is applied to one style of item. So lets say you have 2 different types of t-shirts. They come in 3 different sizes each so you have to do 3(sizes)x2(types) = 6 SKUs. So you would have a SKU for the small shirt 1, medium shirt 1, large shirt 1, small shirt 2, medium shirt 2 and large shirt 2. No matter how many of each you have you only apply 1 SKU for that type of shirt. A product can also have a UPC number which is usually applied at the manufacturing level but warehouses usually add their own SKU number to keep track. You should too now so that once you hand it over to a fulfillment warehouse you can just give them a spreadsheet of what you have and the different SKUs so they know how many different types of products you have. You can also purchase UPC codes online which each product needs to have. This number stays the same throughout the entire fulfillment process (manufacture - sale) whereas the SKU may change from the supplier's warehouse to the fulfillment warehouse. PS: Amazon's (Fulfillment By Amazon) warehouse's use their custom SKU numbers called ASINs which is basically the same thing with a different name. Amazon offers fulfillment services to companies as well so you should look into them as well as any other local fulfillment warehouse. SKUs/Barcodes makes it easy for you to keep track of a larger scale operation since you can just scan the barcode of which item you're picking for an order and that lets the software system that manages the entire thing know that you have taken one of those for an order and to subtract it for the overall number of inventory. For smaller scale operations this isn't needed. I recommend that any company getting larger to start implementing SKUs at some point.\n7. I wouldn't worry about trademarking anything unless you have some sort of custom logos or designs on your products. If you have special designed products than maybe look into a patent and if you are using certain phrases or sayings that you don't want anyone else using then look into copyrighting (which usually happens once you create the work but thats another topic). \n\nIf you want to kind of go over this more in detail PM me. I wrote an eBook on this entire subject since I have been working in the fulfillment industry for the last year or so on our very own Software that manages warehouses and orders for companies just like you and warehouses that fulfill orders for companies like you. I can send you the book for free since its very detailed and will help you understand the entire process and industry inside out.","name":"t1_cudvfo6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-24 15:53:11","week":35}

My entertainment consists of netflix, books, and the internet which have already been factored in. My parents pay for my cell phone.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; I have basic furniture and other things that I bought/can take with me including bed, 2 dressers, desk, tv, nightstands, mini-fridge, window air conditioner, fan, and a space heater.

Apple has a forward P/E of around 11.5 while Amazon and Netflix have forward P/E ratios of around 355 and 400 respectively.  Also, most of these value large cap stocks at least offer a decent dividend.  I see something like Target or Wal-Mart as solid retailers that will withstand a bearish market better than an Amazon whose stock value is based a lot of bullish opinions of it that are bolstered by an overall bull market.  When the market it bullish, people will tend to take more risks on high growth stocks.

Do you have any recommendations for/experience using physical banks with strong online presence?\n\nUnfortunately nothing that will help unless you happen to live in western Massachusetts or northern Connecticut. :)\n\nThat said, *most* banks have good online offerings these days. It's just a matter of finding the one that has what you want. Both of my local banks (I have accounts with two) have less than dozen branches apiece.. very much \"small\" banks. But both have any online option I'd need. I very rarely visit branches, it's just nice when I do need to. (Like when I had to get a cashier's check to buy a car.)\n\nWith online account access, I can do direct deposit, view balances, transfer between my accounts at the same bank (ie, checking to savings), transfer between my accounts at different banks (ie, I send money from my checking account with Bank A to my checking account with Bank B), do online bill pay, transfer money to other people (family, whoever), link the accounts to Amazon or PayPal, etc. I can't think of anything my tiny banks can't do online that I need.\n\nI don't even know what debit network my banks are on, because both reimburse any ATM fees incurred. Way easier to just go to whatever ATM I feel like and not have to seek out one that's on my debit network. I mean, personally, I don't really go to the ATM very much anyway, I'll just swipe my debit card (and sometimes get cash back at a store if I think I'll need it) but when I do, it'll cost about $3, and the bank will refund it at the end of the month.

{"id":"cued2yr","author":"Econ_Stu","body":"I have experience running estores, and it takes a lot of planning. Personally, I would never try to break into the sex industry since its so saturated and cutthroat. But on the other hand, if you manage to succeed and carve out a slice of the pie for yourself this one website will provide you a massive income stream.\n\n**Marketing:** These are the questions you MUST be able to answer before launching if you want a chance at having a successful marketing campaign:  How do you plan on setting yourself apart from your competition? Why go to popgasmtoys.com instead of adamandeve.com? Whats your edge? \n*What your customers might think about while browsing your site:* make sure you have answers to these in your \"about\" section. Can I trust you to keep my identity hidden? What kind of bags do your products come in? How are they labeled; will my mailman know what he's delivering? Would you ever share my email with a third party? How do I know this isn't a scam website?\n\nMake sure you answer those, and any other common questions in a FAQ on your site that is easy to find. People who are buying adult toys for the first time are already probably nervous, don't risk them getting scared away. Make sure you provide reassurance and answers to all these questions in an easy to see part of your site. \n\nThe best way I can see yourself setting apart from the crowd would be to get endorsements by people in the sex industry or related fields. Cam girls, porn stars, sex health bloggers, etc. Having them tweet a link to your website endorsing a product would be really great publicity and the only way I can think of getting yourself on the radar. Contact them and offer them a partnership - every sale that comes through a certain link that you give them, they get a certain cut of the profit. I've never done something like this before, but I'd consider starting with offering them 60%-80% of the net profit just to get the ball rolling. Have that specific percentage only last for a certain amount of time, then the partnership expires and then renegotiate commission levels as a part of renewing the contract. As time goes on and your website gains more and more sales, you can begin offering lower, much more reasonable, commission rates. \n\nAlso, just by looking around your website lacks professionality. The items you have for sale look cheap, (I'm assuming you buy wholesale from China?) and don't have any brand names attached to them so the customer is unable to search for any reviews of a specific product. \n\n**Design** - It looks pretty. I like the color scheme, but just use less pink. The \"add to cart\" button on the sales pages hurts my eyes. It doesn't look like a website that only a creepy pervert would browse - which will make people much more comfortable. Although I do have a few suggestions.\n\nThe sales page needs to be more... professional looking? Look at A&amp;E or Amazon as examples. \n\nWhy don't I see available products straight from the beginning? Eliminating that \"welcome\" page will lower your bounce rate *by a lot.* \n\nAdvanced &amp; comprehensive search function: Put in as many search filter options as available. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I should probably tell you that you just had the luxury of being the very first sex toy website I have ever visited. Only reason I got on Adam and Eve was to compare it to yours lol. What I'm saying is that I really don't have much of an idea of what an actual sex toy connoisseur wants to see / read on a store, just what I would guess.\n\nThat's all I have to comment on for now, if I think of anything else I'll message you!

I buy a specific brand of Vitamin C from Amazon, but I recently lost access to the prime account I was using and had to find alternatives. I found that jet.com sold the same bottle of vitamin C (same brand, same amount) for $8 instead of $13 on Amazon. It came as a shock because I had expected Amazon to have the lowest price, give or take a dollar. \n\n\nA few months ago, I noticed that Amazon will no longer sell my household's preferred brand of paper towels as a prime item. It is now ONLY a prime pantry item, meaning I have to pay $5 for them to put it in a prime pantry box, and then ship it to me. This is on top of paying for a prime membership which should have covered shipping. It was pretty infuriating. I ended up buying paper towels from the local pharmacy instead, which of course means I am getting ripped off, but not as badly as $5 extra dollars.

The stock market can have a correction over three months but that won’t create a value for the implied volatility like we have seen today. Buy the right to sell it at $40 for $20.48 on February 17th and just sit on your hands if you’re feeling lucky ;) I don’t see implied volatility going much higher over 6 months.\n\nThis sounds very like a poor investment to me. The most you can gain at expiration is 19 if the vix goes to zero and you get the ask price. But the vix won't go to zero. During market calm the vix tends to trade at around 12. The 52 week low is 10.88. So assuming it goes back to its 52 week low and you get the ask price you would gain around 8. But if it hovered above 40 during expiration (which it could easily do) you would lose your entire investment of 21. You could of course try to day trade the options or flip them over a period of time but the volume aint that high, only 11 contracts Monday. \n\n\n&gt;As for Commodities I don’t understand the fuss Who cares oil is now $37.93? this is a great thing for Uber, a great thing for Amazon, for PepsiCo, and for my discretionary spending (I drive a jeep the gas mileage is quite horrid.)\n\nThe thing is that low oil can be a symptom of a much bigger problem. There is a lack of demand for oil. The oil price dropping by 65% hasn't increased the demand for oil. You would expect that if something is now at a 65% discount then you would tend to buy more of it but this hasn't happened for oil. This could be a signal of a weak economy.

And this makes Amazon very nervous, as it has been burned too many times by sellers that unload a lot of questionable inventory very quickly, get their money from Amazon, and flee before the onslaught of negative feedback from customers follows. I am certainly not suggesting you are doing anything like that, but Amazon treats all sellers with quick changes in sales revenue this way....if you were able to increase your feedback counts practically as quickly, you wouldn't have had this issue. In fact, if you anticipate a rapid sales revenue velocity, you should plan to have some sort of automated feedback solicitation tool in place so you can focus on growth without having to worry about the number of feedback as much.

{"id":"cuev3vf","author":"seoguy123","body":"I'm an internet marketing guy - so I'll give you advice based on that. A plan of attack for making more sale online:\n\nThis sounds like a VERY niche market. That sucks because it means there won't be much volume (hardly anyone wanting what you sell) but it's also great because I'm guessing there will be almost no competition (you can easily grab whatever traffic is available).\n\n1) Open an Amazon Handmade store (its a direct competitor for Etsy - possible a larger market place) in addition to Etsy. Don't bother with your own web-store just yet - leverage these two marketplaces first and then grow from there. \n2) Learn how to do keyword research for your business. Here is are some good starting points.\n** http://www.seonick.net/search-data-market-research/ for how to structure general keyword research\n** https://www.merchantwords.com/ for Amazon keyword research (shows search volumes for keywords inside of Amazon instead of general Google keywords).\n3) From step two determine what keywords you want to target based on volume and competition. Term Explorer is great for this: http://termexplorer.com/.\n4) Optimize your Etsy and Amazon listings based on this research. Include those keywords in the titles, Etsy tags, etc. Make sure your images are ON POINT (high quality, showing them in use, etc). Write fantastic sales copy. Offer a bonus (eBook etc). All of this will increase the conversion rates of your webstores on Amazon and Etsy - which means you will rank higher in their search algorithm and make more sales.\n5) Opening up a second marketplace and optimizing for the correct keywords on those marketplaces will give you a good boost. But you can also leverage it further by promoting your webstores through some basic SEO (link building). You should be able to rank very easily due to the low competition. Do not bother with your own site just yet. Amazon / Etsy will have higher conversion rates due to their trust in public eye and will be easier to rank due to leveraging their authority domains.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nP.S. I'm new here.

Instead, go get a second credit card (again, you've already got that hard pull, so you may as well take advantage). That will probably double your available revolving credit, which in turn would halve your average usage (because just because you have a second card doesn't mean you're going to increase your spending, right?).

Since usage is the easiest thing to change, it's where you'll be able to make the biggest change in score in the short term.  And in the long term, holding onto these cards for 15+ years also helps.  So get a second card (a Discover It card if you can or something like that where you get some benefit from using it), put your Netflix or Hulu or Amazon (if you pay monthly instead of yearly, though paying yearly for amazon is a better deal) or PSN subscription onto it, and auto pay it every month.\n\nRegardless, your usage will be different next month and you have that hard pull that will stay with you for a year.

They're mailing so many packages they're basically subsidizing square footage from USPS/UPS/FedEx/Lasership/etc. \n\nBulk shipping gets huge discounts because it's ONE pick up, which means they send tractor trailers for Amazon to load and then take to their according sort centers so that cuts a lot of work out for the delivery drivers considering that's half of their job on their routes. Amazon Prime shipping is basically like USPS flat rate where you pay for the size of the box. \n\nA business of any size that's mailing packages can meet with someone from the shipping companies and negotiate a shipping contract for lower prices. I used to do some work for a 3D printer company and they were meeting with people when I left trying to set up a shipping contract since they were selling enough of their big ass printers to make a dent in the shipping costs.

The only benefit I see to it is the free 2-day shipping and convenience of online shopping. The actual merchandise is mediocre, and only seems higher value due to the thousands of customer reviews per item. Pricing is certainly more expensive at Amazon for similar merchandise than at Walmart, and you can actually find better deals for certain items at Walmart than Amazon. For example, I found a dash cam at Walmart for $40 that shoots 1080p, nightvision IR light, has a crash sensor, bike mount, car mount, and charger. On Amazon I was only able to find ones that shoot 1080p (with no mention of a mount or anything) for $50-60.\n\n\n\nI'm not a fan of Walmart in particular, but I definitely won't be going to Amazon first when I need to buy stuff.","name":"t1_cuf0tly","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-25 15:24:21","week":35}

{"id":"cuf0wyi","author":"ibn4n","body":"I'd like to expand on why this is a good choice for frequent travel despite having a $95 annual fee.\n\n1) The Chase Sapphire Preferred allows you to transfer points directly to an airline.  \n2) The Chase Freedom lets you transfer points to your Chase Sapphire Preferred and has 5 points per dollar on a revolving basis (this year it's Amazon around Christmas... that's a lot of points).  \n3) The Chase Sapphire Preferred has no foreign transaction fees.  \n\n\nThere are a lot of other reasons, but these are the biggest ones in my opinion. Between the Sapphire and the Freedom, you can rack up a good amount of points per year. The Sapphire then basically charges you $95/yr for the ability to transfer those points directly to partner airlines.\n\nExample:\n\nMy wife and I fly to Phoenix each year to visit her family.\n\nDollar cost of tickets this year (Southwest): $1,236 (or 123,600 points on most credit cards.)\n\nPoint cost of tickets using Southwest points: 70,446 points + $22.40 in taxes\n\nThat $95 gets you an amazing conversion rate by transferring point to point into the airline's rewards program (You can transfer to United, Southwest, British Airways, Virgin, Korean Airlines, and Singapore Airlines.) My example, it is saving 53,154 points or roughly $500.\n\nWhether that $95 per year is worth it will depend on your plans, of course, but for some folks it's a tremendous deal.","name":"t1_cuf0wyi","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-25 15:27:28","week":35}

{"id":"cuf41sn","author":"miketaber","body":"Nobody wants to waste time doing something that might not work. But the fact is that anything you do \"might not work\". When you've never really done the whole entrepreneurship thing before, you need to try out a bunch of different things and most of them aren't going to work. Over time, you get better. The key to success isn't doing the right thing, it's learning what works and doesn't work for you. Sometimes, things you try will work for one business but not another. Other times, a technique is generally applicable, but won't work for you in a very specific case because of X, Y and Z. The problem is that you won't know until you try it.\n\nEntrepreneurship is about learning the process, not being successful the first time out of the gate. Even seasoned entrepreneurs make a LOT of mistakes. It's not the mistakes that make you successful, it's the process of iterating through different approaches.\n\nIt sounds to me like you're afraid of failing and I think that's an extremely common sentiment. Nobody wants to fail and nobody wants to waste their time. Try a different approach. When you're looking at becoming an Amazon Affiliate, think about this.\n\n\"What am I going to learn and will it be applicable to me down the road?\"\n\nIf you're not going to learn much, then don't do it. If you are, then do it. It sounds to me like this is a viable avenue for multiple reasons. If it's adjacent to where you plan to be then you can establish a track record here. You'll also get the experience associated with marketing a product, without the hassle of having to develop a product. If someone else has created the product, then hopefully they did some sort of validation to make sure there's demand for it. Keep in mind that's an assumption which may or may not be correct. Don't keep it front and center, but don't forget about it either.\n\nYou'll also learn how to make money, learn about margins, accounting, time commitment and various other marketing techniques. To me, it sounds like a good place to start. Too many people dive headfirst into building a product, fail to find a market and give up because they were demoralized by failure. This will get you some experience and build up your toolbelt of techniques as an entrepreneur. And at the end of the day, it's about the learning, not the dollars you're making.

Youre understanding is incorrect, but again, contact seller support.\n\nAsk them, if I order a bundle of 10x items from Prime and use 7 of them personally.  May I sell the other 3 items.\n\n2.  If I buy an item that is for sale on Amazon using Prime and receive it.  After I have received it am I allowed to resell it on Amazon for a higher price if I can?\n\nThe answer will be yes you can.  \n\nYou can figure this out logically by looking at how you are trying to interpret it.  If you interpret that that would be using Prime benefits in reselling, then you would also have to agree that a business could not buy anything using their prime account if they were restocking their business for their customers and that is simply absurd.  Of course there are companies who restock inventory using Prime and the same interpretation that says you can't resell via FBA would then have to imply the same for reselling via their brick and mortar stores. I am constantly restocking my business using my prime account.  I constantly buy out competition whether its prime or not and I absolutely send it back in once I receive it.  \n\nWhat they are referring to is you cannot use PRIME BENEFITS in fulfilling transactions like that.  Meaning, my customer cannot buy from my store and I go to amazon and use my prime account to 2 day ship it to them.  I can't sell an item on Ebay and then dropship it using my prime account on Amazon.  That's what using a prime benefit for the resell~ etc line is about.  FUrther, ALL prime benefits END the second you've received your item.  There are no more benefits that you are using.  \n","name":"t1_cuf6urg","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-25 18:14:56","week":35}

Unbeknownst to me, they shipped another treadmill in the process... And they both arrived the same day. So I ended up with two treadmills out in my front yard. Good times.\n\nI've tried ordering things that I'd normally get from the store just because it's cheaper on Amazon. Cat litter for instance. But, when Amazon shipped the bag of cat litter, all they did was slap a label on the bag and send it on its merry way. Our ups driver was none too pleased with a half full bag of cat litter contained in a garbage bag because Amazon decided to forgo packing. I contacted them about that one and they told me to RETURN IT.\nno ifs, ands or buts.\n\nI've also bought shoes and sandals from Amazon for my fiancé that after a couple wears over the course of a day or two started cracking at the toes/ball of the shoe.\n\nThen there's nothing more infuriating than paying for prime, having their site say \"hells yeah we'll get this to you in two days!\" And then wait a few days before they even ship the damned thing. It's especially disconcerting when I need stuff shipped so it's in time for an art show or something I've paid to be in. Table cloths, displays, whatever. What am I paying into this for if I don't even get the service they're providing?\n\nSo yeah, cool story that you don't contact Amazon ever and  appreciate the downvote for no reason (maybe that's not you).

{"id":"cuf8n2x","author":"felixfff","body":"*bracing for potential hate*\n\namazon (and its 3rd party sellers) can definitely be more expensive for a lot of items. Some people solely make a living off of buying items at target, walmart, etc. and reselling for higher prices on amazon.\n\nin the past, i did this on an (unnamed) item. The price for it at a local grocery store or walmart in the middle of nowhere was probably $8-10. At a drugstore in NYC, it was like $13. But the product had also become harder to find at a lot of stores, so many people couldn't get it where they used to.\n\nFor a while, Amazon didn't sell it itself at all. Now one of its affiliates (Soap.com or Quidsi or whatever) sells it for like $10 + $3 shipping. So I was still getting plenty of sales at $15-20 (depending on other sellers, etc.) and making $2-7 per bottle (after amazon fees).\n\nSo that is one reason why prices aren't that cheap. Sellers are providing an item that would may be otherwise unavailable (or not worth someone's time to go run out and buy a $10 item), at $5-10 / 50-100% more expensive than what it \"should\" cost - so to some buyers, its worth it - to others, they should shop elsewhere.\n\nMind if i ask what items were so expensive? :)","name":"t1_cuf8n2x","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-25 18:58:32","week":35}

So I go on their website to check it out beforehand, see if I could have it shipped to a store near me, blah blah blah. And the interface of their website was so clunky and cluttered with crap that Wal-Mart doesn't even sell that I didn't even bother beyond the initial search. \n\nAt least with Amazon, I feel like I'm shopping in one marketplace despite products coming from tons of sellers. Their site is intuitive and easy to use, and I never have to wonder if I'm still looking at Amazon or have been redirected to some other storefront. \n\nThat said, I agree that they are raising prices on most things, just like any big box store is wont to do. It's frustrating, and beyond digital content, we haven't ordered anything using prime since at least June, which is somewhat rare for us as long-time prime members...

{"id":"cugdg9x","author":"JordanMalik-com","body":"I'm not sure Amazon is universally focused on having the lowest prices all the time. 4 important things: 1.) Remember ~40% of Amazon's sales are items provided by 3rd party merchants (who set their own prices). Amazon sometimes encourages 3rd party merchants to lower their prices, but doesn't force them nor provide any monetary incentive; 2.) Consumers vote with their wallets. If Amazon anticipates any (highly unlikely) significant sea change in the sales that is tied to not being the absolute lowest price, they'll adjust their strategies/pricing/programs accordingly; 3.) Amazon's income today is diverse enough (e.g. their multi-billion dollar web services) it can remain extremely healthy even if is faced (again, unlikely) with an exodus of customer; 4.) \"Lowest\" prices alone does not make a retailer a long-term winner. Sure it can be a short-term fix but doing so usually undermines other critical parts of the operation (customer service, quality, delivery, etc.), that can further damage the retailer's reputation.","name":"t1_cugdg9x","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-26 18:01:28","week":35}

{"id":"cugqzen","author":"ozbucs18","body":"For personal Amex cards you are only allowed to sign up and receive the bonus once. Well you can churn it for a second bonus but you'd only get the difference of the two offers. So if you got it first at 40k and then applied for the 100k you'd actually get 60k on the 2nd time around. So right off the bat the 100k is great because this is the highest you can get the bonus and you wouldn't have to worry about missing a better offer. \n\nAs far as airline fees offsetting the cost, the card comes with a $200 annual reimbursement for airline incidentals. BUT, if you download the United MileagePlusX app on your phone you can use your new 100k Plat card to buy a $200 gift card for anywhere on the app. Most would buy the Amazon GC because it is as close to cash as you can get in an online GC. Also this is calendar year perk so you can get it now before 2015 is up and again in 2016. OR, if this offer lasts until December you can apply in December, get credits for Dec 15, Dec 16, Jan 17 and cancel before your 2nd AF hits.\n\nSo for math: $1000(100k MR points minimum value)+$200+$200-$450 Annual Fee=At least $950 if you're ok with Amazon GCs. Most people value MR as more than one point as well so this is an even better offer. If you are bold enough to do the December route to try and squeeze an extra $200 then add that on too, but this may not be there by then. I'm actually only 3-4 months into this, just keep reading the daily threads. Also have learned that learning how to redeem points for something worthwhile is harder than earning them IMO.","name":"t1_cugqzen","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-26 23:34:27","week":35}

{"id":"cugv28o","author":"Serejai","body":"Final Fantasy doesn't necessarily mean it's sought after. That being said, it's ridiculously overpriced on Amazon; $40 used vs $15 used on eBay. Even a new copy on eBay is cheaper than a used copy on Amazon. List it for $20 used and it would sell quickly. Also worth noting is that a game like that appeals for a very niche audience. Collectors want the original version, and since it's a remake it's mostly going to appeal to nostalgia buyers and they will likely want the original, too.  \n\nAssassin's Creed, GTA, and Star Wars are all big franchises and - in theory - should sell quickly on FBA, but they are also overproduced so the value probably isn't there. I consider games like that to be neutral in value. Games like Spelling Challenges and sports games are negative value (ie pretty worthless). In my example earlier, for a ten-game bundle I would do 5 \"negative\" games, four \"neutral\" games, and one \"positive\" game. Unfortunately your bundle should also contain games from a single system, as your goal is to sell the bundle to a parent that just bought a system for their kid and needs and instant game library. Since you have a mix of systems there, I wouldn't bundle those games together.  \n\nYou can also make themed bundles, like a bundle for younger kids or a bundle for nerd raging teenagers full of Call of Duty and Halo games. Keeping them all one system is important, though, because mixed lots only appeal to resellers and they aren't going to pay your asking prices.  \n\nGamestop is a complete scam 99% of the time, but it doesn't hurt to check their trade values.

{"id":"cugvsf9","author":"jm1982","body":"I've started selling on Amazon more recently, some on FBA and some MF (merchant fulfilled). \nThey are both quite different platforms. \nPros of Amazon: It's super easy to put up a listing and takes a small fraction of the time it takes to list something on eBAY. If you are doing FBA , Amazon handles all the stuff that is annoying and time consuming, Prices especially for FBA products seem to be higher oftentimes than what people are paying on eBAY. \n\nPros of eBAY: You can pretty much sell anything..as long as it's not illegal. Amazon is pretty restrictive and doesn't allow everyone to sell all types of products like eBAY. Even things you would think would be restricted to sell on Amazon are restricted. Like DVDs (issues with copyright infringement) or even bath/beauty type products. All these can be sold on eBAY with no issues. eBAY fees can be much lower than Amazon fees. eBAY has pretty good data on sales prices and what people have actually paid for an item. \nAmazon doesn't have this , there is camelcamelcamel.com that people use to get an idea of how often something sells and the amazon sales rank but I don't feel it's a 'real'/accurate as eBAY recent solds. \n\nHope that helps. For now I'm going to continue both of them...but I have to say that the benefits of FBA are something I want to explore more.

{"id":"cuh5f6m","author":"GameWeiver","body":"I sell video games on Amazon full time, it has been my niche for many years now and I do fairly well with it. I'll answer all of you questions and add any resources I feel are notable.\n\n1) These games would be acceptable condition, mainly because you do not want to create high expectations for someone and them be disappointed. I would make sure to describe in detail how the condition is for each component if you are sending them to fba.\n\n\nYou will get much much more for games via FBA. I consistently get about 50% or more for games through FBA than merchant fulfilled. That is because many people check the prime only box and don't look for the cheapest offer.\n\n\nRank in video games is not super important. I believe video games have around 125k ranks, typically if you are in the top 50% the item will sell reasonably quick. I sold a video game that was rank 80k in just 1 week before.\n\n\n2) I've sold atleast 2,000 units of video games this year and I have had 4 returns. Seriously that is it.\n\n\n3) I actually just did a full video breakdown of how I package video games yesterday. Weird timing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjxicWSvlY\n\n\n4) I would not ship a PS2 in that condition to FBA. However it is the silver model which is much more desirable. I sold one today with 1 controller and the cables for $99\n\n\n5) That is a bit picky. Check the case and see if it seems like it will fall open. If not, don't worry about it. If it does I tend to poly bag games over sticking anything sticky on the cases (see the video for examples).\n\n\n6) I always buy large lots, cherry pick the worth while games, auction of the others in lots on eBay. Rinse repeat. It has done very well for me so far and I have gotten about 5x my invest back this year on FBA alone.\n\n\nI am pretty knowledgeable in the video game field so if you need any help just shoot me a message.

{"id":"cuh5fpw","author":"TACrockett","body":"A couple things here. And please let me apologize in advance for this:\n \n- Subscription services work if you have an established brand and repeat customers. You don't have that.\n\n- Is this a straight to consumer business model, or do you have stocklists? \n\n- Subscription boxes won't give you regular income if they're paying a flat fee up front rather than billed monthly. Or is the 6 month subscription $240/month? That may need to be clearer, but if it's the former, how are you going to make sure you have enough cash to fulfill all of the orders over six months if you're doing this because you're hard-up for cash in the first place?\n\n- For being a charitable company, your price point is quite low. At $30/watch, either you don't have high enough margins to consider wholesale or these watches are manufactured very, very cheap, especially if 25% goes to charity.\n\n- Speaking of which, who manufactures these? Do you give to international charities but have the watches manufactured in large factories that work in human rights gray areas? Your intended audience, at some point, will ask. It happened -- and is still happening -- to TOMS.\n\n- Please fix your photos. They're pixelated. \n\n- Your Amazon book list makes the site looks cluttered. Why is it on every page? Why do I care what books you read? \n\n- Instead of \"Collaborate with us,\"  just do a plain ol' contact page and give the writer a drop down menu.\n\nOkay, that's all.

{"id":"cuhaje5","author":"fracturedworlds","body":"&gt;Wouldn't this apply to any online store? Are you suggesting that allowing social sharing is a poor idea?\n\nIn essence yes. Social sharing boxes generally get very little use. All the research says if people want to share something they are educated enough to just copy the URL. \n\n&gt;There are hundreds of categories, we don't do any product or category assignments by hand, they are all populated at the discretion of the drop-shipper, I consume their data. Anything else would be an administrative nightmare.\n\nThat is your problem in a nutshell. You are looking at volume rather than quality. \n\nFor the products, and this is my personal approach to anything sales related, you need custom descriptions. Doesn't have to be long but does have to be sales/benefit related. 2-3 paragraphs re-written by a decent copywriter per article will make a huge difference. \n\nFirst of all it will increase your google/search engine rankings. If you think about it, chances are everyone else who uses those items from the dropshipper uses the same descriptions. All Google sees is lots of duplicate content which is doesn't want to show people. As far as it is concerned the first person online to use that description has unique content, the rest of you are just copying them. As a result you are fighting an uphill battle to get in front of users.\n\nSecondly, benefit-orientated content rather than feature-orientated content will increase sales when people actually hit the page. People don't buy because of features, they buy because of what it will do for them.\n\nMy approach would be to pick 100 or so products in a single area which sell well and get them re-written properly (I recently did 200 re-writes for a local holiday company. Took about 60 hours but made a huge difference to their search results and the amount their site was making within a couple of weeks). It will be worth it. Then do another 50, releasing them a few products per day. And so on. Then target local companies. Put your face to the product range and offer them that human touch to the faceless website.\n\nI would also start off by targeting a specific niche on the website. Get higher on search results for that using custom sales descriptions and ideally some of your own photos. Find some way of getting product reviews from the demographic you are targeting on there. \n\nOnce that is doing well look at another related niche and do the same. \n\nThe temptation (and I see this a lot as a web dev &amp; copywriter) is for new companies to target and try to catch everyone. They see the larger companies selling a huge range of products and try to copy it. But they forget that those companies started in a niche as well. Amazon started as an online book store, play.com started selling region 1&amp;2 dvds.  \n\nThe problem is that diversifying too soon dilutes both the message and the quality so that no-one sees or cares about the products. \n\nGenerally they work a lot better when they specialise initially, focus on a small (and often local) demographic, and invest time into the quality not the volume. Once that is sorted then they can start to slowly branch out.","name":"t1_cuhaje5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-27 11:51:41","week":35}

Seems like as long as I'm careful with trade marks I should be fine.\n\n&gt; As to your long-term business plan you don't really say what it is but your short term business plan kind of sucks.\n\nI think you're miss understanding though. I'm not trying to drive hundreds of sales and make a huge profit at this point. In fact, I'm not optimizing for profit right now at all, so not making money isn't something that bothers me.\n\nI don't know if you've ever worked on ecommerce sites, but when you're setting up a site for a niche product you rely heavily on ranking well in search for whatever product niche you're selling. I don't mind if 80% of my visitors leave because they can get the products for £10 cheaper on Amazon at the moment. I'm just trying to get first page of Google and get a sustainable amount of traffic at this point.\n\nThen, when I have potential customers coming onto my site, a £2000 investment of my own cash isn't a risky move and I can then work on funneling those visitors into sales (perhaps, but not necessarily, by competing with Amazon's prices). At that point with stock investment I will be working with a 50-60% markup on my products. It's just right now there is still a very high chance I will never reach the top page of Google and I will need to bounce to another niche where hopefully I'll have more success.\n\nAlso, I've built ecommerce sites for years and I can tell you this, if you have good customer support, you look reliable, you have good pictures, videos, and info about each product on your site, people will want to pay extra because they know you're not some anonymous seller on eBay/Amazon. Plus, competing with your competitors by price alone is a stupid move. You could have the best prices in the world but if you have no visitors, people don't trust you, and people can't see what your selling, then no one will buy your products anyway.","name":"t1_cuhkamv","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-27 17:56:49","week":35}

I pay $1415/month for a 51 year old 750 sqft apartment with coin-op laundry, small parking, and no other amenities.  I make $66k a year here, which puts me somewhere in between the lower part of the middle class and \"middle\" class.  Seattle's fun, but I wish I could move out of this neighborhood because I don't ever really take advantage of what this neighborhood is known for (bars and clubs on Pike and Pine).  I go to a small pub two blocks away from me as opposed to the nightlife hotspots on the Pike/Pine corridor, and I can do that in any neighborhood in the city.\n\nOP, I used to live in Atlanta, which is the cheapest major city in the country if you adjust for cost of living.  I had a $45k/year salary and lived in a brand new luxury apartment (1024 square feet, new hardwood floors, in-unit laundry, private parking, 20 foot balcony with a view of all three skylines) in the hippest neighborhood in the city.  I looked at the equivalent of what I could get in Manhattan and it was astounding.  I would need 2.5x the money to have a much lower standard of living ($45,000 vs $96,000) and I'd be living in a literal shitbox somewhere not even in Manhattan.\n\nBefore you take this job, I'd recommend looking elsewhere first, somewhere where your money would take you further.  Why not Seattle?  It's much cheaper here, there's a much more relaxed culture, and the weather is pretty amazing most of the year (no, it doesn't rain nonstop..in fact it's been in the 80s and sunny for most of the past 6 months).

This cards technically earns UR points, which can be redeemed at 1 point = 1 cent, but if you end up getting the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Ink+ you can transfers those points to airline/hotel reward programs for excellent value\n* Discover It: 5% rotating categories and 1% everything else\n* Capital One Quicksilver: 1.5% on everything, 20% uber discount until April 2016, and no foreign transaction fees\n* Citi Double Cash: 1% on purchase and 1% on payment for effective 2% on everything\n* Fidelity Amex: 2% on everything (requires Fidelity Cash Management or Brokerage account)\n* BoA Cash Rewards: 3% on gas, 2% on groceries, and 1% on everything else with additional bonus if you have a BoA checking, savings, or brokerage account\n* Amex Blue Cash Everyday: 3% on groceries, 2% on gas, and 1% on everything else\n* Sallie Mae Mastercard: 5% on gas, groceries, and bookstores (includes Amazon)\n\nIt is almost always easier to get an entry level card if you have an existing relationship with that bank. Also the Double Cash and Amex might be more difficult for you to get, since it doesn't seem like you have an established credit history.\n\n**Edit**: Some people are more willing to have multiple cards for bonus categories and others prefer having just 1 card to put all their spend on, so it is up to you what kind of spender you are. I, for one, have no problem having multiple cards (I have 11 CC, but only use 3-4 on a regular basis), but my parents prefer using just 1.","name":"t1_cuhwlw0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-27 22:57:31","week":35}

You can buy UPC's and create your own bundle listings. But then your rank is low in search until you sell a couple of them/ get reviews/ ect. This is a great method if you can create alot of bundles and maintain them. If you cannot then you will just end up with a bunch of competing sellers anyways. The other option is search Amazon for successful bundles and work on stocking those items to create bundles.\n\n\nEbay is where I tend to sell bundles during the Q4 season. Mainly because I can just create nice tailored bundles with any extra games/consoles/accessories I get in.\n\n\nBundles with an NES/2 Controllers/ Zappers/ Duck Hunt/ Mario 1,2,3 will sell upwards of $200-250 near Christmas time on eBay.\n\n\nMy general business plan is something alot these lines. Buy large lots on a consistent basis from eBay/Connections/Viewers/ect. I break these down into games and consoles that can go to FBA and everything else. After this I auction off the extra games/consoles/ and controllers in bundles or in lots for parts or repair. \n\nOver time I get a large stock pile of cords and manuals and I have a few resources to sell these aswell.\n\nI am super picky about the lots I buy and only bid or buy items I am 100% certain I can turn a profit on. On a overall level I get 3-5x my initial investment after everything. But it has taken me 6 years on eBay and nearly 1 full year on FBA now to get to this point. Over that time I have built alot of connections and people to help me keep sourcing consistently at a good price.\n\n\n\nIf you have more specific questions about bundles and what exactly you are looking to get into let me know.

{"id":"cuime1b","author":"sords","body":"So I have been accumulating Amazon type inventory all year but I have never sent in a large FBA order yet.  I know I need to send it in before 4th quarter as I am not approved for Holiday toys plus whatever other limitations I may face, but is this a bad strategy?  Rather than paying $40 per month for the amazon pro account I just skip the first 8 months or so of the year and send everything in as few shipments as possible around this time of year.  If I can afford to do this and am not depending on amazon sales to put food on the table, but I'd like most of my sales to come in 2015 rather than 2016.  The Pro account makes sense if you sell over 40 items a month.  I think I have about 200 items to send in and maybe $5K+ worth of stuff. I didn't want to pay the $40 per month if I send in 200 items and 100 sell the first month and then sales trickle for the next 6 slow months of the year(Mar-Aug) and I only have 15-20 sales per month.  If my inventory dwindles and I'm down to say 50 items in February, can I switch back to a  non-pro account at that point?

{"id":"cuj2uv8","author":"Phanes7","body":"The idea of a product review blog is golden, right now is a sweet time for getting products free/cheap to review. Follow the steps /u/TACrockett outlined to get started but skip the banner ads for now (at best she is going to get $4 per 1000 visitors to start and she will look much better without them). Once up and running here is some things she can do: \n\n1. Review anything she owns and likes on her own Amazon account (spot her $99 to make it a Prime account). Make sure they are really good reviews, with pictures and/or videos.\n2. Get hooked into some good product review lists: uberzonclub.com, tomoson.com, and there are lots more especially on Facebook.\n3. Make sure she is building out her Instagram account but also a facebook page, twitter account, pinterest, and whatever else is popular these days. She needs followers. \n\nOK, at this point she should be able to get TONS of free stuff, if thats all she wants then have her go broad on the stuff she gets and throw some banner ads up for a little extra cash (don't forget the Amazon affiliate links to the products). If she wants more then make sure she is staying niche focused, 'beauty products for girls 13 - 16' or whatever it ends up being. Then do this: \n\n1. Start reinvesting any money made back into the site via ads to drive more traffic and members. \n2. Create an email list of people who are interested in learning more about cool new products. \n3. Start a Youtube page with interesting short videos\n4. Once her email list is 500 - 1000 people big have her approach a business about doing a private product promotion through her. She charges $250 - $500 and gets the person at least 100 niche targeted purchases (her list) and she does serious publicity work on the product via her owned media channels. Follow up with the buyers (who get the product for free or at a massive, 90%+, discount) to try and get a good number of reviews for the product on amazon. \n5. Keep growing her email list and social media channels and expanding the number of product promotions she takes on each month. 10 promotions is reasonable and could mean $5000 or more in income and thats on top of any other money made via affiliate links or youtube profit share or anything else.\n\nLots of ways to expand this as well (other product niche review sites, launch her own product line, etc.) but I think the plan laid out above is something with a realistic chance of making her real money by Christmas of 2016. Will just take a lot of work.\n\nWhen her blog launches let me know and I'll see about getting one of the products from my beauty line to her to review.","name":"t1_cuj2uv8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-28 23:10:09","week":35}

I've just grasped the concept of Flipping, but the circumstances that I am in prevent me from achieving my greatest. Where should I start? I found some games and DVDs for $0.25 cents each at my local Swap Meet here in Hawaii. I found a pawn shop near my house, so I go and check it out, and it turns out you need to be 18+ to pawn items off. (I then learned that the day after in my World History class, Hammurabi's Code, great timing lol.) I then went to my parents to borrow their credit card for selling on eBay, Amazon and the such, but they are paranoid to use their credit cards online due to falling for a scam a while back. I want to pay for DJ gear and newer music to practice DJing, but as a freshman in High School (13), I feel limited to my options for earning money to pay for it all.

{"id":"cujvy83","author":"jl2121","body":"No referral fees are actually 30-40%. The total in fees can often be that much or higher, especially on cheaper items (a $6 item might have $3.50 in fees, but an $80 item will have $18 in fees), but never JUST the referral fee.\n\nThe fees through FBA are much higher overall than most other selling sites, but if you're out looking for items specifically *for* FBA, you factor those costs in when you're buying the item. Sure, I might pay 60% in fees on this $6 box of colored pencils. But if I'm only paying $0.50 for it, it's a massive return on investment (about 5x). Spend $50 on colored pencils, get $250 out of FBA, even though Amazon probably collected $350 for you to make that $250.\n\nEdit: Keep in mind, *none* of these fees are collected until after your item sells. No sale, no fees. The only exception is storage fees, but don't worry about them too much.

I'm in Australia and I'm quite sure ebay sniping won't be as fruitful as it would be in the US, and of course I don't have the option to buy from ebay and sell on Amazon - but if I can get something out of it that will be good. \n\nI'll have a look at gixen. I've tried Autobidder which is a Chrome extension just the once but it didn't work. I think sniping software will be worth it's wait in gold (do bytes weigh anything?) but in the meantime doing it manually is fine - it perhaps adds to the excitement :)\n\nYep I'm going to play around with multiple searches. I've been looking at vintage toys but that seems like a bad genre - same listings keep re-appearing and everyones a reseller - and no one sells anything, by the few extremely quick looks i've had. So I'll try out new product ranges and things and like you say perhaps give Buy It Now a go too - although with Buy It Now you normally get resellers which means there's no room for margin. \n\nI barely go into thrift stores now. I still wander in every now and then but the excitement is gone. I know it's extremely unlikely I'll walk out with anything. I think the only source to buy at good prices is Garage Sales, but even then about 50% will be no good, either because they're trying to get near ebay prices, trying to make a profit, or because they have junk. And of the 50% where things are reasonable at half i'll only find a few items. It's the 1 in 10 where things work out, but it takes a big effort for me to go to 10 garage sales. So it's very hit and miss. \n\nI'm thinking that ebay will be here every hour of every day, as will Amazon. And if we can figure out how to make money from tapping into that then it can be a side income for the rest of my life, or until the side income is no longer required. \n\nAt this stage I've made a few Electronics purchases, and some Toner cartridges, and a camera. I'm finding games too be a little more work than it's worth. \n\nI'm thinking that to get a lot items I might need to get into clothes, or shoes - which is something I'd rather avoid, but I can see that I might go down that route if the electronic side isn't quite fruitful enough. \n\nI'm looking at jewelry but I don't know what i'm looking at, and I'm not sure I ever will - still it might sink in eventually.

According to Interac, this [fee](https://www.interac.ca/en/interac-about/interac-fees) is currently $0.006012. As a result, debit is more widely accepted, but since vendors aren't paying as much to the banks, the banks have decided to take their cut directly from customers, by limiting free debit transactions or making you put a lot more money in your account to maintain unlimited transactions. \n\nFor example, up north TD requires a $2500 minimum for 25 free transactions (whether they be debit, ATM withdrawal, teller withdrawal, preauthorized payment/ACH, or bill pay), then every one past that is $1 a pop. If you only maintain $1500 you only get 10 free self-service transactions and 2 teller-assisted transactions a month.\n\nOn the other hand, ICBK, a Chinese bank with a few Canadian branches scattered here and there, only requires $1000 minimum for unlimited transactions, but the \"international\" network on their debit card is UnionPay. Acceptance is limited to Discover merchants that take PIN debit in the US, what few UnionPay merchants there alre elsewhere in the world (less of a problem in Asia than Europe), and online you're mostly limited to Amazon and a bunch of Chinese websites.\n\nCredit cards don't have transaction limits because they work the same as everywhere else, so there's that.

{"id":"cuktlrg","author":"GeeJo","body":"It's a combination of small factors, rather than one clean explanation.\n\nFirst of all, data protection laws are complex in Europe compared to the U.S., and not unified across the continent. Second, there are considerable localisation costs - most Amazon services and support are only available in English. \n\nThirdly, a significant contributor towards Amazon's boom in the U.S. was its avoidance of the issue of sales tax (it left it in the hands of its customers to be honest on their returns, stating that it would be too difficult to unify prices across state lines). This gave it a competitive edge over brick and mortar stores. It's more difficult to pull that off with VAT. \n\nFourth, Amazon had a big first-mover advantage in the U.S.. By the time it began looking across the Pond, though, other retailers had jumped on the e-bandwagon.\n\nFifth, labour laws and workplace regulation in much of Western Europe would make U.S.-style Amazon picker centres impossible, or at least much more expensive to run, and the economy of scale that those facilities provide is what makes the long-tail retail strategy workable.\n\nSixth, you can't discount nationalism as a factor. Sure, it seems silly, but there's a definite resistance to American companies muscling in on European markets by the existing powers, and those companies are more than willing to lobby the local politicians for protectionist policies. And, again, don't underestimate the effect that the NSA/Snowden releases have had upon the population when it comes to deciding whether to switch to Amazon's cloud-computing section.\n\n____________\n\nNone of these are things that *prevent* Amazon from moving in, but the combination of minor annoyances has meant that there's just a lack of will to capture the market. Maybe that'll change some day - they could certainly do it if they wanted to - but for now Amazon are leaving European money on the table in order to concentrate on easier gains elsewhere.","name":"t1_cuktlrg","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-08-30 17:44:50","week":35}

{"id":"cukxqfh","author":"throwaway83015","body":"This post piqued my interest as it's something I've been thinking about searching out for a while. Tell me if you could significantly simplify the following situation:\n\nI sell a lot of stuff online, ranging from my website to eBay and to Amazon. Every day I start off by importing a ton of data to check out the previous day(s) sales, inventory, etc. It's a fair amount of manual data entry that could probably be automated but is beyond my expertise. Here's what I would love:\n\n1) Something that automatically pulls sales/expense data from Amazon's seller central with a one-button type click. Currently I have to run a report on seller central, download it as .txt, open in excel, run a macro to format it, do a quick check for odd entries (I really should just refine my macro), and then run a third-party extension on the data to convert it to .iif format for input into quickbooks. It's a lot of steps for something that seems like it should be so ready-to-import.\n\n2) I sell a lot of stuff via FBA and I keep an eye on inventory levels at Amazon's warehouses every day so I can make future sales forecasts. Currently I open a list of 17 bookmarks that show me day-to-day sales for a single item over the past 30 days. For each item I manually count the number of entries from the previous day and enter it in a spreadsheet. That spreadsheet then looks at the past and spits out a forecast for future use.  I take that future use number and put it in another spreadsheet.  In that second spreadsheet, I then open my inventory status page on Amazon and enter in the day's current inventory. The second spreadsheet then gives me calculations on when we might run out, how much inventory I should send in and when, etc. Again, it's a lot of steps and I gotta figure there are better ways to automate it.\n\nThoughts?\n\n","name":"t1_cukxqfh","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-08-30 19:48:50","week":35}

{"id":"cul1keb","author":"AugustaG","body":"Hey, former Scottish student here. \n\n\nCheap supermarkets, etc are good and plentiful in Dundee. \nThe problem with St Andrews is that it is super expensive and that you will meet very rich people with very deep pockets. Long story short, I popped into their Tesco Metro ( urban supermarket) once to buy some noodles and found no instant noodles but did note THREE entire fridges dedicated to expensive champagne. \n\n\nA job will help immensely. Have you had a look at the restaurants and cafes in St Andrews for vacancies yet? I got a job at my old Uni in the library so don't forget to look around for campus work.\n\n\nStaying in Dundee is an excellent idea but halls of residence are great for a foreign student in their first year. It gives you a settled base to work from and helps you meet people n the same boat who you can flat share with from Dundee the next year. \n\n\nAsk for reading lists now ( you can get an idea from the course leaders and from past course material posted online) so you can get on Amazon, email second year students or leavers on the same course to buy their's and contact the library to reserve them for you.\n\n\nChat up the staff in the finance office ( take brownies) and ask them if they can recommend any sources of funding you can apply for at the beginning of term. They'll be busy but might give you ideas. \n\nThe good thing about settling your accommodation later than the standard September move is that students are unreliable. There is bound to be one 'ideal' living situation with flatmates that falls apart spectacularly in October and you can step in to take over the room immediately, so keep an eye out for rooms coming up on the Uni Facebook pages/intranet. \n\nIn Edinburgh you would expect to pay £400 a room including utilities and wifi. In St Andrews £500 sounds reasonable tbh. £250 for Dundee is also about right. \n\n\nTrain and bus travel is expensive. Booking as far in advance as possible is the only way to go. \n\nI used to work for a bus tour company. If you're looking to explore the Highlands, I recommend doing a two day tour to Loch Ness and a three day tour to Skye. They're one of the most economical ways to get round the area ( if you go for hostel accommodation and take food with you). They look expensive from the outside, but when you factor in travel and car hire, etc, it actually makes for a good deal. \n\nSky scanner is great for comparing flights. \n\n\nWorking a job for a venue during the Edinburgh festival ( August), means that you get free entry into shows at that venue. It's a handy way to experience the city and have a ball. \n\nAlways ask about student discount, everywhere. Many places give it. \n\nAnd enjoy yourself! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cul1keb","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-30 21:43:59","week":35}

{"id":"cul2vu6","author":"smuckola","body":"Aside from these twilight zone answers who are simply repeating what you asked or who are answering an obviously unasked question......not that I know of. I'm wondering if the Flow app was an early proof of concept, whose technology got later integrated into the main Amazon app.\n\nI have noticed that I often get different search results from different UIs: searching on Amazon.com versus Amazon seller app versus Amazon app. I have no idea why, but sometimes the results are vitally different.\n\nI think that's usually for older and more obscure items that have redundant ASIN listings. So if I have a product that's somewhat obscure, like a collectible old book, I will definitely use those three different methods. One of them might give me a ridiculously high price so I get overly optimistic, and the other will show me that the first result ACTUALLY has a sales rank of 13 million but with 2 pricey offers. And it shows me that the real listing has hey somewhat better sales rank but 10 offers at low prices. So I end up seeing that my first result was grossly misleading.\n\nBut Flow seems to be redundant. The only reason I have used Flow is when my Amazon app would crash during the optical function. Then I deleted and reinstalled it and it was fine, and I quit using Flow again.","name":"t1_cul2vu6","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-30 22:24:02","week":35}

{"id":"cul3rm7","author":"FlippingCraze","body":"Congrats on the 50th star!  I asked your question to an ebay rep about 6 months ago because I too was curious. They said 10-13% was the norm (I do not sell electronics). I don't know how this was quantified but thought I'd share. I echo the posts that refer to sales as a volume issue. The more I list, the more I sell. I also noticed an increase in sales when I have diverse merchandise.  Consider expanding your sale market to increase conversion. I opened my sales to GPS (very little action) and Canada (direct through USPS).  Sales to Canada have averaged 3% of sales during the past three months. I double list some items on ebay and Amazon. You just need to stay on top of pulling the item from one platform when it sells. Good luck reaching your next 50!

{"id":"cul401m","author":"legotri","body":"I'm the same way, with a slightly different start, I had a friend selling random things on eBay and eventually some buyers of ours started asking for a certain product so we started selling it. The problem, our buyer couldn't get our product, now we sell the product and accessories globally, started 2 yrs ago and have had month over month growth of over 8% every month.\n\nIt's all about finding a problem and building a scalable solution, currently on track to do over 10M in rev this yr, just because the solution solved a problem and we built a solution that scaled beautifully.\n\nIt's one thing to just solve a problem it's another to build the solution so it scales.\n\nMy advice is to start selling something through existing channels, Amazon, eBay, etsy, etc. and basically copy what others are selling like I see a lot of people selling xbox's I'll sell those too. Then figure out how to sell a lot, and eventually learn how to source a lot once demand continues to rise.\n\nThere are tons of great ideas of how to sell products online in new ways and enough money to go around, but most people don't understand that it will be extremely hard for the first few years and you have to stay agile in your business methods and practices.","name":"t1_cul401m","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-30 22:57:19","week":35}
