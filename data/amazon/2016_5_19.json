{"id":"4insnv","author":"LumpyLump76","body":"**How To Maximize the value of the AmEx Platinum Card**\nMay 10, 2016\n\nWith AmEx opening up their purse strings, many people are jumping in and applying for the AmEx Platinum Card, trying to earn 100,000 MR points with a $3,000 minimum spend, and a $450 annual fee.  Along with the app frenzy, a lot of questions gets asked over and over again.  Here is my attempt to put the answers in one place.\n\n## The Basics\n\nLet’s get some basics questions out of the way:\n\n- $450 AF is charged on your first statement.  It is not waived for the first year.\n- If you are Active Military, AmEx can waive the AF.  \n- The AF does not count towards your minimum spend.\n- If you ever had an AmEx Personal Platinum card before, you do not qualify for the bonus again.\n- If you are an AU on someone else's AmEx Personal Platinum, you would still qualify to get your own card and sign-on bonus.\n- However, if you only had a Benz, Ameriprise, business, or any other AmEx Platinum card other than the personal Platinum, you do qualify for this bonus.\n- AmEx expedite Platinum cards automatically.  For example, I applied for the Benz Platinum last Friday, and FedEx dropped off the card this Monday.\n- You do need good credit to apply.  However, the reports seems to indicate AmEx is not very strict about number of recent AmEx cards.  Folks who has recently had 2-3 AmEx cards are still being approved.\n- This is a Charge Card!  This means by default, you MUST pay off the full amount each month.  AmEx is beginning to offer payment plans for Charge Cards, but you should expect to pay off the statement amount each month.\n- Since this is a Charge Card, there is no Credit Limit.  This does NOT mean you can spend as much as you want on the card.  This means AmEx may raise or lower your spending limit based on your previous activity.\n- This is really a Travel Rewards Card.  If you are looking for Cash Back, this is NOT the card to get.  Most of the benefits of the card are for people who do travel each year.  The more you travel, the more valuable the benefits.\n- Yes, you can apply for another AmEx Charge Card or a Credit Card the same day to try to combine pulls.  I’m not convinced that combining pulls does anything useful, but if you believe in it, go for it.\n- You can cancel anytime in the first year, and get a prorated refund of the Annual Fee.  Note, I recommend against doing this.  You can earn enough back from the card to offset the AF.  I rather always maintain a good relationship with the bank, use the card regularly.  If the benefits of the card does not work for you, cancel it at the 11 month mark to at least show you tried to like it.\n\n## The Benefits\n\nOK, so exactly what Benefits do you get with the card that make it worth the $450 AF?  There are a couple benefits that basically offsets the AF in the first year:\n\n- $200 annual airline fees refunded as statement credit.  This is every calendar year.\n- $100 Global Entry/TSA Pre-check fee refunded as statement credit.\n\nHmm, that looks like $300 only?  Well, since the airline fees refund is available every calendar year, you can get that once this year, and again next January.  This means $400 back.  Note that this credit does not apply to airfare directly, but if you buy food or upgraded seats on your ticket, this credit would apply.  There are also some ways to get this credit turned into GCs.  Do a Google search for \"AmEx Platinum MPX Amazon\".\n\n\nWhat if you already have Global Entry or Pre-check?  Well, you can pay for GE or Pre-check for anyone else in your family using the Platinum card, and they will give you the $100 credit.\n\n\nSo combined, in the first year, this card is effective AF free, or even make $50.  Note you do have to spend the $450, but you get enough value back that it should not be a factor for the first year.  On an on-going basis, the $200 credit is available each year, which makes the card really a $250 AF card.\n\n\nWhat other benefits are on the card that makes it valuable?\n\n- Access to AmEx Centurion lounges for free for you and family, or up to 2 guests.\n- Priority pass membership, providing access for you at any Priority pass lounge.  Guests would have to pay.\n- Delta lounge access if you are flying Delta.\n- Hilton HHonors Gold Status\n- SPG Gold Status\n- Free Boingo Wi-Fi.\n- AmEx Offers\n- Roadside Assistance\n- Purchase/Return Protection\n- Extended Warranty\n- No Foreign Transaction Fee\n- AmEx Fine Hotel Resorts benefits\n- AmEx Concierge Service\n- Shoprunner\n- and a few more…\n\nSo as you can see, if you do a bit of travel, this is a great card to have in your pocket.\n\n## But what about that 100K MR Points?\n\nNow we get to the good stuff.  First off, there is a [detailed FAQ on how to use MR points.](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3dwl1z/faq_different_ways_to_use_american_express_mr/).  As you can see, you can get 1 cent per point by using this with Uber, or pay for travel through the AmEx portal.  So getting $1000 of value back from the card is relatively straightforward.\n\n\nBut, the real value is in airline transfer partners.  Off the top of my head, here are some redemption options.  Note, all award redemptions are subject to award seat availability.\n\n- Transfer 25k to Delta and book a RT ticket to anywhere Delta flies in the lower 48 states.\n- Transfer 30k to Flying Blue, and then book a RT flight to Hawaii.\n- Transfer 40k to ANA, and get a RT Economy ticket on ANA to Japan.  Most of Asia is available for a bit more points.\n- Transfer 75k to ANA, and get a RT Business class ticket on ANA to Japan\n- Transfer 15k/25k to Aeroplan, and book a United flight in the lower 48.\n- Transfer 60k to Aeroplan, and book a Star Alliance flight to Europe 1.\n- Transfer 58k to Singapore, and fly from JFK-FRA owe way in one of the top First class product in the world, Singapore Suites.\n\nI’m not going to try to argue whether the 100k points is worth one, two, or five thousand dollars.  The points are worth exactly what you feel any particular flight is worth.\n\n## Should you get this card?\n\nIf you get approved for this card, and spend $3000 on the minimum spend and $450 on the AF, you would end up, on the low end, maybe $1000 of Amazon or other retailer gift cards, or a thousand dollars worth of Uber rides and $400 of Amazon gift cards.  On the high end, you can get $400 in Amazon gift cards, free Global Entry for 5 years, and a Trip to most of Asia in Business class on ANA.  The ANA ticket alone retails for $4-5000 dollars.  And if you fly a few times a year, then the airport lounge and the hotel benefits can further add value to the card.\n\n\nYou really don’t get this kind of deals very often.  So if you have the credit score, and that you can meet the $3,000 minimum spend, AND that you can use the travel benefits, you really should consider getting this card.  If you really just want Cash Back in your pocket, you need to decide whether getting Gift Cards or credits like Uber is good enough for your purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_4insnv","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-05-10 07:33:31","week":19}
{"id":"4iob51","author":"AGameofTrolls","body":"Hi, guys. I live in NJ and last week I got a call from my brother asking me if I ever applied for an Amazon \\ Visa credit card. I said no, and he replied: \"Well you got one now\". \n\n It turns out someone applied online for a card and had it delivered to my brother's house where I used to live years ago. Since it was processed by Chase Bank I stop by to talk to someone there and they made a call to the place where they handle their cc and told me that someone did apply on April 29, but didn't request any secondary cards nor was the card activated any point. So my big question is why would anyone apply for a card and have said cc delivered at an old address? Where they trying to go through my brother's mail before he had a chance to get it? It turns out my brother got a letter today saying his application for the same credit card was denied and he's also scratching his head about this too. \n  Has anything like this ever happened to anyone here,?","name":"t3_4iob51","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-10 10:41:28","week":19}

{"id":"4iq87g","author":"rogueavacado","body":"So here's the dealio. I am 33 years old and making enough to not be able to live on my own by any means, but I'm not going to starve and can afford minor luxuries such as 7$ shampoo. \n\nMy total debt right now is (rounding this all off for personal reasons, but fairly accurate) about 4200$\n\n2000 is on a personal loan from the bank with a 3k limit. It has a fairly low interest and is flexible. If my car breaks down, I can contact the bank and put the repairs on it as an emergency charge. I used it to purchase my 2000$ car. (then a 700$ repair a few months ago so catching up)\n\nAmazon has about 1700 of my debt. Really wanna get away from the 35$ interest a month but the best I can through at them is 150$ a month to chip it all back down. \n\nTwo chase cards have me around 20% intrest. These are the oldest so I don't think I should cancel them, but I'd love to get them down to zero to be able to make minor purchases with to pay off monthly. Together, I owe about 1000$. They're also moving away from a point reward and onto a small cash back I believe. \n\nSo there's all that. I think if I have less interest, I'd be able to pay down things faster and what I really want is less things to pay on. I want to keep my credit lines for emergencies and larger expenses, but the way things are, I'll never really manage a savings. \n\nThe point of this is that my banks credit card offer looks fairly good to me. PNC has been pretty good to me over the last few years and always helped me when I needed it. Here's their offer:\n\n-4 pts per 1$ spent, no cap\n-50k bonus pts if I make 750$ in qualifying purchases in the first 3 billing cycles\n-Can get cash back, gift cards, plane tix, and stuff with pt redemption\n\n-0% APR on purchases and balance transfers through June next year. Then 14.24% after. It'll be 7.99 until transfers are paid off. \nNo anual fee. \n\nSo I\"m thinking that I can just charge the 650$ root canal that's happening first week of June and pretty much pay it off (Already have most of the $ saved up for it specifically on my debit) Toss on my phone bill and pay it off and hey, there's the 50k bonus pts! \nThen I'd move my chase balance over for the lower interest and pay it off asap.\n\nBut I've have had to learn to adult on my own. Is this a good plan? do you have any suggestions for making it better?\n\nOh, and my credit score is good, but not great. It tanked when I dropped everything about 10 years ago to help a friend. The last few defaults are preparing to drop off in the next 2 yearsish. \n\nThank you guys!","name":"t3_4iq87g","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-10 19:06:12","week":19}

People talk about everything, so find a way to get people talking about your product.\n* **When there is a low barrier to entry for your competition, employ every strategy you can to beat them out.** Bezos recognized this about Amazon early on and knew the only way to succeed was to become a market leader before anyone else did.\n* **Long term strategic thinking is necessary for true innovation.** Bezos’ famously claims that many people don’t have the capacity and aren’t willing to think 7 years ahead. Don’t be afraid of thinking extremely far in advance and attempting to build truly revolutionary products.\n\nIf you enjoy this type of content or want to read the full story of Amazon's rise to success, check out my newsletter [Founder's List](https://www.founderslist.co/post/2016/05/11/amazon.html?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=amazon)","name":"t3_4ivgde","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-11 17:30:05","week":19}

But aside from that it got me thinking \"if some random redditor can start his own GPT app, it can't be that logistically difficult to pull off no?\"\n\n**Mission Statement**\n\n- Withdraw when you want (but we pass on the transaction fees to you. No $10 minimum, $20 minimum bullshit when offers are like $0.08 a pop. lol)\n\n- No currency exchange screwjobs\n\n- Large variety of gift cards (just ask)\n\n- Offers that credit. No bullshit\n\n- You get rewarded just as much for being invited as you are for \ninviting people. No MLM scam B&amp;S BS!\n\n- Multiple settings for video (some people are bandwidth capped or have shitty devices).\n\n**Core Business Model**\n\n- $1 USD = 1000 coins\n\n- Pays out in PayPal, Gift cards (including Amazon.com), International Gift Cards at proper currency conversion (\nie. Amazon.ca @ $0.7784USD/CAD) and Bitcoin at proper currency conversion ($452.15USD/BTC) @ ~95% conversion rate to cover bitcoin dealer profit and costs/fees to procure bitcoin from dealers\n\n- 10% Referral bonus for life to inviter and invitee\n\n- PayPal fee passed onto the user ($0.30USD/CAD + 2.9%). Due to the PayPal fee structure, it's actually cheaper for me to pay people in CAD than in USD. lol.\n\n- Bitcoin miner fee passed onto the user (5,180 satoshi for 1 input 1 output, which is like ~$0.024USD)\n\n- Why Bitcoin? Small transaction fees compared to PayPal makes it more ideal for small withdrawals than PayPal. For larger withdrawals like $15+USD, the 95% conversion rate is going to hurt you though. Dogecoin has even smaller fees but it's not as reliable as Bitcoin at the moment.\n\n**Proposed Funding Model #1 (skimming percentages)**\n\n- GPT site/app administration skims ~20% off advertising revenue and gives ~80% to the users\n\n- Super Low Minimum Withdrawal: 1000 coins ($1USD card) Amazon.com, 779 coins ($1CAD card) Amazon.ca, 320 coins for USD PayPal, 250 coins for CAD PayPal, 25 coins Bitcoin\n\n- Fees are not docked for gift cards, only PayPal and Bitcoin\n\n**Proposed Funding Model #2 (skim flat administration fee)**\n\n- Individual Credits 25% higher\n\n- Still competitively low minimum withdrawal: 1300 coins Amazon.com, 1079 coins Amazon.ca, 620 coins PayPal USD, 550 coins PayPal CAD, 325 coins Bitcoin\n\n- A 300 coin flat administration fee will be applied to the PayPal and Bitcoin redemptions at checkout.\n\n- A 300 coin flat administration fee will be built into the gift card redemption pricing","name":"t3_4ixghq","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-12 00:11:37","week":19}

{"id":"4j0rhg","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"Trying to get some detailed discussions going. Would like to hear some ideas from people, but better yet, why: I love to read people's reasoning/thesis behind choices on investments.\n\nNo particular order and may not buy, but five on my list:\n\n1. Equity Lifestyle (ELS). Well-run REIT with a great deal of waterfront/near water property (The REIT has 80 properties with lake, river or ocean frontage and more than 100 properties within 10 miles of the coastal United States.)  In a way, it is also a play on the retired population: \"This is a huge opportunity and fits right into Equity Lifestyle's sweet spot. That's because its RV resorts have an average resident age of 55 and its manufactured home communities' average resident age is 62. With about 180 RV resorts and 200 manufactured home communities, Equity Lifestyle should be an early beneficiary as the baby boomers crest into retirement.\" (http://seekingalpha.com/article/2777665-equity-lifestyle-properties-inc-a-giant-mobile-home-reit-for-the-growing-age-wave) However, would rather see it in the upper $50's/lower $60's.\n\n2. Prologis (PLD) Large, global industrial REIT, seeing tremendous benefit from online sales. While Prologis has a very diversified set of customers, Amazon is at the top of the list. Their exposure to e-commerce continues to grow.\n\n 3. Stag Industrial (STAG) is another industrial REIT possibility.\n\n4. CF Industries (CF). While not as diversified as Agrium (AGU), CF has been the strongest fertilizer player over the long-haul. With the rumor of Bayer or BASF buying Monsanto this morning, there is the feeling that we are at least somewhat near a bottom in agriculture.  Nice dividend. \n\n5. Roper Technologies (ROP). Exceptionally run platform company and, like Danaher (DHR) gets little attention while continually providing terrific returns over the years. May eventually spin off or sell its legacy industrial businesses and while that in and of itself is not a reason to own it, it is a potential plus. Danaher is splitting into two companies in July (record date of June 15th, I believe; 1 shares of newco Fortive for each 2 owned of DHR).\n\nEdited to add: the move in Gilead (GILD) is getting ridiculous.

She is doing pretty good, but so far her business is only via word of mouth and may be through google search. I want to get her more business. It's free shipping of all items and delivers only to India (but to other countries too via Amazon, I believe). I want to get her followers, but the right kind of followers; millennial mothers with little kids. Is it worth paying to post ads Does it really get any customers? Or do I follow random strangers from India who look like recent mothers with kids? Also what kind of posts should I make and what kind of hashtags do I use?

{"id":"4j2ge0","author":"Pianofeathre","body":"Long story short when I started my sophomore year of college (I'm going into my 4th year this fall) I got a card and I only really use it for textbooks during august and january and also eating out/groceries/etc. \n\nMy limit is $500 so I guess 30% of that is $150. I don't always go over that limit except when I buy like $400 worth of textbooks from Amazon or have months where I spend quite a bit of money on like fast food (chipotle, mcdonalds, etc etc) and groceries and parking. Even then the total on those months is $120-150. \n\nMy credit score is like 708 right now so I guess that's ok, but is it possible that those few textbook heavy months lowered the score? I always have the money in my account and several times I've gone very close to the limit but have paid it off halfway through the month so I can actually use my card for things I need for the remainder of the month. I always pay on time so that's not the problem, but would increasing the score to like $700-1000 be a good idea?  I know I never deliberately spend absurd amounts of money so I would never spend anywhere near $700-1000 in a month even with textbooks, and I control my spending pretty well. I think my dad said he had it at $500 in case someone steals it to protect my account.  \n\nThoughts?","name":"t3_4j2ge0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-12 21:40:53","week":19}

{"id":"4jeejk","author":"DirtyBombEngineer","body":"So, I recently sold a Jumbo size Unicorn Glow Pet on the Amazon Marketplace... \nShortly after confirmed delivery, the buyer submitted a Return Request with \"No longer needed\" as the reason selected from the drop-down menu, and in her comments stated she actually just wanted to exchange it. My initial thoughts were: What could possibly be wrong with it—was the magical unicorn plush too fluffy? Was there too much color in its ultra-soft rainbow fur? Was the adorable creature simply too incredibly cute to handle?? ...Nevertheless, she lacked sufficient reasoning for me to allow a return/exchange at my expense (how many times will she want to exchange it before she is satisfied with the unique colorful markings that vary for each one?), so of course I denied it, with a brief apologetic message politely explaining why her Return Request was denied (basically, all sales are final) and thought that was the end of it. \nThen, a day or two later, I get notification that she's opened an A-to-z Guarantee claim under the false pretense of the item being \"not as described\", but now she suddenly wants a refund instead of an exchange, and is disappointed in that I (rightfully) closed her request. At this point, the buyer has become a bit of a nuisance, because she's wasted a significant amount of MY valuable time that I've now had to spend agonizing over her absurdity and trying to get the point across to the Amazon staff overseeing this travesty of a claim, by sending in my re-presentation message explaining the situation, in detail, in hopes that they will understand her claim is nothing more than a farcical way to get what she wants. \nSo, how does the Amazon A-to-z Guarantee Program Account Specialist handle it? He decides that the buyer is eligible to return the item and has determined that I must provide the buyer with a RMA# and prepaid shipping label—as if the claim itself weren't ridiculous enough already, now it's been erroneously decided in the buyer's favor?!? You've GOT to be kidding me... I then attempted to send in additional comments to the Amazon team through the claim (ultimately proving that, according to Amazon policy outlined in the A-Z Guarantee guidelines, I am NOT obligated to accept a return or issue a refund due to the fact(s) that the item was indeed as described and this was all merely a case of buyer remorse rather than an actual issue with the item itself); however, after submitting my final message, the claim history shows that it had been CUTOFF after the first line, thus Amazon probably won't have seen any of the important data contained in this message, hence there is no useful information beyond my first re-presentation message (which was apparently overlooked anyway). \nUtterly frustrated by the situation, I found a way to contact Amazon seller support about the A-to-z claim, basically sent in the contents of my last message with an extra bit of helpful background information and provided the Claim ID as well as the Order #, so hopefully whoever receives the aforementioned email will be able to resolve the issue accordingly (particularly, without having any sort of negative impact on my account)... It's been 2 days now, and still no response to my seller support case (the case has not even been viewed by a representative yet). \nI was given 3 days, at the start of the weekend, to comply or else the full amount will be debited from my account; Saturday is when I got to re-present my side, but there are no seller support specialists available over the weekends; basically, by the end of the day, they will have taken the money from my account and I will now have to appeal the claim to (possibly) get it back, as well as waste more of my time reporting this fraudulent buyer. \nWhy do they even have A-to-z Guarantee guidelines with reasons listed for denying a claim if they always side with the buyer regardless?? \nThis ordeal is wildly infuriating!","name":"t3_4jeejk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-15 05:06:20","week":19}

Aapl is more risky as it has been on a downtrend, but I still think it will be up tomorrow, based on oil and futures being up at the moment.

{"id":"d2yifxl","author":"XVOS","body":"As someone who has actually worked in the street on a large bank's trading desks I'm going to disagree with many people here. For your purposes markets might as well be perfectly efficient in terms of public knowledge, at least in the short term. Obvious pricing ineficencies more than a couple of cents are ruthlessly corrected for on a second to second basis. Additionally, institution scale investors have so many more resources than you (things such as private detectives following important players at companies, large scale proprietary market datasets and analytics, hundreds of years of experience etc.), that you simply cannot compete. On the other hand these people usually have very different objectives than you due to their priorities. Personally I never day trade, why? Because I have no rational reason to believe I bring more alpha to the table in that field than a large hedge fund and many reasons to believe I bring less. That would be gambling. Additionally, if you read economics papers and other science about the markets the vast majority agree that day to day market movements are essentially random minus a slight bias towards markets going up rather than down. That slight upward bias is the real secret behind investing in index funds, that the market generally goes up .x% more often than it goes down and indexing offers a scattershot approach unlikely to miss these slight wide scale gains (but also conversely unlikely to achieve the enormous gains investing in one company can). \n\nAs for investing in individual shares. If you have a capacity for ruthless self evaluation (can figure out what alpha you bring to the table), a significant amount of time for research and modeling, and then you follow those models religiously rather than falling prey to biases very common amongst almost all investors (including funds and institutions) then it really isn't gambling. If you are like most of this subreddit and short AMZN and GOOGL because \"P/E ratios and my research\" (two articles on the motley fool) says they are so overpriced lawlz, then yeah, you are gambling, the markets are just slightly kinder to gamblers than Vegas because the house takes less of a cut. If you are like me (I hope) or some of the smarter individual investors here than you are gambling, but you are playing blackjack and counting cards so you are at least gambling smart.

The book also shares \"behind the scenes\" backstories on how those promotions were conceived and created.\n\nI'd also brainstorm possible info products. Look at Amazon.com and see what nonfiction, how-to books are selling well.  Buy the top 3-5 books in a topic that's also interesting to you.  Use and combine their table of contents as an outline for a book or course you could create. \n\nIf you're not an expert, you could interview someone who is. Take that outline and turn it into interview questions. Experts are everywhere. Google \"expert sources\" and you'll find directories of experts who want to be interviewed (these services cater to journalists). \n\nYou could use one of the free conference call programs or something like UberConference to record the interview. You could just sell the audio file or get it transcribed into text too. Sell as separate products or as a bundle. Hot tip: you can use \"decoy pricing\" to get people to spend more.\n\nExample pricing options:\n\n* Text: $29.00.\n\n* Audio: $49.00.\n\n* Text and Audio: $49.00\n\nMost famously used by *The Economist* magazine, in their case it's a combo of a print + digital subscription. The middle offer is the worst offer, so people go for the third offer.\n\nCreate the product, and throw it up on a shopping cart like Gumroad or SendOwl. Write some sexy sales copy with the new copywriting skills you've acquired. Drive free and paid traffic and see if you can get any sales.\n\nHot tip: collect e-mail addresses. Send surveys asking customers what other things they'd like to learn. Create more info products and put them online. E-mail them to say, \"Hey, I've just created a new course on that topic you were excited about.\" Rinse and repeat.\n\nWhoops, got carried away there.

{"id":"d2z0kul","author":"gotthelowdown","body":"Honestly, I failed a lot at first. Mostly because I made the rookie mistake of creating content only I was interested in, not what customers were interested in. It's so obvious in hindsight: where does money come from? Other people. So sell them what they want, not what I want. \n\nIdeally, there should be some overlap. If you don't have at least a passing interest in the topic, it's hard to stay motivated and keep going. Try to find a happy medium.\n\nI started having small success by answering questions in relevant forums, being helpful and having a link to my product in my forum user signature. Don't just post your website and tell people to check it out. Also made that mistake.\n\nWhen I saved up some money and tested paid traffic, that's when things picked up. Lost a bunch of money at first. Had to learn proper targeting, bidding, tracking, etc. I shudder to think how much money I lost by not knowing about retargeting. I think that could have bailed out a lot of my failed campaigns and put them into a slight profit or breakeven at least. Get that retargeting pixel from Facebook/Google/whoever and put it in on your web page(s). Even if you're not planning to do anything with it yet.\n\nIt's hard to make a profit on just a book, though. It's fine on the front end to attract customers into your sales funnel, but the back end is where the money is. \n\nWhen I added higher-priced upsells (audio, video, continuity programs, done-for-you services, etc.) that allowed me to cover my traffic costs and re-invest in buying more traffic, that's when things exploded.  \n\nPut another way: if you spend $100 on traffic to get 1 customer and only earn $10 per customer, how much traffic can you buy? Not a lot. If you spend $100 in traffic per customer but make $120 on every customer you get? You can buy as much traffic as you want.\n\nIf your budget can handle it, there's a book on Amazon titled *Upsells Unleashed.* Cost you a grand total of $7.99 for the Kindle edition. The author is the owner of a company that sells a digital shopping cart, which means she's seen the conversion data on all kinds of upsells and sales funnels, so she knows what works.\n\nAnother book that helped me a lot was *How to Build Websites That Sell.* Although you can get the guy's content for free on his blog at ConversionXL.com. For me, it was nice to have his posts assembled and organized as a book.\n\nIf those books had been around when I was starting out, it would have made the path a lot clearer.\n\nThat being said, don't be overwhelmed and think you need to set up all that stuff at the beginning. Just good for you to have a road map in your head for where to go in the future.\n\nGet your first product done, get it up online and start getting sales. Then set up more offers when you've validated your first idea with some sales. As long as you collect e-mail addresses and build an e-mail list, you can always follow up with more offers later.\n\nThis might make you feel better: I remember a copywriter talking about one of his clients, a very marketing-savvy company that makes tens of millions per year selling info products. \n\nThey hire the best copywriters, have the most sophisticated tracking technology, etc. He said something like 7 out of 10 of their projects fail. 2 do okay money and 1 will be a blockbuster. That's despite all the vast resources at their disposal.\n\nSo try to be positive and see that failure puts you in good company. You're only 10 failed tests from making your fortune! lol. I think it was more like 20 for me, so I was a slow learner :p\n\nHere's a talk on [Little Bets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl5ATK7tCsI) (Video) that might motivate you.\n\nGood luck!

{"id":"d2z1e6e","author":"sheymyster","body":"Storage is by cubic foot if I'm not mistaken so the bigger an item is, the more the storage fee is for that particular item. Every month they will charge your account a fee based on how much room your inventory is taking up in their warehouses. \n\nYes, you'll need to research FBA if you plan on having Amazon house your inventory and take care of shipping your orders to customers (Which I assume you are since your first question was about storage fees which only applies to items sold through the FBA program). You create an FBA shipment and input all of your items, then Amazon tells you which warehouse to send which items and you box them up, print the label (which will be charged to your amazon seller account) and drop them at the UPS or any UPS drop point. When the items arrive, they will be unpacked and available for sale usually by the next day. But honestly if you've never looked into FBA before you need to watch some videos and do your research, that little description by me isn't enough to fully understand your role as an FBA seller. \n\nAs for storage fees on board games, it doesn't matter it's just dependent on how much space it takes up. I think the storage fees for \"oversized\" items are different but I've never sent one of those in so I can't answer about it. \n\nAlso, remember that there's such a thing as \"long term storage fee\" which is WAY more expensive than the regular storage fee. This only applies to items that you have more than 1 inventory of (so this would apply to your candles), but it can hit hard if you send in 1000 candles and only sell a few and the 6 month time period rolls around. \n\nI would advise you test how well they sell first with maybe just 50 or something and that way, if they bomb and don't sell at all, you can have them sent back to you for not too much money and try to sell them on another platform (ebay, locally, merchant fulfilled, etc..).

{"id":"d303ubn","author":"Colonel_Aldo_Raine","body":"I don't think your business model requires or supports having an online presence. But with that said, as a fan of sweets, I took a look at it from the perspective of a potential client. \n\nOthers have mentioned the lack of visual appeal so I won't delve into that. Your prices are ridiculous. I'm not paying $8 for a 3.5 oz bar of chocolate. I don't care if you included a splinter of wood from the cross that Jesus was crucified on- it's not happening. And that doesn't even include shipping costs (which I will discuss in a bit). The same goes for your cookies. Unless they are the world's greatest cookies, I don't think they are worth $20/box. And if they were the world's greatest, you wouldn't be having the issues that you are currently having.\n\nBut let's say for a minute that I get the most extreme case of munchies and decide to order- your shipping policies are hindering my desire to complete the purchase. The turn around time for orders just doesn't make you competitive in today's market. For example, if I lived in California, and decided at 10:30 AM on Wednesday morning that I wanted to sample some of your products, my order wouldn't even SHIP until the next Monday. It would be a week before I received it. When you are competing against the likes of Amazon Prime, you have to be faster than that. A consumer, even if they are living in the sticks, could get on Amazon and find a wide array of treats that would arrive significantly faster than your products. But that doesn't really even apply to this, because people who get cravings for cookies or chocolate don't wait days to satisfy those cravings- they jump in their car and drive to the grocery store and buy something that is way less expensive and satiates them in minutes, not a week. It's not an exaggeration to say that potential customers in California could get your products faster by getting in their cars on Wednesday afternoon and driving to New York than by ordering it online.\n\nWith all that said, if someone STILL wanted to go through with ordering... There doesn't appear to be a way to access your shopping cart from the mobile site. Both myself and one of my coworkers added stuff to our carts on our phones and we can't figure out how to checkout. Is there a way? Maybe. But we aren't spending any more time looking for it. \n\nJust remember- your job is to make it easy and enticing for your customers. They don't owe you anything, and if it you create adverse conditions for them to buy from you, they will gladly move on to the next guy.","name":"t1_d303ubn","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-05-10 18:42:23","week":19}

{"id":"d304ybs","author":"MasterCookSwag","body":"\n\n&gt;Assuming everything I’ve said so far is true (and it well might not be)\n\nIt's not. \n\n&gt;* It is always a bad idea to buy a mutual fund with a non-trivial expense ratio.  Vanguard has some that are less than one tenth of a percent (&lt;0.1%) which is fine.\n\nTerrible.  It's always a bad idea to use simple platitudes as rigid investment advice. \n\n\n&gt;* If you want to make a bet with very high risk and very high potential for reward, then randomly selecting one stocks is a reasonable course of action.  \n\nSo by your logic you statistically have an equal chance of underperforming vs outperforming with random selection yet you think a \"high risk high potential reward\" strategy would be to do exactly that.  You may want to Google expected return and how that works... \n\n&gt;One caveat to this is if you really pick randomly, you might be a nice big stable stock like visa, where risk and reward is actually fairly low. \n\nTIL individual equities carry a low risk/expected return profile. \n\n&gt; If you really want high risk, do something like randomly a random stock with a Morningstar category of Small Growth.\n\nJust to be clear your advice at this point is to throw shit at a wall and see what sticks, yes? \n\n&gt;* To lower your risk, select a larger number of random stocks.\n\nThrow lots of shit at a wall.  Something will work out. \n\n&gt;* Randomly selecting a fairly large sample of stocks is about the same as investing in an ETF.  Although commissions might make this impractical.\n\nLiterally the first thing you said that isn't incorrect. \n\n&gt;* **You shouldn't bother to read books** like the intelligent investor (which I have already bought on Amazon).  You just need to know enough to choose a risk/reward profile that works for you.\n\nNevermind.  We're back on the ignorance train. \n\n&gt;*when I say beat the market, I mean make decisions that on average tend to beat the market.  Of course any individual bet might beat the market.  If you bet your life savings on one black jack hand you might win, but that doesn't mean you are good at black jack.  **Nobody will beat the market 100% of the time.**  \n\nThats weird, because institutional money managers [do on average beat the market...](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2733147)\n\nIf your criteria is 100% all of the time then that's just a ridiculous expectation. \n \n&gt;* If you beat the market 9 times out of 10 you might just be [lucky] (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=probability+of+9+successes+in+10+trials+with+p%3D.5).  \n* If you beat the market 90 times out of 100 the odds of you being just lucky are [1 in quadrillions] (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=probability+of+90+successes+in+100+trials+with+p%3D.5).\n* If you have a weighted coin that lands heads 70% of the time, your odds of losing 6 or more out of 10 times is about 1 in 20.  Even if you are a winner you could still lose.\n\nOh Jesus, because return distributions are just like flipping coins. \n\nLook man, if you're gonna start your post with \"I'm new at this\" then why even bother giving out advice?  How about you sit back and pay attention and possibly learn something rather than parroting this crap?  Nobody who really understands investing thinks this way, it sounds like you've been listening to a bunch of kids who use their belief that one can't beat the market to shroud their ignorance of how markets work. \n\nWe really need to stop the amateur hour advice around here.

{"id":"d30lfmx","author":"sparkingthefire","body":"Just a heads up since it SOUNDS like the Fancy Feast cans. My cat eats the same ones and will not go any cheaper. Tried to get him on 9 Lives because it's SO much cheaper but he doesn't really enjoy them even though he'll eat them. He's my person so even being frugal trying to pay down my debts I like to treat him with some things. \n\nI would just watch for those to go on sale. I don't know what grocery stores you have in your area but in FL we have Publix and they just had the 24 pack on sale for $11.99. Including tax that comes out to roughly $.53 a can which is a little better.\n\nI feel you about taking away the wet food. He was a rescue at 8 weeks and he had ONLY wet food until he came home with me and at first. I knew I couldn't afford ALL wet so I started mixing the hard food with the wet food to kind of let him know what was up. Now I leave the hard food out and only give him the wet food as a treat. I would say I give it to him at most once a day. I make sure to do it at different times each time so that he doesn't expect it so that if it doesn't happen or I can't afford the wet stuff all the time he won't be disappointed. For example, if I make myself a special breakfast, I'll give him one too. Sometimes I have 'me' night where I treat myself and take a hot shower, shave, wash my hair, paint my nails etc, I'll give him one to treat himself to.\n\nAnother tip from a frugal kitty mommy is the Omega Paw litter box. My kitten is now over four months old and he likes to REALLY dig in there. I had a very basic litter box with no lid or anything and I was having to vaccuum every day and it was ending up all over my bed and carpet. I was trying to find a box that was harder to kick litter out of and found this. I feel like it saves me a lot of litter. The way it works is you put it together, then when you want to 'scoop' it, you roll it to the right all the way until it's upside down (which it's designed to do so it'll also rest on it's lid like that if you need) then literally just roll it back and all the bad stuff goes into a little compartment. You pull out the compartment and dump it and it's good. It runs about $25 on Amazon but I find now that the bulk bag I buy from Amazon for around $15 lasts me at least six months! You never need to scoop again! About once a month or more if I notice, I take it apart and just wipe down the little 'filter' with a wet paper towel. Other than that you barely need anything and it saves you tons on litter.\n\nSorry for getting so wordy but we're very much in a similar situations!

Retail is the remainder) valued not just more than Walmart... But **50%** more?  On MUCH lower revenue with thinner margins?\n\nBut alright.  AWS has a nice fat 17% margin.  So let's give this a go. \n\nLets pretend their retail segment gets to be as big as Walmart's while margins remain the same 1% (AWS is negligible in overall revenue at $8bn compared to $108 bn overall revenue).  Meanwhile we'll assume AWS grows 30% YoY for the next five years.\n\nSo they get $480 bn in sales from revenue and AWS grows to $29 bn in revenue.\n\nWell at 1% for retail and 17% for AWS, from a profitability standpoint, that's $4.8bn from retail and $5.1 bn from AWS for a total of $9.9 bn which we'll round off to 10.\n\nNow, once upon a time, a fair P/E for a company was consider to be 15, but today that number is north of 20.  So we'll assume a *moderately* overvalued company PE would be 22.\n\nThat means if we assume that Amazon becomes a bigger retailer than Walmart in the next five years, AND continues to grow AWS at 30% YoY, they would STILL be overvalued at $220bn... Five years from now... AKA, 33% less than they're valued *today*.\n\nIn other words, the market is expecting things that I seriously don't think Amazon could reasonably produce.  And don't pretend the market *doesn't* have a history of doing this.  Just look at how badly Apple was punished just for reaching market saturation.

{"id":"d3145nn","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"1. Putting all your money into Amazon is an absolutely awful idea. What happens if, instead of going to $1k, it goes back to $400's like it did in Feb? Are you going to be on here posting \"OMG WHY IS AMZN DOWN SO MUCH!?!!?!?!\" I'll also say that $1k within the year is an unrealistic target. \n\n2. Amazon is a tremendous company that is continuing to lay waste to a lot of retail - it's remarkable how retail has essentially been the equivalent to the people of Alderaan hearing about the Death Star and going https://media.giphy.com/media/11lLn6lwsdicLK/giphy.gif Amazon hasn't been really challenged in any meaningful way all these years, while in the meantime the company has been putting tremendous amount of investment into the business. While it's been an incredibly successful company over the years, the effect on B &amp; M seems to only be accelerating the longer retail sits on its hands - will be interesting to see the Macy's quarter this morning.  I've said on here before and I continue to believe that we are entering the end of the mall era. Not that malls are going away completely by any means, but operators will have to evolve, more second/third tier stores will go (as will some formerly \"first tier\" stores) and many generic strip malls will be abandoned or repurposed. \n\nWal-Mart isn't going anywhere by any means, but I will say that their attitude towards Amazon is somewhat similar to how Sears regarded Wal-Mart years ago. While I don't think that Wal-Mart is going anywhere, I don't think its attempts to now scramble to challenge Amazon will be particularly successful, either. Amazon has been tremendously innovative, while Wal-Mart has spent a lot of money on a mobile payment system (Merchant Customer Exchange, then called CurrentC) that basically never went anywhere. Wal-Mart is now going after Visa again. Wal-Mart also is closing its small express stores. Elsewhere, \"Prime Now offers members one-hour delivery on an important subset of selection, and was launched only\n111 days after it was dreamed up. In that time, a small team built a customer-facing app, secured a location for an\nurban warehouse, determined which 25,000 items to sell, got those items stocked, recruited and on-boarded new\nstaff, tested, iterated, designed new software for internal use – both a warehouse management system and a\ndriver-facing app – and launched in time for the holidays. Today, just 15 months after that first city launch, Prime\nNow is serving members in more than 30 cities around the world.\" (From the Bezos letter to shareholders last year.)\n\nI mean, fuck - Target's Cartwheel is more innovative than anything Wal-Mart has done in recent years. Not only does Wal-Mart have to face against Amazon, but I think Target is an underappreciated rival that is doing a lot of things right. \n\nAmazon also has AWS which was met with skepticism when it started and has now become a tremendous bright spot, despite concerns about commoditization. Still, the company's valuation is exceedingly high and prices in a great deal; if there was a significant decline in the market, this would be taken lower in a similar manner to how it was in February. If Amazon badly misses a quarter, this could be down double digits in an instant. It has to continue to going full steam (and then some.) The 3 trillion prediction by a hedge fund manager in the last week is ridiculous, but it would not surprise me if Amazon has further to go, given that the company has basically not been challenged in any meaningful way as it has continued to expand its business. Amazon has had few misses. The Fire phone and Living Social purchase comes to mind. There are likely others, but the batting average is pretty remarkable when you think back over the years.\n\nStill, that valuation is very, very rich. \n--\n\n\n\n \"At that point, I can diversify my portfolio. \"\n\nDiversify your portfolio to begin with. Have a small position in Amazon now if you want.\n\n\" wait for it to hit even higher, then split?\"\n\nLets say it goes to $900 then splits 10 for 1. That's still like if you'd waited for it to hit $900.  Again, that's an if, though; there is no guarantee it will reach those levels nor any guarantee that it will split. Priceline has never split. Chipotle has never. Google split, but largely from a voting rights standpoint. \n\n\"I want to invest in something I know and believe in.\"\n\nExpand your investable universe beyond Amazon. Diversify first.\n\n\"I keep beating myself up over not hitting it then. I still want some skin in the stock but $700/share is rich. However, I believe it will be the first stock to eventually hit $1,000 then split at some point.\"\n\nYou're chasing it. \n\n\"The other stock that is a buy right now is Apple, but I think Amazon is still a far better buy\"\n\nAnything non-tech?\n\nEdited to add: Macy's with that nasty, nassssty guidance. Also, Amazon is probably delighted by the spls/odp merger being blocked. Another business they'll completely lay waste to soon enough.","name":"t1_d3145nn","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-11 12:00:25","week":19}

I mean, seriously: https://media.giphy.com/media/APcFiiTrG0x2/giphy.gif\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nWhat is not wrong with Macy's?\n\nYou basically have a retail industry that have either basically stuck their head in the sand and hoped that Amazon would go away or ignored it. This morning, I compared it to the people of Alderaan hearing about the Death Star and basically going: https://media.giphy.com/media/11lLn6lwsdicLK/giphy.gif  I mean: **Amazon will account for more than half of 2015 e-commerce growth, says Macquarie \"Macquarie estimates that for every $1 of e-commerce growth, Amazon will take 51 cents, and for every $1 of adjusted retail growth, Amazon will take 24 cents. \"Think about the inverse of that: Every other retailer is fighting for 49 cents and 76 cents of each dollar, respectively,\" the bank wrote.\" (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-will-account-for-more-than-half-of-2015-e-commerce-growth-says-macquarie-2015-12-22)**\n\n\nRetailers like Macy's are stuck with big, unproductive stores that focus on apparel, which people aren't spending on...\n \n...at least not at Macy's and other such stores. \" Cowen: It Looks Even More Like Amazon Will Become America's Top Clothing Retailer in 2017 - [Our calculation] implies a gain in U.S. Apparel &amp; Accessories market share from 5 percent to 14 percent,\" the team, led by John Blackledge write in their note, adding, \"We have seen a continued shift away from more traditional retailers...In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon Apparel purchasers were up ~19 percent year-over-year, while Apparel purchasers fell ~1 percent year-over-year and ~5 percent year-over-year at Wal-Mart and Target, respectively.\" (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-11/cowen-it-looks-even-more-like-amazon-will-become-america-s-top-clothing-retailer-in-2017)\n\nCompanies like Macy's have not used online or mobile well and are now fucking scrambling to do something about it, probably too late. The guidance was awful and they are going to have to shrink. People are not coming in the stores. There's all this talk about Macy's real estate, but how appealing is retail real estate when there's going to be a glut of it as Sears goes, JCP sells stores, Kohl's sells stores, Office Depot sells stores (probably a lotta stores), Staples sells stores and more.  The other problem that I have is this: Macy's has a lot of problems. Doing some financial engineering with your real estate may boost the stock (although I think less than many believe, plus the rumors and discussion of that haven't kept the stock from dropping 50% in a year), but it doesn't solve the problems that the business is facing.\n\nThe era of the mall as a sort of ubiquitous thing across the American landscape is over. This is something bigger and not something that can any longer be blamed on weather by CEOs. I think over the next 5-10 years there is going to have to be some real creativity about how to reuse a lot of second/third-tier malls and free standing stores (lotta K-Marts going to be empty for years) that are no longer in use. Some mall operators will absolutely evolve to become more destinations. Some will not and I think it's going to be a difficult time for the B &amp; M retail industry for years to come.\n\nCan Macy's go to the mid-upper $20's? Sure. Will they do something to boost the stock? Quite possibly. May do something with the real estate. Personally, I don't want to be anywhere near the mall in terms of investing either way.","name":"t1_d31p53o","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-11 21:22:32","week":19}

{"id":"d31rv8a","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"&gt; You realize that Macys owns a whole square block in midtown Manhattan by Penn Station... Their real estate isn't a joke. \n\nAnd I don't think their real estate is a joke, either. \n\nBruce Berkowitz made a large bet on Sears several years ago and trumpeted the value of the real estate. Former \"Morningstar Manager of the Decade\" Berkowitz was investing starting well over $100 and talking about how incredibly valuable that the SHLD real estate was. Several years and a handful of mostly awful spin-offs (including one that's no longer), SHLD is literally $12 and change (down another 5.6% today) and we are still waiting for the market to realize the tremendous value within the SHLD real estate and all of those stores, including many old, outdated K-Mart and Sears stores that will likely sit empty for ages. Eddie Lampert's going to unveil his financial engineering finale any....day...now. (crickets.) The Berkowitz bet on Sears (Fairholme owns 26% of SHLD) is going to go down as one of the worst bets in mutual fund history, alongside Bill Nygren's riding Washington Mutual all the way down.\n\n\n I'm not saying that Sears real estate has no value, but the issue is this: the tremendously poor handling of Sears  has resulted in dragging this situation out for close to a decade now. Every day that goes by is a day that Sears loses more money and that Eddie Lampert has destroyed more shareholder value. Several years and billions of dollars in losses for Sears later, the real estate thesis for investing in Sears has resulted in several years of losses and opportunity cost for those who followed it.\n\n As I've quoted in the past in regards to Lampert's legacy with Sears, \" in 2006 RBS (via Greenwich Capital) offered to monetize over $1 billion of Sears stores assets as a \"test case\" at incredibly attractive rates via a CMBS transaction, only to be rebuffed by an ESL finance group which felt that those assets would only increase in value, while believing that continued robust store operations would ensure that Sears did not need cash in any event. The \"spreadsheet math\" would have become reality but for the hubris of ESL/Sears. \n\nThe only thing worse than not creating value is actually having value handed to one who ultimately destroys it.\" (http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/12/sears-holdings-liquidation-sale.html, comments section.)\n\n\nJust because the real estate is worth X does not necessarily mean that management will do a good job realizing that value. \n\nI do not think that Macy's real estate is a joke. They absolutely have some crown jewel properties. They also have some properties that are not. I do, however, think that the wildly bullish case that some have made is overly optimistic. In any case, I'm not interested, but good luck to you: I just don't want to invest in a retailer whose fundamentals now seem rapidly eroding on the hopes that their attempt at monetizing the real estate goes as hoped/perfectly according to plan (and meanwhile, they're clearly not succeeding at turning around the business.)\n\n\nAnd I'm coming at it from a different place, mind you. I invest in what I believe to be strong businesses whose fundamentals I think are strong and that are often part of a long-term theme that I find compelling. I don't want to buy a business like Macy's on the hopes that a catalyst works out just right when I don't like the underlying business otherwise. If I miss it, I miss it; I don't want to sit there and monitor it, I don't want to think about it. I don't buy boring businesses, but I do buy businesses that I feel confident enough in at all levels that I do not have the desire to micromanage or even really be day-to-day about things. \n\n\nFurther downside is probably limited (although I do think momentum can take this into the upper $20's), but they start to get put into a place of desperation in terms of doing something with their real estate as the fundamentals get worse and calls from shareholders to do something gets louder. It's all about how well what they do with their real estate goes because after that, you're still left with a problematic core business that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on its issues (which only get worse as time passes and Amazon takes more business.) I mean honestly, who's to say that the eventual path of Macy's doesn't somewhat resemble Sears in terms of selling off parts and pieces instead of innovation and investment?: \"It’s now evident, that by the time the Sears Holdings coffin is lowered into the ground, the box will be almost empty. Lampert’s mismanaged initiatives have amounted to nothing more than a long running sell off of the company’s valuable body parts. First, to enrich himself, and then, more recently, to keep the enterprise alive. Valuable real estate – mostly gone. Intellectual property rights to Kenmore, Craftsman and Die Hard – gone. Free cash flow generated from normal ongoing operations, long gone. Cash flow, when there was any, reinvested in derivatives, rather than stores, people, products and marketing.\" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen/2016/02/29/sears-holdings-retailings-headless-horseman/#daf2eefdeb9d)\n\n\n\"I can't decide if I agree with this. I agree that second/third tier mediocre malls may have a lot of headwinds. But I think the high end malls won't go anywhere and the stores in them are generally doing well enough to thrive. Google Fashion Island Newport Beach for the kind of mall im talking about.\"\n\n\nAs I've noted when I've talked about this in other threads, I think some mall operators will evolve and transform their malls into more destinations. Some will absolutely not. Many of the dime-a-dozen malls that dot the landscape that are anchored by things like Office Depot or Gap are going to be in serious trouble. The financial engineering Frankenstein that Eddie Lampert has turned Sears into is done, it's only a matter of time. Kohls, JCP, Macy's, Gap, Office Depot and others will be closing stores. It would not surprise me if that list of retailers closing stores gets longer over the coming months. \n\n\nGood luck to you.\n\nAlso: one of the best articles in illustrating what Lampert has done to Sears: http://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen/2016/02/29/sears-holdings-retailings-headless-horseman/#57ce7cc1deb9","name":"t1_d31rv8a","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-11 22:18:29","week":19}

A mutual fund is an investment you can buy that is made up of lots of other smaller investments. You may own small bits of Coca Cola and Amazon and a real estate company and an oil company. Those small bits of each company make up your mutual fund.\n\nBut mutual funds aren't just there for the buying. Someone had to come up with the idea. Not only that, but someone has to manage it. A fund manager. Let's say your mutual fund includes the company Blackberry. Remember them? Made smartphones but then couldn't keep up with trends. Your fund manager thinks \"Blackberry is a bad investment, I want to swap it out of the fund in favor of Apple, who makes phones people actually use.\"\n\nYou pay the fund manager an expense ratio for doing that job - keeping your fund more profitable. While you want him to do a good job, you want to keep your expense ratios as low as possible.\n\nVanguard is well known for selling mutual funds with very low expense ratios. They manage their funds for a very low cost AND they do a good job. PABAX is sold by Vanguard, but is not managed by Vanguard, that's why the expense ratio is kind of high.

{"id":"d322soz","author":"fatalcharm","body":"Ok, let's make it clear that affiliate marketing and multi-level marketing are two different things.\n\nI do affiliate marketing, I run several blogs in certain niches, and put ads related to those niches on those blogs.\n\nFor example, Amazon runs an affiliate program. So if I have a blog about dog/puppy care, I will go to Amazon and find products to promote that relate to dogs and puppies then place ads for those products on by blog. I might write an article along the lines of \"10 cool food bowls for your pup\" and then each of the food bowls I list in the article are actually Amazon affiliate links, so if anyone buys one of the food bowls through my link, I get paid a small commission.\n\nI have a blog related to fashion, I am also an affiliate of a lot of fashion/clothing websites. I will often post articles on current trends etc. and within the article, link to different items of clothing that you can buy online. Those are affiliate links, and if someone happens to buy that item of clothing after clicking through the link I provided, then I make a small commission on the sale. I also post the clothing items to Pinterest and other social networks.\n\nThat is pretty much what affiliate marketing is. It's as simple as putting some ads in the sidebar of your blog. \n\nProducts like this give it a bad rep. It is affiliate marketing, you are promoting a product and get paid a commission if someone buys through you. However this is a shitty product. Instead of promoting something you wouldn't even buy yourself, sign up to programs like Amazon Affiliates or Shopstyle Collective and search through the products and find something that you actually want to promote. Then when you do find something, write a short blog post about it with a link to the product, post it to Pinterest and leave it at that. \n\nNo need to harass all your friends with this new work from home strategy that makes people millionaires that has become your obsession and you haven't slept in days because you are thinking about when those checks finally start rolling in...\n\nAnyway, just wanted to clear that up. Some affiliate marketers make their programs seem like snake oil or a pyramid scheme. Those guys are bad at marketing. Terrible, actually. They are the last person you should be getting marketing advice from (ironically, many of them are trying to sell a product that teaches you affiliate marketing) and instead study the blogs that you already visit. If you notice that within an article, they link to a product/service that you can purchase online then chances are that is an affiliate link. If the linked product is subtle and fits/flows within the topic being discussed within the article, then that is affiliate marketing done right.\n\nI just hate it when affiliate marketing gets compared to multi level marketing/pyramid schemes, as many people in this thread have done. They are very different things but unfortunately, bad marketing can make them look one and the same.","name":"t1_d322soz","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-12 02:37:43","week":19}

If you withdraw a $1 Amazon.com gift card or $1 to your bitcoin wallet every single day of the month, that would be pretty annoying (it's unlikely that you'd withdraw $1 from PayPal every day since PayPal fees are at 33% at $1. lol).\n\nIt's just that when I'm at say 56 cents after doing a few offers and there aren't many offers on the site because I'm Canadian and the minimum withdrawal is $10 or $20, chances are I will probably never ever get paid for my labour. lol. I have so many GPT site accounts from the past 6 weeks or so of doing this hobby. And I've been on Clickworker too for 3 months. And thus far I've only got paid by 2 sites (Swagbucks in Amazon cards and PayPal. And some GPT app that paid me in bitcoin). And have enough credits to get paid by a third site (Perk). Because every time I register with a site, do some offers, find out that the offers suck (surveys especially or non-crediting offers), pay shit or that the minimum withdrawal seems impossible to achieve with the paltry number of decent offers on the site (particularly when you are Canadian and aren't eligible for the offers that Americans get). Then I give up and write it off.\n\nSurely there are Canadian companies that would like to advertise on an app or website no? It seems like GPT sites pretty much neglect Canadian companies. Except for those shitty Tim Hortons and Koodo commercials I see on Swagbucks mobile apps (and even after they secure Canadian advertising, Swagbucks still refuses to give Canadians currency exchange parity for their gift cards and PayPal redemptions. lol).

It is pay-as-you-go car insurance (so a flat fee with a cents-per-mile premium). Our monthly rate is waaaay lower than it would be otherwise because we don't commute (bike/walk) and if you do take a road trip you're only charged for the first 150 miles. Additionally you plug a device into your diagnostic port (so they can check your mileage) but it also gives you handy info like whether or not you're parked on a street sweeping street or if you have check engine light errors, what they mean. It's super neat.

{"id":"d32cxnv","author":"AlejothePanda","body":"Okay, here's my experience:\n\nI've been doing YouGov US for several months and I get an average of 3500 points a month from their surveys. They send you surveys by email pretty frequently and they're usually valued at 500 points each. The website is pretty well-designed, IMO, and I haven't had any problems. \n\nAll of the surveys I get have been very \"formatted,\" for lack of a better word. They're usually the same questions about different brands. During my first month, it definitely took me more than 30 minutes to get my 3500 points. But, lately, because I got used to the questions, it definitely takes me less than 20 minutes to get my 3500 points. So the surveys are pretty rewarding for the amount of time they take and the frequency with which they send them out.\n\nMy biggest gripe has to do with the payouts. To get the most out of the points you earn, you have to save up 100,000 points which'll get you a $100 Amazon or Visa gift card. You can cashout at about 30,000 points as well, but you'll get a gift card with a lower value like a $25 Walgreen's or AMC gift card. So you have to spend a while just to save up for the lower payouts, let alone the more valuable higher payouts.\n\nFortunatly, there are a few ways to supplement your points. Their refferal system isn't bad; I don't remember the exact criteria but your referrals don't have to do much more than sign up and you'll get 2000 points for each of them. There's also a program you can download on your computer or smartphone that basically sells some of your privacy if you're comfortable with that.\n\nBut one of the ways I rack up the most points is their app. Everyday they send out three simple multiple choice questions on their app that don'r usually give you any points. However, they had a promotion where they selected a number of the website members that they deemed \"loyal,\" and offered them 200 points a day for answering the three super quick multiple choice questions. I accepted the offer, and now I'm racking up points pretty quickly and it hardly costs me any time. Of course, the issue is you have to be lucky enough to be offered the promotion, and anyobody who doesn't have it may not be as happy as myself with the rate at which they're earning points.\n\nI believe YouGov is open to anyone above the age of thirteen. I also don't yet have payment proof but [this guy does](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/44h3fr/yougov_earn_points_for_taking_surveys/czqfvs6).\n\nTl;dr: Good surveys, but you have to do a ton to get enough points for a payout. YouGov US is really worthwhile if you're lucky enough to get points from their app. Also not a bad refferal system.\n\n[My Ref](https://today.yougov.com/refer/69Xlsxdowpb8Bp7beZcPOw/) | [Non-Ref](https://today.yougov.com/) links if you're interested in joining.","name":"t1_d32cxnv","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-12 07:31:38","week":19}

{"id":"d32mr4x","author":"sheymyster","body":"Don't box everything up until you know where it's going because you're right, unless you have inventory placement turned on (costs you $0.30 extra PER ITEM), you will most likely be sending to two or three different locations and they will tell you which items to each location so you can't pack the boxes until you know. \n\nYes, during the FBA shipment process there will be a \"print labels\" section where you print individual barcodes for each item. You have to cover any and all barcodes already on the item so usually I just slap the FBA label over any preexisting ones. Since this is your first time you most likely don't have a label printer yet, so you'll be using those 30 labels per sheet labels and a printer. \n\nPeople use inkjet printers but Amazon discourages it because the ink can run or smear if it get's damp and these items could sit in the warehouse for awhile if they aren't super fast sellers. The barcode is the only thing that separates your book from the hundreds of thousands of others so if that smears, you just lost your item forever. Laser printer is the best if you're printing sheets of labels, but if you're going to get into FBA a lot, I'd suggest getting a thermal label printer as it will save you a lot of headache in the long run. I use a DYMO 450 Turbo, it cost me about $70 I think when I bought it, and the labels come out to about $0.02 each, no ink needed. Using a DYMO also costs me $5 a month to use a program called \"listlabelship\" that allows me to print an entire shipment of labels with 2 clicks instead of having to print each one individually. \n\nFees do apply, if you aren't using the amazon seller app already to source your items, download it. With an amazon seller account, the app is free and it will give you a fee estimate based on the highest FBA price. Just make sure you have your settings correct and it's comparing your item to other FBA items only (and not the merchant fulfilled ones). \n\nYes, you're items receive prime status at the fulfillment center which is what makes FBA so worth it. Not only do you not have to handle individual item shipments or customer service for the most part, but you also get to demand a premium price because your items qualify for prime shipping. This offsets the heavy fees that come with FBA, combined with the lack of work required besides sending in a bulk shipment to a warehouse, FBA is totally worth it. \n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to PM me and I'll answer as best as I can. I'm no guru when it comes to flipping or FBA, but I have been doing it pretty hard for several months now and I feel like I'm comfortable with the entire process now.

{"id":"d32n0x4","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"Apologies and the intent wasn't to sound like that.  I think beyond anything else, it's trying to push the idea that if you are going to buy something like Amazon (or Under Armor, or whatever Reddit stock is a frequent topic of discussion), buy it because you have a significant long-term (or fuck, even medium-term thesis) on it. Don't buy it and then if it's down three days later post on here \"WHY IS IT DOWN 2%!?!?\" It just seems to happen a lot on here.\n\nAgain, the intent isn't to sound that way as much as push the idea when these names are brought up as something someone wants to buy that they can be very volatile and double digit declines within a short time frame are not to be unexpected. Amazon went from a hair under $700 in December to around $490 by February. If you are well aware, fantastic. \n\nOr people pile into these names and everything is awesome when things are great. When things turn like they did earlier this year, those are the people freaking out and asking if they should sell everything. I'm not saying don't buy an Amazon. I am saying if you are going to have a portfolio of NFLX/AMZN/GOOG/FB, understand the potential risks of that. Having a comfortable amount in them (and if you're comfortable with 20%, great) allows one - I think - to have exposure to them in a way that allows for a much more comfortable longer-term view and not have people puke up positions and post on here freaking out when things turn like they did earlier this year.\n\nAgain, not meant to sound harsh, I think personally I've tried to emphasize an understanding of risk and a push towards owning things with a longer-term view in an attempt to try and get a little more detailed discussions on here and move away a bit from the sort of \"why is x down!?!?\" posts.

She and I live very far apart, so she ordered it at her local, and I was told I could pick it up at my local store. She did this in early December.\n\nAfter Christmas, I go to my local store with the reference number provided to me. They tell me the item hasn't arrived, but I should try again in two weeks. However, on the way to this custmer service desk, I walked right by the kitchen department, and I saw the exact slow cooker ordered for me. I asked if I could just take one of them, and I was told that wasn't possible; my purchase wasn't considered part of their stock.\n\nAnnoying, but fine. I'll wait two weeks.I think it's more funny than anything, and I tell my sister about it. She gives me a tracking number they gave her as well. I look up the tracking number, and it says the item arrived at the local store around December 10th.\n\nStill, I wait the two weeks. I go back in, give them the original reference number, and they say it's still being delivered. I then hit them with the tracking number, and they say those tracking numbers can be anything; they don't use them at all. I remain very confused about this. I ask if I can take one of the slow cookers they still have on the shelf a section over, and I'm told no, that my model is actually different. Huh, different reason than before. I'm told to come back in two weeks. I ask if they can just phone or email me when the item is in. They say no, come back in two weeks.\n\nSo, I do. No surprise, no item for me to pick up. No, I cannot take one off the shelf; this time because sales taxes in the two cities are different. Howver, instead of saying it's still on its way, they say it never left the original store. That's new. My attempts to provide them with a tracking number showing it arrived here December 10th are completely ignored. They say that the issue is out of their hands, because the item was never sent. Take it up with the original store.\n\nI talk to my sister about it, as it's become a running joke with us. She then goes into the original store, and they quickly tell her the item was sent, the tracking number they provided proves it. She agrees. She asks her store to talk to my store ,and they say there's no need. We beg to differ, but they refuse.\n\nI go back into my store. They then tell me the item arrived, but it was damaged. Whoa, progress! I ask if I could just take the one RIGHT OFF THE SHELF BEHIND ME and I'm told no, that I have to file a claim with the delivery company. I ask why, as I'm neither responsible for shipping or receiving, and they say this is their process. I call right there from my cellphone, and the shipping company says only shippers can file claims, but, regardless, the item arrived on December 10 (we're into March at this point) and it was signed for. I pass the phone to the Sears agent, who nods a bunch, says thank you, and hangs up. They then tell me that I still need to file a claim with the delivery company.\n\nAt this point, I laugh and walk away. \n\nA few weeks later, my sister is mysteriously refunded her purchase on her credit card. She takes the money and orders me a slow cooker on Amazon and it arrives in 3 days to my doorstep.","name":"t1_d32prq8","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-12 16:42:39","week":19}

Their payments website is a little archaic in design, but has (or had) tons of helpful options designed to make the Amazon shopping experience a positive one.\n\nThat said, with any special financing offer make sure you pay off ALL of it before the period ends, or you will typically be subject to full interest charges for the 12 months on the full price.

All these other GPT sites/apps haven't been working out for me.\n\nAnd a Canadian's earning potential from Swagbucks and Perk is not as good as an American's. Because they both screw us on the currency conversion, Perk gives Canadians less points per video and Perk royally screws people on PayPal conversion while Swagbucks only screws you a bit on PayPal (forcing them to trade Amazon.com gift cards redeemed at Perk at a loss at 80-90% conversion on r/giftcardexchange). So if you're a Canadian who wants cash, you get DPed by Swagbucks and you get DAPed by Perk.","name":"t1_d330dz9","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-12 20:36:12","week":19}

Instead of doing it inside the PO, I just put the book inside the env and slapped the label on by my car. \n\nOnce I got home I realized that because it was hot, I through the book in without taking the rest of the stickers on. One still shows the price. Might get a negative on Amazon because of this one.  I'm hoping they appreciate the price on it and don't.

{"id":"d338j9b","author":"VVarlord","body":"It's risk vs reward. People telling you it's a terrible idea are playing it safe but since they're not taking that risk, their reward is probably lower. The general idea is that if you hold positions in several different areas you'll be more protected from one failing eg. tech is down but resources are up. If you'd bought gold at the beginning of the year you'd be in a better spot than if you'd bought Amazon.\n\nThat being said I don't think it'd a bad idea if you want to throw that kind of money in a company as strong as Amazon. Yes Amazon could trip, they could fall as hard as apple has recently but they also might and probably won't. One thing about amazon is they're not a one hit wonder, they're an extremely strong company branching out into many different areas and personally I think that's key. If they were only retail (which they are primarily but hence the branching out part) I'd say they'd be at much higher risk for competition or poor sales to come in and hurt them. Google and Facebook are in a similar position with branching out and that's why they're strong. Apple on the other hand has relied too heavily on phone sales and that's why they are failing hard right now. Apple will be fine but it might be awhile before they're golden again. \n\nI wouldn't hinge the success of your entire portfolio on Amazon or expect (although you can hope) them to reach 1k by years end but I would say it's a solid company if you want to invest in them. Even if they do end up faltering a bit I think they're solid to hang onto for years. I put that much money myself into Amazon stock recently if that helps but I also have similar size positions in other areas.","name":"t1_d338j9b","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-12 23:36:33","week":19}

If you are the seller with a Regular Paypal account, they will only protect you if the person claims they didn't get the item when the tracking number shows this. They will not guarantee or protect you if the complaint is about the quality of the item. You will almost always lose chargebacks or complaints about quality - although in every instance I've been involved in - Paypal has required the buyer to ship the items back to you with a tracking number before issuing a refund. \n\nPaypal will only get involved for quality issues on eBay only.\n\nI've used Authorize.net, Amazon Payments, Squarespace, Chase, Moneybookers and Paypal Merchant Services. They are all the same in regards to chargebacks. The chargeback is initiated by the buyers card company not paypal - all Paypal does is forward the info you send to the card company. There are a few more protections for the Paypal Merchant Services but it cost $35 a month even if you don't sell anything and you need to provide business information and inventory information.\n\nEDIT - Please bear with me and the errors, I'm on mobile and I'm correcting them.","name":"t1_d33l0fd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-13 05:04:15","week":19}

Amazon or Google will give you the same thing with much more freedom, and a larger portion of the sale goes to the artist. If it's a small band, Bandcamp is another great alternative, and you can specify all kinds of lossless formats for the same cost.\n\nThen again, it hardly matters anymore.

They keep everything secret.  Google and Amazon and Facebook, meanwhile, publish everything they're working on and their view of future products and far more details.  The end result is that it looks like Apple isn't doing anything whereas Google and Amazon and Facebook look like they're innovating- even if half of their projects end up failing.\n\n\nHowever, if you look at Apple's current finances, and look at their R&amp;D spending - it's through the roof.  Apple is hiring and developing like crazy and very clearly working on some enormous projects.  They just aren't telling anyone about it.\n\n\nWhy don't they do this when Google/Facebook/Amazon do?  Two reasons:\n\n* The primary one: Hardware. Unlike Google/Facebook/Amazon, Apple's a hardware company.  Being too frank about your upcoming releases can actually kill hardware sales as people hold off their purchases for the next release.\n* Corporate culture.  Steve Jobs preferred to operate this way and we know he laid out a plan to maintain this in Apple's corporate culture before he handed the reigns over to Tim.  \n\nApple's absolutely had products fail before - but Apple is much more tight lipped about what's in development and what gets killed in house.  Apple's got massive projects in the works, but for people unfamiliar with how they traditionally operate, it looks like they're just riding the iPhone gravy train.\n\nSince the iPhone is the bulk of their revenue, any slowdown in iPhone growth leads to a mass freakout by the average investor.","name":"t1_d34fvcz","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-13 21:41:57","week":19}

GCE, DigitalOcean, to name two. \n\nThis all being said, I have yet to pull the trigger on a short. I am going to look at the next earning's call as a potential catalyst for the short, or a bearish MA crossover, indicating a serious change in trend. Even using a lagging indicator (MA crossover), there is so much money in this stock. It is too ripe.\n\nThen again, everyone might be thinking this. But who will have the balls to go first? Once AMZN takes a 10% drop, everyone will be saying they knew it was topping out.","name":"t1_d34gss8","subreddit":"StockMarket","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjuv","created_utc":"2016-05-13 22:03:38","week":19}

{"id":"d34hw3r","author":"kplusp","body":"Thanks. I've always been very careful when it came to money. When I was young I would cut grass and do various jobs to make money which taught me how to work hard for what I wanted. I got my first real job when I got to college. I worked a lot of hours and eventually got a second job my sophomore year to help pay my way through school. During the summers I had internships that were also a big help. Working through school allowed me to graduate debt free, something that I've worked really hard to accomplish knowing that student loans tend to hurt a lot of new graduates financially. Not having any student loans or debt has helped me hit the ground running.\n\nOnce I got a job I was very disciplined in what I could spend and what I had to save. I would budget using tools like Mint or Level Money to help set goals and track my progress. I thinking seeing is believing in finance, once you start piling money away it gets exciting to watch it grow. Every paycheck I would set aside money for bills, then set aside money for savings ~$1000/month. The rest was free money for anything I wanted (trips, sporting events, bars, random Amazon purchases, etc.) I have since decreased the amount of free money I have since I was purchasing things that I didn't need and directed that money into my 401K and IRA. \n\nIt's really important to try and maximize your retirement accounts early if you can because compound interest will help you out in the long run. The rest is just being disciplined, try to prioritize what's important in your life and save where you can. I have made some sacrifices in my life to get ahead financially but I love the freedom that it provides.

Use Ebay gift cards to buy gift cards on sale on Ebay\n    * You can buy AA GCs [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/100-American-Airlines-Gift-Card-Mail-Delivery-/301719635249?hash=item463fe44531:g:1jYAAOSwLVZV13f-)\n    * Ebay offers 'Ebay bucks', so you can get between 2%-10% of your purchase back in Ebay bucks.\n    * There are often sales on gift cards like $92 for a $100 BP Gas gift card\n    * Combine gift card sale + Ebay bucks + shopping portal (like [Splender](http://www.splender.com) )to get gift cards *really cheap*. I've gotten gas gift cards for 20% off this way.\n3. Use the gift cards, or sell them if you want (for profit) on a website like [Raise](http://www.raise.com) or [SaveYa](http://www.saveya.com)\n\nI guess the drawback is you have to select United as your carrier.

The likelihood of you making your money back is probably pretty low, let alone making a decent profit considering the time and effort it's going to take to sell a pallet of vacuums.\n\nThe second-hand market on vacuums is not real great in my opinion. I've sold a handful of higher end Dyson's because I got them for $30 a piece and even then it really wasn't worth all the time and hassle. I sent a couple into FBA, new price was something like $600, but used was only like $180. I think I only made like $90 on each one and shipping them was horrible. You might be able to unload them on Facebook groups depending on your area, but again most people will want them for pennies on the dollar. \n\nThis is all ignoring the fact most pallet liquidation companies are incredibly shady. Most of those returns are probably because the unit is faulty, or the units will have visible wear/damage due to being a floor model or from the previous owner. Attachments will probably be missing, which again kills how much you can ask for them. If they weren't damaged before, they probably are considering how most of those pallets are put together. The stores just chuck everything back into the original box when it gets returned, then when they have enough of them they'll toss them onto a pallet and wrap them up, despite everything rattling around. \n\nAnd these are just the problems if the business you're dealing with is actually legitimate, the vast majority of pallet liquidators are pretty much scam artists. They'll sort and cherry pick pallets, use hidden fees, misrepresent items or condition.

{"id":"d34pqzq","author":"clamclam9","body":"In most cases they do tell you what you're buying to a degree. For instance the liquidator may tell you it's a pallet of cosmetics but there's no manifest so you don't know exactly how many of what specific items are in there.\n\nThe reason to manifest or not manifest a shipment depends on what type of liquidation it is. If they're shelf pulls then generally you would manifest something like that since it's easy enough to put together while you're cancelling the items out of inventory. But store returns usually just get chucked into a big box until there's enough for the store to send out. They're not going to sort through that box and list all the individual random items that got returned. \n\nI would stay far away from pallet liquidations to be honest. Half of all those companies are outright scammers, misrepresenting items or condition, hidden fees, 0 recourse for when your pallet is full of broken junk despite them guaranteeing functionality. They'll string you along forever and the most you might get out of them is a discount on your next purchase, so you can buy more junk from them. The other half is not much better considering the item's condition and price, not a lot of meat left on the bone and you're looking at probably near minimum wage level returns on your time. Most of those items were liquidated for a reason, either they're faulty, damaged, or there's no demand for them. Ask yourself, why would someone sell you a pallet for a fraction of its value? If it really contained what they want you to believe it does then they would just hire some people for minimum wage to send all that shit in to Amazon and reap all that profit themselves. Liquidation in general is pretty much a pyramid scheme. The first couple tiers of liquidators that deal directly with the companies in huge volume will get a decent amount of stuff for literally pennies. Then it filters down as lots are broken up, things are cherry picked and so on until you get to these mom and pop liquidators by the side of the road that let people buy individual pallets. Every business model for liquidators is essentially the same. Buy as much volume as possible, grab all the low hanging fruits, pass on the bulk to the next sucker.","name":"t1_d34pqzq","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-14 02:03:46","week":19}

I started with MF for two months to learn the ropes then switched to FBA about four months ago. I've been consistently sending in 300-400 books in a week over the last two months and my margins have been great. It was slow at first as i was starting with zero feedback, but now that I can win the buy box sales have taken off. If you have an established Amazon account I would recommend FBA wholeheartedly. The fees are steep, but the increase in sales in contrast to what I did with MF are phenomenal. 100% recommended. The amount of time I save alone makes it worth it.

{"id":"d35fr59","author":"435354","body":"Yeah, I'm not sure exactly what's going on there. \n\nTo pay that much with Verizon, with two 128GB iPhone 6S Plus (the most expensive iPhone model I could configure, at about $40/month/each), he'd need to go out of his way to select the 30GB/month data bucket which would be $225/month; the website itself only really markets the \"S to XXL\" plans, which go from 1-18GB for $30-100/month.\n\nTo pay that much with AT&amp;T, he'd have to have the same plan as above, and be financing the phones using AT&amp;T Next 12 (which would let him upgrade in 12 months); alternatively, he could be buying 40GB of data and financing using AT&amp;T Next 24. \n\nIt isn't possible to get that figure with Sprint. Sprint requires a downpayment for the 128GB iPhone 6S Plus, but for accounting purposes we'll just treat it like a monthly expense. The highest I can get with Sprint is an unlimited data plan for both lines, plus full insurance, plus the $11/monthly Amazon Prime offering for both lines (wtf?), which would come out to $230.48/month. To reach $350, he'd have to be financing more than two devices. \n\nIt isn't possible to get that figure with T-Mobille. Same downpayment issue as above, so I roll that into the monthly cost. Unlimited data for two lines, plus full insurance, plus \"Name ID + Voicemail to Text Bundle\", \"North America Stateside International Talk with mobile\", \"T-Mobile Caller Tunes 5\", \"Rhapsody Premier\", and 'family allowances' for both lines comes out to $311.47/month. \n\nI suppose figures for Sprint and T-Mobile can artificially reach $350 if he's also financing non-phones. I'd also imagine that Sprint offers a bunch of shitty things like \"Caller Tunes\" for $5/month, etc, but they weren't offered when I was setting it up. \n\nAssuming this story is true (which is generous), his friend's decision making is so dysfunctional that it probably indicates some kind of mental health issue rather than him just being a \"PIG\" (which, incidentally, as an acronym seems like a very oddly prepackaged bit of political marketing); as though he's severely depressed and simply not evaluating information. I can't speak to their relationship, but if my friend was overpaying by $100-150/month completely unnecessarily, I would sit down with them and help them, including providing some social support to help them address their underlying mental health issue. I probably wouldn't just blindly pay their ridiculously inflated bills, and I probably wouldn't then complain about them being a \"PIG\" to others while launching into my libertarian stump speech.

{"id":"d35sner","author":"CarlFriedrichGauss","body":"622 isn't too great of a credit score and you might have difficulty getting approved for the cash back card that you really want. I would suggest signing up for Credit Karma. Even though it gives you a \"FAKO\" rather than a FICO, it also has a lot of educational information on how to get and maintain good credit, which is valuable when there is so much misinformation about credit scores out there.\n\nTo be honest, you should probably be focusing on building good credit rather than rewards based on the fact that you say your budget doesn't have much room. You could really lower your credit by having over 30% utilization month after month, which will happen because if it's your first card, you're likely to get a credit limit under $2k. I had a 758 FICO and Citi only gave me a $2000 limit on the Double Cash (my first card) for example. If my balance on the card were over $600, my FICO would quickly be dropping under 700 in no time. This can be mitigated if you pay off your balance in the middle of a statement so that you stay well under 30% or even 10% (recommended) if you *really* want rewards though.\n\nDiscover It is a fairly easy card to get approved for and offers 2% cash back with 10% on certain rotating categories your first year. After the first year it turns into 1%/5% but it's worth using because 6 months out of the year one of the 5% cash back categories is Amazon. The card also gives you a free FICO score, which is calculated with the real FICO algorithm rather than the FAKO that you get from Mint and Credit Karma. The biggest disadvantage of Discover is that yet might not be accepted in every store and restaurant, but it's usually accepted everywhere online.\n\nChase Freedom and Freedom Unlimited are also good ones, but Chase doesn't like short credit histories while Discover is a lot more forgiving.\n\nDefinitely stick with points over cash back if you're just starting though. Points cards often have a minimum amount of points to redeem, and the things you can buy with points are usually fairly expensive and offer poor value for your points. I'm suspicious of the PNC points card because PNC isn't really popular in the rewards card world, informed people only get it because they run out of other cards to get after applying for so many. Also 4 points per dollar might sound like a lot, but that's also a good indicator that PNC points are probably worthless (less than 0.5 cents per point for sure). \n\nGet any card that gives you a FICO score with no annual fee and use it **responsibly** for a couple months until you're in good shape to get a better rewards card. And for the love of everything good, please don't spend more money than you have.","name":"t1_d35sner","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-15 02:19:58","week":19}

It will still improve your credit score.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of credit cards, consider visiting Nerdwallet.com and comparing cashback cards. You're not having any problem with your expenses, and a good cashback card can earn a percentage of every purchase. Use it to buy everything then pay it off monthly.\n\nDo you buy anything on Amazon? An amazon store card will get you 5% back. Look at store cards for other stores you shop at, just be cogent of the terms and pay them off instead of carrying balances.\n\nDo you use budgeting software? You seem to have an absolutely enviable mastery of your finances, so you probably already do. If not, I'd suggest getting YNAB (http://www.youneedabudget.com/). Building budgeting habits now will make budgeting easier when you're rolling in cash. \n\nAs for investing, I'd maximize your pre-tax investments to reduce your taxable liability. It's not quite as important right now, but once you it that massive spike in your income, you'll definitely want to get as much pre-tax taken care of as you can. Definitely put in enough to hit your employer match, at least.\n\nIf you can keep your expenses this low throughout your residency and into your full position, you'll be primed to quickly reach financial independence. I'm a little jealous. In less than 10 years, you'll be able to do whatever you want. Keep working, quit, volunteer. Open up your own free clinic, join Doctors Without Borders... retire to an island.

I hope that it's clear what my point was, and OP doesn't bankrupt their business by following my advice blindly and without thought.\n\n&gt; do you have any evidence at all that an odd number eg 10.23 is psychologically advantageous - because that trick boy usually works in certain circumstances (like b2b) and you rarely see it in major retail. My buyer established research at his big name store (before he worked for us) that it was not a good thing.\n\nA good collection of pricing strategies is http://www.nickkolenda.com/psychological-pricing-strategies/ — they do cite studies.

{"id":"d36dsk8","author":"waisttacos","body":"Yes, leasing or buying on craigslist is probably the best way to go. Buying on eBay or Amazon is a bit risky, especially with instruments. My sister's first violin was bought off of eBay, it was better than most but when we took it down to a luthier, he said many parts, including the bridge, pegs, sound post, tailpiece, weren't very good and we ended up paying money for those to get replaced. This would probably be a similar situation if you were to buy off of craigslist. However if you rented, the instrument would likely be a better one in better shape, and the music store would likely be able to make minor repairs and change strings. Also, many stores have a rent to own program, which can be a good deal. In short, when you're looking for an instrument, quality really matters.

{"id":"d36lduo","author":"jrossetti","body":"Okay, so I am probably going to say a few things you don't want to hear, but they are things that you really need to hear.\n\nFirst, you're the problem.  Not the seller.  You are selling on Amazon, and you clearly haven't spent even the most basic of time reviewing the various policies and such that you agreed to personally when signing up on the site.\n\n\nI'm genuinely curious how you managed to miss this section right here.  \n\n*http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161246*\n\nI mean it tells you specifically that they can even return an item for buyers remorse.  You WILL take 100% of all returns, for **ANY** reason under the sun for 30 days.  They can tell you that their boyfriend broke up with them as a reason they want to return it and you are absolutely 100% required to accept it.\n\nSecond, Amazon literally tells you that you're return policy has to at least equal their return policy.  You can go above and beyond, but you do not have a choice as to the minimum requirements.  \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=15015721\n\nBasically you fucked up.  You told a customer you would not accept their return because you got greedy and for whatever reason thought returns were contingent on whatever you wanted.\n\nWrong.  You WILL follow amazons rules, you WILL accept returns, or you WILL be kicked off and suspended with money locked up for a few weeks while you're under investigation.  \n\nMy advice to you is to stop selling for a bit.  Read up on the rules you agreed to follow. Make sure you are following all policies and procedures that Amazon requires so you don't get your account suspended. \n\nYou're going to lose the A to Z claim, and that's going to ding your account and quite likely result in a policy violation. Even if they dont sack you with that, there is a paper trail of you losing an A to Z claim for not following the established return policy rules that you violated.\n\"\nI think the worst part of this whole post is you did not once take any responsibility for what you did and tried to blame a customer who was well within their rights to return that item for literally, any reason, for 30 days.  \n\nThis is not for lazy people, this is not for get rich quick people, and it's certainly not for people who haven't been bothered to read the basics.  You need to put a little more effort into your business or this is just the first of many frustrations you are going to experience on this journey.\n\n","name":"t1_d36lduo","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-15 21:02:17","week":19}

These instruments generally do not come set up, and are of very poor quality.\nI'm not sure of your daughter's age, but violins come in fractional sizes. It is generally a better deal to locate a store with rent-to-own instruments. For instance, go to a Music &amp; Arts, which is national so you could start renting now and just transfer to a different store. They offer free up-sizing and exchanges, and all of the money you put to rent goes toward purchasing a more professional, 4/4 violin down the road. \nThese places also sell their used rental instruments at super low prices for the quality. So that's something to consider too.  \nI only suggest them because I don't know your area. Definitely check out your local mom and pop, if you've got one! \n\nOtherwise, ask other parents!

{"id":"d36pdqk","author":"roebuck85","body":"I can't say that you're wrong, what works for you works for you. What works for me works for me, and what works for OP works for OP... But to put a flipper down because you don't see potential where they do is silly, wouldn't it be better to consider looking into their strategy and possibly learning something new, whether you agree with it or not?\n\nOne thing that's great about flipping is that generally everybody looks for different things. I've seen book sales with 3 people scanning and everyone came away with tons of books that they were happy with. Sometimes a book would be scanned and put back only for another scanner to come along and decide it was worth a purchase. Some people only want to sell Very Good condition items, some only items that sell for $15+, some buy anything they can make just $1 on.\n\nSome people want to maximize the value they get for their time so they only want $15 or $20 an hour, some people have tons of time and the $4 or $5 an hour they make is better than sitting home watching tv for nothing. For some this is a full time job that pays all the bills, for others it's just a hobby and their happiness comes not from the money but the thrill of buying something and reselling for more, whether it's 10% more or 1000.\n\nPersonally, I rarely look at clothes and kitchen items, not because I think they won't sell, but because I spend my time doing other things, things I know more about. I do like learning though and seeing what other people do. Because of this sub I now tend to look at other things when I have time than I normally would have. If I thought everybody else was wrong I'd still be only doing my original niche on ebay but because of what I've learned I now do books and clearance RA items on Amazon and bring in a few hundred dollars more a month than I used to.","name":"t1_d36pdqk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-15 22:51:23","week":19}

{"id":"d36qm1j","author":"WaffleBattle","body":"I'm no expert but I get the local paper and go through Amazon. I prioritize which sales seem large and set a route to hit as many as I can as fast as I can. Around here people normally start at 8. I have food and the route in my car by 745 heading over to the first on my route. Then goodwill/thrift stores after. Hope this helps.

{"id":"d36r1fu","author":"imperialleather","body":"Hey  I dunno of this is any use to you.  But I flip from  Ireland.  Similar  to your  own experience, Craigslist and thrift  shops  are shockingly  bad here too.  Local listings and sites   are where I score most of my Amazon stock.  \n\nIn the beginning  you'll  find you'll  spend most of your time researching.  It's hard to get the info such as barcode or a clear picture of the model number from the local websites.\n\nI find the local listers take bad photographs and don't  like the idea of someone  buying  to sell on, so I make up a story per item. \n\nSo yes in the short term until you find your feet and a good idea of products that sell for you, you are looking at lots of research  and spare time.","name":"t1_d36r1fu","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-15 23:35:44","week":19}

{"id":"d36robl","author":"mike1234567654321","body":"I like the play, I think amzn is due for a pull back as well. I sold my shares last week, for close to 20% gain in a few weeks. There has been insider selling to give weight to the bearish argument as well. My only concern is that continued weakness in brick and motor retail continues to pump up amzn as their loss is amzn's gain. I'm not going to short amzn but I'd be interested in buying shares back sub $700.
