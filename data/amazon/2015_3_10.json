today](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/compare-credit-card-offers\/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3561432011), and thought some of you might be interested. I would say none of them are amazing, but if you're already in the market for one of these cards, it may be worth checking out.  \n  \n* Discover It - $100 amazon GC bonus  \n* Discover It for Students - $50 amazon GC bonus  \n* Citi TY Preferred - $150 amazon GC bonus  \n* Handful of CU cards with $50 amazon GC bonus  \n  \nSome of the cards listed seem to have the same signup bonus as the CC companies' website, but from a cursory check I didn't see any signup bonuses currently listed for Discover. The citi website lists 20k TY points for 1.5k minimum spend, Amazon lists $150 GC for 1k minimum spend, so that's kind of a toss up.  \n  \nHopefully this helps someone out :)\n\n  \n","3":"Maybe it's the optimist in me that takes the guys selling on Day 1 for aspiration but I'm really disappointed in how it has turned out so far.\nI'll start with ebay. A lot of collectibles are sold there still even after how many people jumped to Amazon.\n\n Using the \"Sold Listings\" I check my product and see that everyday people are paying the same price to buy from Pakistan\/whatever even though I offer the same price and shipping 2-5 days First Class USPS.\n\nI tried changing my description and added more pictures and even offer more pieces of the product but nothing is happening.

If you are outside the US\/Canada or other highly rich in apps countries consider using [this](http:\/\/wiki.hidemyass.com\/IPad_IPhone_ITouch)\n\nWith this you will be able to change the IP location on your phone to trick the app\/site into thinking you're from a different country (i.e United States) so you are offered all of the high paying apps!\n\n- All sites have a referral program in one way or another - if you have multiple devices simply refer yourself to your second device so you can earn the referral credit for everything downloaded from the second device (or third, fourth...) DO NOT PAY OUT TO SAME PAYPAL ACCOUNT ON DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS!\n- On some sites (such as FusionCash) there is no limit to how many times you can download an app and receive credit. In this case you can simply remove the app from a device, create a new iOS or Android account and download again for credit. (And rinse and repeat infinite amount of times!)\n- If you do not have access to multiple devices, consider using emulators. A simple to use iOS one can be found [here](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/IDEs\/Conceptual\/iOS_Simulator_Guide\/GettingStartedwithiOSStimulator\/GettingStartedwithiOSStimulator.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40012848-CH5-SW1) (MAC)\n\n\nBy combining emulators with a site like FusionCash with unlimited downloads or FeaturePoints\/Appsdown with infinite accounts your rewards are virtually endless. The amount that you make is entirely up to how much time you want to invest into doing it.\n\nAs an example when I started out I had 4 devices and in a single day using 4 Apple accounts (they were all iOS devices) and the three sites listed below I earned $82.00. The only downside is that I had to cash some of it out as Amazon cards or other to avoid suspicion.\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n**HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET CREDIT!**\nA lot of times I noticed I was not getting credit because I did not realize what was being done to actual credit me so here are some tips:\n\n- You must download and OPEN the app on ALL sites in order to get credit\n- Some sites require the users to keep the app open for ~30 seconds or finish the tutorials so read the requirements of each app!\n- Do not switch networks! Be sure that if you DOWNLOAD the app through Wi-Fi you stay on that Wi-Fi to open\/play the app.\n- Do not delete the app until you are credited! Some apps can take up to a day to credit as the confirmation needs to come from the game developer. Do not remove the app from your phone until you receive credit or else you run the risk of not getting credit for the game ever.\n- If downloading on multiple devices to gain double credit or use multiple sites: use a separate Apple or Android account (as well as gamecenter) so it can not link your two devices together.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n**AND NOW FOR THE ACTUAL SITES\/APPS :)**\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n1. **FusionCash** - **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/fca.sh\/1n9ix)** or [non-ref](http:\/\/www.fusioncash.net\/) \n\n\n**Details:**\n\n- $5.00 signup bonus for new users\n- Get paid $0.50 per download and there is no limit to how much you can earn\n- There are approximately 10-20 apps each day and new ones are offered each day for you \n- Available for both iPhone and Android\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Only open to US and Canadian residents\n- Must be over 18 or have parental permission\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Payment is only made via Verified Paypal\n- Minimum of $25.00 per payout request ($15.00 of which is earned and not bonuses from referrals and such)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n2. **Appsdown**- **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/apd.me\/YrTfg) unique code is YrTfg during signup** or [non-ref](https:\/\/appdown.me\/) \n\n**Details:**\n\n- Available on both iPhone and Android\n- Approximately 30 apps to download when you first register\n- New\/different apps each day so be sure to check back every day for new apps\n- Pays from $0.05 - $1.00 per app downloaded\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Must be over 13 years old\n- Open worldwide!\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Payments are made as little as $2.00\n- Huge variety of payout options: Paypal, eBay, Amazon, restaurants, electronics, microsoft points, paid app downloads...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n3. **Featurepoints** - **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/featu.re\/5YASEH) unique code is 5YASEH during signup** or [non-ref](http:\/\/featurepoints.com\/web\/) \n\n**Details:**\n\n- 50 point bonus when signing up with a referral code (mine is 5YASEH) :D\n- Available on both iPhone and Android\n- Downloads and nice and simple app on your phone which shows all the available apps, rewards, info...\n- New\/different apps each day so be sure to check back every day for new apps\n- Pays from $0.05 - $1.50 per app downloaded\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Must be over 13 years old\n- Open worldwide!\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Tons of different reward options starting at only 200 points (one download) which is a paid app download!\n- Never have to pay for apps again\n- Also offers Paypal, Xbox, PSN, Amazon, restaurant cards, electronics, Steam and so on\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nI hope this information has helped out - please feel free to ask me any questions you might have!","27":"How do I look up Amazon sales rankings","28":"Looking to buy UK Amazon GC for 75%.

I mean no inventory, and you paying for the wholesale item not until it's purchased sounds great and risk free, but the whole nexus law that differs from state to state has made the idea more cringing and frustrating than I chose to put the effort toward learning in. Say I start up an eBay store. Okay, so obviously if I live in Michigan and sell to someone in Michigan, I must charge the customer tax, and if they live elsewhere I do not. However if I use a third party  company (let's say Amazon) to ship the item for me to a customer in another state and Amazon has a distribution center in that state, that could give me nexus depending on the state and I would have to charge the customer the appropriate tax. Some states say it's the drop shippers responsibility, where as some say it's the retailers, and some consider the relAtionship between the two not nexus related. Can anyone shed some insight on this? My accountant said to not charge my customers tax and just pay tax on what the wholesale item costs, but that kind of sounds like an audit risk to me with how money hungry and broke the states are. Am I going to need to apply for a sales tax license in 48 different states or is this just a hassle that's not worth it. And if to add icing on the cake, most states are destination sales tax states, which means to calculate tax appropriately would be a full time job in itself.

I mean no inventory, and you paying for the wholesale item not until it's purchased sounds great and risk free, but the whole nexus law that differs from state to state has made the idea more cringing and frustrating than I chose to put the effort toward learning in. Say I start up an eBay store. Okay, so obviously if I live in Michigan and sell to someone in Michigan, I must charge the customer tax, and if they live elsewhere I do not. However if I use a third party company (let's say Amazon) to ship the item for me to a customer in another state and Amazon has a distribution center in that state, that could give me nexus depending on the state and I would have to charge the customer the appropriate tax. Some states say it's the drop shippers responsibility, where as some say it's the retailers, and some consider the relAtionship between the two not nexus related. Can anyone shed some insight on this? My accountant said to not charge my customers tax and just pay tax on what the wholesale item costs, but that kind of sounds like an audit risk to me with how money hungry and broke the states are. Am I going to need to apply for a sales tax license in 48 different states or is this just a hassle that's not worth it. And if to add icing on the cake, most states are destination sales tax states, which means to calculate tax appropriately would be a full time job in itself.

I am looking to get serious about budgeting, but I want to request some advice first about how my current spending levels look. Thank you in advance for your comments. \n\nAbout me: I live in Washington, DC (absurdly high cost of living compared to where I come from). Salary is $78k but I have some promotion potential within the next 5 years. I have a side job that averages between $25-30 per hour depending on tips - I like the income, but I have considered quitting to have more free time and eliminate some stress from my life. My SO and I are both planning to advance our careers here for the next 3-5 years and then move to somewhere cheaper.\n\nI split rent, groceries, etc down the middle with the SO. \n\nI used Mint to categorize all of my spending for the month of February.\n\n**Assets**\n\n* $16,750 cash (checking\/savings). Hoarding cash for a house down payment within the next couple years.\n* $16,000 TSP (401k)\n* $11,250 Roth IRA (mostly filled up when I was in grad school. I am not currently contributing)\n* $650 HSA\n\n**Liabilities**\n\nI pay off my credit card every month, so this is just revolving debt. I churn for some easy cash returns but don't bother with manufactured spending or anything extreme so the total balances are usually under $2500 at any given time.\n\nDone paying down student loan debt (!).\n\n**February Income:** $5351\n\n* $2338 paychecks\n* $820 side job\n* $1000 savings allotment (aka my house down payment fund, this is direct-deposited from my paycheck so it never even hits my checking account)\n* $1028 TSP (401k) contribution (includes 5% matching, thanks Obama)\n* $165 Misc - cash back rewards, interest, selling stuff on Craigslist\/Amazon\n\n\n**February spending:** $2725\n\n**House**\n\n* $785 rent\n\n* $9 household supplies (toilet paper, cleaning supplies)\n\n**Health**\n\n* $180 gym - yes, it's a Crossfit gym. I spend 5+ hours per week there and love it. When I have space inside my house, I am planning to build a garage gym of my own. I have a small basement storage space that's mostly empty in my current apartment setup and have definitely contemplated buying a cheap weight set from Walmart and just lifting down there, although I'm sure it would violate my lease.\n\n* $118 for an urgent care visit. I have been paying doctor's fees out of pocket and saving up money in my HSA instead. I need a $5k minimum balance before I can invest HSA funds.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe SO and I share a car (1999 Toyota with 80k miles, which we are hoping to drive into the ground), but I supplement it with Car2Go rides (SmartCar sharing program) if we both need a car at the same time. My job pays for my normal metro commute, so I only pay for transit rides on the weekends. We usually take Metro or the bus if we're going out on weekends and then ride an Uber back. \n\n* $70 Uber (this is pretty high.

In short, we like good food and everything's expensive here. \n\nWe have cut down our restaurant spending pretty substantially over the past few months, but the compromise was that we wouldn't skimp on buying good ingredients. Our groceries are definitely high, but we also a high-quality diet with tons of protein and fresh organic vegetables and gourmet ice cream (you get the picture). I used to survive on about $30\/week right out of college, so I know it can be done -- I just don't mind the lifestyle creep in this category very much.\n\nI've also cut down on drinking at bars, but still want to buy fancy beer and liquor to drink at home -- the only exception is happy hours, which are important for networking in DC, so I am still going to 1-2 per month but trying to keep it cheap. \n\n* $94 beer and liquor (major stocking trip to Maryland liquor store)\n* $120 restaurants\n* $44 take-out\/delivery\n* $72 coffee shops, happy hours, food trucks\n* $85 fast food (includes anything from the cafeteria at work)\n* $415 groceries\n* $160 prepared foods (anytime I grab a sandwich or lunch from the hot bar in a grocery store)\n","77":"I currently have 3 $5 Amazon GC's that I am trading. \n\nRep:\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2tfj2i\/ubigmacwin_gcx_rep_profile\/","78":"Local Amazon sale","79":"[H] $50 Newegg Gift Card [W] Steam\/Amazon $50 Gift Card","80":"You all probably know this.

For example selling an ad that says Tony Hawk Skateboard + game and saying that one part or the other is missing.\n\nPeople selling board games missing pieces.\n\npeople selling video games in collectible condition as disk only.  \n\nAnd my favorite, putting the defect in the comment section that Amazon buyers aren't even required to read and doesn't factor into listing your item.  \n\n\nThese are all things that I have now realize are kind of rampant in many areas, but yet are against Amazon terms of use.  I used to ignore this.  They also tend to crowd the list for cheapest items, sometimes pushing the first legitimate item matching product description 5-10 people down.  \n\nNow, I have been fighting back.  I now go through and I report each, and every single violation.  I have given serious thought to buying from and opening up A to Z claims and then reselling their item that I'll get to keep but I have refrained from that temptation. Edit:  (Seriously, I think about this in the same way you want to punch someone for being rude to a waitress or cashier for no reason.  So many people stuck on this like I am doing it myself.  It's a discussion post, wanted to see where people lie.  Nothing more. Not looking for validation or justification for something I want to do.  I don't, I'm simply curious)\n\nI had one item that I reported EVERY buyer who priced below me as they were all missing parts or incorrectly graded and have seen a nice spike in sales in the places I have done that, including a better price as now my item is listed at or much closer to the lowest price on the category.\n\nI was just wondering how many people actually take the time to report sellers like this.  Ive included it as a best practice on all of my listings that I check and verify when I post new items.   It never fails that in a day or three I start seeing them drop off like flies.  I have yet to confirm an account has been shut down, and that is not my goal.  I used to just message sellers and have gotten some nasty mails so I quit doing that.  \n\nI believe that if I have a set of rules to follow, that everyone else should too and I am not above turning them in.  Do you?  Besides, why should I have to compete against someone not selling the right item? \n\nThoughts on buying items you see that are violating policy and then filing a claim for a policy violation?  Would any of you do that?  Why or why not?  I gotta be honest, it's been super tempting because you can only prey on someone who has done something wrong, but as a seller I feel for people and realize it could be an honest mistake.  But to be fair, they should have read it ahead of time.  \n\nIronic enough, one of my 5 businesses is turning in businesses for pirating Boxing and UFC pay per views, and that's the same type of thing.

Over the course of almost 3 years I successfully bought 2 businesses, started 3 and failed\/closed 4 of them - and then started a long process to get back into the workforce and tried to get back to the wage I had made before taking the leap.  I backburnered the one business that I had left and didn\u2019t think about it for almost 3 years.\n\nI don\u2019t regret the attempt and I certainly don\u2019t discount the lessons I learned.  I do however regret that I hadn\u2019t learned more about affiliate marketing while I was running my own show.  I certainly would have been in a different place if I had known even a little bit about it.  The one business that\u2019s still around had a pretty robust website that was focused in the fitness \u201cniche\u201d.  At the time that I stopped working on my business we peaked at around 30K pageviews for the month (early 2012) but were only generating about $600\/month in advertising revenue!  Ahhh, hindsight!  I was trying to go door-to-door and get advertisers to buy ads - wow, that was hard.\n\nFast forward to early 2015, I have a decent job (at a desk all day), this site still humming at 5K pageviews\/month with almost ZERO thought given to it for almost 3 years, I own about 20 additional domain names and a little too much time on my hands.  I start digging into Reddit and I stumble upon a few case studies talking about affiliate websites.  Suddenly it hits me - I could do that!  So, that\u2019s where this case study starts\u2026 with me trying to resurrect my site and turn it into something that generates a small stream of money.\n\nBut, I have a hard time focusing my attention and efforts so my one site idea suddenly turned into 3 sites to test 3 different approaches.  I have an existing Fitness related site, a new Sports site and a new Outdoor site (we\u2019ll creatively call them the FitnessSite, SportSite and OutdoorSite during this case study).  I\u2019m going to test building an authority site, a comparison\/review site and a pure Amazon affiliate site and see how it goes.  You\u2019ll get to come along for the ride.\n\nAside from knowing how to work on a WordPress site a little bit, I don\u2019t really know much about any of this stuff.  I don\u2019t even really know how much work is required but I do know that others have done it so I can do it too.  Don\u2019t expect me to \u201cpreach knowledge &amp; authority\u201d since I intentionally started this with ZERO knowledge - I thought it would make for a more realistic case study.  Also, next month I will create a very basic blog where I will post more details about what I\u2019m doing and the themes, plugins, add-ons and affiliate networks I\u2019ll be using.  I\u2019ll provide that link when it\u2019s up and going.\n\nEDIT:  A few years ago I wanted to write a book about failure.  So I bought the domain name [99Fails.com](http:\/\/99fails.com\/).  I think I'll just use that domain for my basic blog to document this case study.  Feel free to give it a visit.\n\nAnd finally, don\u2019t ask me to tell you the names of my sites nor my exact niches, I don\u2019t want to skew the results.  I will reveal them in a few months after they get going.\n\n****\n**Goal:**\nThe overall goal for doing this was just to see if I could do it.  My monetary goal is to see if I can get 3 sites that could each generate $1000 in affiliate income per month by January 31st, 2016 (seems so far away).  Hope and goals are different\u2026 I hope I make 3X that amount within a year, but my goal is low since I\u2019m a bit sceptical.  \n\n**Budget:**\nMy budget for this whole year is $500 out of pocket.  After each site starts generating its own flow of money, I can use up to $1000\/site to fund growth but until that time my budget is only $500 total.  I don\u2019t count my time in my expenses.\n\n****\n\n**Starting STATS:**\n\nCategory     | FitnessSite | SportSite  | OutdoorSite\n---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------\nAge| purchased in 2009 | purchased in 2009 | purchased in 2010\nSubdomains | 7 | 0 | 1\nPages | 140 | 3 | 6\nPosts | 3000+ | 2 | 10\nCategories | 40 | 10 | 50\nTraffic | avg 5000 pv\/month in 2014 | 0 pv | avg 100 pv\/month in 2014\nLast Update | 4 posts in 2014 | 0 | last update 2011\nMoney | $30\/mo Google Ads | 0 | $5\/mo Google Ads\n\n\n****\n**RESULTS**\n****\n\nFebruary Results (screenshots at the very bottom):  This month\u2019s results are pretty lackluster and boring.  A lot of time was spent just doing research and laying the foundation.  I\u2019ve outlined how I spent my time on each site below.\n\n**FitnessSite Update:**\n\nThis month I broke the site!  I had originally used this site for local news &amp; information so each subdomain was specific to a region.  Each one had it\u2019s own WP instance and, in some cases, duplicated content.  I had to get rid of those so I merged all the content and deleted all the subdomains &amp; consolidated.  This made me take a huge hit in traffic.  My webmaster tools on Google now show that I have 1400 404! error pages.  This is concerning since it also shows that I have 229 external backlinks - so I fixed the main ones and redirected the rest as best I could.  I also found an internal link checking tool (Broken Link Checker by Janis Elsts) and it showed that I had over 2200 [Broken Links!](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9UrTZNN.png)  I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever fix all of them but at least this way they are identified.  This is going to be a long process to rebuild but I knew that coming in since the whole strategy will pivot.  But at least I have some quality content and a base of users\/traffic that I can start to regrow.\n\n**SportSite Update:**\n\nStarting from scratch was fun!  It took a lot of time to plan and build the framework but I think once this gets going it will be really fun to write creative, targeted, and SEO rich content.  I will spend a lot of time on this site since it\u2019s truly in a niche I love already and generating content and traffic should be natural since I live in this world.  I had originally planned on this being a small and very targeted niche site for just a couple products but I soon found that my outline was at 4 pages.  In order to cull the list I decided that I could only focus on the top 3 subjects and the rest had to go to a \u201csomeday maybe\u201d list that I\u2019ll get to later.  Right now I\u2019ll only optimize and focus on those 3 subjects within the niche until the site is in the very top for that category - and hopefully that will generate a greater return than trying to focus on 15 very light topics.\n\n**OutdoorSite Update:**\n\nBuilt the structure &amp; let it simmer.  This is in a pretty saturated niche already and I didn\u2019t quite know how to position this site in the niche.  I\u2019m still thinking through it so I just built the structure and added a couple posts - now I\u2019ll just let it sit for a couple of months while I decide exactly what I want to focus on.  It\u2019s going to be the bastard child until mid summer probably.  This site is in a niche that I\u2019m very curious about but I don\u2019t really have the time to dedicate to it.  I\u2019ve always wanted to learn more about it so I\u2019m leaning toward making this site an \u201cintro to the niche\u201d site since it will grow and develop as I do.  I\u2019m still not sure.  This will also be my Amazon Affiliate site, which is probably the easier site to build, so I have to take that into account while building my strategy.\n\n**Site Breakdown for Month**\n\n\nCategory             | FitnessSite | SportSite  | OutdoorSite\n---------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------\nTotal Time Spent| 21 | 38 | 16\nSubdomains| 0 | 0 | 0\nPages| 75 | 53 | 22\nPosts| 2200 | 6 | 11\nAffiliate Links\/Ads| 17 | 3 | 7\nTraffic| 936 pv (90% new) | 1429 pv (10% new) | 265 pv (77% new)\nMoney| $28 Google | $0  | $3 Google\n\n\n****\n\n**February Commentary &amp; Details:** This past month was spent doing a lot of keyword research on each niche to find the exact focus for each site.  For the purpose of my case study, I\u2019m not going to get into the details on how I chose my keywords or my niches on Reddit.  There are plenty of great case studies out there that talk about researching keywords\/niches \/u\/HumbleSalesman has a pretty good one.  There are also fantastic resources out there on the web - just Google (or DDG) it.  I have provided some \u201creal life\u201d searches that I did this month below. \n\nI don\u2019t count the full price of my hosting since I get that reimbursed from another venture I have.  I also only count the domain spend if I have to actually renew the domain - that\u2019s not due for another couple months.\n\nThis month I also spent a lot of time researching the best structure for the 3 sites and spent a TON of time working on the outline for the menu structure.  I\u2019m a visual person so I set about outlining my sites in nested outlines.  So I would have the main page, sub pages and categories.  I would also put a bullet point for POSTS and then under that I would put any ideas I had for post titles and supporting keyword targets.\n\nThis helped me to sort out the structure and flow before adding my first page.  Obviously I had names for each of these items and the list ended up being 4 pages for the SportSite.  Once it was outlined then I just started making the pages &amp; categories and crossing them off the list.  This way when I started filling in each page with content I could easily create my internal links as I went without having to stop to create that page.  I called this my site foundation &amp; framework.\n\nTime Spend:\n\n* Keyword Research - 15 hours\n* Outlining site structures - 3 hours\n* Strategy - 9 hours\n* Building Site Structure - 31 hours\n* Researching Niche - 9 hours\n* Setting up social media - 3 hours\n* Writing Content - 5 hours\n* Total Time Spend - 75 hours\n\nMoney Spend:\n\n* Theme - $75\n* Unlimited Use Plugins: $300\n* Domains - $0 this month\n* Hosting - $13 this month\n* Total $ Spend - $388\n\n**February Net Income: -$357 - it\u2019s going to be red for awhile I think**\n\n**** \n**FINAL THOUGHTS FOR THE MONTH**\n****\n\nThe one main thing I learned this month is that it\u2019s not easy work.  Well, it is actually pretty easy work compared to being an electrician in winter or a heart surgeon\u2026 but overall it\u2019s *very* time consuming and requires a lot of mental power.  I was tired after this month.  I also realized after the 3rd week of research that there probably isn\u2019t one *BEST WAY* to do things - everyone has their own opinions and they all counter each other - if you\u2019re looking for the answer it\u2019s not going to come - there just isn\u2019t one answer to any of this.  The best *SOLUTION* is to just get going and see how it goes otherwise you will suffer \u201cAnalysis Paralysis\u201d.\n\nI also learned that I can\u2019t spend this much time in March or I might just lose my job!\n\n**New Skills Acquired, Websites Used &amp; Tools Found:**\n\n* Google - I Googled everything!!  Here are some of the actual things I Googled this past month: \u201cBest Affiliate Marketing Networks\u201d, \u201cPopular WordPress Popup Plugins\u201d, \u201cBest Plugin for Affiliate Marketers Wordpress\u201d, \u201cFind Keywords Ranked by Competitor Website\u201d, \u201cBest Review Plugin for WordPress\u201d, \u201cFind Traffic Stats for Site Free\u201d, and \u201cAffiliate Marketing Case Studies\u201d.  Plus many more.  As you can imagine the list was huge.  I could write a whole post just full of my keyword searches.  Another thing I did notice is that a lot of my searches returned the same information so I researched an alternative search engine and found DuckDuckGo\u2026  \n\n* DuckDuckGo - It\u2019s an alternative search engine to Google - it doesn\u2019t track your history so the results it returns (in theory) are completely unbiased.  This was nice when I was doing keyword research as well as other searches.  I felt like my results were more targeted around the specific keywords and not around the ads, my history or whatever else Google thought I would like to see.  I found a lot of high quality resources on page one of DDG that were on page 27 of my Google searches so I would have never found them otherwise.\n\n* Reddit - I think this goes without saying.  A few searches on the different subreddits and you will spend a ton of time reading about everything you should do, didn\u2019t know you wanted to do, and didn\u2019t know even existed.  However I found that I was spending too much time on Reddit last month so I gave it up for Lent - I\u2019m not Catholic so I don\u2019t know how long my forced fast was supposed to be but those 2 weeks without the \u201cReddit Temptation\u201d were very productive.\n\n* [Quora](www.quora.com) - similar to Reddit but it\u2019s not anonymous so you have to limit how much you ask\/share if you want to protect your niche and your ideas.  But, it\u2019s nice for getting answers from actual \u201cknown\u201d experts.  That\u2019s the one drawback to Reddit - someone on here that claims to be an authority could actually just be some guy living in his mom\u2019s basement regurgitating information found on the internet.\n\n* [NicheHacks](www.nichehacks.com) - This site was the result of my \u201caffiliate marketing case study\u201d search.  I found his information to be very useful and helpful while building all aspects of my sites.  There\u2019s a lot to be learned on his site.\n\n* [Backlinko](www.backlinko.com) - Equally informative, Backlinko really helps you dive into how to gain traffic and increase your site\u2019s visibility to search engines.  Backlinko (as the name implies) provides ideas for ways that you can get your site noticed by experts and generate quality backlinks which are legitimate and will help you site\u2019s authority.\n\n* [Spyfu](www.spyfu.com) - This was the result of a Quora search on how to research the traffic of your competition.  I found this site to be very useful and I might even consider paying for a membership after I get going.  I think it could make up it\u2019s value pretty quickly.\n\n* [Alexa](www.alexa.com) - I used Alexa to help me target my niche by seeing which sites are ranking well and getting traffic.  I used this exclusively until I found spyfu, now I use it in conjunction with spyfu.\n\n**Useful Tips:**\n\n* Use an Outline to help you flesh out the menu structure, post ideas &amp; keywords\n* All Traffic is not the same - I\u2019m building for CONVERTING traffic (email subscriptions, return visits and lots of clicks) and not just hit &amp; run traffic.\n* Go with the masses - sometimes it costs money but it could be worth it.  I leaned toward the plugins, themes and information that had the highest downloads, recommendations or traffic.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* Stop daydreaming, researching and philosophizing about your idea and get started - sometimes a forced fast is required.\n* Having the mindset of an Entrepreneur is both a blessing and a curse - focus dammit!\n* The long term is always easy to say but hard to live.  It\u2019s a slow and painful process.\n\n**Images:**\nHere are some traffic screenshots (you can see that I worked on the FitnessSite at the beginning of the month, the OutdoorSite in the middle of the month and the SportSite at the end of the month by the spikes)\n\n\n* [FitnessSite](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/j5XJ8ag.png)\n* [OutdoorSite](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AlU9VXO.png)\n* [SportSite](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pff4PGz.png)\n\n\nHope you enjoyed the summary.  Next month I hope it\u2019s shorter and full of more good news and results.  Please ask any questions below and I\u2019ll try and answer them.\n\nEDIT:\n\n[See the month 2 update here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/32ly4f\/3_site_affiliate_marketing_case_study_month_2\/)\n","98":"[H] Amazon.co.uk 15GBP and 19 GBP [W] PayPal","99":"[H] Amazon GCS UK [W] Paypal","100":"New sign up page with all the info:\nhttp:\/\/www.hitpredictor.com\/join\/vip\/\n\nRegular site:\nwww.HitPredictor.com\n\nmy referral code:\nhttp:\/\/www.hitpredictor.com\/referral\/521291\n\n$5 Amazon e-cards for qualifying members.

Excited to be sharing this information I have acquired. So here goes. I, like many of you here have been lurking for quite some time now. I've tried several different models to start my own eCommerce store, but they have all failed. \n\nAfter much frustration last August, I decided to call it quits. I swore off this nonsense and stopped reading posts. I would see them pop up in my front page daily, but I would look at them with disgust. Mostly because I thought I don't have what it takes to be an entrepreneur. But this whole time I still had the itch. The itch to do my own thing. To start my own brand, build my own company. Be my own boss and be independent of the 9-5 (I currently hold a big kid job in the big kid world).\n\nSo I started reading again. Reading post after post. And it clicked one day. I found an idea I really liked and wanted to test it. But I didn't really know how. So I read [this post](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/2xhm46\/entrepreneurs_of_reddit_how_do_you_validate_your\/) about making a landing page and buying some facebook ads. And thats what I did and here are the steps I took and the data I've gathered.\n\n1.  I first created a landing page.\n2. I then created a Facebook ad.\n3. After that, I set the demographics and how much I was willing to spend ($25 a day for 3 days).\n4. Then I waited.\n\nSo now here is the date I have collected:\n\n\n\nPlacement | Reach | Impressions | Clicks | Click Through Rate | Amount Spent | Cost($)\/1,000 Impressions | Cost($)\/1,000 People Reached | Cost Per Click | Actions \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nNewsfeed Desktop | 55 | 55 | 0 | 0 | 0.62 | 11.27 | 11.27 | 0 | 0  \nNewsfeed Mobile | 5829 |5908 |169 | 2.86 | 72.46 | 12.26 | 12.43 | 0.428 | 132  \nRight Column Desktop | 20 | 31 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.01 | 0.32 | 0.5 | 0 | 0 \nRight Column Ads Desktop Homepage | 10 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.02 | 1.67 | 2 | 0 | 0 \n\n\nSo what I can take away from this? Well, there certainly seems to be *some* demand for the idea. I paid on average around $0.50 per click. Did it translate well on my webpage? Well, not so much. I created a very half-assed, lazy website just to get people there (my ad however was made very professionally). And from what research I do know is that you, on average, can see about a 1-2% conversion rate with traffic to your webpage. So doing the math, I would lose money in the long run running daily adds if my conversion rate stuck at 1%. But that doesn't mean I don't want to go through with my idea. I actually do want to give this a shot. There is only one brand I can find by google search that is even ranking (4\/10 is pretty lousy if you ask me) and I think I can beat them in the long run. Plus, I have Amazon on my side to sell this product as well. \n\nSo I'm going to be outsourcing a manufacturer this week from China and having it created. Once I have done that and have my website in much better working order with product images and such, I'll gladly share that information here with you guys as well. And just so you all know, I don't think too many of us here are the target demographic (18-65 y.o. females in fashion and beauty) I am looking for. So don't think I'll be spamming you guys to buy my product. \n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or comments, please ask away. Thanks for all your help with awesome posts through the years. I hope I'm contributing!\n\n\nEdit: I've messed up some figures on the table.

The policy changes (we already had high deductibles) and multi-policy discounts will save us about $425 every six months.\n\n* Changed my cell phone plan. I wasn\u2019t using all the data every month anyway. \n\n* Called on credit cards with fees (for airline miles) and asked them to waive the annual fee. I'm guessing this will only work once in a while.\n\n* Sold quite a few things on ebay that were in the garage or my closet being unused. I collected a ton of stuff while I was single and, while it made the move to the new house, it never quite made it out of the boxes in the garage. Plus, it feels good to minimize and de-clutter.\n\n* Switched my husband\u2019s bank. We kept his account from before we were married because he already had his direct deposit set up and his debit card, etc. However, his bank got bought out by another one about 4 months ago and started charging for checking. One of our rules is \u2013 don\u2019t allow ourselves to be charged for using our own money. No ATM fees. Free checking and savings accounts. \n\n* I\u2019ve been in a book club for years and have always bought the books new every month from Amazon. (Prime shipping allowed it to arrive in 2 days, so I could have the entire month to read and didn\u2019t even have to go anywhere. I was lazy). They were usually hardbacks, so that added up. Now I go to the local used book store (where I gave quite a few old books I know I won\u2019t read again, so I have some credit), or if they don\u2019t have it \u2013 I order a used one online and be patient.\n\n* Cooking and leftovers. It\u2019s rather amazing how much difference planning meals and eating leftovers instead of eating out regularly makes. I still go to lunch once a week with friends to get out of the office, but the other 4 days is simply a meal from a previous evening. And leftovers for dinner on nights we work late is faster and cheaper than waiting for pizza, and just as relaxing. \n\n* Being aware of how I drive. I have some speeding tickets from 3 years ago *still* affecting my insurance rates. I\u2019m very aware that getting where I want to go 5 minutes earlier isn\u2019t going to be worth the extra money of the ticket, the insurance, and the wasted fuel. Not to mention my peace of mind at leaving a few minutes earlier and knowing I will still be on time and not in a hurry or stressed.\n\nWhat are some of your tips you\u2019ve had experience with?","132":"[H] 3 American Amazon gift codes (10$ each) [W] Canadian Amazon gift codes","133":"I know there are people here who aren't:\n\na) Marketing a blog\n\nb) Reselling on Amazon\n\nc) Selling business advice\n\nSo what do you do?\n\nEdit: My faith is completely restored.

Would this cause any issues?\n\n* I pay off my credit card every month (automatically) without trouble. I have rather large savings relative to the meager amounts I spend each month.\n\n* I purchase things on Amazon only once in a blue moon and this card would only be used for those purchases. I might consider using it for other non-internet purchases if the rewards are greater than those of my current card.\n\nReasons to get it:\n\n* I could save a nice amount on a purchase for signing up.\n\n* It has pretty nice rewards.\n\n* It would increase my overall credit limit.\n\n* As far as I can tell, if I pay off the full balance each payment period, I would incur no fees.\n\nThis question can be extended to all store cards: why shouldn't I get their credit card if I can easily pay it off the few times I use it as long as utilizing the rewards isn't a hassle? i.e. I wouldn't get a Kohl's card because the $0.25 reward I get for my purchase can't be redeemed for anything without spending even more money (except maybe a stick of gum?), while a gas station card (those are a thing, right?) would have easy redemption. I don't plan on going out today and getting as many as I can, but the one time a month I go non-grocery shopping, what's to keep me from signing up for the store's credit card?\n\nConversely, would my credit score be hurt by not utilizing my new collection of cards?\n\n[Link to card info](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/iss\/credit\/rewardscardmember?_encoding=UTF8&amp;plattr=CBFOOT)","225":"Hello, churners,\n\nAs a long-time lurker in this helpful subreddit, I'm happy to make my first post.\n\nI'm traveling SE Asia and S. Asia for the next year or more, and I'm struggling to meet all my minimum spending requirements since credit cards are rarely accepted in this region for everyday purchases. As such, in January I signed up for Serve and am so far successfully loading $1k per month by credit card.\n\nHowever, $1k per month isn't sufficient, so what MS methods can you suggest in order of greatest to least ROI of time and money?\n\nA few considerations:\n- My parents (whom I often add as authorized users) live in California, and they can do small things to help. For instance, when Amazon Payments used to allow $1k monthly transfers from credit cards, I'd send $1k to my dad's account, withdraw to his bank account, and then he'd write a check he'd deposit to my bank account. However, I can't frequently send my mom to buy and liquidate gift cards.\n- Neither of my parents have good credit.\n- I'm currently working on minimum spending requirements for the Chase British Airways and Citi AAdvantage Gold as well as hopefully the Chase United Mileage Plus Explorer Business (assuming my reconsideration call goes well on Monday). Soon I hope to get the AmEx PRG (if I can get a 50k offer) and maybe a few other Citi and AmEx cards.\n- Kiva loans are nice, but the long repayment time and possibility of default make them unattractive.\n- Buying AmEx gift cards through cash back portals I'd consider, but this is also unattractive since I'd probably just have to eventually use these cards for regular spending because I can't send anyone to liquidate these cards in person\n\nIn addition, I'm right that my mom can't load her Serve account using my credit card on which she's an authorized user and then withdraw the funds to her checking account, eventually sending the money back to me?\n\nI'm grateful for your time and advice!","226":"[H] Paypal [W] Amazon Gift Cards Offers","227":"Amazon taxes","228":"[H] $5 Paypal [W] $5 Amazon GC","229":"Available\n\n* $45.00 AMAZON GC \n* $10.00 Barnes &amp; Noble GC\n\nLooking for Bitcoin.

I have been a member on the site 'Points2Shop' for over 2 years now and having scrolled through various other posts about this site, feel that a new, detailed guide about how to earn points\/cash on P2S would be useful both for those eager to earn a bit of beer money as well as the sceptics being driven away by the repeated calls of 'scam' and 'fake' by many users.\n\n[My Referral Link](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com?ref=uin1346212395)\n\n[Site Link](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com)\n\nBefore I begin a detailed guide into how to use the site, let me give you a bit of background information on my experiences with GPT sites, particularly P2S. I have used Swagbucks, InboxPounds, MySurveys, EpicRewards etc... over the years but Points2shop is easily my favourite. it has the widest range of offers, the best payouts and impeccable customer support, contrary to a lot of reviews I read about it.\nHaving been a member for 2 years (5-6 months active), I have been able to earn around $350 on the site through surveys, downloads and videos. 'Definitely a lie' I assume a lot of you are thinking...so here is some proof.\n\n[Current Earnings 08\/03\/15](http:\/\/gyazo.com\/d136e85b994a8c9afebc05d3645327e2)\n\n[$100 paypal withdrawal]( http:\/\/gyazo.com\/15d119fd4cdec9b79896cc64c0293d46)\n\n[30kg Dumbell Set](http:\/\/gyazo.com\/2a5aa2379b23aa554decee8792236f10)\n\nI have also earned $100 on an online debit card, some earphones and a pack of crayons (yes, my first reward!)\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nSo now, having seen the proof of what you can do on the site, I can feel you're ready to get started. The first thing you need to do is get signed up. There are two links at the top of the article - use my referral link if you feel I have been helpful, or the general link if you feel I could have done a better job. Most of my help is coming later in the post so perhaps read through before signing up.\n\nYou have now signed up and received that 250 point sign up bonus. The next stage is filling in your demographics (information about you). Here are 3 important points:\n\n- Ensure **all your information is correct** or you will have account issues - the info you complete offers with must match your account info so ensure your name and DOB are right.\n\n- Your address should be where you reside the **majority of the year**, as it must match your IP address while completing offers. If you are at college or uni, use this as your address.\n\n- Use a **valid email address** - they will send you a verification link. I advise making a new email address, it will become a spam magnet.\n\nYou will then arrive at the homepage, which looks like [this](http:\/\/gyazo.com\/022afd5fe71bfe3690afcf75886075be) \n\nMost of the stuff here is very self-explanatory. I would like to point out the 'shoutbox' on the right hand side. As well as having a general chat, there will always be experienced members here available to answer all your questions about the site - they are very friendly.\n\n**Earning Points\/Cash**\n\nNow you're ready to get started earning your own rewards. First things first, decide whether you want to earn points (redeem for rewards) or cash (withdraw to paypal). I recommend earning cash as you can convert cash -&gt; points but **not vice versa**. You should also note some offers are points only.\n\n[Change your preference (Cash or Points)](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/account\/edit_preferences)\n\nScroll down till you find [this box](http:\/\/gyazo.com\/8070623ec42c893cd1d5294217e6c61c)\n\nNow for the offers. The site has many different earning opportunities from surveys and downloads, to free trials and paid offers. As you develop on the site you will discover your own preference - I personally enjoy surveys and free trials.\n\nFollow all of these links to the easiest offers on the site:\n[Reward TV 75 points\/UK only](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/offers\/12964\/Reward-TV-Register-and-Play-at-least-2-games-UK)\n\n[Reward TV 50 points\/US only](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/offers\/11852\/Reward-TV-Register-and-Play-at-least-2-games)\n\n[Demographics 27 points](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/account\/profilers)\n\n[Download toolbar 25 points](http:\/\/www.points2shop.com\/offers\/cashback)\n\nThere are many other easy offers such as downloading the app, Soop, Facebook page like - these can all be found [here.](http:\/\/ukcl.info\/easypoints)\n\nEvery 100 points you earn is equivalent to $1. Offers are generally worth between 20-50 points and take 5 minutes. Surveys can be worth between 50-300 points and take 3-30 minutes. It will always tell you how long the survey is beforehand so you know what to expect. Finally, free trials pay between 100-500 points.

So another 5-7 days until you meet your goal of 2 weeks with no purchases. \n\nAnother trick I may use is, to count my purchases last 2 weeks, and if there are 30 items, then I'll try to cut that in half. So I can only make 15 purchases this month on my card. \n\nOr cutting a bill in half, like a phone bill, and using the remainder saved as another form of earned money to buy something. Or having a goal of thinking about what you want 1-5 years from now? That way you won't buy a silly magazine at the store, or the latest gadget. Or not spending for 14 days, then buying that 1 skateboarding item. You're rewarding your new habit of not buying something for 14 days. \n\nI like to think of budgeting at a habit rather than manually entering in everything. Which is nice to look back on, but YOU KNOW what your weakness is. Just don't buy it. Or if you face a problem like going to the movie, either eat before going in, or rent a movie instead. That's money saved right there. Or finding a coupon code for redbox for a free rental. \n\nPen and pad is the best budget. Think of it as a 2 week budget, write your stuff down, then throw it away. Many budgets, you miss input a number or two and you're fucked and have to rebalance, which is annoying. I dunno, just some thoughts. ","328":"I am in the same boat as you. I was making a decent salary, and my gf was making about the same, even a bit less per year. Yet in 8 months she had $5k in savings, I was hovering at about $900. I had a couple of additional expenses (fines) that she didn't have that contributed to that, but I am a terrible impulse buyer. To help with this, as funny as it sounds, a meme I saw on here really spoke to me. It was the advice mallard, and it said, \"Just because you can buy something, doesn't mean that you can afford it.\" It hit the nail on the head with my mentality towards buying stuff. The new purchases were fun right when I got it, but now it's just extra clutter\/games that I'll never use again. After that, I made my own cheesy acronym that I keep at my desk (where I tend to do a lot of impulse Amazon\/eBay purchasing). It says SAVE. \"S\"- Spend LESS! (Duh). \"A\"- Always ask myself, \"Do I really need this?\" \"V\"- Value! Value my hard earned money and my free time. \"E\"- Enjoy life. Read, exercise, learn, explore.    \n\nAs I said, very cheesy but it has helped me immensely with my saving and also with life in general. Instead of locking myself up on the weekends for 6 hours playing video games (which is still awesome to do from time to time), I spend more time reading, hiking, spending time with family, stuff that is more important in the long run. I think it's more of a mentality than anything, and getting in the right mindset will help you.","329":"&gt; GoDaddy has officialized its IPO.

If you guys had the same setup\/racket as Tai does you wouldn't be ragging on him.  He is basically where 99% of the people that populate this subreedit want to be.  Earning a good living with minimum work hours, a nice home, good social life, and a modicum of fame.  \n\n2.  If you had a secret method of making money would you share it to the public at all?  Hell no!  Of course you wouldn't.\n\nHis website had the same basic layout as all 'information products' except what he's selling you is an information high.  The target audience - an insight junkie as others have coined.  Who isn't an insight junkie at some level.  Information, stories, anecdotes are practically worthless without a well directed plan of execution.  Most of the people who have subscribed to him are those people who didn't have a clue about reading to boost your intellectual stock will be the ones most appealed by this new venture.  Hoping that the 67 steps is a step by step program that will lead to you (as Tai calls it) the 4 pillars of life, health, wealth, love and happiness.  I agree that if you have those parts of your life in order you will be exponentially more happiness than the masses.  But it's not really a step by step plan rather, 67 things that Tai talks about in length for no particular reason other than to keep you hooked into subscribing for longer.\n\nWhat i'm saying is there's no inherent value in insight\/information unless it makes you get off your ass and work harder and smarter than before.  That's it.  It's not magic.\n\n\nEDIT : - more stuff\n\n\nHis business model is smart because :\n\n\nA.  He is constantly reading new material all the time - therefore he's receptive to new ideas being published - most of us don't have the time to read that much -&gt; getting new content for videos.\n\n\nB.  You can't prove him wrong because he selling an idea - who doesn't want to learn more, become well read and educated?  He taps into a primal instinct within all of us - learning - who can argue with that.\n\n\nC.  No risks - if you don't get tangible results - it's not his fault.  He doesn't promise anything beyond an information high.\n\n\nD.  There's not much competition in this particular niche - I suspect there will be more bloggers\/youtubers coming online with similar characteristics soon, if this style continues to be popular.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: -\nIn saying all that, he has introduced me to a lot of books I have not discovered or overlooked.

I prefer cash back as opposed to points cards, but if you want to save up points over the years for a new tablet or whatever you can get, go for it. Just make sure you **get the most points\/cashback for what you will charge on the card** most. I have a  card system that gets me the most back for what I charge.

There's not much of a downside to most credit cards if you pay them off every month. Just wait for your balance to be reported on your billing statement before paying it off (don't charge then instantly turn around and pay it off online) any amount will help build credit. Although having a $0 balance every month is a good thing, credit bureaus want to see that you are actively using your credit.  \n  \n  are you sure you don't have any credit? no car loans, bills in your name etc.?  If you haven't, sign up for Mint and check your credit score. Then I used www.CreditKarma.com and www.CreditCards.com to find a card that worked well for me. I have Bank of America Cash Rewards for 3% back on gas, and American Express Blue Cash Everyday card for 3% back on groceries. This way, Always have a balance reported since these are things I buy every month anyway.  \n  \n  I would also wait for a reward that seems fair to you. Some cards offer $100 back after spending $500-$1000 with them in 3 months, others give you an Amazon gift card once approved and making a purchase with your card. Since your not transferring a balance or anything, no interest for so many months will most likely just make it tempting to make a large purchase.  \n  \n  Hope this helps","368":"Pay it off every month and there are few downsides. I've had the Chase Amazon card for years, and know a lot of friends have it too.\n\nIf you don't use it for a long period, like six months or a year, they may cancel it.

If other people believe that those questions should all be contained within the weekly threads, and if Joe is alright with it, we could oblige... but that would mean deleting almost every single post, and concerted effort of the community to report all posts they don't want to see.

Honestly when you're asking if you need a scale it's way too early to be thinking about multiple marketplaces.\n\nExpanding to other marketplaces does not actually mean you'll expand your income because you still only have X amount of merchandise to sell. If you want to increase your income you should increase the amount of merchandise (typically I sell 1% of all available stock each day, whether it was back when I started with 10 things or later on with 10,000 things listed).\n\nAdding another marketplace to the mix quickly can become a royal pain in the ass. FBA isn't exactly designed for flipping either, you can do it but once you package the item to meet FBA requirements and send it to Amazon, you may as well just send it to the customer directly. FBA is great if you buy 10,000 widgets from China in bulk that are boxed and barcoded but it's not so great for flipping used stuff. I would do MF on Amazon if you absolutely must but don't expect a massive jump in income. You're better off finding sources for cheaper things than worrying about multi marketplace listings.","402":"Well the answer to that is quite simple...I acquire the Amazon Gift cards from various auctions and person-to-person adds (Craigslist)  with a 30-35% discount so I still maintain a good profit margin even when selling at 25%...I'm also a strong believer in Bitcoin and I am actually keeping  most of my Bitcoins because I believe that their real price is higher than today's value of $270\n\n","403":"Do you still need it?

After looking through responses in this post and actually watching the YouTube vid, I have to agree on a few of these points. \n\nThe issue here is that you (OP) built the product before finding out if anyone wanted it. For any product creation a proof of concept is needed before you should ever pour serious money into it. Find out what people want, then give *that* to them. \n\nHow many people told you, \"I wish I could find games that WERE ads\"? I'm guessing none, because no one wants that. What people want are games that are fun, where they can make visible progress and get a sense of accomplishment. \n\nPlaying a game to get a coupon sounds more like work to me. Unless the game is spectacularly fun, people won't want to spend time \"playing\" them with the sole purpose of getting indefinite prizes, unless the prizes are amazing ($200 gift card to Amazon) or they have a real need for what's being offered. \n\nIt doesn't matter that the game is free; no one will play it unless they have a desire to. And the chance to get some discounts is not going to overcome a game that isn't fun by itself. \n\nYou need to do some testing with your target market (you do have one, right?) to see how much they actually would play (and voluntarily acquire the app) before dumping more money into an expensive launch. ","408":"I disagree, but I respect your opinion and see where you're coming from.  I don't import from China, but flip retail arbitrage and online arbitrage style.  In regards to the comparison of shipping to Amazon vs shipping to the customer directly: I shipped 600 units to FBA last month; there's no way I could've fulfilled all those orders myself.

Boy were we wrong. We use it all the time. Save lots of money by buying bulk deals and freezing it. It also helps save money and much more nutrious than eating fast food. We are always scrambling around with our kids (competitive swimmers). We would cook the meals for the week on Saturday. And freeze individual servings using the foodsaverish bags (more on that later). It's like making your own frozen dinners. The bags are bpa free and microwavable. When frozen they store flat which helps with space in the chest freezer. Every meal is properly labeled and dated. My wife loves it. Just cut a little hole in a corner (to let steam escape) and put in microwave. Becareful as it will be very hot and contain steam once removing from the microwave.\n\nIn addition, we use the jar accessory to vacuum seal certain goods (like rice, pasta, etc) in mason jars to keep fresh. Air is not a friend of storing food. We also do this our dehydrated foods (sweet corn, watermelon, etc) and keep in the fridge.\n\nNow as for the bags, at first we use to buy deals from the company itself (bogo deals). But even then we found it to be too expensive. We would try different suppliers on ebay and Amazon. Until we found one where we could get 4 jumbo rolls very cheap. And they are very good.

The theory I've heard about one book about flies that got to almost $23 million asking price was that one retailer was actually just drop shipping directly from Amazon based on their higher feedback so their algorithm was set to make money on that by charging a steady 1.2% of the lowest copy. Then the lowest copy is set to stay at .999% of the 2nd lowest copy to maximize profit while remaining the cheapest option.

If they are all selling for less than $200 you might need to separate the costs to look competitive. The extra $10 looks more material than it really is but only in comparison.\n\nAmazon seems to believe free shipping is the way to go.

It was crazy.  I could see the price was .60 and he said they paid close to $3 at a big box store.  He said they had 100 locations across the US.  His hints were as follows.  Chinese (Alibaba I assumed) Gold Supplier, Art product sold to new Franchising idea in the US.  He said that he sold a supply item to a franchise that was new in the US, who bough a product they used with clients locally that had a huge markup via retail but needed it for their stores, when the products were available elsewhere much cheaper.  I assume it was some kind of make it and take it product like acrylic painting, raw pottery or something, but they originally purchased these items at a big box retailer like Michaels for use in their stores where customers created something as the experience.  It could of been flower arrangements for women and he supplied silk flowers for all I know.  He said that there are tons of these opportunities.  Everyone's trying to do it online, but he said the money is in offline companies that regularly use something you can supply cheaper via China (Alibaba) and the like vs. At the online and offline retailers they use to buy their raw materials.  I assume there are several companies right in our backyards that if we found something they regularly buy locally (costco, etc.) and had a deeply discounted price we could land accounts and make some good money, especially if they had hundreds of stores across the US and the franchisees simply went to the local Costco to buy inventory to create, make, have available or whatever for their customers.  And I guess you would just be stepping between Costco and the company.  Just a thought and something I learned to pass along.  I guess the point is to get out there and find out what these companies biggest expense item is that they purchase regularly and make it available for less via mass supply for similar companies, but then again that's what manufacturers reps do, don't they?

We have formed partnerships with Apple and Twitter, both great firms that spark innovation. Watson is without a doubt IBM's crop, however there is more to IBM then just it's software.

Be honest on the condition, they'll still sell when priced accordingly.

I've had two scrabble deluxe editions that were both missing 1 tile. In those listings I knocked off $5 from what I would ask if it was complete and said that there are other sellers selling 1 tile of the specific letter for $2. Also, it might sound ridiculous at first for some games, but piece the games out and organize them nicely for your photos. This will allow potential buyers to actually count all the pieces if they want or it will at least show you are not trying to hide anything and they will just trust your openness. I also organize all the pieces and cards into ziplock bags and take a picture showing how it will be shipped without the top on, so they can see it wont just be all loose and wild in the game box.

","470":"I personally would recommend getting a new card. If you are responsible with keeping up on your bills, then there is no problem in getting a new card, or even several new cards. \n\nI have 13 credit cards, and some people have even more than this.\n\nThe reason I suggest getting a new card is twofold. First, if there are rewards, these rewards can only help you. Rewards include cash back, miles, or large signup bonuses. The second reason is to lengthen and thicken your credit profile. If you only have 2 credit lines on your report, adding the additional line (such as a car loan) can significantly affect your score. But when you have 37 lines on your report, like I do, a new credit line barely affects your report. \n\nAs far as which one, my own preference is cash back, since I don't travel. I like the Citi Double Cash, which gives 2% back on everything, and the Sallie Mae card, which gives 5% on gas, groceries, and Amazon. You say you do a lot of shopping at Costco, so I would recommend the Fidelity Amex for that. This card gives 2% back on everything and includes a $50 signup bonus (search around for the correct link). Of course, you've probably read that next year Costco will no longer accept Amex, so this will only work for the next 13 months.\n\nThe CSP is a great card, and I believe gives a great signup bonus. You do need excellent credit, but 729 *may* not qualify (it should though). \n\n[Here](http:\/\/frequentmiler.boardingarea.com\/best-credit-card-sign-up-offers\/) is a list of other great cards with signup bonuses. ","471":"If this is Ebay you only need to show it was mailed, but it's not.\n\n\nOn Amazon, it requires a signature to be similarly protected. \n\n\/random tangent \n\nJust an FYI, if this was an FBA sale, this is open and shut.  In fact, you can't even GET an A to Z claim on FBA sales.  It's a completely worthwhile insurance policy. If that isn't sweet enough for you, I get reimbursed for anything that happens to my items from the moment it leaves my house until I have money in my account.  this includes customer damaged, bait and switch, customer says not delivered, or even damaged in shipping.  Just some food for thought.  UPS truck catches on fire with my FBA shipment, CHA CHING!  If only. \n\/end random\n\nBased off the information you have provided she has no basis for an A to Z claim.  The A to Z process is for sticking it to a seller who is not following Amazon policy.  The people who say buyers can scam people with A to Z usually have done something they should not have done or didn't take a precautionary step and they were preyed on.  Yes, there are people who go out there and prey on some of us who have shitty listings.  Anyway.  \n\nThat said, you have her in messaging changing her story several times for no good reason. It's beyond the 30 day window as well.  If you recorded the serial number of the phone you could even take the further step of finding out what provider and person it is attached to (I see no reason to go this route, but assuming your listing is good you could almost certainly find a sympathetic employee who could tell you if the phone is active and when it was turned on since it's being reported as lost\/stolen.  \n\n (Make sure you verify the date of her first message was beyond the 30 day window as well, because if the chain of messages starts prior you are still locked into whatever your return policy is, although i dont believe that matters in this case for other reasons) \n\nYou also have a  packing slip that reflects the appropriate weight upon delivery, and if you had SIGNATURE required that means someone had to accept and sign for a package and you are now 100% in the clear.  She would then have to explain why a broken package with a missing phone was SIGNED for.  Good luck on that.\n\nIn addition, all shipping companies will either return to sender OR blatantly sticker and mark that your package was damaged and something was possibly lost.  Ive had this happen with USPS several times.  They will never just delivery an item with a huge gaping hole in it, nor do they accept items like that.  It's just policy (I mystery shop the USPS and my girlfriend has family who works there) It's over 30 days.  No one gets fired  for it and there's no motivation to hide it.   \n\nSo they did remove the feedback bu, but that doesn't necessarily mean they agreed she is scamming.  Just that she left improper feedback.  There IS a difference and as such should not be used when figuring out if you think you'll win or lose the A to Z.  It certainly doesn't HURT though.  \n\nIf I was pissed off at a seller over a legitimate complaint and left scathing feedback with personal remarks it will be removed, but if that were a valid claim to begin with I would still win.  This is why I am stating you can't make that leap.  I believe you win based on the merit of the situation.  There is no apparent evidence that supports her at all and it sounds like you did almost everything right.  I'm hoping you get back and say you used a signature because that makes this open and shut.  Either way, I don't think you have much to worry about.  If you have any signature confirmation (or FBA) then I give you a definite nothing to worry about.  \nGod I hope you used signature confirmation.  That's blatant proof she lied because you can verify the weight of the shipment that she SIGNED for and has to try and explain that away.  I do like it when customers try to explain away logic.  Those are always the most entertaining.  \n\n","472":"I disagree with people telling you to stick with Ebay.  I do agree with Hellsgator about reading, reading, and reading again.  For the sake of my post, I am going to assume you know how to read and I shall leave you with this advice.  Just once will I ever say this.\n\nDo not skimp on anything.  WHen you go to make your first order, go and read the directions on making a shipment.  When your order is received, then read up on all of that.  You will learn about how to find out if there is an issue with your order, the standards for packing materials for FBA, how to set up your auto-removal function to send returns back to you or to just have amazon do it.  Really, it's way more information than you can know at once...but if you read it when you need it.  \n\nKeep it open, print out the condition guidelines for all categories you are selling in and follow it religiously.  Do not give yourself the benefit of the doubt, do not make any assumptions, and do not think at at that anything you did for Ebay matters on Amazon at all.  \n\nRead everything that pertains to the area you are working in.  That is your fucking bible.  I ignored a lot of people here when I went to FBA because I hadn't been doing this but 2 months, and I also had over 100 items I wanted to send in for my first shipment.  I cleared a Monday, I spent all day doing it.  I had my shipment out Tuesday.  By a week later I had already had one of my shipments recieved, and made more money in the first 48 hours of it going live than I had the prior 2 months as an Ebay and Amazon MF for all of the exact, same, items.  Just read and follow directions. READ and follow directions.  READ THE MOTHERFUCKING DIRECTIONS.\n\nEverything you have listed on Ebay is now doing nothing except taking up space.  You may as WELL list them all on Amazon and ship it in if for no other reason than they will sell faster and you can still ship it to your Ebay customers via Amazon and never leave home.  \n\nGive yourself plenty of time, have 5 or 6 boxes (just in case), and decide if you are labeling or not.  I suggest labeling if you have anything that is confusing to figure out, because someone will fuck it up otherwise.  Basically any new item is safe.  It's the used ones that I now avoid using their labeling service for.\n\nI pretty much disagree with everything \/u\/wow_what_a_username stated regarding FBA.  I agree with I do over 90% of my business there and moved all other business away from Ebay and it was pretty much the best thing I ever did.  Most of my items tend to be used items from thrift shops.\n\nI also disagree because expanding into Amazon FBA is not just any other marketplace.  It is THE marketplace.  Period.  Unless it can't be sold on Amazon by you, it's almost certainly going to sell faster and for more money there.  Once you factor opportunity cost into that, it's simply no contest.  Yes there are exceptions, I am aware of them so I don't need a lesson from anyone, but it's so rare that as long as you have verified you can sell it on amazon, it's hard for me to justify spending a lot of time explaining those to someone.  Basically, verify you can sell it.  Make SURE you can sell it.  \n\nSo anyway, use the ebay items that are for sale, and send them all in.  I bet you you get more sales in the first week listed than you did in the last 3 months on Ebay.  Hell, if I am wrong, I'll buy you a 12 pack.  You can't go wrong =)  \n\nExceptions that matter: \n\nDo not do this if you do not have close to 50-100 items.  You need 40 sales a month to make the expense a wash and it's unrealistic you will sell everything you send in right away, although that largely depends on what you sell.\n\nTLDR:   Send that shit to FBA man.  Join the ranks of satisfied FBA merchants.  Just for fun, do a test.

Collectible as a rule means that it includes all aspects of the item including original packaging, all pieces, all manuals, advertisements, etc.  For example you can sell a collectible video game if you have the case, manual, and disk.  If you are missing one of those items you cannot sell it as a collectible and must sell it as used.  For board games though, the next paragraph applies.  \n\nCollectible - Like New: An apparently untouched item in perfect condition. The original protective wrapping, if any, may be missing, but the original packaging is intact. There are absolutely no signs of wear. Suitable for presenting as a gift.\nCollectible - Very Good: A well-cared-for item that has seen limited use but remains in great condition. Item and instructions are complete and undamaged but may show some signs of wear.\nCollectible - Good: Item shows wear from consistent use, but it remains in good condition.

It can be a pain to do a workaround otherwise.  That said, a scale on ebay will pay for itself very quickly with 1,000 a month assuming those aren't big items.  \n\nAlso, the time you save by not going to the post office on your sales each month should be more than enough incentive to use FBA because now that time you used to spend for that you can now spend sourcing.  Plus when you factor materials and time, I definitely believe you come out ahead of the fees charged.  The fees on Amazon are all inclusive.  They do your customer service, selling, packing, wrapping, shipping, insurance for your items, so you ship it and forget it basically.  I gave a more detailed explanation in one of your other threads.  \n\nYou're doing SO much work right now.  To put it in perspective.  My girlfriend and I will spend about 500 bucks every month if we are on a road trip, as we were this month.  That 500 bucks we spend we take one day and get a hotel for an extra day to box and pack our shipment for FBA.  Those two days from the last two months is on par with what you're doing an entire month on Ebay.  Amazon sells better for anything you're allowed to sell in it's catalog compared to Ebay in most cases.  As in, there are so few exceptions I wont even bother to try and list them.

I don't think you're instilling your customer that you care about them when you wait 39.5 hours to reply to their offer.

How many people do you know are so patient they can wait 48 hours for a response on something they want to buy, or are they more than likely going to move on.  Unless you have a super price or a very unique item, you're dust in the wind friends.  I strongly, strongly, discourage this type of strategy for your negotiations.  Talk to any salesperson whether they would make someone wanting to buy their item if they would ever willingly not reply to them for hours or a day.  This is still sales.  \n\nThe advantage to waiting until the offer just expires is that you can see other offers that come in.  However, if the person says you haven't replied to them they can simply cancel it as per Ebay rules.  They can cancel it anyway, and there isn't much you can do about it.

You dont refund until the item is back in your hands and you want that customer being just as nice to you so why not gather all the information you need to sink them firsT?\n\n it would be suspicious if they refused to take a photo of the item before mailing it to you, so they probably will.  They think you're simply processing a return for them and they got you.  You want them to be cordial until you drop the hammer down.\n\nAfter it comes to you, you open a claim to report a violation if you're confident it's not what you sent out. Not a feeling, you're positive.    You offer up your original listing and what you have received.  Even better if they sent you photos prior because they are done at that point.  \n\nThen you copy the pertaining policy regarding all items have to be an identical item in same condition and that this was not done in that way and would like to not issue a refund.  \n\nIve literally never had this process fail.

Any bitcoin I get, instead of converting to fiat for a % I just go dump it on gyft.com for Amazon gift cards (as that's where I do probably 95% of my shopping) and then just note down the exchange difference between the time I receive the BTC from the customer and exchange it on gyft (usually less than a half hour) and consider it cash from the business to myself... while the vast majority of companies and people that receive it immediately dump it to fiat (which I imagine is what gyft.com is doing).\n\nIt's not a currency, it's a check at best. \"here I want your stuff, take this and your processor will give you cash for it\".","486":"Consider hiring a temp worker to use a bar code scanner and listing all your items fulfillment by Amazon.

What data are you looking at to demonstrate \"they\" are getting most of the sales.  How many items sold in the last two weeks, and how many of those sales were from you vs how many came from someone else with a buy box at a higher price?  As far as I know, there is no compilation of this data for you to make such an assertion.  I would then ask this question, replying your anecdote, with mine.   Who is or isn't prime?  Are the items used or brand new?  \n\nI simply dont know, why did I sell all 17 of one item in 48 hours when I had no buy box?  the buy box price was nearly 14 dollars higher than mine yet i completely sold out fast.  When I finished selling out, the same person still had the buy box and their item did not sell as far as I can tell nor did they have more than one in stock.  \n\nThe important factor is being Prime for the biggest benefit.  The next biggest factor is price. The buy box is gravy but hardly the end all but is also what I would say as having the least impact regarding the sale of an item.  \n\n  Having the buy box to get a sale over a higher priced item ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL such as shipping times and return policy requires that the purchaser not know how to find the cheapest item on Amazon and as much as people are idiots, it's a fairly easy process and its just one inch or less below the buy box clearly labeled directly below buy now with a window that says \"other buying choices starting at ????\".\n\nIn short, it takes a stupid person who is internet savvy enough to find an item they want to buy on Amazon and make an account, but also not smart enough to notice or ask if there are other sellers or how to sort by price.  The buy box literally factors in only as long as the buyer at the time of purchase is an idiot.  So yes, it impacts you, but not as much as you think.\n\n\nWe know that most people look for the best deal.  I dont know why this centuries old mantra somehow isn't applicable to people when it comes to buy box discussions.  It's still the truth.  \n\nSo basically you would need to not be the lowest price and have a buyer who isn't looking for the best deal for whatever reason in order for it to have a positive impact on you.

It's a bit of a double standard as you are in the same business, whether you sell the same stuff or not.

I do it because I can afford it, but it irks me.  I would have gotten a different labeler instead.  \n\nThat would let you make your own labels.  As a general rule, you can't label your items faster than Amazon can for the same price.  You pay .20 each one.  I do larger orders and I figured out I could realistically spend at LEAST 45 seconds to a minute of work per item to label them when I factor in the printing, waiting, sorting and sticking the items appropriately.  In short, I make more money if I let Amazon do that, and I just add a location or two for sourcing, but your milegage may vary.  \n\nNow, I do not label my items unless I don't have time to make and merge two shipments (You dont sent labeled and unlabeled in the same box unfortunately)\n\nOnce you start dealing with scale, you'll quickly realize why labeling is a poor use of time, but dependent on your situation, time, and patience you can certainly do it yourself.  Just don't forget once that  if you are even remotely close to one minute per item to label, that once you factor in the money for a labeler and all the labels that skews it more in favor of letting Amazon do it. \n\n\nPlus you're going to get a lot more space. \n\nPro-tip.  Make your first shipment.  you're going to probably have one place that has the majority of your items going to it.

Then I finalize that shipment and send it in.  I keep the rest open throughout the next week or two of purchase and as I list new items, I keep creating new shipments and having them sorted into boxes until I have a box filled and repeat.\n\nI realize I may not have worded that as clear as I could have, so please let me know if it doesn't make sense.

I'm already signed up to Screenwise and I'll give the others a try this week.  Can all be used on a farm phone or do they need a cellular data connection? The less I'm running on my normal phone the better.\n\nAlso if you want you can add Mobile Performance Meter to your list.  I'm not sure if it's on anything other than Android or not. I have used it and it does require a mobile data connection so no farm phones.  I forgot the number of points you get for signing up, but you get 20 points a day and I think 100 points for a survey.  Surveys seem to always be the same and average to about one a month.  It's always been if I like my carrier and if I would recommend them to others. I think you may get points when making a call as well, but I'm not sure.  I have seen a jump in points after a call, but I don't send or receive calls much to know.  I mostly text and use data.  They have a number of gift cards however I stick with Amazon.  At the 5 dollar amount it's 100 points per dollar and usually you get the gift card the day you cash in depending on how early you cash in for it.  So that's 5 bucks every 25 days for just the 20 points a day.  Issue is after one of the past updates you may have to check it daily to make sure it's still running.  Even with the icon showing on your notification bar the app may not be running.  Even then it's hit and miss however more hit than miss.

But I am not *your* lawyer. You need lawyer licensed to practice in your state. Dig? \n\nMe: lawyer. **But not your lawyer.** \n\n**The following does not constitute legal advice, does not commence an attorney-client relationship, and are only general guidelines about starting a company that sells goods. If you need a lawyer, get one. Preferably not me.**\n\nNow, on to the actual points:\n\n* **Incorporate. Now.** The point of incorporating - whether you chose to go S corp, C corp, LLC, whatever - is to limit your personal liability. That way, when someone sues the business, your personal assets are not on the line. Right now, they are. This is bad. Don't be bad. Be good. Incorporate.\n\n* A single member LLC is a disregarded entity from the perspective of the IRS - meaning that the money passes directly through it and you pay taxes on it like you would normal income. One person mentioned certain types of distributions to members of an S Corp - I believe you can only get capital gains if you have owned the relevant equity for more than a year. In any event, **you should talk to an accountant who can help you choose the best corporate form in the context of your greater financial situation.**\n\n* There is no meaningful distinction between being a single guy and a small business. Business is commerce. If you are providing goods or services for money, you are in business. Without a corporate entity, you *personally* are in business. Again, this is bad. Because if a product you sell explodes, your house is on the line. **Make sure that after you incorporate that your bank accounts, your bills, your sale contracts, your website, your user agreements ALL list the business - *not you* - as the entity doing the transactions.** This is critical. Also honor your corporate books. Keep your business accounts completely separate from your own. File separate taxes. Keep all your corporate documents together in a binder, someplace safe. Make a record of major decisions on behalf of the company - leases, equipment purchases, car rentals or purchases, major travel expenses, approval of hiring officers, documentation that says what their powers are, and keep your accounting books in order as well. This is to demonstrate that you and the company as *separate entities* - if you do not \"recognize corporate formalities\" then if someone sues you, they can \"pierce the corporate veil\" and go after your assets directly, completely defeating the purpose of the whole thing in the first place. This is bad. Don't be bad. \n\n* If you are selling products, you are likely going to want a website. Set one up. Make sure that you have proper Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I am fairly certain squarespace.com can take care of this. Have your lawyer review it. You may want an online store. Check out shopify, amazon, etsy, ebay or all of them. \n\n* If you hire people, **use a PEO.** From what I've seen, justworks.com is not only cheap, it provides basically everything you need from the perspective of employee compliance. If you don't use it, find another PEO.\n\n* If you are selling products, you are going to need **fulfillment services.** There are many providers. Amazon, among others. Find one you like. Use it. *Pay your sales tax.* A good fulfillment service will help you with this.\n\n* **You are going to need a warranty and limitation of liability.** Your warranty may, in fact, be something that simply *disclaims* all warranties, and the limitation of liability will likely be a fixed, low number. But make sure you have one. **This should be reviewed by a lawyer.**\n\n* **You are going to need insurance. Get liability and umbrella insurance. Consider D&amp;O and E&amp;O.** It is not terribly expensive. You will be very happy when you need it. And you will be **horrified** if you need it and don't have it.\n\n* **You need to perform trademark clearances. Now.** You may think you have an awesome brand name. Neat. It may be. Do you own the domain? Is the company name available in your state? **More importantly, [have you checked the USPTO website](http:\/\/tess2.uspto.gov\/bin\/gate.exe?f=tess&amp;state=4801:mg7lwp.1.1)?** This process is *much* more complicated than people give credit for. Even if you don't decide to go ahead and start your own trademark filings, if you are selling a product that has a name similar to a registered trademark, you can have a reasonable expectation that one day, if you are successful, you will get a cease and desist letter. Better to find a really novel name and start your trademark application. Or at least be relatively confident there is no one else using that name on that product. Trademark is far trickier than people realize. Don't think you can do it alone. BTW, lawyers love legalzoom. And trademarkia. Because the people who come to us having used their services need *way* more services than those who came to us in the first place.\n\n**Tl;dr Talk to an accountant. Incorporate. Get a lawyer. Get your corporate documents in order (bylaws, operating agreement, whatever). Get your EIN. Get your bank accounts. Get insurance. Get fulfillment services. Get your website \/ online store. Clear your product name. Get insurance. Start selling.**\n\nAnd let us know how it goes.

This is adding an unnecessary step to a quite simple task.\n\n3 - you have one picture of your product on the site, and no mention of the material it is made out of.\n\nYou say that it is easy to clean. Is it made with compressed fiber with a paper coating, or out of some non-porous material? \n\n4 - How are you going to back this claim up? \"To stop the spread of germs with the immediate disposal of tissues, leading to a healthier lifestyle.\"\n\nIt looks like to empty the tidytissue the user has to stick their hand in the box and peel the snotty tissues off the inside of the box once they have dried.

Imagine if you were looking at AAPL prices from mid-2012 to mid-2013 and concluded that the company was doomed.\n- He also has a slide on the increasing shipping costs of Amazon, but this is meaningless being in comparison to sales. For example, from the chart it looks like Amazon's shipping expenses increased about 40-50% between 2011 and 2013, but that's not too bad when you consider that revenues more than doubled in the same period.\n- He didn't mention Amazon Web Services at all, which I think is a mistake considering it's easily the fastest-growing segment of the company. If you're looking at a ten-year timespan you can't just ignore that.\n- He had a lot of good stuff to say about Facebook, and for good reason. I think that he's spot on that Facebook is still easily the dominant social network and one of the most appealing to advertisers. I'm really glad that he pointed out how good Facebook has been about managing their acquisitions.\n- I think he should have spent some time talking about how Facebook is going to get around their \"oversaturation\" problem. When a third of the planet has a Facebook account, your only real option is to make each user more valuable. He should have rattled off a couple of approaches that Facebook was taking to do that.\n- He really glossed over Google, I guess to give room to the other companies. I don't think it's as doom and gloom as he makes it seem though--he points out that mobile is becoming more important, and Android has a very strong market share. I feel he should have spent some time considering how Google can monetize outside of search.\n- He spent a lot of time labeling Apple as a luxury brand and holds up their brand management as *the* reason for their success. I don't deny that Apple's fantastic marketing and branding has had a huge impact on their success, but I feel that's still a bit of a myopic view. He compares Apple to Tesla--companies that he claims make expensive impractical products that serve foremost as status symbols. But I don't think Apple has built their success on impractical products, they've built it on delivering quality products with a great user experience. Compare [this typical Louis Vuitton ad](http:\/\/www.malemodelscene.net\/wp-content\/gallery\/012013\/jacey-elthalion-louis-vuitton-spring-summer-2013-01.jpg) with [this typical iPhone ad](http:\/\/media.idownloadblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/why-iphone-ad-2.png).\n- That said, I agree that Apple can be considered a luxury brand, but so far I don't think that's the main reason they've been successful. He talked about the Apple watch a little bit at the end, I think he should have spent more time focused on that. To me, the Apple watch *is* an example of the sort of impractical product he was talking about, the kind that Apple is only able to develop by leveraging their brand value.\n\nOverall pretty cool talk though.

I have no idea if the 40% increase in sales from 2013-2011 was due to good organic growth or if it was simply because Bezos wanted a bit of that Wall Street capital so he started giving away prime memberships and undercutting popular goods. But yes, I also found his simple comparison to Macy's stock price to be a bit strange. Nonetheless, I think his high level strategic points about possible vulnerabilities with flexible shipping (Uber) and flexible warehouses  (brick and mortar stores) were things that I'll be trying to follow this next time I look at AMZN. \n\n\nRegarding FB, I think the most telling slide regarding the \"saturation\" problem is the identity tracking ability of FB (and Instagram and WhatsApp). Their ad network has plenty of room to grow based on their various properties... and right on queue, Instagram just announced clickable ads. \n\nhttp:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/04\/what-advertisers-want\/#WBbAET:rkwL\n\nSpeculating a bit, I think the unique ability of FB to own its users identity may allow to extend it's business much further than traditional ads. With personal identity, services and jobs also open up to FB. Examples of this are things like how Tinder\/Coffee Meets Bagel are reliant\/require facebook integration. These services\/jobs are things that Google could never fulfill since the closest to personal identity Google got was gmail (assuming google+ is dead).\n\n\n\n&gt;how Google can monetize outside of search\n\nThat is the hundred billion dollar question these days. I'm unfortunately unable to answer this question, which has made GOOG a hard sell these past few years. I see little faith in the pie in the sky projects unless a real business model is presented. Currently, we have incredibly fun\/ambitious tech, but I'm unwilling to invest in fun\/tech without a business model. \n\n\n&gt; He spent a lot of time labeling Apple as a luxury brand and holds up their brand management as *the* reason for their success.\n\nI didn't really see him as saying that this was *the* reason for their success. I don't think he's saying that a luxury brand is \"impractical\" or not a \"quality product.\" I don't think he's saying that these are orthogonal things that can't fit in a luxury brand. He's just analyzing the brand (that's his expertise at NYU). I took it as him saying \"If you look at Apple this way (a luxury brand), this is why they can become a trillion dollar company regardless of any potential technology challengers.\"","635":"&gt; You're telling me every joe blow who's only selling iPhone cases on Amazon has done this entire process?\n\nNo, they almost certainly haven't.

Is earnings a decent proxy for company's growth?\n\nThe S&amp;P 500's average annualized earnings growth has been 6.9% since 1960.

Don't hold my breath.\n\n&gt;Store Warehousing vs Centralized Fulfillment Centers\n\nHe mentions that store pickup is faster than Amazon's shipping as if this is somehow a revelation.

Essentially flipping but on a predatory level. The word thief I've used, and have already explained to you, as part of an analogy. Your wish to bring it up out of context indicates that either you failed to understand it's meaning in its original context despite having it explained to you, or you're using it out of context in an attempt to score points in this discussion. Could be either. \n\nI don't think i've said \"taking from someone elses hands\" at all, could be wrong. \n\n\"and none of those accurately describe what is going on.\"\n\nOK - go ahead and tell us how they don't accurately describe what is going on.

I'm just not damaging them. \n\n\"You can certainly say that my motivation is more towards profit and filling a market need for people who don't have time.\"\n\nWho don't have time? Your making presumptions again. It's annoying. Just be more honest about it. You're motivation is about the profit. Fuck the filling a need. That's not your motivation. If it were you'd allow the suppliers, manufacturers and retailers to fill the market they had already invested millions in fulfilling - and by all accounts did a bang up job. Your motivation is about the money, nothing more. Stop pretending. \n\nNow don't get me wrong. I'm a profitist. Profits are great. There's nothing wrong with profit being a motivation. \n\nJust be honest. Stop pretending that there are other motivations when there aren't. Stop pretending that a service is provided to the majority, when the likelihood is that a service is provided to the minority. Stop pretending that reasonable levels of margin are being charged when you're charging the maximum the market will bear. Just be honest. You're allowed to do all of those things. Just be honest. \n\n\"To call anyone a thief, a scalper, or any of those other charged words is simply inaccurate and kind of silly.\"\n\nWe've been over this, haven't we. Who did I call a thief? No one. So shut up. \n\nWhat's wrong with the word scalper? I've not made the word up. It's been in use for decades - primarily in regards to the resale of concert tickets at much higher prices than the original price. It seems to be the right word for the subject that we're discussing. \n\nScalping does appear to be different to flipping. All part of the same ballpark. Might be some cross over at points. It's certainly a gray area, as i've stated several times, but there is a difference\n\nWhat is the difference? Well I'm not sure, but my feeling is in the predatory nature of the scalping. Perhaps i'm not best equipped to explain - but to me scalping seems to be taking excessive advantage of a (momentarily) highly sought after item - and I guess it also involves actively limiting supply (by purchasing large quantities of the item) in order to capitalise on demand. \n\nIn some countries scalping is illegal.

Because there are victims. \n","672":"I've done whatever it takes to reduce the amount of driving errands I have to do.

I could be considered a fanboy, if you will.\n\nI think that the Apple Watch will be follow the model \"who needs that\" and quickly become a significant part of Apple's business or a raging success. Apple has set this up as more of a fashion accessory than a \"gadget\". This is an important distinction from other smart watches, because while one only requires adding function (gadget), the other appeals to the consumer's need to \"fit in\". There are plenty of examples of certain items that provide no greater function, but are commonplace because of their trendiness (see North Face jackets, Patagonia jackets, Ugg boots, etc.) All of the aforementioned are functionally similar, but are considered \"premium\". \n\nBasically, I think this watch will become a status symbol. I can see it now, people judging you for owning an Apple Watch. \"Oh it must be nice to be in the 1%\". Okay, that might be a slight exaggeration, but it's something I've grown tired of justifying to people who ask why I buy everything Apple (which isn't even true since I own a Chromecast and Amazon Firestick). I buy Apple products because they work well together and I can choose other services that those other than Apple offer. For example I use Google Play because functionally it's no different than iTunes Match, but it's free! \n\n\nArgument for Apple Watch functionality:\n* There's a lot we don't know about the Apple Watch, but I always point out the following when somebody says it's too expensive.\n\n* This watch can store music like an iPod (albeit probably not the same amount)\n\n* This watch can consolidate functions of other devices (timepiece, Fitbit, heart rate monitor)\n\n* The other functionalities we don't even know about yet. The possibilities really could be endless. I've read some going as far as an application like Snapchat that takes the app world by storm. Or something as simple as replacing car keys (Tim Cook actually commented on this).\n","675":"I feel that your nitpicking a lot of the presentation without looking at the higher level analysis (which is all a 15 min presentation is good for). \n\nYour complaint about the definition of \"about 1300\" is strange but perhaps fair. I don't know what to think about it, but it's prerogative to treat the presenter as a \"liar\" if that's what you want to do. \n\nI don't understand your second point about the definition of a growing company.

The only point of showcasing the wealth of these companies is to show that they have a huge access to capital that allows them to do things that almost no other companies could. (See his points on Amazons fulfillment infrastructure). \n\nYour fifth point about the use of share price as a proxy for innovation is something that did bother me a bit as well. Most people should be well aware of the extremely weak connection between share price and innovation. It seems that you want to use this slide as a sign of incompetence on the professor's part. This is how I rationalized that slides inclusions. He was trying to show that brick and mortar retailers are showing signs of success when fighting etailers like Amazon. He could do this by showing strategic analysis of how stores in high traffic cities provide tremendous flexibility and value. He could present Macy's as a case study and show the huge improvements they've made to their online shopping experience and compare it to Amazons. He could then do a cost analysis of Macy's online infrastructure costs to Amazons to show the financial\/brand benefit (if any)... Or he could just show the stock price knowing that it was an incomplete picture but hopefully a reasonable way of showing the ways that brick and mortar stores are successfully competing with Amazon. And yes, it still leaves open holes like how the stock price only went up because the stock was vastly undervalued during the financial crisis and the uptick is just a rebalancing. That's all true, but shortcuts are required when you're limited to a 15 min talk. \n\n\n&gt;Amazon's differentiation is that if you're a seller, you go to Amazon because it has all the buyers.  And if you're a buyer, you go there because it has all the sellers.  Let me ask you a question.  How many of you have bought something off Amazon in the last year without first comparing the price somewhere else?  \n\nIs your argument that Amazon differentiation is that it's the biggest? If that's true, that was also Sears and Yahoos differentiation... And look where they are now. Yes, Amazon is the biggest online retailer, but you're very mistaking in thinking that the listed one-click and same-day shipping were not huge benefits to the company. His point is not that Amazon will stop being the biggest. His point is that the loss of their differentiation leaves them open to competitors. \n\nUber\n\nIt is an Apples to Oranges comparison. And this is exactly why it's such a threat. It's asymmetric competition. Uber is not going to compete against Amazon. What Uber allows is for a thousand other retailers to compete against Amazons infrastructure. It will allow a new company like Warby Parker to compete with the same day shipping of Amazon. This is literally the commoditization of one of Amazons biggest advantages. (Assuming Uber successfully expands of course). \n\nThanks for being one of the few who's willing to discuss the talk. I appreciate it. With this type of high level analysis, there's always room for interpretation, which I personally find quite interesting. If you listen to the 2014 talk in the comments, you'll see that he was extremely bullish on Amazon last year.","676":"Amazon will usually freeze your account if you purchase too many $0.50 gift cards (happened to Chuck with a lot less than 100 gift cards).

I must be missing something.\n\nThis assumption is that Uber is not just a taxi company. The idea is that Uber could expand to ship people (taxi company) as well as cargo (shipping company). Basically, there is untapped revenue in all of the empty seats\/trunks on cars in the road and Uber is well positioned to tap into that unused resource. Look at it this way. Today, only Amazon can provide same day shipping for a trinket. They can do this due to economies of sale and the fact that they can bundle the trinket with a hundred other packages in nearby locations. A small boutique store has literally no way of competing with Amazon with the last mile of shipping (without excessive dhl\/post office fees). If Uber can expand fast enough, suddenly all of these smaller retailers will be able to compete with the fulfillment infrastructure of Amazon.

So Uber will be able to ship the trinket cheaper than UPS and Fedex?  Or faster?  Or a combination.  \n\nLots of small advantages\/efficiencies. Uber drivers are running all night picking up drunk people on Friday night. How much would it cost to ship something Friday night at 11:45 with UPS? There are small mobile infrastructure advantages like being able to track your package in real time. Uber would have inventory advantages. They can offset a lag in shipments with taxi discounts or vice versa. They basically (might) have a more efficient business model than UPS or DHL, and it wouldn't rely on economies of scale that benefit huge retailers like Amazon. \n\nBut there are also tons of expansion problems. There is no Uber route from San Francisco to Kansas. But there's no reason why they couldn't expand to make a Uber route between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The reason i ask you to delete your posts is because a lot of people come to this forum and they see 2-3 people write \"pm'ed\" and they say \"Oh this trade is closed already\" ... this is the reason i ask for that :) Still thanks for all warnings.\n\nThe way to determine if a trade is closed is by using the \"CLOSED\" link flair. Doesn't matter if you have 100 comments in your thread, your thread is not closed. Don't ask people to delete their comments for that reason.\n\nOther than rule 5, which is new (so no worries if you missed it, there's a grace period), you seem to not understand a lot of the fundamentals of how things are supposed to work from other rules, which have been around for a while.

It is your job as a seller to maintain whatever coverage you need for your sales, or you need to turn off your store completely.  \n\nIt is my understanding that although you can adjust your shipping lead times, that this doesn't protect you from the negative repercussions on your metrics.  it's basically being courteous and telling everyone you're going to fail ahead of time.  I'll do a bit of digging and see what else I can find.  ","743":"I'll throw out another tip.  Check out vidfall.  Granted, you have to pay for gift cards, but you can get them at huge discounts.  I've spent a ton of money there, and got lots of Amazon gifts, often 20% off.  That's basically free money to me.\n\nThe downside is they don't seem to offer the popular gift cards as often as they used to.","744":"The Amazon card is pretty garbage, to be honest.\n\nIf you're buying from Amazon directly, the Sallie Mae Barclaycard gives you 5% cash back on Amazon purchases.\n\nIf you're buying from other sellers on Amazon, you can get a card that gives cashback on certain stores (like, grocery stores or office supply stores) and purchase an Amazon gift card there. Then use the Amazon gift card to purchase from Amazon.\n\nBoth yield better returns than the Amazon branded Chase card, straight up. ","745":"Also do you want general purpose cards or one with large signup bonuses?  The ones with large signup bonuses are much more lucrative (I've made &gt;$3000 in the last year), but it requires opening much more cards.  The Amazon card is pretty mediocre, with no benefit over the Citi DC except the 3% at amazon.  Maybe take a look at the Arrival+, it usually has a pretty large signup bonus and 2.22% cash back when redeemed for travel.  The Sallie May and AmEx BCP\/BCE are all good grocery\/gas cards.  Anything that earns chase UR points will be good for transferring to airlines (Ink+, CSP).\n\nPersonally when I am no going for a signup bonus, I carry the Citi DC and the Amex BCP.

Back in 2006 AT&amp;amp;T was far from the leader in spectrum deployment. \n\nI'm not sure they were far from the leader. \n\n &gt;I don't know how you can believe they were the only company with the infrastructure to support the iPhone. AT&amp;amp;T was notorious for **not** having the infrastructure to support the iPhone for so long. \n\nThey could not handle the growth.  I don't think any company really could because no one expected such heavy growth data usage. \n\n&gt;Anyway, the real story is that Apple contacted Verizon (the real industry leader) first but they were unable to come to agreeable terms so Apple *settled* for Cingular (which quickly merged to become AT&amp;amp;amp;T). And regardless,  this deal **did not** help Apple sell more phones. \n\nVerizon didn't want to deploy iPhones the way Apple wanted to.  Keep in mind Verizon phones don't use sims.  There were other sticking points, but that's one I remember. \n\nHow didn't it help them? They to be with top supplier to sell any phones at high enough clip to matter. \n\n&gt;Look at the market research. Exclusivity helps you make more money in the shot term but they don't help you sell more phones (ask Palm or Amazon). That's why that entire business model is largely outdated. \n\nExclusivity is outdated?  The only reason worked because no one believed people would consume mobile media to the degree they are now.  Exclusivity has a place in business, I'm not sure what you're saying here. \n\n&gt;Finally, AT&amp;amp;amp;T represents just one market for Apple. It's a large one (not the largest) but hardly the only market. Attributing Apple's global success to a regional player is pretty disingenuous. \n\nThat's not even relevant. The point is the biggest success in Apple is the iPhone, which AT&amp;amp;T helped popularize.  Now they are being symbolically replaced.  In some ways, 100 yr old innovator\/visionary company has been used as a stepping stone. Kind of odd in my book. ","748":"Ended the day at up 46.46%.

You're super bad at this. \" is?\n\nHere's the deal. \n\nI've been honest in this discussion. I've acknowledged the benefits of scalping. I've acknowledged that it is a gray area. I've acknowledged that there is, arguably, a level of hypocrisy involved in my opinion (which many share). \n\nThat does not invalidate my opinion. It merely means there are question marks. \n\nHere's your approach. You deny that issues are caused. You declare that you're justified in fucking people over on the basis that others are fucked over. You present reasonings which aren't entirely explicit - consistently. \n\nI'm not saying I have the perfect grasp of the situation - at all. I'm saying that I have concerns about scalping, i've presented my reasoning and i've listened to you and others skirt around the real issues. \n\n\"more people aren't \"fucked\" as you so colorfully put it.\"\n\nColorfully? I was using the language you introduced, wasn't I? (I'm not going to check)\n\nI'm not going to read through previous comments but I'm pretty sure you said something along the lines of that given that most items will be bought by end users, what does it matter if the scalpers take the rest. \n\n\"With, or without resellers.\"\n\nYou're failing to acknowledge that the resellers exacerbate the issue - again. \n\n\"I like how your answer to your flawed thinking is to ignore, deflect, belittle, or be incredulous as opposed to responding.\"\n\nIgnore? I'm pretty sure I've responded, and I would say effectively addressed, all or certainly the majority of contentious points that you've made. That's not ignoring. \n\nDeflect? I'm still here responding to almost all of your points. By deflect do you mean countering your points? If so, that's how discussions work. If you make a point, and I disagree or see holes in that point - that I'm going to say as much - and guess what, you'll have the opportunity to do the same. The point of view that stacks up the best would hopefully be highlighted. But then it might be ignored. \n\nBelittle? \n\nReally. Let's see how you started this comment. \"Lol. You're super bad at this.\". Ok. Not such a great start. And let's see how you ended it, \"You're in the wrong business kid.\". And, again i'm not going to read through the previous comments but I'm pretty sure these aren't the first insults that you've made. Yet you wish to claim that I'm the one that's belittling. Well, I'll run the risk of being further accused of belittling by pointing out that you might need glasses, sir (metaphorically speaking). \n\nIncredulous?\n\nOh come on now. I've responded to almost everything you've raised, with points based on reason. I've not claimed flawless reason, but I'm doing my best here - and it's a damned sight better than what you've done. It seems to me that you've just slipped in the word for no good reason. Much in the same way that the other criticisms were slipped in for no good reason. \n\n\"How do you tie your explanation of scalping to ebay bids? how is that any different than what flipping already is?\"\n\nAre you asking me why I feel scalping is different to flipping - given that I'm against scalping, but pro flipping? \n\nIf so, then I'm confused as to why you've mentioned ebay bids - ebay isn't the only medium to sell flipped items. \n\nAnd I'm also confused that you're asking something that I've explained in detail several times previously. \n\n\"your constant crying over the poor victim who didn't get there fast enough can be applied to 100 percent of all flipped items. \"\n\nNo, it cannot be applied to 100 percent of all flipped items. \n\nYou know, this is where it gets annoying. \n\nThe majority of your comment is claiming that I have flawed logic and then you throw this beauty out. Not only is that massively hypocritical and blatantly wrong, but it's just a continuation of the \"pro-scalping\" view shielding their position from the truth. It's dishonest. \n\nLet me break it down. \n\nIf I go to my local thrift store and buy a vintage military book for $3, am I denying anyone? \n\nYou could argue yes (which is why i've acknowledged a level of hypocrisy) as potentially there could be someone that is a store regular that is actively seeking that specific book. Or, you could be realistic and argue no - that in practical terms it is unlikely that there is a store regular that is actively seeking that item. \n\nFurther, should you list that military book on Amazon or Ebay you are introducing the item to buyers that almost certainly would have had zero chance of encountering the book that was sourced. \n\nWhereas with scalping (a toy from Walmart for example), you clearly are denying someone. You know this. We all do. Yet some pretend they don't. But we do know that there will be many Mrs Jonnys mums that will specifically come into Walmart specifically to buy the toy for their child. And we do know that if the items are already sold that Mrs Jonnys mum has been denied the opportunity. \n\nNow is it fair if Mrs Jonnys mum is denied the opportunity to purchase the item that she wants for her child at a normal retail price from her local Walmat on the basis that other Mrs Jonnys mum bought the item? Sure. That's how the market works. There was limited supply, first come, first served. No crying here. \n\nNow is it fair if Mrs Jonnys mum is denied the opportunity to purchase the item that she wants for her child at a normal retail price from her local Walmat on the basis that resellers bought the item? Not in my mind, no. In my mind that is not fair. Legal, sure. Fair, no. And why not fair? Because it's selfish, predatory behaviour that inevitably harms others. Maybe inevitably is the keyword, or one of them - i'm not sure. Again, i'm not claiming to be an expert on the subject, i'm not claiming to have flawless logic (in fact, i'm claiming to the contrary given my consistent acknowledgment of a level of hypocrisy), but I am giving my opinion (that many others share) in as reasonable and detailed a manner as I'm able to. \n\n\"Yet this, this particular item, is your soapbox?\"\n\nIf there is a difference between flipping and scalping, and I am pro flipping and anti scalping, then why wouldn't I discuss my anti scalping views within a discussion forum of the same topic. \n\n\"You throw all normal ways of doing business out the door and criticize people over an amibo?\"\n\nTo be clear, i've not mentioned an Amibo once. As far as I recall. But sure, why not. That seems like a solid example. Gaming aficionados want their toys that have been beautifully crafted and marketed by Nintendo (outside of the dodgy packaging) yet they can't have them unless they pay silly scalping prices. A very good example. \n\n\"You're in the wrong business kid.\"\n\nThis is just condescending, pointless (literally) nonsense - which betrays your previous insults. You can't call me belittling and go on to belittle me. \n\nMore than that, your comment is nonsense when taken literally. \n\nYou seem to be suggesting, in a massively condescending way, that if you want to be in the \"business\" (I would prefer to say partake in the activity) of flipping, then you are obliged to \"scalp\" (or if you would prefer to say, charge high premiums on highly sought after items). Which is simply incorrect. \n\nI describe flipping as an activity, as opposed to as a business, as for me it is not a business. It is something I do on the side. I hope to develop it into a side business, but right now it's an activity and not advanced enough to be considered a business, even by the tax man. And to be clear, I think many flippers are in the same situation or level as myself. \n\nNow whether or not it's a business or an activity, either way the flipper always has choice.\n\nYou'll see this mentioned in a lot of flipping threads. One of the primary reasons (full time) flippers enjoy being flippers is because of the high level of autonomy that they have. They can essentially do what they want, when  they want. \n\nAnd that includes choosing what to buy. \n\nA flipper is not obliged to target highly sought after items. A flipper can choose to tackle such products, or they can choose to tackle entirely different products. \n\nSo I, or any other flipper, could partake in the flipping activity, or construct a perfectly viable flipping business without ever having to resort to scalping. \n\nIt's a choice. \n\nRecognise and acknowledge it as such. \n\nStop pretending. \n\n\n","751":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

If you want to use my debit card details at an online webstore, you'd still need my physical card, my PIN code and one of [these things](https:\/\/stock-foto.nationalebeeldbank.nl\/nationalebeeldbank_2012-3-711528-2_random-reader-rabobank.jpeg). It's somewhat like a mobile payment machine you usually see at cash registers, and I need it to make online purchases. It does something cryptographic that's needed for payments, although I'm not a security specialist, so I can't explain too much. \n\nIn short, my debit card is makes it easier for me to keep track of my budget and is a lot safer, although since credit cards have no real cryptographic protection at all, that's not very difficult. I never carry my credit card around, since I can't possibly need it for anything. \n\nI'm a modern man. I study at a place where I can pay for snacks using the NFC on my phone. I use a debit card for all other payments. I don't carry old-fashioned and obsolete things like cash or credit cards around. ","806":"The Sallie Mae MC has 5% on the first $250 for groceries, $250 for gas, $700 for bookstores (including Amazon). Since we take the statement credit, we receive $30~ a month from that card by itself. I'm not aware of a better card with no annual fee.","807":"Look at what\/where you buy, and get a card that caters to that (this is where tracking your spending really helps). I got a Capital One Quicksilver only because I needed a no foreign fee card for traveling, and those are the easiest free cards to get with no foreign fees. The rewards are *ok*, but the point was that I didn't spend 3-5% on all my transactions overseas.\n\nI buy a lot of stuff at Amazon, so for me it was worth getting the Amazon Visa for that alone. Pro tip: don't redeem the points on Amazon; you can go through Chase's website and redeem as cash back to your checking account (no minimum amount required, either). You also get 2% back on restaurants and gas, which can add up too. \n\nI have the Amex Blue Cash Preferred for gas\/groceries since those are my highest spending categories every month, and that nets me more cash back than 5% for 3 months out of the year. I get easily $150-200 back a year on groceries alone from this card.\n\nI prefer the cash back cards, because then I can maximize the rewards for each category of my purchases and pocket those rewards ASAP. I don't get enough time off to warrant a miles-back card or airline card. Your purchases or rewards desires may be different, so find a card to suit your needs. ","808":"Ah, I hadn't considered that. I'll look into that more as well. What does it mean if I can't find a sales rank for an item on Amazon? It doesn't get sold often enough to have one? It's a jigsaw puzzle.","809":"I think the [Digipass](http:\/\/vbh-bedrijfshistorie.nl\/image?p=168w600h400&amp;h=e2lpHqtdMbyxNbH1FVwUgQ,,) that came with my debit card came instilled the idea in me. The sheer existence of a cryptographic device that is required for online purchases (no matter how good the quality of the cryptographic code) makes my debit card safer than my credit card (which I actually loathe). If I sent you all the numbers written on my credit card, you could simply enter them in Amazon and use my money to buy things. I still wouldn't send you my debit card details, just out of precaution, but it would definitely take a bit more effort for you, if you wanted to spend my money. In theory, you couldn't use my money for online purchases unless you also had the physical card itself, my PIN code (which isn't written anywhere, of course) and one of these [\"random readers\"](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/62\/Random-readers.jpg\/1024px-Random-readers.jpg), which generates a new TAN every time it is used, based on the purchase that is being made. It's a system that is intended to ensure (as far as possible) that the person making the online purchase is in fact the owner of the card, and not someone who installed a key logger on someone else's computer. \n\nOf course no system is impervious in reality, but having any cryptographic security at all is superior over having absolutely none. Sure, credit card details will be sent over an encrypted connection, but anyone with a photocopy of the credit card could have entered those details. \n\nAs a detail worth of note, this device has recent become obsolete as well. It will be replaced with a scanner that will use photoTAN codes. ","810":"You can do it but it's basically a royal pain in the butt to setup because each website has different requirements along with different categories and policies.\n\nYour best bet, since you want to use Amazon, is probably design your own website with Magento then the M2EPro plugin can sync items between your website and eBay\/Amazon\/Rakuten. You just make a new listing on your website and it'll appear on the other sites, if it sells on say Amazon the listing is pulled from your website, eBay, and Rakuten. Orders, shipping labels, and such are all done through Magento if you want.\n\nYou could also use something like Sellbrite which adds markets like Etsy or if you want Sears specifically multichannellistings.com lists it as a feature but I have absolutely no experience with that website other than what Google said. You should be aware that some multi channel listing software will take your listing from your website and push it everywhere (the description, photos, etc.), other's only do inventory number synchronization, and some like BigCommerce's built in eBay sync, for reasons I can't possibly figure out, sends the description and ONLY the first image of your product.\n\nJust search Google for \"multi channel listing\" and you'll find a bunch of other solutions.","811":"Gotcha.\n\nSo it looks like you basically want a way to post new listings, etc. Correct?\n\nYou could probably do this with WordPress yourself. There's a little bit of a learning curve with installing and using WordPress but it's not going to be like learning a programming language and then learning how to actually be a developer after you learn the language. Plus, there's all kinds of WordPress addons to help you. You can simply install them and you're on your way. Looks like there's all kinds of Real Estate type plugins for WordPress as well that you may find useful: https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/tags\/real-estate\n\nFor hosting, I personally use [WebFaction](http:\/\/www.webfaction.com) at the moment. They are a great Django host, but you don't have to have a Django site with them to host there. I also hose a PHP site as well as just flat html sites too. They are $10 per month starting out and then you can add on features later if you need them when your site grows. It's likely you won't need to ever pay more than $10 per month there though as they give you a lot of storage and bandwidth. One of my sites receives over 150k pageviews per month and I've yet to come anywhere near my allowed limits there.\n\nGetting a domain name: I'm a fan of [NameCheap](http:\/\/www.namecheap.com)\n\nServer storage: You can use what the host gives you. As an example, Web Faction gives you 100GB of space with each plan. I also use Amazon S3 for storage but that's only because I've got users uploading photos and stuff. You likely wouldn't need to go down that road.\n\nMaintaining: You could do this yourself if you use WordPress. It's really not that difficult although if you're not used to some of the terms and stuff it may take a bit to become acquainted, but just ask questions in the various forums and subreddits and people will usually help. As long as you keep WordPress up to date then you should be fine. Just ensure any addon you add works with whatever version of WordPress you're updating to.\n\nHope that helps.","812":"The best way to turn Amazon Giftcards into cash is to sell the gift cards on \/r\/giftcardexchange. However if you already redeemed them to amazon credit (in your account) then you will have to get mod approval before hand.\n\nYou will get about 85-91% cash for your amazon cards, although it is often still better than redeeming elsewhere (even paypal).\n\nYou can ask for paypal, google wallet, bitcoin, or whatever other form of online cash you would like. Although paypal and google wallet are, in my opinion, the easiest to trade for.\n\nMake sure you read the sidebar there and ask mods if you are concerned at all, new people are the ones that scammers will seek out!","813":"Plus less waste and fewer plumbing clogs.  They can be found for under $30 on Amazon.","814":"I'm looking to go from MF to FBA on Amazon. There are several items I have that are strictly MF right now. What's the average mark up on a FBA item over a MF item?","815":"I think the Sallie Mae Mastercard is better for Amazon and gas.\n\n- 5% on bookstores which includes Amazon (direct purchases, not other sellers) up to $750 of spending a month\n- 5% on gas up to $250 of spending a month\n- 5% on groceries up to $250 of spending a month\n\nFor general purchasing, I'd look at Citi Double Cash (2% back), Fidelity AmEx (2% back into a Fidelity account), or Capital One Quicksilver (only 1.5% back, but no foreign transaction fees, good for international usage).","816":"If you use Mturk to make beermoney, your money goes into Amazon Payments and can be withdrawn to a bank account.","817":"It just means he is giving 80% (of the Amazon amount) PayPal in return.\n\nFor example: If I was him and decided that I want to trade for a $10 Amazon card, I would pay 80% of $10 in PayPal, which is $8 PayPal. ","818":"I have decided to forgo getting the Amazon card but I have a further question about your comment: could you elaborate on what you mean the following? I am curious as to why this is.\n&gt; It will limit your ability to get company-specific offers on your card in favor of store-specific ones.\n\nThank you for your responses.","819":"Thanks! I will look into these cards when I go about getting another card.\n\nAnd to clarify, does Amazon count as a bookstore regardless of the actual item(s) purchased? I don't buy my books from Amazon but rather purchase electronics and bike gear.","820":"Well it all depends whether you need large SSD or not. If you don't (and I'm assuming you're not because you're storing the files in the cloud) go with:\n\n* CT128MX100SSD1 (Crucial MX100 128GB - $67 on Amazon) - my personal favorite\n\n\n* VTR150-25SAT3-120G (OCZ Vector 150 Series 120GB - $79.95 on Amazon)\n\n\n* MZ-75E120B\/AM (Samsung 850 EVO 120GB - $79.99 on Amazon)\n\n\nFor linux I would recommend: \n\n\n\nArch + XFCE4 - pain in the ass to install but it's one of the fastest monsters arround.\n\nIf you're not \"tech savy\" (you don't really need to be to install Arch) install Xubuntu and you'll be just fine.\n\n\n","821":"Generally, anything sold and shipped by Amazon counts.

Note that I live in PA, so most of the time I buy things based on 1) quality\/price, and 2) proximity to me. I've bought things from the PA\/NJ\/NY tri-state area before and those are usually the slowest to come to me. I've had things from Colorado and Oregon come in 2 days (first class) and things from PA take a week to get to me that would be an hour from my house by car!\n\nI'd love to know how exactly some of this stuff works and why this stuff happens.","823":"Currently, I use Ipsos iSay, Opinion Outpost, ProductTube, and Swagbucks. So, I'll read through their reviews of each.\n\nIpsos: \n\nThey rated it fairly highly and I have to disagree. For one, their site is atrocious. Half the time you go to do a survey you get a message about \"coming back in 10 minutes\" because the site and\/or survey is messing up or you just get a \"service unavailable\" message. Because of this, I only go to the surveys they email me, which cuts it down a little, but it stills happens and it is still annoying. Second, they take forever to payout for Paypal, up to 3 weeks. Typically, I get my payment in about two weeks. Amazon is supposed to be payed out in 24 hours. Third, for the focus group and special offer surveys the payouts take forever to come or they never do. I had to email them about three surveys I did that never paid me (I waited until after the typical 6 week cutoff mark to email). Two of the issues were resolved after a ton of back and forth. The last one was supposed to have paid out in 7-10 days and it has now been 10 weeks and I still haven't gotten the $45 owed to me. That's after Ipsos confirmed with the project manager that I was supposed to get it. They have been telling me for three weeks that they are adding the points to my account. With all that being said, I make about $15 a month pretty passively. I try to take a survey when it gets emailed to me and when I complete it that's fine and if I got an error message I get over it because I'm so used to it. Plus, I have gotten a couple good product testings from them. Also, you get 5 points, 5 cents, if you are disqualified from a survey. While that doesn't sound like much it is better than nothing. As for redemption levels, you have to have $15 for PayPal and I believe $10 for Amazon. \n\nOpinion Outpost: \n\nAlso rated highly and I agree. By far my favorite one to use. The payout is super fast, most of the time almost instant. I think the longest I have waited was two hours and that was on a weekend. I get a lot of product testing through them and several great focus groups. Some downfalls, you have to wait until you have $5 to get Amazon credits or $10 for PayPal, but that's better than other sites. Their customer service is lacking. If you ever get wrongly disqualified from a survey (ie you actually completed it, but got directed to the wrong screen) they never give you the points. Also, it takes a while to start getting in a lot of surveys, but once you do it is easy to rack up the points. \n\nProductTube:\n\nRemoved\n\nSwagbucks:\n\nHighest rated of the 3 on the site that I use, which isn't surprising because it is the favorite of many and I have to agree. This month I cashed out $100 from them. I make most of my points by doing surveys and some of the quick and free special offers. However, they are bad about surveys not crediting or wrongly disqualifying you and a lot of the special offers won't credit you either. You can submit tickets for these, which I did for the bigger point ones, but they get to the point where they won't credit you anymore. There used to be a long wait for payouts, but now I think they all come in about 1-2 days. They also have $3 Amazon cards which is nice if you want to redeem for lower values. Or you can wait and save 2200 points and get one $25 card once a month, after that the cards are 2500 again. They also have other denominations and a ton of options for redemptions. As for the surveys, Swagbucks often rewards you with less points than if you did the same survey on Opinion Outpost. For example, I have gotten similar magazine surveys on Opinion Outpost and Swagbucks and OO gave me $1 while SB gave me $.60. This is because Swagbucks is a hosting site or gateway for other survey companies. Because of this, surveys also tend to get filled up quickly. Lots of people make their money running the video apps, but I've never done those. There is also a reddit board dedicated to it if you want to look into this one further.\n\n\ntl;dr: I don't agree with the rating of Ipsos. I like Opinion Outpost best, but make the most on Swagbucks. ProductTube is worth signing up for even if you only get the first survey done and nothing else. ","824":"Sure. The card is a Chase card, right?  You log into Chase's site, and you pay Chase your interest.  But you get the Amazon store credit bonus, not the typical bonus points, double points for rotating categories, or other \"chase-specific\" card perks like your Freedom card gives you.  You've traded in the opportunity for Chase's perks for the Amazon perks.  You don't often get both.\n\nThe card, interest and limit are the same either way, so you should pick the card that offers the bonuses you want.  Sometimes store perks can be better (Costco is a great example) but not usually, since they're a lot more limited in use.","825":"You should never have to ask about the interest rate of the card - it should be irrelevant because you should never, ever carry a balance. If you do, any benefit from points\/cash back will be swamped. Just set it to pay automatically in full every month.\n\nIt's a great card for Amazon, even better than Amazon's own (which offers 3% back) unless you need to make a very large purchase.","826":"A bidet and one wipe with TP is the ideal solution. A bidet doesn't clean you all the way off, you need at least a single wipe. I nearly never wipe twice when using my bidet. Get the $30 attachment on Amazon and give it a try, it'll change your life.\n\nFlushable wipes will fuck up your plumbing, don't do it.","827":"Going to give my two cents here:\n\n* Eating out should be a rarity, once a month, maybe twice at the very most, use your best judgement, and realize how expensive it is.\n* Yes, dear God, learn to cook. Anybody can cook, you may not be able to develop a natural sense for cooking beyond following a recipe, but if you can, that's a very valuable skill.\n* Duh.\n* I definitely agree with this, I've never bought a new TV or monitor, only used and refurbished. I just bought a refurbished Thinkpad W520, which is one ass-kicker of a machine (gaming-capable) and I paid 540 dollars shipped. This thing cost easily 1300-1500 when it was new a few years ago, and it has all the luxury features, and it will be upgradeable for years to come, I expect this to last me a little short of a decade, my last laptop did.\n* Water is amazing. Try weaning yourself off of soda with flavored\/sweetened teas, and also give seltzer\/club soda a try, more for health reasons than frugality, it's still fairly expensive, but, I kicked soda pretty easily with seltzer, I don't even like soda now, really. I'm going to disagree with \"no coffee\" but, try and wean yourself down. Get a french press, and find some cheap coffee you like. Starbucks, etc. are verboten, and if you're willing to work a little, you can make your own drinks like those at home, far cheaper. Also look into loose-leaf tea, cheaper, better, and you can make a ton of it, or a little. You can use the french press for that too! Get a french press and an electric kettle, and you can make a ton of stuff.\n* Cheap food, can be, unfortunately, cheap for a reason. Junk food is bad for you. Duh. This goes hand-in-hand with \"Learn to cook\" if you know how to cook, healthy eating is much more attainable.\n\nAnd my own thoughts:\n\n* You're human, you need entertainment, I don't think this is a debateable point, so here's my suggestions:\n\n* If you're a gamer, either try and stay back a generation, when things get cheaper (So, get an Xbox 360 instead of an Xbox One, PS3 instead of a PS4, hell, feel free to go back further if you want) or try PC gaming. \n\n* God tier, do both, build a decent PC, (Or buy something cheap and refurbished, and upgrade a few components) and play older games. Steam and, to a much lesser extent, Origin, have good deals on games. \n* There are plenty of other places to buy PC games on the cheap, check [isthereanydeal.com](isthereanydeal.com) it's a great resource. If you're willing to put up with older games whose graphics might feel a bit dated, I can make lots of suggestions on classics.\n\n* TV\/Movies: No cable. No. Just no. No cable, no satellite. No going out to the movies. Save a ton of money, get some combination of the following:\n* Netflix\n* Sling TV\n* Hulu (Some stuff is free!)\n* Crackle (Free!)\n* Amazon Prime (Excellent if you shop there a lot)\n* Google Play Movies has good deals\/free movies at times.\n* Vudu has okay sales sometimes.\n* Sub-section: Ultraviolet, lots of people either don't like it, or don't know what it is, but, a lot of websites will offer you free movies if you make an ultraviolet account and link it to their site. They're older movies, but there's some good stuff in there. I can expand on that if desired.\n\n* Books: Yes, books are good. Go to Goodwill, go to used bookstores. Books are good for your brain. Check Project Gutenberg if you don't mind old books. Amazon\/Google Play have good deals on eBooks\n\n* I have lots of other tips, but I'm going to end the post here to gauge interest. I don't know if this post will be well-received, as these are more \"low-cost\" than \"bare-minimum\" but, hoping there's some demand here.","828":"~~That's true but I believe Chase limits cards to two credit lines per person. So OP would wind up having to cancel the Freedom or Amazon card to get, say, a Sapphire Preferred card.  Just something to keep in mind.~~\n\nThere are no limits to number of cards, I was wrong.","829":"Just curious, is this a gift card or Amazon balance?\n","830":"Amazon reports your earnings to the IRS at $20,000 in received payments (this includes any shipping the buyer pays and does not factor in refunds) and 200 transactions in a year.\n\nLegally, you are required to file taxes on your earnings at a much lower amount (the exact amount will depend on your filing status as well as the amount(s) and type(s) of income you have).  If you are unsure if you are required to file, you may wish to talk to a tax professional.","831":"*checks le RewardRack*\n\nDarn, my first one is still processing. However, if they are actually paying out, then in about a month, I will have a $50 gift card for Amazon (just a few hundred points away from cashing out for said gift card). \n\nAlso, I'm not sure how long they'll be around either, but considering about a week ago (I think) they upgraded their servers (according to what the website said when I tried logging into it), they may be around for a little bit. But then again, who really knows, besides them?","832":"Also consider the AMEX Blue Cash Preferred. This gives 6% back at supermarkets (does not include wholesale, such as BJs\/Costco\/Sams Club), but **does** apply towards cards purchased at that supermarket.\n\nStock up on gas cards, Amazon cards, and hell: even loading VISA cards with it breaks down to be a net gain, despite not rewarding as much of a return as the aforementioned other options due to the activation fee --\n\n* $500 VISA gift card + $5.95 activation fee = $505.95\n* $505.95 * 0.06 = $30.36 in AMEX cash back\n* $30.36 - $5.95 = $24.41 net cash back\n\nIf you do that 12 times to hit the $6000\/yr AMEX spending cap on their 6% cash back rate, you are making $292.92 per year ($217.92 after $75 annual fee) just in using VISAs and eating the activation fees.\n","833":"Replying to you (as well as my initial post above) because I also use the AMEX BCP. If you weren't aware, gift card purchases made *at* grocery stores also reward you with 6% cash back.\n\nWith this, you can purchase Amazon\/Gas\/restaurant cards and receive 6% cash back when you'd ordinarily receive much less just by using your AMEX at those locations. Stack onto this that some places (Kroger, Harris Teeter, Publix) occasionally discount their giftcards, and that some places have incentives on their giftcards near holidays (ie: buy 25$ giftcard, get a 5$ one free), and you've got yourself a substantial savings + cash back combo.\n\nFinally, you may also be able to tie this in with a gas reward card if there are any gas stations that are partnered with grocery stores for a few cents per gal savings at the pump.","834":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

That way, you can put stuff in it either at night before you go to bed, or in the morning before you leave for class, and when you come back in a few hours, you have a nice hot meal waiting for you. For that, you might check out \/r\/slowcooking. You can also google around for recipes. \n\nPlan your meals around your grocery store's sales. \n\nIf you drive, it will behoove you to learn how to do as many of your own car repairs as you're comfortable doing. It'll save you a metric fuckton of money, which you can use for more productive ends. \n\nUse technology to find the best deals. There are a TON of online sites that let you download coupons. Some places even offer their own coupons directly on their sites. You find this a lot with oil change places, but it's not limited to them. There are also smartpone apps that are designed to find you good deals on such. Others may be able to elaborate more on this, as I don't have a smartphone. \n\nRack up the fuel points, if you're near a Kroger (or a store in the Kroger family). If you're going to be buying something on ebay or Amazon, first go to Kroger and buy a gift card for Amazon or ebay. You just got double the value of the gift card in fuel points. They also sell gift cards to many restaurants, stores, home improvement stores, etc. Btw, Kroger fuel points are also redeemable at Shell gas stations, but only up to $0.10 off per gallon, and Kroger sells Shell gift cards. Sadly, you don't get points for purchasing Kroger gift cards; they're not that generous. haha. If possible, download the Gas Buddy app to your phone. That will also help with finding a good price (which is handy for when you don't have any fuel points to redeem). \n\nYou may want to look into something called \"even billing\" with your utility company. Basically, your bill will be the same each month. But at the end of the year, you'll have to \"settle up\" any difference between what you've paid for the year, and what you actually owe. Does that make sense? Depending on how much you owe, how much you use, and how much your even billing amount is, the settle up bill may be very small (our last bill for 2014 was actually $0.00 b\/c the way it ended up, we didn't owe them anything) but that's not guaranteed.

It all depends on your skin, and you'll see the phrase \"your mileage may vary\" tossed around a lot and it's very accurate. The best thing for new wetshavers to do is to buy a sample pack with many different blades and try them each a few times until they find the perfect fit.\n\n* Ditch the canned goop. Buy a cheap brush (I'd recommend the Omega 20102, ten bucks for a quality brush) and a decent soap or cream and you'll never *want* to use the canned shit again. Soaps\/creams won't leave your face feeling greasy after use, don't dehydrate your face, protect your face better, perform much better than the goop, and won't clog up your razor. There are also some amazing scents to try out.\n\n* Spring for a decent quality razor. A five dollar model from china will work, but for ten bucks more you can get a sturdier razor that will last much longer and weighs more, which does make a difference to your shave. [Maggard Razors](http:\/\/www.maggardrazors.com) has their own line of quality razors for 15-20 dollars apiece.\n\n* Watch tutorials on youtube and read them on \/r\/wicked_edge. There are tons of videos and posts on proper shave prep, lather building, angle of shave, etc etc, and they are incredibly useful for someone going into this with no clue what they're doing.\n\nPretty much anything you need to get started can be found on Amazon, but there are countless vendors that offer better prices, service or both. My go-to vendor is the aforementioned  [Maggard Razors](http:\/\/www.maggardrazors.com). It's run by a husband\/wife team who are both enthusiasts and are extremely knowledgeable. They have a brick-and-mortar location in Michigan, their own line of high-quality products and are very active on \/r\/wicked_edge and other shaving forums. Most importantly of all they provide the best customer service I've ever seen. Place an order and you'll soon receive a personalized confirmation via email (within the hour in my experience) and they usually get it shipped out the same day. Overall amazing people and I'll gladly spend a few bucks more (though their prices are very good) to support them.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to try this. I used to dread shaving, now it's an enjoyable experience, I've never had a better shave and my face looks better than ever. Irritation and burn is rare (and usually my own fault) and I haven't nicked myself since I was learning to use a safety razor two years ago.","896":"I haven't checked into buying my dog's food on Amazon, but if you live in the US there is small chain of pet products\/grooming stores called Petsense. I'm paying anywhere from $10 to $15 less than at major retailers. You get a discount with your first purchase and after so many pet food purchases you get a free bag of pet food. Their selection is great too. They have the food stuff. ","897":"Do Amazon Prime products tend to be more expensive?","898":"Even buying Sriracha sauce is easier to buy on Amazon.   My supermarket only carries it sometimes.   ","899":"THANK YOU! I just ordered more from Amazon yesterday. I ordered more from suppz.com just now for $20 cheaper!\n","900":"Actually my wife always finds a better price than Amazon. Many sites have rotating sales and coupons, so if you buy in bulk, it's a great deal. Check chewy.com, pet360.com, wag.com, and petango.com. One of them will be the winner at any given time.","901":"OK, that might be the best answer yet.  Going to see if I can get a bunch of glitter for $10 or something on Amazon.","902":"Any vendor in Amazon with better vanilla beans? Or just about any vanilla beans you can find in there?? ","903":"Thus the issue with commingled inventory. \n\nWhen you send in an FBA shipment it tells you if labels are necessary. If so it gives you the option to do it yourself or have Amazon do it for you. ","904":"Not when it's sold by Amazon. Amazon works off volume and doesn't have a high mark up","905":"Best source for cheap labels for eBay\/Amazon\/USPS shipping (4x6\", I believe) and FBA inventory labels? Seeing really cheap on eBay not sure of quality. \n\nFinally found 2 Zebra 2844s on eBay last night that should get to me in next 2 weeks thanks to customs\/Canada shipping.","906":"Vornado heater on Amazon turn it on for 15 mon and it will heat up a lot of space.","907":"Cool, you could probably get one for \u00a350 off of eBay\/Amazon and it wouldn't take too long to gain it back. ","908":"1.  You can look at completed sales on ebay or sales rank on Amazon.  \n\n2.  Stick to one category if you sell a LOT of that category otherwise just sell what you find.\n\n3.  Look for books that are more (there's a lot of scanning involved) not every one is going to be worth a lot.  However some people make a little bit off of the $0.01 books with the shipping reimbursement.\n\n4.  Some China gets good money but most is essentially worthless to try to sell online because shipping something heavy and fragile kills margins.  Replacements.com is a good source as well if you just want to offload stuff.\n\n5.  There's a lot of money to be made on used clothing.  Those $15-$20-$30 polos aren't the ones from Kohls.  They're from the brand stores.  And yes they buyers are still saving money.  What was once a $100 shirt is on ebay for $30, SOLD.  There's also a lot of money to be lost trying to flip clothes.  You need to know the market and the brands really well.  Or you could just nickel and dime it and sell through tons of midlevel stuff.","909":"Newegg seems to be pretty comparable and sometimes better then Amazon for me. They also have a slightly larger selection for computer components.","910":"&gt;How do I know if an item is actually selling. It seems like most of the antiques I have found in the store and on eBay are posted but have no bids or only has a buy now price.\n\nLook at the \"sold\" listings.\n\n&gt;For Amazon FBA, should you stick to only one category of items? Can I post anything I think would sell, or is it smarter to run a \"store\" on Amazon, selling just electronics, or just kitchenware, ect..\n\nYou have to be accepted by Amazon to sell in certain categories, other than that you should sell whatever makes you a profit.\n\n&gt;People on YouTube constantly say they are making money flipping books on Amazon FBA. Every book I found was selling used on amazon for $0.01. What's the deal?\n\nAmazon gives you a shipping stipend, those sellers make a dollar of so per book, volume makes it worth it for some.\n\n&gt;I am skeptical people buy antiques so much.. I see a lot of really nice cheap China dinner sets at thrift shops **which people generally perceive to have value.** But I don't know a single person under 50 with a China set. Do people really still buy this stuff? I understand the desire for old commercial kitchen appliances for their quality, but china doesn't have that functionality.\n\nWho says they have value? They only have value if people want them. Back to the checking ebay sold listings.\n\n&gt;I see people on YouTube talk about selling clothes all the time and it seems NUTS. People talk about selling used Polos and sweaters. Saying they'll get $15-$20-$30 on EBay.. THATS NUTS!! I buy new clothes at khols for that price! People who want to buy used clothes are trying to SAVE money right? Is anyone paying more than $5 for a NICE used BRAND NAME article of clothing?\n\nPeople pay for quality, the clothes you buy at Kohls are not the clothes most people are selling. \n\n\nAs a side note on clothes, I bought myself some waffle fabric long sleeve shirts a few years back on clearance at old navy, love those shirts. Have not been able to find them since. If someone had them in good shape on ebay I would buy them even though they are used. So there are other reasons to buy used.","911":"A friend of mine moved off the grind in nowhere Idaho. She orders household goods and groceries from Amazon cause it's cheaper than driving all day, to and from, to get to the nearest Target.","912":"90% of my stuff is new and sealed toys. Do you think this is something worth doing? From what I read, Amazon doesn't need to label brand new items but the sellers can to avoid their stuff getting mixed with another sellers.\n\nI don't see a reason for this unless I was selling maybe clothes or sunglasses or something. I don't know how many fake $3 marvel toys Walmart churns out ","913":"I sell brand new toys in the packaging so I'm not really worried about the counterfeit market on $7 toys but broken packages and such could screw me over if someone did that.\n\nWhat's from stopping someone from sending in a damaged box product and commingling it? \n\nDoes Amazon even look out for stuff like that?

That's a risk you take commingling.  Damages are sometimes stopped from being sent to the customer. If they aren't typically Amazon will refund you or remove negative feedback since this falls under them fulfilling it.
