I was thinking that the mark up would make it worthwhile, but there would be no variety in different types of pipes because you would be buying the same type of pipe in bulk. \n\nIt also seems like there is no one selling them on eBay or Amazon even though from the terms of service it looks like it's allowed. Is this because of some issue with the legality of paraphernalia? I thought maybe if you could just order two different types a month and continuously switch them out every month. There is competition but you could also lower the price to stay competitive.

{"id":"3cc52s","author":"4mbiguous","body":"I have just started working full time after college so I am starting to get more into credit cards and whatnot now that I am going to have some money to play with. I have been reading a lot recently about all of this but have been pretty clueless until now.\n\nSo I have had a credit card with Wells Fargo for about 3 years now. I applied my junior year of college and they gave me a $700 limit. What I have been doing is just using it for all of my spending and when it gets near my limit I would just pay it all off. I never carried a balance and I have never missed a payment (maybe once), but sometimes I would hit my limit and get declined and I don't know if that is bad or not.\n\nAnyway, now that I am working and my expenses are going to be higher I wanted more credit, so I requested a CLI and they ended up only approving me for another $200, so I now have $900. \n\nThen I went to BofA, where I have checking/savings, and applied for their cash rewards card and was approved for $5000 limit which was awesome. I also applied for the Amazon Store Card because I am expecting to be making some purchases from amazon and was approved for $400 there.\n\nNow I really want to apply for a Discover card for the 5% cashback on amazon purchases too which will double at the end of the year, but I am worried that I am making too many requests in a short period of time. \n\nI know the new credit lines don't affect my credit score too much, and I am thinking that the massive increase in credit will lower my utilization so much that it will increase my score too. \n\nI guess I would like to know if it is a bad idea to apply for this discover card after getting the BofA card and Amazon store card within about a week.\n\nAlso, I can't seem to find anything about how often your FICO score is updated or affected by activity. For example, since the APR on my new BofA card is 0%, could I max it out and only make minimum payments for the 12 months, so have a very high utilization and a lower score, and then if I were to pay it all back over the last few months and return my utilization to less than 30% or so would my FICO score shoot back up immediately? I just don't really understand if those past utilization numbers and things are continuously considered when calculating your score, or if it is just your most current reports... And how often I am reported on if that is the case.\n\nSorry for the length, all this stuff has got me really excited though and I am very interested in how this all works. Thank you guys for any and all of your advice, looking forward to reading your thoughts.","name":"t3_3cc52s","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-06 21:34:30","week":28}

The higher tiers require breeding to get there.  Unfortunately, there is no guide for what dragons will breed what, as it is randomly assigned for each account.\n\n**~ Tier 1 ~**\n\n$5 each time sold\n\n**~ Tier 2 ~**\n\n$10 first time sold, then $5 each time thereafter\n\n**~ Tier 3 ~**\n\n$20 first time sold, then $5 each time thereafter\n\n**~ Tier 4 ~**\n\n$100 first time sold, then $5 each time thereafter\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOn top of selling your dragon, you can get money by fighting and winning battles with your dragons\n\nLevel 1 : 1-10 Wins - 3 Gold Coins --- 10th win moves you to Level 2.  (gold coins are for slot machine and treasure hunt only - no monetary value)\n\nLevel 2 : 11-25 Wins - 5 Scales --- 25th win moves you to Level 3. (scales are useful for buying upgrades to your dragons, no monetary value)\n\nLevel 3 : 26-50 Wins - $0.25 --- 50th win moves you to Level 4.\n\nLevel 4 : 51-100 Wins - 1 Platinum Coin --- 100th win moves you to Level 5. (platinum coin is equal to $1 - can be traded for Amazon gift card or prepaid visa)\n\nLevel 5 : 101+ Wins - $1.00 and 1 Pearl (cash is cash via paypal)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow you're thinking, wow, I can get some money, but what's the rub?  * Well, first off, you need scales to build some facilities (nest, breeding pit, training grounds) * and you need some scales to feed your dragon until it is an adult (26 scales required to raise your dragon from an egg to adult stage and begin earning money with it) * and finally you need 25 **touches** of your egg.  A touch is someone from outside of the website who clicks on your egg.  They don't have to sign up for anything or do anything else on TT, but you need 25 touches to hatch your egg.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo that's my appeal, please [touch](http://www.treasuretrooper.com/touchegg/21424/a379cbd157ade2c625eba35461020d85) this egg!  [non-ref](http://www.treasuretrooper.com)\n\n\nFYI - I've seen some posts saying TT isn't worth the time or effort.  I used to agree with this, except they have really stepped up their game on monthly contests.  Currently, you can get up to an extra $80 this month by killing it on surveys.  Personally, I will probably just hit the bottom tier for an extra $8 this month, but considering it goes straight into paypal, I'm pretty happy with it.\n\nPS - I've seen posts in their forums, they do have international users, but some things aren't available outside of the US.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nEdit - cuz I'm markdown dumb.","name":"t3_3cca5e","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-06 22:08:04","week":28}

{"id":"3cdoqx","author":"financeaccount1234","body":"Hi.  Going to describe my financial/credit situation, normal spend habits, the cards I am planning to get to reap max benefits on those habits, and then ask a few questions about going beyond this.  Appreciate any suggestions on alternative cards for higher benefits and/or thoughts on sorta general questions at end.\n\n**Personal info**:\n\nDenied for first card application 6 months ago\nApproved secured no benefits card (2 months old)\nDiscover It card with 5% category / 1% else and double after a year (1 month old)\nCredit Karma shows me with a low 700s score.\n3-4 hard pulls on each agency CK shows\nMid/late 20s with income in the 150k ballpark\nZero debt\n\nIt seems like something in the ballpark of 25k liquid cash is ideal for churning, but I'd be willing to play with more if the ROI is reasonable.  I've come to this number based on seeing a high of 15k CC direct deposit into LMCU, plus 1-2 bank sign up bonuses worth several hundred dollars with balances in the neighborhood of several thousand, plus a few more thousand tied up in MS loops.\n\nSpending profile: Eat out every meal (only buy fresh fruit, beverages, etc. for home food).  Spend 10k-15k on hotels per year.  Spend about 2.5k-3k on gas per year.  Most of the rest of the money I spend is on Amazon.  All of my home bills have to be paid in cash or check (maybe one exception), no rent or mortgage payment.\n\n**Reward goals**: \n\nI never fly and don't really have any desire to do so.  Free hotel stays, cash back, and straight profit (new savings account at PNC for example) appeal to me.\n\n**Plans**:\n\nI plan to acquire the Sallie Mae card for the year round 5% Amazon cash back.\n\nI also plan to acquire the Wyndham Rewards Visa Signature.  These are the brands I stay at the most, so the 10 points per dollar (with no card) plus 5 extra (with the card) = $1000 of spend for 15,000 points.  They recently made it so that  a flat 15,000 gets you a night at any Wyndham hotel (the nicer ones are ~$500) so I value these at 3.3 cents per point or 15.9 cents per dollar cash back on Wyndham stays.\n\nAs a backup for when I don't stay at Wyndham properties, I am thinking Citi ThankYou Premier for the 3 points per dollar on hotel spend.\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature for 5% choice categories as needed (my secured card is a U.S. Bank Visa and I read that upgrading an existing card with them is the easiest way to get Cash+)\n\n---\n\nAt this point there is a lot more I want to do, but I don't know the best way to go about it.  The above is mostly just straight rewards for regular spend, not churning really.\n\nFirst question.  How do I go about getting a CL in the neighborhood of $15k on a card to reap max benefits from LMCU offer for example?  My Discover It isn't even remotely close, but it seems like people in much worse financial condition than me have these monster CLs anyway.\n\nShould I delay going for a monster CL on one card until I have acquired all the cards I want with appropriate CLs for their category spending?  It seems like having too high overall CL can hurt your chances for new cards.\n\nSay I want to get the $300 PNC sign up bonus for 5k direct deposit left 6 months (over 12% ROI pretty yummy).  Might as well do CC -&gt; gift cards -&gt; bluebird -&gt; PNC on a card with big sign up bonuses for $5k spend.  I see credit cards with $500 value sign up bonuses on 5k or less spend, which bumps me up to 35% ROI - pretty insane.\n\nFrom what I gather, the best way to do this is:\n\n - buy prepaid pin enabled VISA cards ($500 for ~$5 fee)\n - load these to bluebird at WalMart\n - use bluebird to deposit to PNC\n\nYou have to repeat this process 10 times though, right?  That seems kind of ridiculous.  Are there not easier ways to churn high dollar amounts?\n\nWhat cards do you target for signup bonuses dependent on spend for those of us who are not that interested in flying?\n\nHow much do you value a hard pull?","name":"t3_3cdoqx","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-07-07 04:41:22","week":28}

{"id":"3cf9vv","author":"GingerShroom","body":"Hi /r/personalfinance, I've been trying to become more diligent about budgeting, saving and paying off my loans, but even after reading your wiki and making a Mint.com account, I still feel frustrated and lost. I know I'm making some financial mistakes, but I really need some personal advice to make sure I'm doing the right thing. Even if one person reads this I would be more than grateful:\n\nI have a few major financial concerns that I need to address immediately:\n\n* I haven't filed my taxes yet this year.  My Dad has always done them, and last year he did them, now I owe fed + state approx. $1,000. \n\n* I haven't been paying my student loans. Idk if I should consolidate, or what programs to apply to. I have 5 different loans with varying interest rates from 6.8% to 3.4% that add up to $20,951. Studentloans.gov estimates/says If I consolidated, I'd have an interest rate of 5.125%.\n\n* My emergency fund is almost non-existent because I kept having to dip into it. I have $200 set aside right now though.\n\nSome more helpful info, I graduated college May 2014 with a job lined up in early childhood education. Because of the time lapse in moving, I didn't get paid from the end of June until the end of August. My SO moved with me and couldn't find a job until the end of September. During that time, our landlord and family friend, was kind enough to let us live there our first two months rent free. I am a few months away from paying her back. I do work in a Title One school, but I don't know how long I plan to stay here. I would LOVE to teach overseas for a year. I've heard that teaching overseas can be a good way to save money, but I'm not entirely sure if that's my best option or not.\n\nI'm not sure what else to post, but I can provide more information if needed. Below I'm including my monthly expenses that I can think of.\n\n\n* Income - $1980 from full time + idk what from serving from time to time\n\n* Health Insurance - Previously taken out of pay check\n\n* Rent - $700 (+200 extra a month for July-October)\n\n* Gas for car - $22 per fill up 3-4 times a month\n\n* Groceries - $240 (It fluctuates and we switch paying)\n\n* Netflix - $8.65\n\n* Animal costs - $100? (Rough estimate)\n\n* Car loan - $262 a month; $11,991.16 total left\n\nCell phone, Car Insurance, Electric, Natural Gas, Cable have been paid by my SO instead of contributing to rent. I don't exactly know how much he's paying honestly, and I know that's a problem.\n\nThese are my non essentials that I don't want to give up, but I'm cutting down on for now except the emergency fund.\n\n* Amazon/clothing - $0\n\n* Fast food - $0\n\n* Emergency fund - $200","name":"t3_3cf9vv","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-07 15:35:03","week":28}

{"id":"3chg2g","author":"Azphael","body":"Hey everyone,\n\nEverytime I need to buy new sports gear I need to do hours of research because each brand comes out with new lines of technology and introduces new names for their equipment and tech every year. It's unnecessarily challenging for a consumer so I'm going to make a quick site to simplify the process and keep track of name changes from one year to the next. I'll do product reviews to add content to the site and implement a better sorting feature to narrow down what a user is looking for.\n\nI figure I might as well learn something new while doing this so I'd like to delve into affiliate marketing. One of the major gear vendors uses 4 different networks such as EbayEntreprise, avantlink and ratuken. Is there an advantage to using one over the other?\n\nIn this case, I already have a vendor in mind. Is that usually how it goes? Or do you usually find a product and then find out what affiliate networks you can use and then go from there regardless of vendor? For example, linking to an item on Amazon that 5 vendors sell on one listing?\n\nThanks for answering!

{"id":"3cifpe","author":"ENOTTY","body":"As some of the folks who have been around this game for a while know, the Citi Forward card earns 5 TYP on dining, entertainment, bookstores, and Amazon.com. Does this card, combined with either the Citi Thank You Premier or Citi Prestige card offer good value? I haven't seen this question answered on the blogs, so I wanted to calculate it for myself.\n\nMy personal travel goals are mostly domestic travel and my home airports are DCA, BWI, and IAD. So it's about Southwest, AA, and US for me.\n\nThe Citi Forward has no annual fee and each point is worth 1 cent when redeemed for travel. It has no transfer partners.\n\nThe Citi Premier has a $95 annual fee and each point is worth 1.25 cents when redeemed for travel. In order for the annual fee to be worth it, one has to be earn and redeem 38000 points, which is $7600 a year in bonused spend.\n\nThe Citi Prestige has a $450 annual fee (with a $250/yr airfare credit so it's effectively $200 AF) and each point is worth 1.6 cents when redeemed for travel on American Airlines or US Airways and 1.33 cents on other airlines. In order for the annual fee to be worth it, one has to be earn and redeem (on AA/US) 33333 points, which is $6666 a year in bonused spend. On other airlines, you have to earn and redeem 60606 points, which is $12121 a year in bonused spend.\n\nI found it really interesting that the Prestige provides more value than the Premier. That being said, I don't eat at restaurants to the tune of $7000 a year. I also don't live near a Barnes and Noble (do those even still exist?). I don't know how to MS at Amazon without taking on big risk.\n\nIn the end, I don't think I'll apply for either card. It just requires too much spend. That said, the signup bonuses are sweet, but I want to use my credit pulls on other cards, like the Chase Ink+ where I know I can MS at office supply stores.","name":"t3_3cifpe","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-07-08 05:55:47","week":28}

I have thus sent 3 detailed messages to the reply address given to me in the email that said my account was closed. I use Tenso, a forwarding service, and I am assuming I was linked to some other banned account using Tenso. This happened to two other people as well when I made a thread on r/amiibo (I was importing amiibos)\n\nAnyway, every response they just repeat the same \"your account was previously closed\" and they refuse to listen to anything.\n\nHere's the issue. They have charged me for several items that were preparing to ship out when I had access but since I have no access anymore to my account or anything, I don't know if it was canceled or not. All I know is that Tenso has not received it and it's been two weeks.\n\nOne of the items I received a message saying I was refunded for one of the items. The charge still hasn't been taken off after about two weeks.\n\nSo if Amazon is gonna be a jerk about it, the only thing I can do is chargeback. I have contacted US Amazon and they just said I have to deal with Amazon.co.jp because they are separate.\n\nHere's is the next problem. There are several $10.51 charges, about 4 items that arrived at Tenso and then 6 that did not.\n\nWhat do I tell my CC company? I have no information to link which is which and Amazon is not cooperating. I'm thinking if I do the wrong one, they will just provide tracking and close the case. Do I do all of them? They were all charged within two days.\n\nEmails all list the same ship date, well for the 2 I got. The others I received no emails.

{"id":"3cpnva","author":"EvTheSmev","body":"What I generally do is at the end of every semester I will buy up a lot of textbooks for cheap that students are selling by using the school Facebook groups. The bookstore pays almost nothing so it is easy to convince people that $25-$30 for a textbook is a good deal. At the end of semesters you can also sometimes find good deals online even on sites like Amazon since no one is currently buying so the price is low. Then when the next semester starts I sell them back to all of the students taking the classes for a lot more money, but the best blind and bookstore prices are so crazy that the higher price is still lower than the bookstore price. Sometimes people quote Amazon to get a better price but a lot of freshman also only price check against the bookstore so you can sell to those people for a lot. I generally deal with high volume freshmen classes such as the entry level chemistry and physics classes. Another reason this is such a good market is that no shipping is required for all of your buyers. You can just have them meet you on campus so you are able to do lots of meetups in a short amount of time. You can even meet several different people at the same place and time as long as you are selling them different books so they don't get suspicious. It's a pretty good gig and you can easily make $40-$50 per book and you could make more probably if you really tried instead of just always selling to the first people interested in buying for a reasonable price like I usually do. Anyway just thought I'd share my method I use. I usually make about $750 for 25 hours of work. You could probably make more money if you put in more effort I just don't really have time during the semesters unfortunately.

{"id":"3cq3wi","author":"KevinHoda","body":"Hi, My name is Kevin Hoda. For 2011-2014 I ran a mobile accessories business selling cell phone cases among other things. It was a great experience as my first business. Before I started to stop operations, I had around 900 skus, and 50,000 cases in inventory. It was a great business, low barriers to entry, a fast growing market, and of course cases break a lot and phones get upgraded, so I had a lot of repeat customers. The reason I no longer am in this business is because I run a new company and no longer have time to manage a retail business. Since my manufacturing was in China, 20% of all my copyrights were stolen by factories in the PRC, and the cases I had licensed were counterfeited all over the web. Since I am a computer programmer by trade, I decided to start a Online Brand Protection company, https://stigmasearch.com I do plan to return to the cell phone case market, but I can only focus on one business at a time. Can't chase two rabbits. \n\n\n\n**Intro:**\nIt didn't start as a cell phone case business. I was just selling whatever I could on eBay and Amazon. I would go to thrift stores and look for stuff I could buy and resell online. I would go to book sales and buy books in bulk and resell them on Amazon. I would scan every book at Value Village looking for ones to make a profit on.  I also sold lots of computer networking hardware. This was back in 2011 and I found out about Goodwill's online store. Since I know a lot about computers, I would buy cheap hardware on there and resell them. I took a hit on some, made a lot on others. I remember the day I realized that making money online was a great opportunity. I had bought a brand name firewall for only $10 plus shipping. It sold used for $700-1000. I had listed it at $700 on eBay. I was in the Army at the time, and I remember it just like yesterday. We had formation before the day ended and during that formation we all had to stand there and hear the usual safety briefings and such, don't drive drunk, don't kick the dog, beat the wife, etc. After that, I checked my phone and saw I had a email from a potential buyer asking if I would sell it for $500. I replied I would and put the phone back in my pocket. Our first line leader came up to our section and started complaining about how we did not check out AKO email that morning, even though I did. He was a alcoholic and would go crazy for no reason. He later apologized to us afterwords after I logged on in front of him and showed that I clicked receipt on the email. After that I checked my phone and I saw the buyer on eBay bought the firewall and paid for it. Here I was having to deal with the usual military bs making little money, and in 10 minutes I had made about $400 in profit. It was there I realized how much money there was to make online, if only you would work on it.\n\n\nDuring the next six months, the business blew up. I was reselling everything I could. I had found a nice niche buying skin care products on eBay and reselling them on Amazon. The hardware I found at Goodwill was selling good. I stopped going to school as I would just sit there and think about my online store when I went. By December 2011, I was making enough money that I could do it full time. By accident, or it was meant to be, I got a box of cell phone cases for free. It was from a friend who ran a mall store getting rid of his old inventory. I got hundreds of cases for free. I listed them on Amazon and eBay. Not much sold as they were just plain generic cases, and the Chinese have cornered that market.  I spend hours each day on Alibaba talking to suppliers, looking at their inventory. I bought many different designs from these suppliers. After I sold some online, I realized I was on a gold mine. Cases only cost around $1 from the factory, but I could sell them online for $10-15. A very low cost business to start. During the first  half of 2012, I stopped buying things just to flip and focused 100% on cell phone accessories. Business grew so fast, I had to quit school and focus on it 100%. I was almost done with my Army contract, and through the grace of God, our unit was downsizing as part of the overall budget cuts and our commander asked if anyone wanted to transfer to a inactive service. I did and with that I was a free man and could focus on my business every day. I am still technically in the U.S. Army until 2017 however. \n\n\n2012 was a great year. I was able to move out of my apartment to a house, was debt free, and could do anything I wanted to do with my time since I had no boss, other then my customers of course. Keep in mind I was doing this all myself. I listed, shipped, imported, marketed, and did customer service all by myself. The two employees I had hired to help with shipping was a disaster. I spend more time managing them and fixing their mistakes then if I had did it myself. I decided when 2013 started, I would use Amazon's FBA for all my shipping and customer service. The 4th quarter(Holiday Season) was huge in terms of sales. Most retailers make the bulk of their money during this time, and so did I. Sales were so huge in December, I ran out of inventory within the first week. I had sold a little over 10,000 cases during that quarter, and the shopping season had two more weeks. I took a huge risk and sold inventory that I did not have. I ordered from China as fast as possible to make up for the gap. My main supplier was backed up from other orders, so it would take two weeks. Orders piled up and I had nothing to ship. I had about 1,400 unfilled orders. Since it was the holiday season, customers did not really care as they were used to slow ship times. Amazon did though. Since they had a program that checked all the tracking numbers and saw they were not delivered, they decided to inspect my account and froze my money transfers. Here I though Amazon would ban me right as I reached a new level. Luckily my supplier shipped a few days earlier then expected and I was able to fulfill them all. So much caffeine pills were consumed during those days. So much stress. But by the time the month was over, I had a nice $30,000 in profit to invest. That means 30,000 more cases. \n\nAll my day was spend shipping and dealing with customer service. I decided to go with Amazon's FBA and let them deal with shipping and customer support. Shout out to all those who have had to customer support. I have never experienced something so stressful. I swear half of them were on drugs when they contacted me. Sending them to Amazon was really easy. It was straight forward. I would put a label on each case and ship it to them. It was great, I usually had the buy box, customers loved the Amazon prime two day shipping, and I had so much extra time with my day. I went from 8-12 hours a day to less then 2. I really had nothing to do except accounting and once a week send in new inventory to the warehouse. That was one of my greatest regrets, not sending them to FBA, but the fact I did nothing with my day. I had a lot of net cash flow and life was comfortable. I did whatever I wanted with my day. Even though I chilled a lot during 2013, it was my best year. Since I reinvested almost all my net profit into more inventory, sales kept going up. That and each time Apple releases a new iPhone, everyone needs a new case. I thank Mr. Cook for releasing a new phone every year. The holiday season was ten times better and ten times less work then in 2012. All the work was done on Amazons side, so all I did see was the money pile up. Since there was so much data as I had 900 skus, I had not realized that some of my copyrights and cases I licensed were being sold by Chinese sellers all over the internet. The factory that made them for me even swore they did not sell my designs. I did a test buy with a different account and sure enough they were more then happy to sell my designs. Dealing with the removals of their listings was a one man fight. So with the retail experience I had, computer programming, I decided I would start a online brand protection company, Stigma Search LLC. I felt like it was a sign from above. I actually got to thank those who stole my designs. Selling Brand Protection is ten times harder then selling phone cases, that and the potential market is 100x smaller. A lot of competition, just as many problems. But I have always wanted to start a tech business, and those counterfeiters pushed me to do it. The retail business was great, but I could only focus on one business. That business was a great experience. So much learned. I do plan to restart the business sometime, but this time I will not import from China. I think later in the year I will start selling cases again. Not 100% sure. \n\n\n**Lessons learned:**\nI am not going to talk about all the problems I had. No matter what size your company is at, you will have problems. Just look at how much problems Microsoft, Walmart, McDonalds have a daily bases. I mean MCD has a same store loss of 2% in the U.S. this year. Microsoft has problems making new programs. Walmart has to deal with labour all the time. Problems will always exist. The best thing you can do about problems is to have the skills needed to adapt and react. \n\n\nThe only lesson I will talk about it actually doing the work. You get what you put in. Even though I made $600k during the two years, I know for a fact if I tried just a little harder, put in a few extra hours per day, I could have been in the two comma club. As said before, during my most profitable year, 2013, I did really nothing buy chill and hang out. Life was so easy. I would go to the theatre and watch a movie, and by the time I came out, I would have already made that money back. Procrastination, not doing work are the curses of man kind. How much would we achieve if we actually did the work instead of thinking about it or putting it off. I am guilty of this sin. So much wasted days. I can't give you a solution to this problem. I still fell like I do not put in enough work everyday. But the fact is even if you put in one hour a day, it will show results. I worked so much hours on my business in 2011 and 2012 compared to what I did in 2013. Every spare minute I had was used shipping, importing, going to stores and looking what to flip. If only I kept that work ethic during 2013. One of my greatest regrets. \n\nThe only other lesson I think worth mentioning is that you should try your best not to be depended on one channel for your sales. I stopped selling on eBay in 2013 as there fees were insane. The profit margin on a case is only a few dollars, and eBay charges about a dollar to just list it, compared to Amazon and every other store where it is free to list. I know, eBay has lowered their fees since then, but they did it after I stopped selling online. So all my sales were through Amazon. It is dangerous as at any moment they can cancel your store and all your cash flow is gone. That was pretty scary to me, specially since I had all my inventory at their warehouse. They charge 0.20 cents per item plus shipping to get it back. That means for the 50,000 cases I had, it would cost 10k to just get them back. So you may want to keep that in mind. You do not want to be dependent on a single channel. Just as a country you want to have your own defence industry, in a business you do not want to be depended on someone else. So I would say that is something you may want to think about. One of my regrets too was not starting a website. It would have been very easy for me since I know how to make one, but I never did. I paid Amazon $50,000 in commission alone in 2013, I think my web costs would not be even near that. \n\n\nAlso, if you are dealing with counterfeiters or others infringing on your intellectual property, I do offer Free Online Brand Protection for companies that are less then a year old and have less then 500k in revenue.\n\n**AMA:**\nFeel free to ask my anything. I will answer pretty much anything you ask. I have already put up hours of the business on Youtube in a podcast form. I covered the whole business there. You can see that playlist here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWc4rGZt2gU&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL_xrnHAvaAKojuQP9_1ZrkXVgHti0s1w5\n\n**UPDATE:**\nThanks everyone for the great AMA. My inbox is full of messages so please allow a few days for a reply. \n\nSorry, I cannot give anyone my suppliers or designs I sold. I am asked about everyday. Dealing with suppliers and inventory is a critical skill in retail. You must learn how to do it. The process of vetting a supplier is something you want to learn. I cannot build the business for you. In my videos I explain clearly how to import and how to deal with factories in China, and I also give clear examples of some of the designs I sold and how to find ideas and designs to use. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more, I made a 2 1/2 hour podcast earlier this year and uploaded it to YouTube. Link is above. If you have any comments or question, please put it in the video comment field as I will not be answering any more questions for this post. That and it will help others who have the same question.  I have around 2 more hours worth of information that I plan to upload, so stay tuned.

{"id":"3cs8k6","author":"101ByDesign","body":"I'm a bit lost to be honest. I'm 17 and I literally spend the majority of my day on reddit, business magazines, news, movies, researching random stuff, and [agar.io](http://agar.io/) Also I tend to bat around new ideas, but currently it feels like I just distract myself so I don't expand in terms of wealth. I constantly feel like I'm not doing enough, but instead of doing something about it, I distract myself further.\n\n\nI started an Amazon store around a year ago after finding a niche product. I've had LOTS of ups and downs doing so, but for the last few months I've steadied out at around 5k-6k in monthly profits.\n\n\nI've setup my Amazon business so that all I have to do is respond to customers daily, oversee my shipper, and add new variants of my product whenever I want a boost in sales. \n\nI almost feel like this store has zapped my motivation to move on to other things. I need to move on because Amazon can be quite volatile. (Imagine making 300$ Monday and then having a competitor get you shutdown by Wednesday. Forcing you to start from point A, all over again) I've come from nothing 5 different times, each time with more success than the past attempt.\n\n\n\nMy knowledge of eCommerce has vastly improved thanks to this experience, yet I do nothing with that knowledge to expand off of Amazon. It's like I've hit a motivational wall. \n\nI'm worried that I'm trapped in a phase that might not pass for quite some time. (It took me several months to lose this mindset the last time it arose) \n\nIt may be important to note that this isn't my first business. I've done other things throughout the years, and each time I've ditched my previous idea when I find a more profitable model. (Candy machines, Soda selling at school, laptop repair, websites, YouTube, game servers, etc...) Amazon is different from the rest though, as I've stayed with it longer than any of my past projects, which makes me worry that I may be in a rut.\n\nI suppose my true question is, are there any entrepreneurs out there who can relate? Maybe you went through a period of \"pause\" in terms of motivation? I feel as though the fact that I'm a teenager may be playing a role in my current flawed mindset. Can anyone confirm that this is a teenage issue that will eventually subside as I age?\n\nThank you all for your consideration.\n\nEdit: Added some evidence per requests. Well that goes to show your past can come back to haunt you. I've always tried to represent myself as older whenever possible. I understand where you're coming from, I'm skeptical too, so I would never take words at face value. \nTo clear things up though here's a pic: http://gyazo.com/c6ce88f3e9dd2741ae0696fab024f2cd \n\n\nAs to the story's authenticity: http://gyazo.com/bff6443be90f1411ec55848a0a45ae52 \n\nI use shipstation so my shipper never actually gains access to the Amazon account. \n(Turning 18 on 01.08.2016, then I can legally form LLCs) Born in 1998\n\nIf more proof is desired just let me know, I'll be glad to oblige\n\nUPDATE:\n&gt;*Just kidding! This was all a clever ploy to advertise [Agar.io](http://agar.io/)!*\n\n&gt;I'm kidding about Agario, I seriously needed some helpful criticism and commentating, thank you all. You're amazing.\n\n","name":"t3_3cs8k6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-10 12:27:30","week":28}

{"id":"3ctalf","author":"mrblahblahblacksheep","body":"&gt; Dear mrblahblahblacksheep,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The data from all of the extra participants who signed up on the holiday weekend has already been deleted, and therefore, we do not have any access to it and cannot use it for any purpose. Thank you so much for your interest in participating in our research study to build empathy in teens. It’s a cause that we really think is important and that could benefit many teens. We are again very sorry for the inconvenience that we caused to you because of our delayed response to the enrollment closing. We can understand from your perspective that you may feel like we have wasted your time or misled you. That was not our intention. This is what happened: we were not expecting the surge in enrollment that took place over the holiday weekend. Our programmer was unavailable to shut down the study until after the holiday weekend, and we acted as quickly as we can considering this situation. We have been working with our university’s ethical committee in trying to handle this issue. We have a limited budget for this study which means that we can only include a limited number of participants. Therefore, we cannot pay participants who registered after we reached our maximum enrollment goal. We understand that this may be upsetting and again, we apologize. We know that this was not ideal, and we are working with our programmer to come up with better solutions for future studies. We did not intend to harm or hurt anybody, and this will not happen again in the future. We really hope for your understanding, and thank you again for your willingness to help us and our cause.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sasha, Text to Connect\n&gt; \n\n\n**ATTENTION**\n\nIf you have participated in this survey please contact these emails: reep@iu.edu and irb@iu.edu. This are the IRB and Ethics offices for the Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. \n\nHere is a better email someone in the comments has sent: \n\n&gt; To Whom it May Concern, On July 2nd, 2015, I signed up for the Text to Connect survey, through Indiana University, from this website: http://www.texttoconnect.org/. I was really excited to participate in the survey, in addition to earning an Amazon gift card for my efforts. However, on July 7th, after completing the intro survey and following questions for 4 days, I received an email stating that I would be removed from the survey without compensation, because they had too many participants. I understand that many people enrolled, but it is highly unprofessional for them to not compensate me for my time. Nowhere in the contract that I read and accepted, did it state that the survey would end on July 1st (in fact, the website originally said through the 31st of August, which they later edited). This contract also clearly stated that all participants in the survey would be compensated for their time, regardless of how much they completed. I ask you to please look into this situation further, as it is a violation of study ethics and highly unacceptable. I hope the appropriate actions will be taken. Thank you for your time. If you would like to see any of the emails sent to me on this regard, please let me know and I will forward them.","name":"t3_3ctalf","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-10 18:30:13","week":28}

{"id":"3ctvuy","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hello!\n\nI'm trying to find a good companion credit card to use alongside my American Express Blue Cash Preferred.\n\n**Current credit cards/limits:**      \nI currently have two active credit cards: My first credit card from a credit union I no longer am in the vicinity of (moved to another state). This card has a limit of $500 and was the card I used to build my credit, no carrying balance. Opened July 2011.\n\nMy second card is my primary card- the Amex. I went with the preferred option because I was commuting at the time and the rewards were definitely beneficial. Still, my driving and grocery expenditures cover the yearly fee for the card and from my estimates give me more cash-back than the non-preferred card would. Limit of ~$8200, no carrying balance, opened February 2013.\n\n**What I'm thinking:**      \nI use my Amex for everything currently, and am having a difficult time finding another card to use to increase my overall credit limit and to add another account to begin aging. Since the most important thing for me is convenience, and I make quite a few purchases from Amazon, I was thinking the Sallie Mae Mastercard since it gives 5% back on Amazon purchases without having to buy gift cards from the store (from my understanding). My Amex would then be used for everything else, including gas and groceries.\n\nAlthough there's some overlap in rewards, would that be a good way to go? What recommendations do you have for me? \n\nThanks for the help, appreciate it!\n\nP.S.

Live at home. \n\nSince about 2006 I've been investing a few hundred dollars a month (supplied generously by my parents), on behalf of myself and my sisters, and that's grown into $137k. Mostly in blue chip stocks. Some of my positions were quite risky but I have outperformed the market, mainly through sheer dumb luck. \n\nAdditionally, my parents sold a house in the 80s and had that money in an overseas fund which they've had to close now. It's about $155k. Their plan is to give it to their 3 children to invest. My siblings don't know anything about investing and want me to choose for them. They have always been very hands off and I have usually handled the investments. My parents don't really care as long as we don't blow it on coke. I'm thinking that we should open vanguard accounts and drop it in some index funds (enough to trigger 'admiral' benefits) and forget about it. \n\nMy questions are twofold: \n\n1) Do I chuck it all in there at once, or practice DCA, given that I'm worried about an imminent contraction? If the latter, what's an appropriate rate of deposit? The money will be sitting in our credit union bank accounts, losing value to inflation. \n\n2) Should I liquidate my conventional stock positions and realize the paper gains, reinvesting this into something less volatile? Currently my biggest positions are Toyota, Apple, Amazon, Chipotle, and Ebay. \n\nThanks in advance for your responses.","name":"t3_3cu67j","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-10 22:21:39","week":28}

Am I deluded in that?\n\nI've visited a number of UK charity shops recently and haven't really found much that would make it worth a visit on a regular basis.  There might be the odd few pounds here and there but that's hardly going to cover the fuel cost (which is heavily taxed and expensive in the UK).  In a way I'm glad because it would mean that the charities have got their act together and are fully realising the value of what they are donated.  Well done them if this is true.\n\nAt the Wallmart end I've visited the likes of PoundLand which is probably not quite an equivalent but definitely errs on the side of \"stack 'em high sell 'em cheap\".  Here goods are all priced at around a pound.  After costs most of what I've looked at would yield on eBay or Amazon, uhm, around a pound.\n\nMy best RA results have therefore come from more mainstream stores like Tesco and Argos.  I'd love to find that I'm just not trying hard enough or that there are outlets I've missed!

Another well established site, they have been paying out since around 2007.  \n \nThere is generally lots of ads to view under the \"View Ads\" tab and a list of ads along with their payout. \nYou can also recieve tasks, such as Surveys and doing research (You get a $5 bonus for every $50 worth of tasks you do)\nYou can also try your luck with the Clixgrid. ClixGrid is a fun little game where you click anywhere on a picture, and  instantly, you can win up to $10. Each time you click, a window will open a website that will have to be viewed for up to 10 seconds. After that, you will be notified if you are a winner or not.\nFinally you can use the Clixsense toolbar on your browser and get notifications for ads, play games, listen to the radio and more.\nClixsense also offers premium accounts which offer some pretty good bonuses, such as signup commision, more chances to win in clixgrid, more ads to click and better referral rewards.

Instead you're paid in Market points, which you then convert into cash.\n \nThe best thing about GTM is that it's known for sending out lots of survey invitation every day (usually between 2-5 surveys a day)  However, you won't qualify for every survey.  When you do join up with the site, a number of questions concerning your demographics will be put to you. The answers to these questions help Global Test Market decide on the types of surveys you are most suited for. Answering such personal and spending preference questions will allow you to qualify for the right kind of surveys.  A nice little treat from GTM is that they provide you with a few market points even if you don't qualify for the survey. \n \n * *Payout Method:* Check, Paypal, Giftcard\n * *Minimum Payout:* $50\n * *Available In:* Worldwide\n\n-----------------\n\n\n\n[Prolific Academic](https://prolificacademic.co.uk/rp?ref=OZH9LMSH) | Non\n\nThis one is fairly recent.

It's since been changed and now you can sign up with a facebook account.  \n\nPA hosts studies for academics, you sign up and complete those studies.  The best part is that the payout rate is extremely generous, every study will give a rate of **at least $7.50/hr** and as a bonus, they are involved in lots of scientific research (who doesn't like advancing mankind as they earn?).\n\nStudies are posted quite numerously, several times a week, and usually don't take to long to complete\n\n * *Payout Method:*  Paypal\n * *Minimum Payout:* £5\n * *Available In:* Worldwide, but studies are targeted to specific demographics","name":"t3_3cwf9l","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-11 12:13:24","week":28}

{"id":"3czfcy","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hello, I've recently looked at the [Amazon Store card](https://www.amazon.com/iss/credit/storecardmember/ref=storecard_van), which allows you to pay for items over a period of a few months, rather than immediately.

This sounds good, but shouldn't there be some small text, or some loophole? \n\nI'm wondering about the following things (hopefully a list makes this post more readable):\n\n* Will I be paying for more than the entire item, assuming I can make payments on time for it?\n\n* Will I just be charged one sixth/twelfth of the total price each month until I'm done paying it back?\n\n* If I get approved for the card, will there be any charges to me if I don't use it at all?

I have 672.50 short calls with a 675 hedge in case. Doesn't pay a lot in premium, needless to say. But it's repeatable. It's pretty good odds. And it represents consistent cashflow (so far). I can't envision the stock running $15 without news, short of some kind of upgrade. (Which I guess would be news).\n\n*Incidentally I've been doing the same type of trades with $GOOGL and $AMZN -\nNetflix has been the only one of the three I've been caught out by. Not too long ago, some analyst upgraded the stock and it blew threw my strikes for a big loser. I scrambled and took a kick to the nuts that week. Still profitable for the year by far. I was well hedged but it was still painful.

{"id":"cstvm89","author":"AHJ-","body":"We started our affiliate program 3 months ago but I can still share my experience so far.\n\nIn our niche, there is no one offering an affiliate program and since the products are not available on Amazon, it was easy to get new affiliates since day 1. We used our social medias (700 followers on Twitter and 500 on FB) to get our first 2-3 affiliates. Afterwards, we put a link on the main menu. This allows up to get about 5 affiliates per week. It is not a lot but considering that our products are 300-$500, I think it is good.\n\nAbout the commissions, we are giving an amount good enough so people do not think twice about it before subscribing. The issue with affiliates programs is that it is often too low and if a new websites has no traffic yet, it may look like it is not worth it for them if they only make 1-2$ per sale for example. In our case, we are paying $30 per sales via PayPal. I feel like PayPal is a good way to pay affiliates and we guarantee that the payment is done after only 7 days of the order being shipped. A short time of delivery may compensate for a low commission.\n\nFor us, the main advantage of the affiliate program is not necessarily the direct sales but the links to our website it creates. Now we get reviews on Youtube and blog websites about our products which helps us get more visitors. It also helped us ranking up on a few keywords on Google which is always good. Although we are just a reseller, we saw a major improvement since then.\n\nWe currently use a Shopify app for our affiliate program although we can use a normal affiliate platform. \n\nI am probably not the best person to give my input since we just started but I just wanted to share my experience so far.\n\nGood luck!\n","name":"t1_cstvm89","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-06 17:32:38","week":28}

{"id":"csu64b2","author":"meowhahaha","body":"I've been going through some of the top-of-all-time threads. The amount of flippers that get screwed over by eBay &amp; Amazon really makes me paranoid.\n\nI've been flipping (didn't know there was a word for it), for about a year, mostly books I read and wanted to sell afterwards. I want to branch out beyond books/DVDs/CDs, but y'all have me nervous about it. \n\nThe amounts/ways/lack of appeals that Amazon &amp; eBay have is disgusting. From other redditors here, it seems there is no way to keep up with all the changing rules, the new systems &amp; calculations, etc. The companies can freeze or cancel accounts, repossess unpaid money in your account or even reclaim it from PayPal, and track the ISPs to make sure you don't open a new account. \n\nAnd there is no incentive for people to leave good feedback (I always leave feedback for everything I buy). Everyone with a slightly negative experience leaves a blistering review, but usually people with good experiences don't bother with a review. \n\nActual Questions:\n\n1. Is there any reliable way to know if my account is in trouble before Amazon just shuts it down? I know my rating is only 'fair' right now. \n\n2. I've never sold on ebay, but have items I want to list. What are the most common scams to avoid?\n\n3. Are both of these companies so customer-focused that I should just accept the seller will never win a dispute, no matter what? Or do I have to start photographing everything before it's sent? It doesn't seem worth all that extra work. Most of my sales are $10 or less.\n\n4. My descriptions are very detailed: bottom right of cover has crease 4mm long; spine has one line horizontally, etc.  Are these descriptions costing me sales (I've seen some opinions here that they are), or are they saving me from unhappy customers? \n\n5. My husband and I are disabled veterans. I was thinking putting a little sticker on the receipt (or even in the description) \"Thanks! Your purchase helps support disabled veterans.\" Good idea or not?\n\n6. On eBay, I can see how much an item is going for; on Amazon, it seems like prices are all over the place, including the same item with several different AINs. The same book will be priced at $5, then $50 on another AIN. Is there a way to tell how long that item has been listed at X price? Or what that item has actually been selling for?\n\n7. Do people actually buy X item for $70 when it's listed for $6 on another AIN for the same product? This type of overpricing must work if people do it, but I just can't understand how. \n\n\nThanks for all the info &amp; support. Transitioning from selling 3-4 items a month to listing tons more stuff makes me anxious.","name":"t1_csu64b2","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-06 22:05:01","week":28}

{"id":"csu6gjg","author":"HurtAndVirtue","body":"Sadly, not entirely. A pawn shop is almost the best bet if you only need a small sum of money short term and have something you wouldn't mind losing should repayment become an issue. I've actually been told a few times making a purchase or trying to pay a year ahead on a bill or service I wasn't allowed to, or they would only accept credit, or only payments. They will not let you own or use something without incurring debt is astonishing. Then they charge you twice for things, get you nailed for overdrafts and bounced checks on money that they had no business touching, good luck getting to the bottom of it playing phone tag between multiple companies for days to months which could have been avoided with cash at the start. Some credit unions work harder to help people build credit and tackle their debts once you've been had, even force you to prepare for your future with savings accounts and mutual funds as a requisite for membership. A lot of online banks are known to have low interest rates on loans and higher on savings because they don't have to pay as much for a work force or station, they do most of their operations digitally saves them millions a year in massive mailing. If you do go the pay day route what I would recommend is that you only borrow 70% of what you reasonably assume you can manage, it's always going to cost more and there are other hidden fees and charges you probably won't take the time to read about; like any other user/client agreement, deliberately worded to be misinterpreted or too broad for enforcement to be contested. I wouldn't be surprised if Craigslist had people who were independently wealthy essentially loan sharks, willing to contract personal financing. No matter what the situation or circumstance is, you have to be very wary of who you borrow money from and what it will eventually cost you. If you can accomplish a financial goal or obstacle by saving or being frugal that's always better, even if it requires more patience than you typically exercise. I just bought a new PS4 with spare change. I've been saving it since launch day, every time I visited a Coin Star I dumped it in for a Amazon certificate instead of cash voucher. It was better than dumping that much money out of my paycheck or several of them for a month or two. It won't really help you pay your mortgage, but it's nice. I've also invested my tax returns into pallets of popular merchandise from liquidated stores and warehouses, then re-marketed on Ebay. I made $900 in the end off iPhone 6 cases last week. It just feels more rewarding than spending twice as much to borrow what you need in the end. I also quit smoking when my daughter was born after a pack a day habit for 16 years. Now I take that $70 a week I wasted on a cancerous drug and gamble it in the stock market. A year on I'm only up around $400, I'm not even a minority owner of a start up, it's not a get rich quick scheme but I find it more exciting than flipping web domains or something like that. A good rule of thumb is that every living thing needs a food source, investing in that is rarely a failure, or to invest in something you use or believe in. There are obviously a lot of ways to get the money you need without having to beg and suffer for it, it really just depends upon your target and means to achieve. The only fiscal certainty there is in the world is that millionaires are broke, you will always spend to your means or beyond them, someone will make sure of it if you won't. You will never have enough, there will always be some emergency or expenditure leaving you striving and struggling. All you can do is try to prepare, and try to plan for inevitable failure.","name":"t1_csu6gjg","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-06 22:13:51","week":28}

We charge on a per photo basis, which includes photography and editing.  We’ve tried to make our service easy and non-committal so we only charge for images the client wants.  Our service is great for anyone who is selling on Amazon and needs the standard product shot on white.  You can see our portfolio at  [PremiumProductPhotos.ca](http://www.premiumproductphotos.ca)\n\nWe were also thinking of setting up a referral program paying around 20%-30% commission.  Not sure if anyone would be interested. \n\nWe are happy to answer any general photography questions or questions about our service and welcome any suggestions/criticisms \n","name":"t1_csukk70","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-07 04:56:01","week":28}

Give yourself credit for how far you've come already.\n\nYou just need some good PR and a few bits of luck.\n\nFirst:\nContact the local business journal and local newspaper in your town/region; tell them you've made a cool product, and send them a press release.  It's local, cool, etc.  That will get you some press in your local area.\n\nSend that press up the chain; perhaps to a regional paper/blog and step up the ladder.  \n\nList your product in Amazon.com marketplace.  Amazon sells more nests than anywhere else, so it could be a popular add-on item to the Nest sale. \n\nList your product on Houzz.com / Reach out to designers who've incorporated Nests in their remodel projects (esp. classic /traditional  styles)\n\nDo some Googling and find bloggers who've reviewed the nest and offer to send them a sample for a review.\n\nReach out to home design magazines like \"traditional home\" \"southern living\" etc. for inclusion in product guides.\nAsk GaryVee:  Send a little video with your product asking how to get good PR, of course plug your product / website.  Do the same with AskPat.  Those podcasts get hundreds of thousands of viewers / listeners.

{"id":"csul6mb","author":"MamaXerxes","body":"I just got married and I'll give my expense run down for another (cheaper) perspective. \n\nVenue - $5,500. This includes the space, food (about $60 per plate), waiters and cake servers, a bartender fee, and basic linens (table cloths and napkins matching our theme). This also includes about $200 worth of drinks for the band. We got married on a Wednesday. \n\nDress - $800. My dress retailed for $800 but I bought the floor sample for $500. I then gained 20 pounds and needed extreme alterations ($200). I also personalized it a bit for an extra $100. \n\nVeil, sash, and shoes - $50. I made my own veil for about $10 bucks, in the style of one that retails for about $200 (so $190 in savings there). I bought a pair of shoes from Amazon that came out to about $40 after shipping. \n\nMusic - $900. My husband and I are classical musicians and knew people, so we got discounts. This cost includes a ceremony harpist, a dinner pianist, an 8 piece jazz band and a 4 piece gypsy jazz group. Also we paid a guy to tune the piano at the venue because it was hella terrible. \n\nFlowers/centerpieces - $400. I paid a florist for my bouquet and my husbands boutioneer and ordered the rest of the flowers (roses and greens) in bulk from global rose. I and my maids arranged the centerpieces, other bouquets and bouts ourselves. They looked fucking awesome and I am hella proud. \n\nCake - $350. 3 tiers of awesome. \n\nChaircovers - $300. We needed black chaircovers and the venue didn't have any, so we got them through our florist. \n\nTable runners - $11. I bought all the black lace runners they had in the store and made 10, 6 foot runners myself. Super pretty. \n\nFavors/seating assignments - $100. I bought lollipops and hand wrote names and table numbers on stickers and slapped them on there. \n\nGuest book - $15. \n\nRings - $2100. Mine was $300 with a coupon from Jared, my husbands was custom. I am not including my engagement ring cost because my husband bought it with his own money about a year ago. It was about $300 from AlphaImports. That site looks shady as fuck but my ring is awesome. \n\nHair and make up - $220. This was for a trial and day of make up for me, and hair for me and a maid who couldn't afford it. \n\nHotel rooms - $200. \n\nInvitations/save the dates - $200 from vistaprint.\n\nOfficiant - $400. We had a secular wedding and had to hire someone. She ran a rehearsl\n\nMy husbands tux was free because Mens Wearhouse had a deal where if you had ten people in your party rent from them, the grooms rental was free. \n\nSo in total, about 12 grand. Not too shabby, and the wedding was everything we wanted. The easiest way to save money is to wait for sales and to not be afraid to do stuff yourself. \n\nEdit - forgot photog, because a family friend gifted us the cost, which would have been about $2k. Also we are in faarrrr west texas. ","name":"t1_csul6mb","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-07 05:14:58","week":28}

I can certainly see how people would blame the nearest available entity (airline or Amazon) though.\n\nAre airports running at maximum capacity? Sure. What are airlines supposed to do? Cut flights?

I mean, sellers get a much shorter end of the stick if they get ripped off than a buyer does.\n\nBuyers can always do a chargeback if they absolutely don't get what they want. If it's not what they expected most sellers will work with them depending on if the misunderstanding is a reasonable one. Worst case scenario for the buyer, they paid for a product that they didn't get. I know, that sounds bad but... Look at the sellers part of it.\n\nThe seller has multiple options to sell on (just as the buyer has multiple to buy from. Frankly, they won't find a much better price than they would on ebay though). The seller could potentially get more for their sale on a site (like Amazon) as opposed to eBay. It just tends to be the go-to. If the seller gets ripped off, not only do they not get the money for selling it, they also go further negative for the cost of the product, plus the cost of shipping, and depending on if they buyer is sending it back, the cost of a second round of shipping. The seller could try to sell it again, but that's depending on if they even get the proper item back, or if it retains it's condition through all of the travel. \n\nPlus buyers can rate sellers bad, however sellers cannot do the same for buyers... Which doesn't make sense.\n\nI don't know, to me it seems like there is a lot more hazard to being a seller than to be a buyer. Can't say I'm not a little biased though, being a seller and all.","name":"t1_csv5v74","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-07 19:15:26","week":28}

{"id":"csv9cjc","author":"sir_richard_head","body":"When I'm buying games (Whether to build my collection or resell) I consider anything that has a value of &lt;$10 to be worth $0.   A pristine copy will go on my shelf and if I don't need it for my collection then it's probably not worth the effort to resell.  By the time I buy a padded envelope and pay for shipping I'm spending close to $5 to get it in a buyer's hands.  Add in fees for eBay/Paypal/Amazon and a game that's worth less than $10 will likely be a net loss.\n\nSports games depreciate in value quite rapidly and people who don't buy them on the regular don't find a lot of value in them (especially because a number of sports games can be found in thrift stores for bottom dollar).  Many of the older titles probably wouldn't sell by themselves even if you priced them for $5.  \n\nMost of the games are readily available in game stores for cheap and flea markets for cheaper.\n\nI would part out all of the hardware.  Sell one controller with the system.  That could easily get you $100-$125 if everything is in good condition and it's a 250GB model (CL or eBay).  The wireless adapter might still be worth $10-15 if that is worth the time to you.  If not, bundle it with the console.  Sell the controller charger with one of the controllers on CL ($30) the other controllers for $25 (CL/eBay).  Sell the Kinect separately, CL or eBay ($25). \n\nI think your best bet for the games would be to check Amazon prices on them and list anything that is over $20 for Merchant Fulfilled, then for the remainder make small bundles like you have in the pictures to list on eBay and hope someone is trying to pick up a set of things.  \n\nAlternatively, you can check all of the prices and anything above your personal threshold for selling separately you can set aside and sell by itself, then combine everything else and the console into another bundle and try to sell it for about $200.  \n\nYou should easily be able to double your money, probably triple it, but a dozen or so of the games just aren't going to sell by themselves. \n","name":"t1_csv9cjc","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-07 20:37:11","week":28}

Look for good margins and things that sell well and see if you can get involved in /r/FulfillmentByAmazon on a large scale. \n4. If large scale doesn't work with your current $$ situation then start looking for smaller local deals to flip - /r/Flipping can help a lot there. \n\nI currently do a mix of #3 and #4 and am doing decently well with them.

{"id":"cswblu8","author":"sir_richard_head","body":"Disc media, for the most part, isn't worth a private seller's time on Amazon because disc media is so cheap these days.  \n\nBox sets and rare albums are probably worth it, but your average album/movie is not. \n\nThis example is just made up prices, but it should give you an indication of what to expect.  Let's say you pick up a CD for $1 at a flea market and it's going for $13 _new_ on Amazon.  The used price is probably in the neighborhood of $7-$10.  Pricing your item at the high end means it won't move as fast as if you priced it at the low end, so let's put yours at $8.  You stand to make $7 at this point.  You put the FBA label on it, you box it up with a bunch of other items, and you ship it off to Amazon.  Let's say that with all the money you spent on packaging and shipping your inventory to Amazon you averaged about $.50 per item, which isn't terrible.  You now stand to make $6.50.  Your item sells within a couple weeks and it's not on the shelf long enough to be charged a warehousing fee by Amazon.  Once it sells, Amazon takes their cut... you can get an estimate of the fee before you send them your items, but for something below $10 you can probably expect Amazon to take more than 50% (Since they have to cover the costs of shipping with FBA they have a base rate in the neighborhood of $5).  So now you're looking at about $1.00 to $1.50 profit _at best_.   You could up your price by a buck or two and hope that your profit goes a little higher, but that means your item won't sell nearly as fast.  People that buy used don't often buy the higher priced item unless the condition is significantly better.\n\nSo, knowing all of this, you decide if it's good or not.  You stand to make _at best_ a buck or two per item which is technically doubling or tripling your investment, but it's still only a buck or two.  You'd have to move a pretty hefty volume to make this worth the effort.  I can think of plenty of ways to turn a better profit with less hassle on the same investment.

It's not technically trespassing unless you clearly don't have permission to be there (signs, chains, markers, etc), or (in the case of publicly accessible areas) if the owners have asked you to leave. In most cases, the stores in a strip mall don't even own the parking lot, so it wouldn't even apply if the manager kicked you out of the store. You'd still be able to chill in the parking lot.\n\nWhat you're describing is more of a moral grey area, and less of a clear cut case of theft. This is just how capitalism works. If I was buying some sort of rare $1000 item at a garage sale for $1, and the guy behind me screams \"THAT'S WORTH MORE I'LL GIVE YOU $100 for it!\", it's not illegal... he's just being a jerk. Did he \"steal food off my plate\"? Kinda... but lets not be dramatic. Did he \"take advantage of my efforts\"? Yeah... I did the research, I found the item at the garage sale, and the jerk is reaping the profits. But that's not illegal. That's just called being a jerk. This will probably effect said jerk sometime down the road... but it's not illegal to be a jerk.\n\nYes, he's taking advantage of Gamestop's advertising. You ever wonder why gas stations open up right across the street from each other? Same idea. It's capitalism. Why spend money on advertising if someone else has already done the work for you? Are you under the impression that this is a pure and fair marketplace? \n\nLastly, yes, we discourage the discussion of clearly unethical practices here. If he was asked to leave the premises, and he started a thread with all of the ways you could sneak back onto the property, or disguise yourself, or otherwise get around the law... well... that would be illegal, and I'd shut it down. As it stand, it's no more unethical than finding ways to get amiibos first, before some 'deserving kid' is able to pick them up.\n\nAs it stands, yeah, he could end up getting banned from Gamestop.

{"id":"csx1j2v","author":"chuckymcgee","body":"The Prestige lets you redeem ALL TYPs earned on any Citi card or account at 1.6 cents/point for AA airfare, including the Forward. You go to Citi's portal, get basically same flights and prices you'd find on Orbitz or Priceline or Expedia and pay points instead at 1.6 cents each to get the ticket. The tickets are just like any other paid ticket, so you earn miles too. So you're supercharging all of your existing TYPs and future Forward earnings.\n\nAww but it's $450, right? First, the Prestige AF comes down to $350 with Citigold. You can either open a Citigold account (and possibly milk 40k TYP out of it, if that's still going on), then cancel, or apply in branch using an app that's supposed to be for Citigold customers to get the $350 fee. Take off $250 for the very broad, very generous no hassle airfare credit that reimburses you for any airline related purchase, airfares, giftcards, baggage fees, pretty much anything. I assume you'll buy at least one ticket or have some airfare charge, so this is totally as good as cash. \n\nSo that's really a net AF of just $100 now. Your $250 airfare purchase netted you 750 TYPs, which is worth $12 off the AF, minus what you would have gotten had you used your next-best airfare card. So now you've got a sub $100 fee to make up. The Prestige is taking your Forward earnings from 5% to 8%. That's an extra 3% per dollar spent on the Forward's categories. So spending over ~$3k a year on the Forward on restaurants and Amazon.com alone gets you in the green. That's not hard. Plus the Prestige itself gets you 4.8% back on ANY airfare and ANY hotel- arguably putting it on par or better than basically any other airline or hotel specific card. Then you've got the 4th Night Free deal at basically any hotel. And AA Admiral's Club Access, and Priority Pass Select lounge access with guest privileges.\n\nIt's not for absolutely everyone, but it can be absolutely baller if you're doing a modest bit of restaurant, Amazon, hotel or airline purchases. After the airfare credit, one 4th night free use can more than cover the card. I had 80k TYPs lying around from the Forward, so just signing up gave me an additional $480 value.","name":"t1_csx1j2v","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-07-09 05:46:34","week":28}

Even my pups love the cookies!    The almond flour is also a nice thickener for  cooking.    Any use for the leftover oats? Or will you heat them up and eat them as is?  I make my almond milk in a blender - soaking them in the blender and setting it out overnight.  In the morning I rinse the almonds and then puree' them in fresh filtered water.  I place a muslin cloth inside my strainer and strain it over a large container.  When done (I let the batch sit to strain for an hour, covered to protect from any insects) I return the pulp to the blender and add one cup of water and  puree it again and then strain as before.   After this batch I leave it to sit and squeeze out any left over milk  for the purpose of getting dryer pulp.     I place the pulp into a a clean dry muslim sheet  and let gravity finish draining it during the heat of the day on a screen I have made for this purpose. I later learned one can buy sieves in various sizes used for chemistry like this one on Amazon -  a 5 pc set of  8\" Multi-Purpose Interchangeable Sieves  where each filter drops into the holding ring -   in the evening I put the mostly dried pulp into a dehydrator and I run it overnight until noon the next day.  At that point if the moisture is gone I will try to grind it in my food mill downr. If any moisture remains I have to bake the pulp further in my oven or just refrigerate the pulp for other use.    The problem with moisture in food  is it can rot very quickly.   The drier the better.   I  hate having to use the dehydrator any more than necessary, and running the oven to bake flour makes me crazy about increasing costs.  I'd rather let the sun do the work for me.    I built a solar dryer last year using a window cabinet with a glass front, putting a screen bed into the center to use a solar dehydrator and  glass cover  to keep bugs out.  \nIf I can use the sun to do the work - that's what I'll always do. The air flow is powered by a 2\" solar powered fan thru the cabinet - each air intake has a screen blocking bugs from being blown in.

{"id":"csxil77","author":"jmr33090","body":"I'm not sure what you're saying here exactly. Amazon, Google and Netflix don't have their own indexes. You can buy individual stock in those companies tho. However, if those are your three main holdings, you are heavily exposing yourself to only one sector, technology. That's a really risky move.\n\nEdit: I guess you probably mean indexes with those companies. I just want to expand on this to explain the risk here. Technology has very low barriers to entry, and anybody could create the next Google or Apple. It's not likely that these two companies are gonna go out of business, but consider the fact that Amazon has literally never turned a profit, how long can that continue? They will have to make some serious changes or eventually go bankrupt. And next time the market crashes, guess what people are gonna stop subscribing to when they are short on cash? Netflix. Luxury things are the first things given up, and the hardest hit when the market falls. \n\nLet's consider some other companies you use every day. Procter and Gamble, the makers of Bounty, Charmin, Gillette, Braun, Tide, Gain, Downy, Cheer, Dove, Olay, Pantene, Iams, Pampers, Dawn, Duracell, Head &amp; Shoulders and various other products. People will use these things no matter what the market does, P&amp;G will not crash as hard. Or Exxon Mobil, who not only produces oil (highly profitable when oil prices are high) but also refines and owns the gas stations (these parts are highly profitable when oil is low). People don't stop using gasoline in a bad economy. Or Johnson &amp; Johnson, the largest, most diversified healthcare company in the world. We're gonna keep taking medicine and using medical supplies even if the market tanks. Through the course of a full market cycle, these three sectors (Consumer staples, energy &amp; healthcare) have historically been far and away the best for buying and holding. They aren't gonna be as exciting as technology, but they pay dividends and they hold value far better when the market is down, making for a much quicker recovery. That being said, it's certainly appropriate to have some technology investments as a portion of your portfolio, along with financials, cyclicals, materials, industrials etc.. but I'd build a base first with highly stable, defensive, diversified companies before getting aggressive with technology.","name":"t1_csxil77","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-09 17:58:29","week":28}

{"id":"csxkhcu","author":"cheesemcnab","body":"Here's what I do with my HSBC rewards points:  I divide the monetary value of what I'm getting from the redemption by the number of points for that redemption option (in my case, I get one point for every dollar spent, so dividing by points just means that I'm dividing by the amount of money that I spent overall to get to that reward level).\n\nExample:  I can redeem 5,000 points for $50 cash back.\n$50/5,000 points = 0.01 x 100 = 1% cash back\n\nMost of my cash payment options equate to 1% cash back; example: redeem 10,000 points for $100, 250,000 for $250, etc.  They just changed the lowest-tier option; 3,000 points for $25 cash back (used to be 2,500/$25).  I now wait until I have at least 5,000 points to redeem to get my full 1%.\n\nI can also get $400 off of a plane ticket with 25,000 points.  Let's do the math:\n$400/25,000 = 0.016 = 1.6%\nIf you have somewhere you'd like to go, this is a better return than the cash back.  This is my current goal.\n\nMy card also offers various merchandise options, but I find that these are never worth the number of points that it takes to obtain them.  To calculate this, I do a Google search for the item and then divide the retail price (as seen on Amazon or the Google shopping tab) by the number of points.\n\nExample:  Yankee Candle 7oz tumbler candle for 2,400 points.  Candle generally goes for about $16 from what I can tell.\n\n$16/2,400 = .67%.  \n\nAnother:  Weber Spirit E-210 gas grill, 67,900 points.  Retails for $400.\n\n$400/67,900 = 0.58%\n\nAt that point you're getting half as much of the value as you would taking 1% cash back.  I find that this trend (i.e. the merchandise will never give you a better return than the cash or plane tickets) is well conserved among the merchandise options, but feel free to do the math on anything that you'd be interested in to see if that holds true.\n\nI know this seems like a lot of work, but I am all about maximizing my return.  :)","name":"t1_csxkhcu","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-09 18:45:41","week":28}

I would be happy to change my habits if convenient and rewarding.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; I am looking for a card that will last me a long time with low interest rates, a low (preferably no) annual fee, and that will have greater rewards over time (as in besides higher spending limits, I want to say turn my Blue Cash Amex into a Centurion thirty years from now.) Also, how dumb/hard would it be to pay for a combination of the two (Chase Amazon and Blue Cash Amex for example)?

At an antique mall 15-20% is not an unusual  fee on your sales, and you get nowhere near the reach of Ebay.  At an outdoor flea market it is common to pay $10-30 for a booth, and for all you know it could rain and you could not get a single sale.... plus all the time you spend running the stand.\n\nI love Craigslist, but there's also a lot of BS that goes along with selling on it.\n\nHerein lies the problem:\n\n* Ebay and Amazon can charge whatever they please (though again, I find 15% quite reasonable) because they have the traffic.\n\n* Sites with lesser fees are going to have lesser traffic, and like most, I want quick sales.

{"id":"csy4tfq","author":"KevinHoda","body":"I started out with pretty much every brand, but after a year I only sold Samsung and Apple. Those two companies make up almost the whole market. Apple was the best as their users tend to spend more money then Samsung users, and Apple has a larger market share in the U.S. Both companies also release a new phone every year, thus requiring customers to go and buy new cases, and if they liked my design, they would go back to me. Amazon shows you who is a repeat customer in their data. Very nice to see repeats. \n\nI did not get into power banks. It was near impossible to get a supply for brand name ones and all the generic ones either fail to much or are cornered by the Chinese. \n\nWhen I first started selling, there was only U.S. sellers. I only saw a few Chinese. Now it is the complete opposite. Even in 2013, I was one of the few U.S. sellers. Which was a great selling point. \n\nThose living in China have the advantage of selling cheap, shipping cheap and finding suppliers easier. However they have the disadvantage of ship time and the fact some sellers prefer to buy from the U.S., even though they are all made in China anyways. \n\nThe Chinese do hold the majority of the market share of sellers, but the sector is over $5 billion and grows at double digits each year, so I would not worry about them. They also offer horrible customer service as most do not speak fluent English and it is near impossible for them to handle customer returns.

This is why I now believe its a good idea to set wages only after doing extensive research on what is standard pay for the work you're hiring out. (I've never had a job, so this was new territory for me)\n\nHe started to complain when I'd ask him to do minor tasks, like stopping by Walmart for printer paper. I tried to explain how he was making a ridiculous amount of money, and therefore he should be able to handle a few more tasks. He did the minor tasks but continued to complain. That's when I realized drug using teenagers are not the best employees, especially when they're your friend. \n\nI was paying him per item as if he was my business partner. I wish I would have realized sooner that he was only an employee, and a replaceable one at that.\n\nLong story short I dropped him and hired an adult on an hourly basis. This new guy makes 15$/hour, gets to work from home, and couldn't be happier. In return I get a good, loyal, and most important of all, satisfied employee. Not to mention, I save a TREMENDOUS amount of money compared to what I paid previously. \n\nUnlike adults, teenagers haven't seen the real world, and the real value of money. I think no teen can truly value a dollar until they've experienced what its like to scrape by with nothing. \n\nMy entire life I have disagreed with the limitations and stigmas surrounding my age group, but only recently have I realized that most are sadly correct.\n\nSide Note: My parents have been questioning why I don't ship the items myself to save money. To this I say, I could spend an hour packaging 10 items, or I could spend an hour creating 10 new items. Work smart, not hard.\n\n","name":"t1_csyjnkw","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-10 15:35:49","week":28}

I would think so?\n\nJust submitted my quarterly to the accountant last month. US citizen\n\nYou need to track a few things in a spreadsheet yourself.\n\n1. The cost of merchandise. Really only need 2 columns here: Cost per item and SKU. This will be used to calculate Cost of goods sold later on (COGS). I include any sales tax I paid and the cost to have the items shipped to me (but not to Amazon or customers). I think to do things 100% correctly, you would track sales tax separately and then deduct that when you submit taxes later but it's a small amount for me so I ignore it for now.\n\n2. General Expenses. Packing material, shipping, office supplies, subscriptions, etc. Any expenses for your business other than merchandise and...\n\n3. Mileage. You can spend all day reading about this on the IRS website but the basic columns you need: \n\n * Date\n * Destination (City, Town, or Area)\n * Business Purpose\n * Odometer readings:\n  * Start\n  * Stop\n  * Miles this trip\n * Additional expenses:\n  * Type(Gas, oil, tolls, etc.)\n  * Amount\n\n For Mileage, I would really like to tie my receipts to each trip but I don't have a program that would do that yet.\n\n\n***\n\nSo at regular intervals, you want to build a report. This can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or per pay period.\n\nI go to Amazon &gt; Reports &gt; payments &gt; transaction view. Pick the pay period you want and download the report.\n\nI use Microsoft Excel with Power Query to build detailed reports and summarize everything at the end. You can merge tables, create new columns, filter, group, etc. This part took me a few days to learn how to do but was worth it.\n\nNot much left for the accountant to do at this point but review my numbers, clean up the format and submit for me.\n\n\nI would recommend making a simple report at regular intervals so you can review how you are doing.

{"id":"csyt9yv","author":"101ByDesign","body":"After adding why I used shipstation, I thought a bit more info would be helpful to others.\n\nOn Amazon you can only have one account.\n\nBut often times, there are legitimate reasons for a person to desire more than one account. For example, maybe you want to have separate accounts that sell separate products. Maybe you start one account that ONLY sells vegetables, then you decide to make an account that ONLY sells fruit. Separating accounts based on product type can be useful as it helps you to keep accurate tabs on what's happening to each individual product.\n\nHow this relates to shipstation:\n\nSince Amazon doesn't like one person owning two accounts, you will have to present yourself as two separate entities to Amazon. This means you will want to have two Ip addresses, two street addresses, two names, two different search browsers, etc...\n\nAmazon tracks your IP each time you login, but with shipstation you don't have to log in to Amazon to print orders. So you can use one shipstation account to print your orders from both Amazon accounts, without Amazon knowing. (Amazon does track the IP address you use on shipstation when you FIRST connect your account, but no time after that) \n\nIf you want to succeed greatly on Amazon, multiple accounts can be the best way to go.","name":"t1_csyt9yv","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-10 19:55:01","week":28}

The minimum limit on that card is $5,000. (... not to mention in order to get the bonus, you'd have to spend $4,000 on the card in 3 months.) Don't waste your time. If the Chase Freedom is showing up for you on the [pre qualification page](https://creditcards.chase.com/prequalified-offers), that would be a good option.\n\nIf you do wind up applying for Chase Freedom, I'd wait until you can get a credit limit increase from Amex. Read up on the Amex 3x CLI. It's suspected that Chase will meet or beat your highest Amex limit, so it's in your best interest to get your Amex limit increased and reporting before you apply to Chase.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about the hard pulls. They're on your reports, but you're being denied because of low income, not because of your credit score or because of inquiries.\n\nDon't cancel the card yet. Just let it sit for a while.

I was also heavily into drugs and massively depressed trying to escape my reality. Would call my parents crying at almost 30 years old that I was depressed and ready to give up and move home. Interviewed for a QA job with very little experience through a friend. I asked for 60K and got it! LOVED the work and got a 10k raise the next year for working hard. Quit after 2 years and applied at Amazon, got hired for $110K + 50K hiring bonus and some stock. Quit after a year and now work at Cisco for $130K as software dev in test. I'm 33 now and very happy with the upward trajectory. I'm not rich, but comfortable and do what I want now and am grateful for everything. I've realized that being pro-active really makes a difference. Honestly, going to the gym and getting my headspace right, eating right and stopping all drugs probably had more to do with it than anything. This allowed me to direct all my healthy energy at my new found passion and it showed. I look back and reflect at how quickly you can change things around if you study/work your ass off and focus all your energy in one direction and don't be afraid to say no and drop everything if things aren't working out. I also hang out with the people I want to be and eventually found myself to be one of their kind. I also have taken no hand outs from anyone, am debt free and I'm very proud of it.

These are facilities that are meant to sort freight shipments. \n\n\nThough most times people are considering fulfillment, they're considering e-commerce direct-to-consumer.

Since the fulfillment company is providing error-corrections late-in-the-game they span the range and it's a mostly manual business. \n\n\nI work with AaronGerry and we found with some software on the side of the fulfillment center and on the product manufacturer level, you can eliminate many major issues. \n\n\nThough to get a better approximation of costs, I wrote something up on Quora: https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-participate-in-the-fulfillment-process-of-goods-e-g-fulfillment-by-Amazon-if-I-have-a-resource-such-as-a-warehouse-that-I-can-fully-maximize","name":"t1_csztk27","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-11 19:01:12","week":28}

I would also recommend checking out some of the related subreddits as well.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I like to use a lot of mobile beer money apps, here are some that I would recommend using. (**Android**)\n\n\n* **CashPirate** - With this one I earned the most amount of money. You download apps and open them to earn points. The offers I found to credit me 100% are the ones under 'Pirate Picks' and 'Sponsor Pay.' You could earn 2500 points in a day if you do all the offers. I was able to get $5 to PayPal after 3 days of using the app. Minimum cash out is 2500 points ($2.50) to PayPal or Amazon. Make sure to check back multiple times a day to get more offers. You can use my invite code SZHMDC to get 500 bonus points ($0.50) and here is the [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ayet.cashpirate&amp;hl=en) to the Google Play store page.\n\n\n* **Uento** - With this one I earn less than CashPirate but I was still able to get $5 to PayPal within a week. You download apps just like CashPirate. The minimum cash out is 250 points or $2.50 to PayPal. You can use my invite code if you'd like '4Cmrq.' Here is the [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.uento&amp;hl=en) to the Google Play store page.\n\n\n* **Wild Wallet** - This one is just like the other two and here is a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/39x0sk/wild_wallet/) I made to earn money with it.\n\n\n* **SlideJoy** - This one is a really nice app that I like to use for passive income. When you download it, the app sets a lock screen on your phone and you will earn money while you use your phone over time. The more you use your phone during the day, the more points you will get. Your total updates at 1 pm every day and the minimum cash out is at 100 points ($1.00) to PayPal or Amazon. I use my phone quite a lot so I get around 15 points each day or $0.15.

Once you read thru that, again as Gritthing said, there are other related subs that you'll want to check out which I'll mention below.  The two sites not in the sticky that I use the most are FusionCash and EarnHoney.\n\nFusionCash is your standard GPT site but what I use them for is getting paid to download apps on your mobile/tablet device.  They pay you 0.50 cents (thru AppFly) per app that you install and run.  They usually refresh the apps each day as well so you have some nice opportunities to earn.  They also have a forum where you can earn points for posting and they have your standard GPT stuff as well like videos/surveys/offers, etc.  There customer support is very good to and will help you if something doesn't credit.  Minimum payout is $25 but you can get a payout to PayPal, check or direct to your bank which is always nice as well.\n\nRef\nhttp://fca.sh/1pw1g\n\nNon-ref\nhttp://www.fusioncash.net\n\nThe other site I use everyday is EarnHoney.  They're a new GPT site that is still in Beta so still working some things out but overall I've been very happy with them.  They have surveys, you can watch videos, play games, and PeanutLabs as well for offers.  I mostly use it for the videos/games though and have been paid out almost every week to PayPal ($5) minimum but they also have Amazon for $1.  There CS is also very good at answering any questions you have if something doesn't credit right away.\n\nRef\nwww.earnhoney.com/home/?referrer=yPPp2K7O\n\nNonref\nwww.earnhoney.com\n\nThose are just 2 of the sites I use on a daily basis and they provide a nice little side income.

I worked at UPS and they were desperately looking for full timers but had a strict 4 year degree requirement.\n\nFull timers will make $65k - $80k depending on where the job is.  From there, just keep working at it.  Make it to the next level after a few years and you can be making $80k - $120k.  If you want to keep pushing after that, at some point someone will hire you for supply chain management consulting and you could be making any where from $150k - $300k depending on where you land and what aspect you focus on.\n\nBasically, I think if you make your intentions known and work with diligence, you'll probably become a full time supervisor within a year or two and have enough money to move out.\n\nRight now is the best time to apply at these places because they'll be ramping up for Christmas.","name":"t1_ct02e86","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-11 23:56:13","week":28}

{"id":"ct0okia","author":"Jancy52","body":"I cook everything from scratch, no box meals for my family.   So my cooking supplies will include a microwave oven and a toaster oven but those are rarely used.   I use daily a Goose neck kettle for hot water/coffee  and a Moka pot for making espresso.   I keep a small copper lined sauce pot, a medium size copper lined sauce pot, a 3 qt. dutch oven with lid and heat resistent handles,  a cast iron dutch oven with heavy lid that can double as a frying pan, two cast iron skillets sizes 9 &amp; 12\",  2 9\" loaf pans, variety of dark and shiny cookie sheets, around 9\" cake pan, 13\" rectangular pan with 2\" walls and several cooling wires.  One cast iron griddle 17\" long by 12\" wide for making series of pancakes and for griling steaks on the opposite side.      Don't bother with nonstick pans as many of the chemicals come off the pans into your food and remains in your body - pans don't have to be only scratched to be dangerous - just the act of overheating them can cause a dangerous chemical reaction.    Invest in enamelware, cast iron and copper lined pans instead of teflon pans.  Learn to bake on parchment paper, baker's paper or brown paper,  or a silicon cookie sheet.   High heat spoon and spatula or wooden tools are wonderful.  Keep several dedicated cutting boards, each labeled as for either poultry, baking, or steak to help minimize bacteria transfer.   and thick pot holders.   Learn how to put your oils into a spray pump so you don't waste time manually buttering up pans for cooking.    A spray pump helps with your cast iron as well.... I purchased a food grade srayer and only use olive oil in it.     My favorite pump requires to pump it up like a bike pump before it will spray out any oil.  Misto Brushed Aluminum Olive Oil Sprayer is just fabulous.         I also use a vinegar/detergent  sprayer for cleaning surfaces before cooking - I prefer vinegar as it is not toxic like over the counter chemicals one can use for cleaning - you could use diluted bleach to clean/sanitize  your kitchen instead but the  bleach smell lingers and once vinegar is dry the smell utterly disappears.  I use one tiny  drop of diluted dish washing detergent in a bottle of spray plus one half teaspoon of baking soda to act as a abrasive with  two cups of vinegar.  You can also dilute the mix with water.    I use my vinegar sprayer thru-out my whole house to keep odors at bay, cleaning safely with it as needed.  It works well in the bathroom also .  I vary between plain white vinegar and apple cider vinegar.  This is just as important in my kitchen as my pots and pans.   \n     Other equipment:  When you get ready for it, a good food processor is a god-send.   I make almond milk for us to drink, so a tall blender is helpful.  Also get a larger rice cooker - but also learn how to make rice on the stove top from raw rice, make grilled or  spanish rice in addition to using a rice cooker so your skills with rice will increase.        I also use an immersion blender while cooking as it tolerates  heat while making soups.    Having a heavy duty metal kitchen hammer designed to tenderize meat is also helpful for tenderizing and for self defense.   Having a hand crank can opener and bottle opener is helpful.    Plus a whisk tool.  And a knife sharpener of your choice,  I love my Arkansas oil stone.   A glass hand worked juicer is always nice, the antique variety usually have very nice sharp edges and do a super-short  job of juicing.   Plus get a a variety of plastic  mixing bowls or lovely hand made pottery serving bowls for your table. I also keep several sets of plastic measuring bowls and spoons, leaving extra measuring cups in with my flour and sugar containers - one cup size to the flour, a half cup size to the sugar container.  With  knives, my go-to knives are a paring knife and a chef's 8\" knife.  I have a variety of wood handled knives and had to teach my adult children how to care for them.  I hate to see any wood soaking in water for no good reason.    A small grinding mill can be used for cracking peppers and spices together as well as coffee.   I use a very small coffee grinder for this purpose, cleaning up the blades with salt in between uses.   I will grind up salt and sugar together for use over popcorn.   Find yourself a good pop-corn maker when ready for it - I use a crank style whirley-pop stove-top popcorn maker and never make popcorn in a bag due to the potential for lung damage. This stove top  style ensure there are very few if any un-popped kernels.     Plus get a self standing heat resistant colander for straining  and a couple sizes of over-the bowl type sieves. A tiny hand held sieve is very helpful.    I also keep several in-the-door glass pitchers in the fridge. I use a 16 oz mason jar to make sun tea.     I typically clean up and reuse glass jars to hold the infused butters and clarified butter  that I make for cooking .  And I rely on my glass candy thermometer for cooking  nearly everything including meats I've cooked.    \n     It's not just about cooking utensils, the mark of a good cook is in prepping and cleaning while you are in stages of cooking.   while I have stuff on the stove, I'll organize my spice jars (I glued strong magnets onto the top of the spice jars and let them stay close to the oven  perched onto my refrigerator side wall within easy reach.)\n     I also keep a spoon rest  on my stove top to keep the area cleaner  and always use aluminum foil to cover my stove top to make cleanup easier. \nIn the kitchen clean up: I use a padded counter top dish drainer for my larger pots to drain on and don't overload the plastic dish dryer.  One can never have enough hand towels to use in the kitchen.   My sister-in-law crochets my pot scrubbers for me out of tule. One only rinses them clean , then nukes them for 30-45 seconds to disinfect them between uses.  They last forever and are essential in doing dishes.   For tougher cleaning I use steel wool.          \n     My extra appliances include a digital crackpot, a solar cooker on my back porch with it's dark pots and pans,  a food processor, an electric dehydrator for making fruit rolls and dehydrating fruits for snacks,  and an old fashioned vacuum food storage system.    My newest fun tool is my yogurt maker with extra storage cups.     I also can foods and believe in prepping and keep a 3 year pantry.  One can never have too many little plastic food containers for left overs.    Always check your plastic and glass containers before you throw them out for repurposing. I have a large box of reusalbe plastics I keep.  \n    \n     I own a world class supply of mason jars, lids and inserts for this reason, plus a monstrously heavy 40 pint electric antique pressure cooker I use for immersion bathing  when canning. Plus all the accompaniments that go with it like long handled jar lifters, hot water spatulas, and large mouth pouring  spouts for putting food into jars or narrow containers. Don't forget a pretty canister set for your kitchen shelf top that you'll actually try to use:  a friend of mine actually uses 3 L size bottles of coke for her canister set - she cleaned them up and painted the outside of them and pours her flour and sugar into them and just leaves out for use.  \n     \nI keep the majority of my cooking spoons in a pretty painted old #10 coffee can  with the handles down inside the opening so that I can see where/which each spoon is.  I also keep a metal wire box mounted on the wall just above the counter top for my supply of cleaning cloths as I don' use paper towels anymore - I avoid putting items into drawers as that slows things down....   I machine wash and sun dry all of my kitchen wash cloths to keep bacteria away and keep them within reach of the sink to speed up my work.  I keep a open trash can lined with a plastic bag to the side of my stove while I am cooking and a kitchen compost bucket under the sink for taking scrapes out to the compost/worm bin.       \n\nI use a Grohe Semi-pro Kitchen Faucet that I got on Amazon - and it's amazing.  When I moved out of my last home, I brought it with me. That's as important a tool to me as my cast iron pans are.  I hate shallow sinks with low faucets, they can be so frustrating.      And I sit on a tall stool while I prep and cook - I can't do without my kitchen stool.    \n     ","name":"t1_ct0okia","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-12 16:41:41","week":28}

I'm a developer, I tinker with design tools and drawing, all things tech, networking, security, etc. but I've never been \"passionate\" about those things, they're just really cool. 3.5 years ago my wife and I had a child, and I really like doing things with her.

They would have a better judgement on what tools and folks to hire for their data. Hell they might even have an internal security product that they might sell!\n\nI would stay away from $HACK, as much as I love the promise, they are competing for these data holders to hire them, when these data holders might simply drop them and use another solution.\n\nThat is my thoughts on cyber security stocks; looks great on paper but bad in long term vision.

We buy customer returns from major department stores and sell them online, primarily on eBay, since Amazon doesn't like used merchandise.  There are a million companies doing this, some who do it wholesale and some like us who do it on a retail level.  The only barrier to entry is literally having your shit together enough to form a business, get a reseller permit, and find out the contact information to get registered with the company, and having enough money to buy pallets of merchandise at 3-4k a pop up front.  We have to compete with companies who will buy the merchandise by the truckload (16-24 pallets per load).\n\nWe're on pace to do 200k in revenue this year, with 60% margins.  most of the profit we've invested back into further inventory; we want to grow enough to support a warehouse and seasonal employees.  Right now it is a home based business.
