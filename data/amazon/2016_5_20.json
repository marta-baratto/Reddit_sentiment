{"id":"4jiol0","author":"Spac3Ghost","body":"For the past three years I have been writing Oped's on religion. I have a column in a small paper and recently have become a blogger from Huffington Post. \n\nI was thinking about creating a personal website to showcase the articles I have written over the years. One of my articles from HuffPost provided with me with the opportunity of being interviewed at a public radio station. With a personal website it would allow me to work more on the branding in my name. Some questions:\n\n1. Is it a good idea to create a personal website affiliated with my name? Or would it be better to go with a branded name, such as MuslimLawyer.com?\n\n2. should I post the articles I've written over the years all at once (about 20 articles) or should I post it once a week, a month?\n\n3. Is it acceptable to have google ads or Amazon ads on my website? Or would that be poor taste? I am it sure of other ways I could use to monetize the website.","name":"t3_4jiol0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-16 02:00:25","week":20}

{"id":"4jj2zy","author":"throw0away0way","body":"[Throw-away account because: All the personal details here]\n    \n\nAfter many years of stagnant household income, my SO and I have fairly suddenly experienced a huge boost in income. First I got a new job, and then SO got a new job.\n    \n    \n**Our income progression has been something like this.**   \n2006-2013:    \nMe: $35,000-45,000 (volatile income)    \nSO: $40,000 (very steady income, but no raises)    \nTotal: average $80,000 a year    \n    \n    \n2014-2015:    \nMe: $95K (income mostly stabilized with new job &amp; acquisition of investment property)    \nSO: $40,000    \nTotal: $135K    \n    \n    \nAnd now SO is starting a new job, so going forward:    \nMe: $95K (salary + real estate investment income)    \nSO: $70,000    \nTotal: $165K    \n    \n    \nIf you've had a sudden dramatic increase in income, how did you handle it--buy a few extra conveniences and then save the rest? Did you focus on reducing debt or on increasing savings/investments?\n    \n\nI know this is a great problem to have, but I'm finding it's increasing my anxiety a lot.\n    \n\n**A few basics about our assets/debt:**     \n* Our only debt is our mortgage ($160K owed on $250K house. House is old and costs a ton to heat and maintain.)    \n* We own investment property worth about $165K, owe $120K on it, and it cash flows about $600 a month conservatively after all expenses.)    \n* We're in good shape for emergency fund (about $60K in cash) and college (about $135K in 529 plans for one kid in middle school.) I feel like we're behind on retirement savings (about $325K in various retirement plans) so we'll have some catching up to do now that we have this extra income. SO is about 15 years from retirement age. I'm about 20 years from retirement age.    \n    \n    \n**Things I'm worried about:**    \n* Becoming too dependent on the higher income and then not knowing how to live on less if our income drops again (I'm in a volatile industry and would not be at all surprised to get laid off if the economy shifts)    \n* Spoiling our kid    \n* Spoiling myself. I definitely notice I'm already more comfortable buying whatever I want at the grocery store, dropping $100 on Amazon purchases on a whim, etc. It's freaking me out.)\n* Not giving enough to charity    \n* Having our friends/family notice our financial situation has eased up a lot, and maybe having our relationships with those people change in uncomfortable ways    \n* Not knowing how to manage the added tax burden    \n    \n    \nHas anybody else been through this? What mistake did you make when your income went up? What did you do that helped? Do you think I should talk to a financial planner?\n    \n    \n**Options for extra income:**    \n* Pay down mortgage on our house to try to get it paid off before SO retires (we've got 24 years left on a 30 year loan)    \n* Pay down investment property mortgage so it will cash flow more    \n* Save cash in expectation of an economic downturn and a layoff for me    \n* Save cash to buy more investment real estate, either soon or when there's an economic downturn and houses go on sale    \n* Throw everything we can at retirement accounts to catch up? Except part of me thinks more real estate investments would be better, because it will help lock in today's income in case I get laid off in the next couple years, AND it will help us in retirement.    \n    \n    \nI know this is really ridiculous that I'm stressed about suddenly having too MUCH money, so downvote me or yell at me in the comments if you must. I do realize that I'm in a fortunate position. But I really would like to know how others have handled this situation.\n    \n    \n*TL;DR: My household income doubled within 2 years, and I don't know how to handle the added income.*","name":"t3_4jj2zy","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-16 03:49:53","week":20}

{"id":"4jjieh","author":"WavesOfFury","body":"So it all started last week when I canceled my cable TV service saving me ~$60/month. And now today I got my $105/month T-Mobile bill and decided no more. So I downgraded my data plan from unlimited LTE to 6 gb LTE/month with rollover that given my usage for the past few months (and the fact that most video and music streaming doesn't count against your limit), should be more than enough. Another $30/month in my pocket. Plus I sold a few hundred dollars worth of stuff I just had collecting dust on eBay, with another few hundred to go.\n\n\nSo 2 small changes that I won't really even notice put an extra $90/month (almost $1,100/year!!!) back in my pocket! I'm so stoked right now! Anyway, thanks for all the tips and advice yall post on here guys.\n\n\nEdit: Oh, I also changed my own oil in my truck. Cost me ~$30 worth of supplies from Amazon and less than 30 minutes of my time. Had I gone to the dealership (as I had been doing because my Tacoma came with 2 years of free oil changes) I would've been there at least 45 minutes, probably closer to an hour. And after I finished doing it myself I looked at one of the dealership invoices for the first time to see what they would've charged me. **$90!!!** Disgusting...

{"id":"4jmcmj","author":"waitingforgoodoh","body":"I posted here a couple weeks ago sharing my story about [starting a website, and my experiences over the first two weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4gkt4a/realistic_expectations_of_the_first_two_weeks/)\n\nI got a ton of great feedback, and a few people said that it helped them (u/claudettej I'd love to hear what you ended up starting!) so I'm writing another post about my first month. Here it is! Hope you enjoy, and would love to hear any feedback or answer questions.\n\nFor your reference, [here's the site I've been working on](http://datingappsdemystified.com).\n\nDay 15. Posted this to r/entrepreneurship and got a ton of amazing advice!! Thank you so much, I appreciate it (especially u/geekgirl32, u/nannooo, u/itsstifu, u/Csplayer55 and u/webconnoisseur). Decided to keep writing in this format because I think it helps. Some of the feedback: seek out online groups/ forums, work on the site design, write in a more personal style.\n\nDay 16. Googled “dating app advice roundup” on the advice of u/nannoo and reached out to some of the people on it-- we’ll see if that leads to something! Hopefully. Also published a new article, “When to ask a girl out on a dating app (hint: you’re probably waiting too long).” It got good traction in /seddit (Around 70 upvotes), and fewer than 10 upvotes in /dating_advice and /online_dating_advice. Also got some people who were angry that it was spammy. These comments definitely sting, but they are also sort of funny and fun to respond to-- I have tried to just be excessively positive and courteous.\n\nDay 17. I have gotten 3 straight days of record traffic on the blog, (in no small part due to r/entrepreneurship). I have been getting more into Google Analytics, set up a “goal,” which is people visiting my Services page. Sort of discouraging that no one is signing up for email list or commenting on the posts. Kind of confused that people are clicking on “comment” but not commenting-- I turned off the setting that made people enter their email addresses to comment.\n\nDay 18. Got good feedback from one of the people who I had emailed because they had a roundup, which was nice. Had a long drive so I listened to “Will it Fly” by Pat Flynn which is honestly amazing-- really really worth reading for someone just starting out. Also listened to “The E-Myth Revisited” which I enjoyed, and made me think in a new way-- “work on your business, not in it.” Made me think about systematizing things and not working for the sake of work.\n\nDay 19. Sort of procrastinating on writing more content, largely because most of the low-hanging fruit is gone.\n\nDay 20. Woke up to a comment on Reddit from an amazing human being (Thank you u/CaffeinatedProphet!!!) who told me they bought a book through my affiliate link! Wrote a long (1400 word) article on “Fun things to talk about during a first date.” This was fun to write and it flowed well. Still, I can’t help but feel I am running out of quality content to write about, and it worries me that I won’t have enough content to get picked up by Google.\n\nDay 21. Posted the new article on Reddit. It started out slowly, I think the copy in the headline wasn’t great, but gained traction up to around 150 upvotes on r/socialskills and r/seduction (thanks to the wonderful u/nannoo for encouraging me to post to r/social_skills). In bigger news-- I got an email subscriber!!!! That’s really exciting to me, and a great validation of what I’ve been working on. I guess now I have to figure out how to communicate with them :)\n\nLearning about modifying the CSS to customize things. It’s really pretty intuitive and really interesting/fun. Big takeaways: don’t modify themes directly, create a child theme to override parts of that theme. Use developer tools/ inspect element to see what you’re working with in your browser.\n\nPosted to some other forums using google search \"forums: seduction\". It’s really tedious work, but hopefully pretty valuable.\n\nDay 21. Pretty strong traffic from Reddit, roughly 250 views. I was surprised to check back to one of the other forums I posted on to find I had been banned! I suppose it’s because I included a link to the blog, and the forum owner sells their own dating products. Oh well. So far haven’t found a traffic source outside of reddit that works reliably. Answered some Quora questions, my hunch is that this will work but only if I commit significant time to it.\n\nDay 22. I don’t really feel like writing, and I’m not sure this is a good niche to be in. This is hard! However, I’m trying to remind myself that I did this to learn, and it’s been a really great learning experience so far. Another thing that’s kept my morale up has been connecting with people doing similar things, either through their blogs or through reddit-- that’s been surprisingly helpful in keeping me going.\n\nAnother interesting motivator: it’s really cool to go on Google Analytics and see people from other countries who have interacted with your posts. 50 people from Australia?! 3 from Sudan!? The internet is an amazing thing.\n\nOne embarrassing thing-- I reached out to the fellow who runs tinderseduction.com and asked him for his opinion on my site, and he was really gracious and responded, but said the site was down. I was annoyed, and checked it on my phone and my laptop and at that point it was working fine. I don’t know what the problem was, whether it was with the hosting company or something I did or what.\n\nI’m about to write another post! Wish me luck.\n\nDay 23. Writing another post, Where to go on a first date, but just not feeling it. I think one problem is I have started writing for a Reddit audience. Since my first few posts did well in some places on Reddit, and that’s where I get the majority of my views from right now, I feel like I have to keep doing that. But, there are only so many lists of concrete tips I can make that will get upvoted. I think I need to write more with the user in mind who is coming from search and is already interested in the topic.\n\nDay 24. Went to a good coffee shop, sat down and got in a good groove and wrote 1100 words or so. Posted to some different subreddits (r/okcupid and r/POF) and got mixed results-- r/okcupid was suuuper resistant to any sort of promotion, and were generally dickish. It’s funny how different communities have their own personalities.\n\nDay 25. I got another email subscriber! After changing the call to action to be “sign up to get a free profile review.” Really good feeling. Reached out to him. Page views are holding steady around 35 a day without posting new stuff. Still nothing from search. Interesting finding: subreddits with low traffic (r/online_dating_advice) give traffic for a longer time, because content stays on front page instead of getting buried, even though it only got like 3 upvotes.\n\nThis is definitely a slog. I’m enjoying myself but it’s not always exciting. You have to really appreciate the little wins.\n\nDay 26. Working on several articles for Dating Apps Demystified. Starting to incorporate data and visualizations into posts. This is something I’m interested in and regardless of whether people like it, I think it’ll help keep me excited about writing.\n\nToday, I got a couple of hits from Google search, but the search term was my exact URL. Not sure what this means, but it’s frustrating to still not be getting any sort of organic search traffic.\n\nDay 27. Spent a lot of time finishing up an article, “a guide to first dates.” I also spent a while answering quora posts, but haven’t gotten traffic from them. Has anyone seen success with this? It’s such an appealing medium, and it’s so easy to go on and write, but I’m afraid you don’t get the kind of traffic necessary to make it worthwhile.\n\nDay 28. It’s funny, I wasn’t all that excited about the post yesterday but I put it up on r/socialskills and it’s my highest upvoted post, by almost a factor of 3. 600+ upvotes on r/socialskills, and today’s a record day for pageviews already-- 700 and counting. I think this shows me that it’s sometimes hard to realize what people will find valuable. I thought the post was kind of obvious, without much groundbreaking information, but it’s hard for me to remember what I knew and didn’t know when first starting out.\n\nSpent 3 hours responding to comments on Reddit! Lots of work but it’s fun and satisfying.\n\nDay 29. Set up WooCommerce on the site. This was really easy, and makes my “services” page look much more professional than before (it was just a list of services followed by a contact form).\n\nIt’s funny, I remember thinking before I started all this “man, if I could just work for myself, I wouldn’t care if I was doing busywork all day. I’d love every second of it.” I definitely realize now-- busywork is busywork. It’s really satisfying working for myself for sure, but it’s still tough.\n\nDay 30. Still seeing traffic come in from Reddit, which is encouraging. People have complimented my writing which is really nice to hear. Also, made another sale through Amazon! Up to $1.34 (which island should i buy?!) It’s interesting to see how I respond emotionally to things over time. For instance, the first couple days, I was super excited to get 20 pageviews. Now, even when I got 700 the other day, I was pleased but not over the moon. Similarly, I’m still really stoked to have made $1.34, even though obviously it’s a trivial amount of money.\n\nHere are the posts I've made to reddit and their success:\n\n\nPost | Subreddit | Upvotes\n---------|----------|----------\nAfter at least 100 first dates, these are my rules for making them go well | r/socialskills | 629\nAdvice on Dating App opening lines based on 2 years and 100+ dates | r/seduction | 269\nSome fun things to talk about on first dates | r/seduction | 216\nSome good first date conversation starters | r/socialskills | 212\nAfter tons of first dates, my thoughts on making them go well | r/dating_advice | 110\nWhen you should ask a girl out on dating apps | r/seduction | 78\nMy 5 favorite first date conversation starters | r/dating_advice | 76\nDating app learnings based on 2 years and 100+ dates | r/Entrepreneur | 22\nAdvice on dating app pictures based on 2 years and 100+ dates | r/dating_advice | 15\nSome goofy but fun conversation topics for first dates | r/POF | 6\nYou're probably waiting too long to ask girls out on dating apps | r/dating_advice | 6\nFun things to talk about on first dates | r/online_dating_advice | 4\nAfter at least 100 first dates, my rules for making them go well | r/online_dating_advice | 4\nAdvice on Dating App opening lines based on 2 years and 100+ dates | r/dating_advice | 3\nWho's the most charismatic person you've ever seen? | r/askreddit | 2\nWhat fictional character do you imagine yourself as when talking to a girl? | r/seduction | 1\nGoofy but interesting and fun things to talk about on first dates | r/dating | 1\nBest practices for dating app profiles | r/Tinder | 1\nThings I've learned after 2 years on dating apps and 100+ dates | r/Tinder | 1\nYou're waiting too long to ask girls out on dating apps | r/online_dating_advice | 0\nGetting your dating app profile pictures right | r/dating_advice | 0\n\n\nVarious thoughts:\n\n* If you’re posting blog content to reddit, paste the whole article, then link to it at the end.

Not sure what to make of this but an interesting example of the Pareto principle at work!\n\n* Keep a journal like this! It really helps organize your thoughts, it’s fun to look back on, and it might be able to help out other people.\n\n* Twitter: I think a lot of people get twitter backwards. They post a bunch of stuff out into oblivion. Starting out, I’d recommend using twitter almost exclusively to @message people doing similar stuff to you. Just compliment them, or ask their opinion or whatever. Try a 5:1 ratio of @s to normal tweets.\n\n* Email signups: I’ve gotten about 1 per 1000 pageviews. This is without a popup, but offering substantial rewards for email signups. I’m going to try a popup and see how it goes, but I’m really reluctant to damage the user experience, even though I know I'd get a lot more signups\n\nIn all, I’d guess I’ve worked about 50 hours on the site, which so far means I’ve earned between 2 and 3 cents per hour (this isn’t counting the $110 or so that I’ve spent on hosting and the domain!)\n\nMuch more importantly though, it’s been very gratifying and a lot of fun, I’ve learned a lot, I’m much more confident in my abilities to create things that people want, and it’s given me momentum going forward. I probably would have spent about 25 hours reading about entrepreneurship/ online marketing over the past month, and this has been sooo much more valuable than that would have been. 100% would do it again. \n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\nAlso, **if anyone has recently built a business of any kind to “ramen profitability” (&gt;$1,000 a month or so) I’d love to talk with you**-- since I’m really interested in this, I’m planning to compile a bunch of stories of people who’ve very recently created a profitable business. Some free publicity for you, and a good way to give back. Shoot me a PM or comment on this and we can set up a time to talk.\n\nEdit: formatting","name":"t3_4jmcmj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-16 19:51:44","week":20}

{"id":"4jtt9c","author":"theoldraven","body":"Hello from Fulfillment by Amazon,\n\nIn 2015, FBA volumes, growth rates, and inventory levels were very high. As a result, our U.S. fulfillment centers were very full in November and December. This fullness was driven in part by FBA inventory that did not sell until well into 2016.\n\nTo avoid potential capacity constraints during the 2016 holiday season, we are accelerating the expansion of our fulfillment capacity. Additionally, we are changing our FBA fee structure to encourage all sellers to send in and store products in November and December that are likely to sell by the end of 2016. To give you time to plan for these changes, they will begin to take effect on October 1, 2016.","name":"t3_4jtt9c","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-18 01:39:18","week":20}

{"id":"4jxi5w","author":"zachcowell","body":"So I had an idea for product validation:\n\n* Build a site that markets a single product that performs really well on Amazon (a silicone baking mat)\n* Buy $20 in Facebook ads and target people who like to bake\n* Try and get them to convert and buy the thing on Amazon\n* If all the above is successful, cut off all the links to Amazon and instead do dropshipping for the same mat, but sold directly through me (through Shopify or Stripe or whatever).\n\nThat, in a nutshell, was my plan. I wanted to validated the idea by spending $20 in Facebook ads and trying to get at least 1 or 2 purchases. Here's the stats on the site:\n\n* FB ad cost: $20\n* Impressions: 1,805\n* Clicks: 17 (0.93%)\n* 0 conversions on the site\n* [Here is an image of the ad](http://imgur.com/uOSfVVZ)\n* [Here is the site](http://www.snackvault.com/)\n\nQuick note about the site: in the green sections, I had big fancy hero image backgrounds that looked pretty nice, but I stripped them out because it made the page stutter when scrolling; I wanted to go with a more performant site rather than something flashy. \n\nWhat do you think my issue is? The ad creative? The site? Should I increase my ad buy and see if I get some conversions?

If this should go in a different sub, please feel free to post it there as well.\n\nGoogle AdWords has a handy thing that will let you know if someone who followed your ad completed a certain action (like clicking to another page).  My site used to bounce traffic to my Amazon listing where customers could place their orders.  Problem is, Amazon doesn't let you add a tag to your listings, and my wordpress page wouldn't let me change the button so that the tag fired when the customer went to my amazon listing.\n\nWhat I did was create an intermediary page that fired the tag then sent the customer off to my amazon listing.

{"id":"4k56en","author":"Jrhess003","body":"Here's a little background of the past couple of days (I apologize it's a bit of a novel):\n\nI am a 22 year old male, 717 credit score, no other loans, have had a credit card with regions for a year (only card, 1k CL, co-signed with my dad who has credit score of 814). I applied for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and the Chase Freedom card. I was given a \"pending approval\" message at first. I called the backdoor number for Chase and spoke to a representative because I have read that it is okay to call the reconsideration line before getting an answer because it may help in getting approved. Both people I talked to said they denied me because I do not have enough of a credit history even though I have made all my payments on time and had a credit utilization of less than 20%. \n\nMy question is whether I should ask my dad to increase my credit limit, or whether I should apply for a different credit card to go along with the one I have now? If the first option, what is the max limit that I could probably get to put me in the best position to get a Sapphire Preferred (minimum limit offered is $5K) in a year or less? If the second option, what cards should I apply for, and should it be something different than a standard Regions Visa like a department store card or Amazon card?\n\nThanks in advance.","name":"t3_4k56en","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-20 00:42:18","week":20}

{"id":"4k5c6g","author":"sunday_silence","body":"A few days ago being a newbie I posted a question about what sort of possibilities of RA at Costco and I got a variety of answers most of them having to do with store brands and/or too much competition already or some such. So I went there with my new Amazon seller app in tow...\n\n\nJust about every product I scanned turned out to be \"restricted' when it came up on my Amazon app. Funny, huh? So I saw one of those water pick/dental kits things and I figured that might be a good candidate and there was some margin there but it came up restricted. Saw some ladies tank tops that were definitely a sale and \"restricted.\"  Then I saw the best deal was a package of those Keurig refills with Starbucks brand coffee, that was also restricted. \n\n\nI had signed up for Amazon seller or whatever so I had heard about restricted items so I figured this was for dangerous items or something like that. In fact if you read the amazon policy it talks about illegal items and violating laws and dangerous items. It doesnt say anything about \"Note also: every piece of flippable merchandise from Costco.\"\n\nSo like is it safe to assume any flippable product in Costco is already restricted?","name":"t3_4k5c6g","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-20 01:18:49","week":20}

Then they asked me to send 200 $ as a refund to the customer who make the order as he already paid for it. After a couple of days arguing with them for the refund I decided to do so this story will end. After I did the refund using western union as they asked and told me that I will receive my money in 48 hours. Has past four days and nothing, I send them a email about what is happening and the answer is that they can't send my money because the customer that I send the refund has a fixing account and he should close it but they asked me to send another 350$ to the customer so they can pay me. I want to sue Amazon for this story. Any suggestions? ","name":"t3_4ken80","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-21 19:54:26","week":20}

I have been working on sending in shipments lately, and on average I have only been getting like 30ish sales a month. My inventory is building because I get in a lot of medium to long tail items like books. I just sent in about 300ish retro games.  It will be the biggest shipment I have sent in so far, and one with the most video games for sure. \n\nI will also be able to work closer to full time for about 2 months June and July. Do you think I should take a shot at upgrading for Amazon Professional seller as this video game shipment gets checked in? I also today sent in another 100 or so items. Also first week of June I have to process about 500 books I sourced for free. Most seem long tail. Maybe 10% quicker sellers. \n\nI started to type this out on Newbie thread, but I am thinking this has to be at least moderately advanced no? I feel in between here. Hope this is ok.

The problem with that is that I live with my parents (I pay them rent, however) and only see them when I come home from work - being around them 24/7 as I would if I quit my job would drive me insane as they are constantly in my business and would nag me incessantly about getting a regular full-time job since they're very \"traditional\".

{"id":"4kj90r","author":"Violentos","body":"My first time having an item lost in transit. I wasn't sure what Amazon's policy was on the issue. They normally either send you the same item again or offer a full refund. Ok. That satisfies me. It's not their fault after all that the item didn't get delivered, it was the shippers fault (in this case the company was CEVA).\n\nSo why isn't the shipper responsible at all? The only thing they're expected to do is call you if a problem occurs and notify you. No compensation for their fault? Nothing offered for making you wait days extra and going through the process of contacting the seller for arrangements? Basically, they can't be held accountable?\n\nI'm just voicing my opinion on the matter and would be very interested to hear your opinions. I know: it's a 1st world problem. I'm not really mad about it, just curious as to the whole process setup. It's the principal of it. Perhaps the shipper does take a loss if Amazon doesn't re-pay the shipper to re-send a lost item?

{"id":"4kj9h0","author":"ZippyTheChicken","body":"Almost every time I see a post for someone requesting a way to earn some extra money to cover some bills there are a half dozen people suggesting that they sign up for Amazon Mechanical Turk and they can earn a couple hundred a month.\n\nThis is completely untrue and people that never tried this website need to stop suggesting it. It is an utter waste of someone's time. \n\nA few years ago i found myself at home unable to find work and unable to get out and look for work in a brick and mortar setting. It was due to health problems with a family member and I was pretty desperate to earn some money.\n\nI will tell you what things have gone back to this and right now I am going through the same thing and when I see people suggest Mechanical Turk i can only believe they never tried it.\n\n\nFirst of all you have to understand that much of the work in the Hits they give you is not really related to honest work. Much of it is psychological profiling and testing and as you will see some of it is not even available to you because they are targeting very specific groups. More so you will find that the hits that are available often pay about 10 cents US or less and take you 15 minutes or so to perform. Many are looking at someone's website to find mistakes, some are looking at images and sorting them and others are just so random you can't really understand why anyone wants this stuff done.. but heck if you can fork out $5 and have 500 of these things going does it matter?\n\n\nSo my experience is very poor with MTurk\n\nI do understand though that some people .. very very few people that to private work through MTurk do get paid a bit more. You have to be pre-approved to do this work. Its not open to everyone and the few hits of this type that I was approved for to do some writing were unjustifiably difficult to get paid for.\n\n\nMy earnings back a couple years\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UEhEW9m.png\n\n\nExamples of Hits you can earn.. look how little they pay \n\n3 cents for 20 minutes\n\n1 cent for 5 minutes\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AoeIDOn.png\n\n\nHighest Paid Hits are very unique .. and they are asking you to do stuff thats not quite on the up and up.. asking you to look for movies and use your internet account .. be on a specific cable provider.. then show them a screenshot of the movie.. wth\n\nyou just can not earn money on Mechanical Turk\n\nhow are you going to spend 10 minutes earning 3 cents? \n\nthis is worse than what they pay people in India.. these hits are probably indian companies hiring american workers that they put out of work to do their jobs for pennies...\n\nI mean really .. more than happy to make money helping companies this way but its got to pay more than 10 cents an hour...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HgZz0u7.png\n\nThe highest paid hits are transcriptions of 2 hour movies.. wow thats a ton of work for $35\n\nby the second page all of the hits that are sorted high to low are down in the sub $1 area and taking an hour or much longer... \n\nexample one is.. post 10 videos of yourself.. we will pay you 75cents... ok but then you also have a high probability of having these hits rejected. or reused in ways you don't want to think about.. \n\nfrom my experience Mechanical Turk is not a honest place to earn any amount of extra cash.. sure you might make something and I did after months I made like $20 but it is such an utter waste of your time.. you would be better off just sleeping or cleaning your home or anything more productive than trying to earn money on this site.\n\nthat is my experience and i really wish it wasn't.\n\nPLEASE STOP SUGGESTING THIS SITE FOR PEOPLE IN FINANCIAL NEED.. YOU CAN NOT EARN ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL FROM IT.....\n\nYou would be better off putting up a Blog about your dog and throwing Adsense ads on it... honestly","name":"t3_4kj9h0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-22 18:31:12","week":20}

{"id":"4kjux8","author":"JZerner","body":"On May 17th, I applied to sell in the DVD category on Amazon. Here are some details of my application. I chose the option of \"number of products to be sold\" to be \"Over 100\". I also submitted 3 invoices from my primary source of inventory. I was told by an Amazon Seller Support representative the following information. \n\n&gt; \"In requesting for selling DVDs on Amazon, you need to provide your primary source of inventory. You gave me a link for your primary source and upon checking, that is a valid primary source. Your next concern was about the 3 invoices. You need to provide 3 invoices within 90 days so that Amazon can verify if your primary source is still on business.\"\n\nSo according to Amazon, my primary source of inventory is valid. All 3 invoices are dated 5/17/16. So definitely within 90 days. Amazon also requires the following information to be on the invoices \n\n&gt;  Your name and contact information or your company’s name and contact information, the name and contact information of the company that provided the invoices and the names of the products you purchased and the quantity of each product\n\nMy invoice includes all of that information.\n\nSo everything seems to be going great up to this point.\n\nI then get an email back from Amazon and they told me that my invoices do not meet the minimum criteria and they cannot tell me any additional information regarding why the invoices do not meet the needed criteria. They also mentioned here that the invoices must contain \"A brief summary of processes you have in place to prevent inauthentic goods from entering your inventory.\"\n\nI replied to this by telling them \"My primary source of inventory tests each item as stated below “we will determine the condition of the item after we have fully tested the item” (link to quote from my source's website). Each and every DVD will also be personally tested by me, to ensure that ALL DVDs are authentic. I do not foresee any of my DVDs to be inauthentic, but if a case arises, all inauthentic DVDs will be disposed of and will NEVER reach an Amazon Fulfillment Center. After two thorough testing processes, there will be NO inauthentic goods in my inventory whatsoever. If you have any further questions with my application to sell in the DVD category please let me know.\"\n\nTo this point I feel that I have been more than reasonable answering all of their requests. \n\nAmazon then responded with the exact same email that they sent me before which told me the invoice requirements and about the inauthentic goods part.\n\nBut they added the following in another response. \" Due to proprietary information we are unable to disclose why certain invoices ought to be disapproved.\"\n\nThey are telling me now to submit other invoices instead of the ones that I sent them. I have a gut feeling that although I exceeded all the requirements Amazon put in place, they are rejecting my application for no reason.\n\nAlso, my seller metrics far exceed the requirements that they listed.\n\nSo this really bothers me because I've been selling on Amazon for a few years now and I've had no major issues with my account. I would think they would want me to be selling DVDs based on my history with them and the fact that my application meets all of their requests.\n\nLastly, I just started a chat with Amazon Seller Support twice and the representative left the chat abruptly twice. I didn't get a screenshot of the first one, but here is the second one. http://imgur.com/COk1Hzr\n\nIf anyone has ever dealt with an issue with what I am going through now I would really appreciate any help I can get. I just feel like I do what they tell me to do and then they reject me every time and I feel lost at this point. And a big thank you to everybody in this sub. I've received so much help up to this point and I am very grateful for everything.\n\n**TL;DR Amazon rejected my application to sell DVDs for what seems to be no reason.

{"id":"4kjwse","author":"alekspiridonov","body":"So, reddit, there is this celebrity (not like Hollywood, but odds are you probably have heard of them from TV) who does fairly informative and interesting releases on YouTube. On one of their episodes they made an accessory to a tool from scratch and designed it on the fly. I thought, \"hey, that's pretty cool!\" and made my own version in different materials with better feature set that can be easily mass produced.\n\nNow my plan is to set up a supply chain for this product and ideally sell it on Amazon. I think it would be great there since people often buy the tool that it goes with from Amazon as well.\n\nAfter doing some math and itemizing all the costs, I figured that to get this project rolling I would need to raise $50,000-$100,000 to get the ball rolling with minimal risk. I think I could raise these funds by letting people pre-order the product (at a slight premium, to offset initial tooling, testing, travel and startup costs) through a Kickstarter campaign. But that assumes that I would be able to generate 5,000+ pre-order sales to get into the quantity/price bracket that is workable.\n\nObviously, getting that many orders would require some marketing. So, I was thinking about sending one of my prototypes to the celebrity who originally inspired the whole venture with their original creation. If I could just get them to take a look at it, play around with the product, and let me know what they think about it - I would be ecstatic. If they liked it enough that they mentioned my fundraising campaign on their show - I would be so happy, I might go comatose. Finally, they have their own online store and I could even rebrand my product for sale there (this may mean less sales through my channels).\n\nWhat would be some reasons not to send out this sample? I know they could just steal my version of the product, but I don't know if it's worth their time and I don't think it's something they would do.

{"id":"4kkbix","author":"OctaShot","body":"Hey everyone. I just discovered this lock screen ad app and I'd like to share my thoughts. \n\nWhen you first open the app, it asks you to create an account using an email and password. Right of the bat you get 1500 points. If you use a referral link, you get 1250 additional points. If you would like to use my referral link, here it is: https://i.fronto.co/i/7bj3 . Otherwise, you can click here: [non-ref](http://www.fronto.co/). If you do end up installing the app without a referral link but want the bonus, you can go to settings&gt;Have A Promo Code? and enter my code: **freebank**\n\nNow for the breakdown. You can redeem both Amazon and PayPal (and Google Play, but who wants that?). The redeem rates are non-linear. A $1 Amazon Gift Card costs 3,250 points. A $20 Amazon gift card costs 50,000 points. If you were to redeem $20 worth of Amazon credit by buying $1 gift cards you would spend 65,000 points, leaving you with 15,000 less points than you could have if you had just saved for the $20 card. Even redeeming 2 $10 cards (26,875 each) leaves you 3,750 in the red. 50,000 points is a golden number because you need exactly 40 people using your referral code to reach it. It also makes it so that every 1250 points is worth $0.50.\n\nPayPal has different costs. $1 PayPal is 3,375 points and $20 is 52,500 points. Twenty $1 PapPal purchases is 67,500 points, costing you 15,000 points for your impatience. 42 referrals will net you $20 PayPal. If you choose PayPal and go for the $20 card, every referral is worth $0.476.\n\nYou earn points depending on what you do. Sometimes unlocking the lock screen will give you 5 points. Other times you get a 20 point offer that tries to open something in Google Play but rewards you just for swiping it. Then there are install and open offers should you choose to do them. I recommend doing these as they give the most points. It doesn't take long to install, open and uninstall. There are also offers that ask you to take surveys or submit your email but I highly discourage anyone from doing them because I've yet to actually be rewarded for them (they are 3rd party offers that Fronto has no control over). \n\nI just started this morning and already have 5152 points. Remember to use my referral code (freebank) or link for 1250 free points. Even if you have no plans to use Fronto long term, you can get $1 in about 5 minutes by doing one install and open offer. You can then uninstall Fronto with $1 in your pocket. \n","name":"t3_4kkbix","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-05-22 22:26:55","week":20}

{"id":"4kkizf","author":"acamu5x","body":"Hey /r/entrepreneur!\n\nI'm writing this post at work on May 22nd, 2016, just under a month since I launched my business. So far, I've made $9.39 in Amazon affiliate money. This is my journey. \n\n#The Backstory:\n\nI'm a 20-something college kid from Toronto, and have been chasing the entrepreneurial dream since highschool. I'm a marketing student, and freelance web design while working at a gym this summer. The $12/hr is enough to live an average student life, but I'm hungry for more. \n\n#The Idea:\n\nWe've all heard of niche sites on reddit before. Stuff like [ThisIsWhyImBroke](http://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/) and [ShutUpAndTakeMyMoney](http://shutupandtakemymoney.com/) make a ton of money, and provide awesome value to their customers. They feature a bunch of awesome stuff, but some of the prices are outrageous. This is where I come in. \n\n#The Business:\n\nLast year I registered TechUnder20.com on a whim, and promptly forgot about it until it expired and someone else grabbed it. Oops. So I started **www.TechUnder10.com** instead. That's when I accidentally stumbled upon my niche. \n\nCheap tech gifts and gadgets that are geared towards me- a college kid with a bit of pocket money to spare. Having plenty of WordPress experience, I whipped together a minimalistic site, and started adding awesome products from all over the internet. \n\n#The Day reddit Crashed my Site:\n\nI stumbled upon [this askreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4gs7l2/what_is_the_coolest_thing_you_can_buy_for_under_5/d2kdoi6?context=3) a month ago about cheap gifts, and decided to share my newly built site. And holy shit, you guys seemed to love it (maybe a bit too much). Within a few hours, I felt the warm embrace of reddit's hug of death. My site crashed, and I had my first \"Holy shit this has potential\" moment. I also started /r/techunder10, which is a work in progress to say the least :)\n\n# Advertising:\n\nI'm launching reddit, Bing, Facebook and Google ads on June 1st. In addition, I'm creating a weekly newsletter, Instagram, and Facebook page. The delay gives me more time to add a few hundred new products. Embarrassingly enough, I need to wait until my next payday to spend any significant money on advertising.\n\n#What I've Learned:\n\nThis is my [Amazon snapshot](http://imgur.com/dyOlez0) and [Google Analytics info](http://imgur.com/jM3Kk6G). I'm coming up on 4,000 sessions, and 1,000 clicks on my site, with a 1.2% conversion rate. My main demographic is males 18-30 from the US. Reddit's proven that there is a market for my site, and I'd love the chance to compete with the big niche sites out there.\n\nSo that leaves me with this. \n\n#I Need Some Help.\n\nI've learned so much from you guys over the past couple years, through all my reddit accounts. I even founded [Toy Soldier Marketing](http://www.toysoldiermarketing.com) because of this sub. As you can tell, I'm pretty inexperienced in this industry, and need some advice- again. \n\n^^^^. \n\n1. I'm ranking on Google's 3rd page for \"Tech Under 10\". Since my site is primarily pictures and links, how do I boost my ranking without becoming a blog site?\n\n2. What do you think my best advertising channel is, and how much should I spend initially?\n\n3. What would you change about my site, design or functionally?\n\n4. Do you think this idea is worth pursuing? \n\n^^^^.\n\n**Thanks so much for your time guys :)**\n\n^^^^. \n\n***tl;dr: Started www.techunder10.com a month ago. Reddit liked it, but i'm unsure of the best way to proceed. Calling in for some help.","name":"t3_4kkizf","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-22 23:12:13","week":20}

I tried pricing something at $150 as I was the only seller in new condition and didn't get the buy box, but then lowered it to $109 and got the buy box.\n\nIf you're the only seller and you don't have the buy box when the item is FBA, it is usually for 1 of 2 reasons:\n\n1. Your price is above the MSRP or list price. If that is the case, you will most likely not get any buy box. It will just say \"available from the following 3rd part sellers\" or something along those lines.\n\n2. Even if your price is below MSRP, you may still not get the buy box if other big box retailer like WalMart, Target, Toys R Us, etc. are selling it for cheaper.

{"id":"d3775pk","author":"MeFigaYoma","body":"&gt; I would like to just use the exemption certificate and **keep track of and pay my state taxes on my own like I have been doing** since not charging tax seems like a competitive advantage on FBA.\n**I already pay my quarterly fed and state sales tax** and did my own taxes with turbotax for 2015.\n\nSince you're asking about getting a resale certificate, I assume you don't already have a sales tax license. Can you please clarify as to what exactly you're talking about here? Also, FYI, there is no federal sales tax. Could it be you're confusing sales tax and income tax?\n\nAlso, the reason most Amazon sellers don't charge sales tax is because they're only obligated to charge it within their own state, and since most Amazon sellers aren't in Maryland, you don't see any sales tax from them. Believe me, they *are* charging it, or else they will be soon ;)\n\nIn general, you should get the sales tax license ASAP unless you're just starting out, since it's required by law. Having a resale certificate is just a \"benefit\" that comes along with complying. However, I'm wondering what kind of supplier you're planning to buy from that's *in Maryland* and lets you use a resale certificate? That could provide some clues as to your situation.\n\nFinally, this doesn't seem to apply to you yet, but most states *technically* say that if you have product stored in a warehouse stored in that state, you have nexus, and thus must collect sales tax in that state. Of course most people don't bother with this, but there have been rumors of some states (I'm looking at you, Pennsylvania) sending out threatening letters to start collecting sales tax. Currently the only exceptions are I believe Virginia and New York (which doesn't have any FBA warehouses). If you really want to be a sales-tax-collecting angel, the TaxJar blog (google it) has information on the sales tax policies of all 50 states.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, and I don't work for TaxJar.","name":"t1_d3775pk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-16 07:52:18","week":20}

The Amazon shipping prep page will tell you what needs to be bagged and have a suffocation warning on it ( usually stuff animals I have seen)   Once all your items are labeled and you double check them , Amazon will usually divide your shipment up to multiple wharehouses. Just make sure to put the right items in boxes Amazon tells you too. I use my old leftover  grocery bags smooshed together to fill space. Amazon doesn't seem to mind but don't use packing peanuts to fill empty spade unless you put them in ziplock baggies first. I hope this helped. I'm on.

{"id":"d37soox","author":"zseelye","body":"Cancelled my Prime membership a few months ago. Amazon was fulfilling their promise of 2-day shipping, but it was taking them 3-5 days to send items. I'd been a prime member for 3 years, and had grown to depend on it, so when orders began taking a week to arrive, it was a serious let-down.\n\nI called customer service to see what was up (a few times), and the issue was never resolved. I was told they have no policy on how long an item can be in processing prior to shipment. I primarily used prime for the shipping benefits, so it was basically of no value anymore. I cancelled, and have been using super-saver shipping and other stores ever since. \n\nFYI: Delivery with super-saver shipping only takes about 2/3 days longer.","name":"t1_d37soox","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-16 20:45:35","week":20}
{"id":"d37swch","author":"salsasymphony","body":"I have been sleeping on a Casper mattress for a year, and I've gotten 2 referral credits in that time. One guy returned his because his wife didn't like it (though he loved it). The return policy in action is as-advertised. He wasn't hassled about it at all. In fact, the only hold up was because in Georgia, laws forbid used mattresses from being recycled/resold. So Casper couldn't find anyone to take it and finally called the junk yard. My buddy was extremely impressed they tried so hard to recycle it. When the junk movers came to take it, he pleaded with them to take it home instead of taking it to the dump - it was a brand new, king sized mattress.\n\nI didn't finance - buy it straight away if you can afford it!\n\nThe firmness is too firm if you like soft. I love a firm mattress so this was great for me, but my wife adores ultra-soft, so she asked for a pillow topper (so has everyone I know using one). They send it out real quick, except I requested it after only the first night and they told me to give it a couple weeks and see if things got any better. My wife still wasn't feeling it after a few weeks, so I asked again and received it within 3 days. Now my wife ADORES the Casper. Every other night when she plops down she says, and I quote, \"Why does our bed have to be so soft and comfy?\" (because usually after the first plop she has not yet changed into her pajamas). So yeah, we're totally happy with our Casper now.\n\nI haven't tried other memory foam except in stores, and that's not a fair comparison if I didn't take it home. But there was only one bed (a Tempur-Pedic) that we could both agree on (because of our polar firm/soft preferences), and it was heavenly. We drove home from Mattress Firm discussing how we could adjust our budget to afford $100/month for that $5,000 mattress. Thank goodness we didn't go that route...\n\nI just heard yesterday about this company Tuft &amp; Needle. Apparently they're selling almost the same thing but for a little cheaper. So... meh. I love the customer experience of having a Casper, so I'm plenty happy with our purchase (queen-sized). From what I can tell by the website, they're almost identical (the website, the product, and the company).\n\nYou didn't ask, but the referral program is legit too. Like I said, I've gotten credit for 2 referrals and immediately receive a $50 Tango gift card via email good for any number of retailers. We cashed those into $100 Amazon credit. It's legit and awesome.","name":"t1_d37swch","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-16 20:50:27","week":20}

Unless you are doing things to add value (IE using adwords to promote your site somewhere) then you won't get far.\n\n**2)** Even the best dropshippers will screw up sometimes.  They tell you that something is in stock when it isn't or oversell, etc...\n\n**3)** Software can also screw up.  Either by not running often enough or by crashing upon import.  Sometimes the file has changed with new inventory &amp; your listings/website does not reflect it.  Better software (which works differently) is more expensive.\n\n**4)** If you plan on selling on major retail channels with catalogs (IE Amazon), lots of people are trying to trip you up.  They associate UPCs to incorrect ASINs so that when you do it in bulk, you accidentally sell the wrong item &amp; upset your customer.\n\n**5)** Dropshippers know what they have and tend to price themselves high.  They're a lot more interested in getting you to see which items are popular &amp; buying wholesale than dropshipping unit-by-unit.  So even when you do sell, you won't make so much money.  More to the point, if you find *anything* that's remotely attractive, you won't be able to ride it out.  You'll get a small piece of the pie for your work.\n\n**6)** Many feeds don't provide much in the way of content.  They'll have a UPC, price &amp; quantity.  Putting together all of the content based on a UPC is a lot of work.\n\n.\n\nHaving said all of that, dropshipping is a fantastic model for *identifying* inventory that is currently moving well.  It's also good for offering a vast catalog &amp; being approached by customers who you can develop relationships with.  It allows you to sell in volume (albeit with little profit) and from there you can negotiate shipping rates which open other doors.  From time to time, new retail channels open up or new opportunities open up within known retail channels.  You can make a killing when you're in the right place.  Or - if you're so lucky - you will have some dynamic idea to generate traffic to your own site &amp; not have to compete on bare minimum price.\n\n","name":"t1_d38bqkc","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-05-17 04:33:42","week":20}

{"id":"d38ff32","author":"Jancy52","body":"Sorry this is long, but it's not about the buying, it' obviously about the ability to store it.  I've got about 60 plastic bundles of (30 rolls)  TP under my bed right now due to buying on sale and not having enough space for it.        \nBe sure you have a bug free area for storage (old time wooden pantries are notorious for having \"pantry pests\" - flour weevils, etc. living in the cracks of old wood work and getting into boxed cereals. I suggest if you are building a pantry - use wire.)  \n\n I leave dried/dehydrated foods in their original plastic bags if there are no holes, and store in seal-able 5 gallon buckets or heavy totes with lids, then rotate my stock every so often, inspecting  containers to ensure there are no pests inside having taken up residence.  I install air valves on each lid, and pull the air out using a hand pump (much like a bike pump) and that helps get rid of air, the second step s the silica packs to help absorb moisture (if you learn nothing else remember this;  moisture destroying foods due to mold.)  There are any number of preppers who have basic advice about what kinds of containers to use for long term prepping and the \"how to's\",  but the best advice I got was from a Mormon site due to their mandate about having a three year pantry for every family home.  The USDA has plenty of hand books on food safety and storage ideas on their website as well.   Plenty of books on the internet about how to build a pantry (including buying in bulk and how to care for your stored items and general life expectancy of foods. )  \n\n Last year  I purchased twenty large 30 quart size Rubbermaid restaurant style clear containers for my grains, rice and beans, and all our staples (four, sugar, salt.)   50 pounds of rice fills up 3.5 containers, so it's nice if you can leave it in it's original bag and stored in a stack.  If there are no holes all you need to do it keep an eye out for vermin as well as bugs. Rubbermaid and roughneck containers hold up nicely.    \n \nYou will need to research how long different foods will store safely and set up your pantry/storage area for that purpose - not forgetting vermin pest control!  \n\nDon't buy stuff you will never eat!  That's the first key!   Just because you have it doesn't give you freedom to eat all of it at once!  I find my family hesitates to open anything I have \"stored.\"    \n\nPeople also forget to buy bulk seasonings.... if you cook with it find it in the largest sealed container you can.   I buy baking soda in 20 pound sizes on Amazon for example and the bag is a bitch to get opened.  There are seasonings no frugal person would ever purchase like taco seasonings - it' just chili powder, paprika, citric acid, and salt among a few other specialized ingredients, learn to make your own.  \n\nHopefully you know how to cook from scratch, so stuff you buy should reflect your lifestyle and avoid buying any items in boxes...   sealed bags and sealed containers  are your best buddies.  \n\nLearn how to can food in season so you can save money and can everything possible yourself to save money...  I own an impressive amount of both new and antique mason jars - spending on lids on a regular basis.  Or just buy canned food when on sale.\n\nIF learning to can, you can not reuse jelly jars as those lids won't ever  attain a true seal, even if you try to use paraffin on the top or in time you'll end up with mold if you fail to refrigerate. \n\nI dehydrate and make jerky and then store it in mason jars using a valve and air removal or sometime I do the water bath technique.\n \nI invested in a large powerful vacuum food saver, but you will need to be careful with home-prepared foods in these saver bags due to possible spoilage if there is any moisture in the food, or the bags are contaminated.\n\nWhen searching for dehydrate milk - full fat milk tastes better and can be used to make yogurt but full fat milk has a higher spoilage rate due to the fat content.  I keep cases of cans of sweetened condensed milk in cans instead of dry milk.  But if storage is limited go with the powdered stuff.\n  \nDon't forget it's not just food you can buy in bulk.  We make our own laundry detergent, and i buy the powdered detergent and keep it available in bulk. \n  \nYou can make your own dehydrated eggs cheaper than buying, but aging and spoilage is a factor if not dehydrated or canned correctly for storage.  Eggs are safer bought from a professional company who does this for a living.\n\nThere are still some places where you can rent a canning machine for #10 size cans (coffee size metal cans) for canning dehydrated foods like beans and rice and flour...  usually associated with a local Mormon church, or German Baptist or Amish...  would need to look.\n\nOne last note:  also invest in a milling grinder to make your own flours from grain if needed. one buys grains in bulk for this purpose.  I grind our own corn for corn meal and store it. I grind rye for flour as well, buying in bulk and then grinding up  enough for a month at a time as I also home make bread.    I like to cook with rice flour, but refuse to pay the high price for it, so I grind my own at home using a cast iron manual crank corn grinder.   One can also make and stuff sausage with it, an depending on the brand you can get various attachments for it.

{"id":"d38r3of","author":"lurgid","body":"**TL;DR** Sold a couple of items a few years back MF on Amazon, including an old unlocked cell phone, and ended up with negative feedback from some sort of scam buyer (never really could figure out the angle). I'm looking into getting started with FBA in a \"serious hobby\" sort of way, but is my 66.6% rating going to hold me back (3 reviews, with the 1 negative), and is there anything I can perhaps do with Amazon to remove it? I don't want my business to suffer before it even begins in earnest.\n\n--------\nHere's the story for more insight:\n\nSold an unlocked Nokia Lumia, merchant fulfilled, to an address in Florida with a number and name for the To: line, like this \"ve923844 Andry Lastname,\" but the contact email for the email just simply said \"carmen.\"\n\nI had previously unlocked the phone with AT&amp;T and had successfully used a foreign SIM card in it myself. Over a month later, the buyer asks, in broken English, \"Hello, i need code unlock  please, i use this phone internacional,\" at which point I let her know that's it's been unlocked already and then even went ahead and gave her the unlock code from AT&amp;T. She then replies with a picture of the phone where it is asking for the SIM PIN (in Spanish), and not an unlock code and \"I can't yet. Please help me.\" \n\nI then ask her what SIM is in the phone, and then also give her the default SIM PIN for AT&amp;T (1111) and tell her that she may have to ask support from whomever the SIM was purchased for the default SIM PIN. She let's me know the SIM was from Movistar, and I then went to Movistar's site to tell her to contact Movistar Customer care to get the default PIN and to stop entering random codes to keep the SIM from being locked and no longer usable. To which she then again asks me to get the \"code international\" from AT&amp;T, which I had already given her, and I had already applied and unlocked the phone with before selling it. So I tell her again, that the PIN she is looking for is 4 numbers and should have been included with the SIM card and after it's entered, then she can change it to a PIN of her choosing, and even found Movistar's customer support number and gave it to her. And she finally ended the email conversation with \"Ok. Thank you very much.\"\n\nThis was all on 5/14/2014, and I had shipped USPS Priority on 3/27/2014. On 5/16/2014, she left a 1 star rating saying \"cell phone say unlock. i had to pay for unlock here.\"\n\nFast forward two years, to a couple of weeks ago (5/6/2016), I now get an email from \"carmen\" stating \"I do not get this product. I want my refund in gift card  . I got in touch with freight forwarder and the product did not arrive . please make my  refund in gift card as soon as possible .\" I was a bit salty, because of the 1-star review previously, and this was sent to me while I was on vacation, and I replied that she most certainly received it, as she had sent me a picture of it in her possession two years ago and the tracking number proves that it reached the address in Medley, FL to which it was listed to ship.\n","name":"t1_d38r3of","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-17 15:32:55","week":20}

{"id":"d38xod4","author":"CarlFriedrichGauss","body":"Oh sorry, I misread your original post and skipped over the part about not being interested in FF or hotel points. But even then, the Freedom Unlimited still makes a strong case to get due to the $150 (+$25 if you add an authorized user) sign up bonus, plus there's no annual fee so you don't ever have to cancel the card. You'd have to spend $30,000 on the Double Cash in order for it to \"break even\" with the FU (1.5% of $30k = $450 + $150 sign up bonus vs 2% of $30k = $600). However, the smartest thing to do is to get a 1.5% cash back card with a sign up bonus, and then switch to the 2% card after you get the bonus.\n\nAnother card you might be interested in is the Discover IT, which has 5% cash back on quarterly rotating categories and 1% cash back on everything else. Instead of a sign up bonus, they give you double your cash back after the end of the first year, which makes it a 2% cash back card for the first year. The 5% categories usually go in some order of:\n\n1. Restaurants\n2. Gas stations and public transit\n3. Grocery stores\n4. Amazon (during October-December, of course)\n\nIf your daycare provider accepts Discover, it's certainly a very compelling card to use for the first year because you'll be getting 2% from daycare and 10% from the other bonus categories. Even after the first year, the 5% categories are worth it. It beats the Chase Amazon Visa during the holiday season.\n\nChase Freedom is similar to Discover It but offers a sign up bonus of $150 (+$25 for an authorized user) instead of the double cash back for the first year. Good card to have because while the 5% categories are the same as Discover, they occur at different times.","name":"t1_d38xod4","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-05-17 18:09:23","week":20}

{"id":"d3924qb","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"\"oil price is low,people have more money to spend on stuff\"\n\nPeople have said that incessantly on CNBC for a year now. \n\nDepartment stores have since been fucking obliterated, including Nordstrom, Macy's, Kohl's,  JCP and others. The consumer is not not spending, but they are spending on things like the home (Home Depot, which is down today because of commentary but was otherwise a good quarter), travel/experiences (Disney, Expedia) and restaurants/electronics. They are absolutely NOT spending on apparel at department stores. Additionally, Amazon is only getting more and more powerful against much of retail - it's predicted that Amazon will be the largest apparel seller in 2017, taking over the #1 spot from Macy's. \n\nSo, it's not that the consumer is not spending at all, but the idea is that e-commerce is having a devastating effect on some stores (like Macy's and Nordstrom) and others are also feeling an effect. Some chains basically stuck their head in the sand and hoped Amazon would go away, only to find that the Amazon effect has gotten worse.\n\nI fully believe that a lot of chains have more stores than they need and you will see a shrink in store count for chains like Kohl's, Macy's, JCP, Office Depot/Staples and others. Bed, Bath and Beyond is slowly heading into irrelevance - take away those coupons that they constantly send people and there's no reason to go to those stores whatsoever. Gamestop is eventually irrelevant. The Container Store is ... well, getting obliterated. Sports Authority is gone. Smaller/weaker/lesser quality mall REITs will be effected. While I am not negative on Macy's real estate, I'm not as optimistic on some as I think we are going to see a glut of retail real estate in this country. Sears will go soon enough and there will not be tenants to fill all those spaces. A lot of apparel is going to have to be liquidated by closing apparel stores in the years ahead. \n\nNadella has done a fine job with MSFT turning around a lot of the issues from the Ballmer era, but it's not a cheap stock and I'd like to see it with more of a margin of safety.","name":"t1_d3924qb","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-17 19:43:36","week":20}

{"id":"d39aizp","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"I'm not going to say that Amazon is within the ballpark of reasonable valuation by any means, but I also ultimately see a future where Amazon continues to basically lay waste to a retail sector that largely stuck its head in the sand and hoped Amazon would go away. When you look at what is going on with Macy's, Nordstrom and others, I only see that accelerating. We are over-retailed in this country and many of these chains will shrink (Bed Bath and Beyond is one that not enough people are talking about; take those coupons away that they incessantly send people and there's no reason to go into those stores.) Many low/mid-end malls are going to have real difficulty dealing with vacancies.\n\nI'm more positive on AWS than some and Amazon continues to move into logistics, not to mention 18 other things. The company has had few complete whiffs (Fire Phone being a big example). I'm not going to be lining up to invest in it, but with a retail industry that has passed the point of being able to challenge Amazon (Gap now announcing today that they will consider partnering with Amazon, not out of strength but of desperation), Amazon seems to be gathering momentum. I'm not saying that the mall will go away - you're going to see some of the major malls evolve - but there's going to be a lot of empty retail real estate in this country. So yeah, I'm not going to argue that the valuation is remotely attractive, but I think when you look at what is happening to retail and where things are going (not to mention AWS and other factors), I think retail in the United States will change massively in the next 5 years, in a way that will be remarkable and really require some creativity as to how to repurpose a lot of mall space.\n\n\"Sears Holdings eventual demise will bring with it the closure of almost 2000 mall and off mall stores. Though some locations may be successfully repurposed by either Lampert’s Seritage Real Estate Trust, or other involved landlords, most may very well go dark and stay dark. Coupled with store closings at Macy’s, JC Penney JCP -1.76%, other mall anchors and specialty tenants, Sears’ closures may signal the eventual death rattle of many of the B, C and D level malls throughout the US.\" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen/2016/02/29/sears-holdings-retailings-headless-horseman/2/#63a37cf57599)","name":"t1_d39aizp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-05-17 22:39:18","week":20}

I have a hanger and a space for each item of clothing in my closet and can see at a glance what is still needing to be washed/dried and returned.    In the first three years after retirement I wore out all of my work attire and figured out I needed to replace things as I went along, including shoes (my work shoes are in plastic and sitting in boxes waiting to be used one day- I prefer to wear sandles or flip flops around the house... I'll haunt thrift shops and Walmart alike, but prefer a decent women's shop when things are on sale and often buy from specialty shops or Amazon as the mood hits me.

My sons have five pair of jeans/pants each and 15 T shirts and several nice sets of clothing for going out (their Dad supplies for them.)  They are also minimalists.

Food Waste is a huge issue that I have become very passionate about! We watched 2 documentaries over the X-mas break and after doing a bit of research, tried it! It was not like I thought, and after the first obscene haul of fresh fresh food we were hooked! Our grocery bill now is $40 A MONTH not including ALL that I give away to those who also now have similar bills! And that is only because we like to buy Organic fresh milk etc or go out for Sushi lunch 2x a month. I never have to buy K-cups again after finding over 2,500 at a BBB! \n\nOMG U shop at Audi's? They have the best stuff, all on top, in boxes, sealed in packaging bread, dairy, meat and just tons of fresh produce churned b4 the weekend and then again after the weekend! I dare U 2 take a peek, if UR embarrassed say UR looking for a spare box! Open ur eyes &amp; ur mind and spend UR grocery budget on other things or just save it! \n\nNow some of the people in these docs are a bit extreme!

If U had told me I would be doing this 5, 10, even 1 year ago I would've said U are crazy or I must be committed! lol The diff between my perception vs the reality of what I've encountered is astonishing! Nobody has ever gotten sick or really harassed, besides the rare double-take. We \"dive\" in luxury German vehicles! We are not doing this outta necessity (although the $ savings is wonderful &amp; significant) but more outta principle now, and of course the thrill (it's like a treasure hunt) Our country is the most wasteful and doesn't give or donate as much as U would assume, for if they did, there would be no hunger or \"food insecure\" families in this country! Only France, has recently OUTLAWED food waste and now mandates they donate everything! Stores can staff a whole LP (loss-prevention) div but not spare a couple people for WP (waste-prevention) to divert all the \"culled food\" and returned merchandise and coordinate with local food pantries etc for pick up! Instead it all goes into the trash where only a couple percent is \"rescued\" most goes into compactors where NONE of it can be!

{"id":"d3abxnk","author":"BizChap","body":"There's a ton of work in the service-side on the business industry asides from what you named\n\nTo name you some examples:\n\n1. Photography work for products for businesses in the area and /or publishing catalog work using Adobe InDesign. Any retailer outlet will need this, smaller outfits would prefer someone local\n\n2. Youtubing / Blogs - Generate revenue there I guess? \n\n3. Writing e-books and selling it off\n\n4. AmazonFBA, and or dropshipping retailing outlets. Alibaba, made-in-china, Globalsource.com. Private labelling. Ebaying. Selling things. Lots of avenues here\n\n5. Building a restaurant, there's more so a tendency for people to do foodtrucks. Deli's, I am not sure what kind of deli you are referring to (like a subway -style fast casual?) or more like a supermarket style? Supermarkets are generally higher risk imo, deli shops are all about the location and the concept. I actually know a lot about this industry if you want general advice. Food trucks are hot right now, and Food trucks for dog chow food is especially sexier right now in the trending industry. **SIDE NOTE** Don't bother getting into restaurant industry unless you plan to go big IMO, you'll just work at a deli and write your \"Existential\" post again 3 years from now. \n\n6. Deli sauce industry. Wuju sauce is an example here. I am not sure how hard this is, manufacturing food products. You can work together with a local \"shared kitchen environment\" to do this. Really, this isn't something you should pursue unless you have a deep rooted passion for cooking\n\n7. Service driven work - e.g. lawn mowing company. Maid driven service. There's lesser known ones here as well, such as EcoLab style dishwashing solution business (chemical business has high margins). There's also washing the front of houses (power spraying), there's also IFixIT / IT related work -sort of businesses.\n\n8. Consulting. Become good at what you do in whatever avenue it is, you can get paid for just advice. Programming not so much, consulting ends up becoming programming. Talking about niche specialty fields (Book writing consultant / marketing, International Trade Logistics and Sourcing Agents overseas [connections are big here], marketing consultant for XYZ)\n\nReally, like another comment said here, you are in existential crisis. Just stop what you are doing, go on vacation , take a breather, and let all the real things you want to do surface while your relaxing on vacation. Then pick up from there. Best ideas come when you don't expect it\n\nYou should be doing business because its fun as well, not just for money\n\nJust my 2 cents\n\nAlso, once you work in the deli business, you are probably going to get bored. Not much to explore and work on unless from the get-go you plan to scale upward. Also, I can name you a few examples here personally from people I know, but starting a really successful restaurant relies heavily on good marketing as well. And location. And concept. I could run a restaurant if I wanted too (as I know exactly what I'd have to do to make it work), but it wouldn't be successful (it'd feel like work, not fun), because I have 0 passion for running one, and it'd show, you might be in the same boat, just saying.\n\nI suggest you go on meetup.com and find some areas of interest and explore that.","name":"t1_d3abxnk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-18 17:46:29","week":20}

I can get a 13-lb bag or MeowMix at Wal-Mart for the same price as a 3.5-lb bag at the grocery store.

{"id":"d3aezbe","author":"myrpfaccount","body":"Unless you're really working to maximize point value (a la /r/churning), you're probably coming out worse off than just getting cash back. JetBlue points, in particular, often have a redemption value of about 1/2 cent per point - most cards give you a 1 cent per point cash back option.\n\nI, personally, wouldn't close any of these cards - I would call the companies and ask them to downgrade to a no annual fee card. Put them in a drawer, the companies will eventually close them for inactivity on their own. Having older cards open on your credit report gives you a slightly higher score, so it's actually good for your credit at some level to have them open. If you're worried about closing the older ones, buy yourself 50 cents of Amazon credit or something every 6 months or so and pay the balance right away. They usually don't differentiate between a lot of activity and very little when it comes to keeping the account open.\n\nHonestly, I'd replace all the cards you have - they're not great when it comes to rewards. A simple approach is to use a combination of a Chase Freedom/Discover IT (for 5% back rotating categories) and a Citi Double Cash/Chase Freedom Unlimited (for ~1.6 cents per point redemption) on everything else. This is a great, hands-off combination of cards that gives you a really solid, steady reward. They also all have sign up bonuses which are nice.\n\nIf you go with Chase I'd probably get both Chase cards since you can couple them with a Chase Sapphire Preferred card and use that to transfer your points over to travel partners and push your redemption up to around 2-2.5 cents per point. Don't do this unless you start paying attention to annual fees, etc., because that drives the value down so you need to go in with a plan. If you want to get into that kind of thing, visit /r/churning and learn the ropes there. It takes a fair amount of time and effort though, so it's not for everyone.","name":"t1_d3aezbe","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-18 18:51:48","week":20}

There are nice minimum wage jobs that essentially pay you to do homework while sitting at a front desk of some kind.\n\n5) Depending on your major or field of interest, it's possible to find off campus works relating to that interest. I was a mass communication major and worked at 2 radio stations part time. It was great for the resume and the bank account.\n\n6) If you have a credit card, great. Be smart with it.

Best thing to do is to scan them with the Amazon selling app (free) to see what you would get for each book after fees.\n\nTo answer the \"worth it\" question, it might be worth it to try a few out just to get the hang of selling on Amazon, but it's probably not going to be sustainable long term unless you can really ramp up.

{"id":"d3bi094","author":"sheymyster","body":"Most books you come across are going to be \"penny books\". This means they sell for the minimum Amazon allows, which is $0.01, but all books also cost $3.99 for shipping. This shipping credit is also rewarded to the seller, so they get $4.00 total minus fees from Amazon. The profit comes from the fact that sending a single book doesn't cost $4.00 with certain shipping methods, so the seller still profits if he gets the book dirt cheap. \n\nMost of these penny book sellers will buy gaylords or even truckloads of books, pick out the ones worth actual money and sell them with Amazon FBA or other methods. The rest of the \"penny books\" get listed for $0.01 and $3.99 shipping and profit a few cents when they sell. These guys work in unbelievable volume so that few cents add up, plus all of the books they get in their large volume purchases that are actually worth decent money. \n\nSo, if you're going to sell books on Amazon, I'd suggest using something like the Amazon seller app. It lets you scan the barcode on the back of the book, or you can type the ISBN or title manually if it doesn't have a barcode, to check the current selling prices before you make a purchase. That way, you only buy books worth flipping. ","name":"t1_d3bi094","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-19 14:36:27","week":20}

{"id":"d3br3fm","author":"r4ndpaulsbrilloballs","body":"1. I think maybe you never took Econ 101.  None of this stuff is in it.  Seriously.  It's not about taking on debt and \"using business capital\" whatever that means.  Here.  [This is the most popular econ 101 textbook in the world](http://cyber.sibsutis.ru:82/Monarev/docs/nauka/PROBABILITY/MVspf_Stochastics%20in%20finance/Mankiw%20N.G.%20Principles%20of%20microeconomics%20(2ed.,%202001\\)(481s\\).pdf).  It was written by Greg Mankiw, George W. Bush's chair of the council of economic advisors.  It takes a while to load.  So give it time.  But you can have a look through it if you want.  Then even you, yes, *you*, will understand what Econ 101 is about.  Here's a hint for you: It's not about company finance.  And then maybe you'll stop doing that cutesy libertarian \"learn econ 101 thing.\"  Because it's only cute to people who never actually took economics in college.  To everyone else who has taken economics classes in college, you only sound like an ass when you confuse business classes with econ classes.  So stop doing that. Okay?  Great.  Moving on...\n\n2. When you say, \"Opening a new business required taking on debt,\" you're wrong.  Very wrong.  In fact, Tesla has relatively little debt.  They equity financed.  Again, I think you didn't even quite get to take  the business classes, never mind confusing them with economics classes...\n\n3. Ah, but then again, maybe you did take the business classes.  Nobody else would be focused on business process re-engineering and all that voodoo about a restaurant.  Here's a better tip any illiterate immigrant who starts a restaurant can tell you: 1) Have good food, 2) Never lose a customer, give things away first, 3) Employ family instead of paying wages, 4) Don't ever go into debt for a restaurant or a store, sleep in the basement if you have to first, and 5) Know the commercial real estate and landlords around you...if someone's going to rent a nearby spot to put in a competitive business, get to the landlord first and snatch it up.  Put something that loses there temporarily.  Anything to stop direct competition from incoming too close.  Seriously, just talk to owners.  This shit ain't hard.  You don't need a lot of 'process re-engineering' to serve slices and hamburgers at the corner house of pizza.  That's some McDonalds Hamburger University level shit.\n\n4. Which \"economics books\" hold up Amazon as the de fact example of how patience in the stock market should be done?  Can you name them specifically?  We're 22 years into the slow burn on Amazon.  ExxonMobil still earns more profit in a week than they have in a generation.  Should shareholders give them 40 years?  60 years?  80 years?  100 years?  How long is it reasonable before they demand a profit?   22 years without profit doesn't seem a little exuberant to you?\n\nWe'll see what happens.  Only the future will tell.  To be honest, I thought tech companies were much closer to fairly valued 3 years ago than today.  They've just shot through there roof.  And I, for one, think gravity will bring them down.\n\nOf course, we're talking about predicting the future.  So maybe you're right.  Maybe tech stocks will never crash and they'll continue to grow faster than inflation, stocks in all other sectors, and every other investment forever until kingdom come.  But I don't think so...I think they've got maybe 18 months left in them before everyone wakes up and realizes the emperor has no clothes.\n\n","name":"t1_d3br3fm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-19 18:23:44","week":20}

They didn't know the difference between merchant fulfilled, amazon fulfilled, and new items that Amazon was selling themselves. It's why feedback rate is so low if you sell on Amazon, most people just click buy and wait for it to arrive. \n\nAs for FBA, yes the fees are high, but you save a shit ton of time and storage space by just boxing up all of your purchases and letting them sit in a warehouse. You're effectively finished with your process at that point and can go back to sourcing more stuff. Someone orders the item, Amazon finds it, packs it, ships it, and handles any returns or customer service from that point on. Yes, you lose some control over that process, but to me and a lot of other people, it's worth also losing the headache. I don't have to keep all of my inventory stored. I don't have to worry about being available to ship items when they are ordered, about having to keep shipping supplies and boxes of all types and stuff like that. \n\nAlso, the difference in profit isn't as much as the high FBA fees would have you believe, because most of the time, being able to ship to prime customers allows you to demand a higher premium for your items.

{"id":"d3c1p54","author":"sheymyster","body":"No problem at all, glad I could help out.\n\nJust off the top of my head I have two things that may or may not help you out. \n\n1. You've most likely heard the phrase \"measure twice, cut once\", but it can apply to anything in the sense that you should always put more effort into research and preparation than actual application, if you want it to go smoothly. When I first got into flipping, I watched so many youtube videos about anything and everything. Everyone has their opinion on youtube flippers, but I found Cody Hawks earlier videos, Raiken Profits, Bonafide Hustler, and Picking profits to be very helpful and entertaining to watch, especially their ride along videos. I also read this forum extensively, going so far as to sort by new and scroll through every page over a year back. I didn't read every thread, but I did read almost every daily newbie, weekly haul, Lesson learned, and flip of the week thread I found. This is important, because every single flipper went through the exact phase you're going through now. Their questions in the daily newbie thread and their sometimes costly hard lessons learned in that thread are a great way to find answers to questions you may not have thought to ask yet. The flip of the week and weekly haul threads were a tremendous source for items I had never thought to sell. Weekly haul let's you know what other experienced flippers are picking up on their sourcing trips, and the flip of the week validates a lot of users choices here with proof of success. I watched a ton of packing videos too to get a grasp on how to properly ship things and prepare FBA shipments for Amazon. All of this was before I really started buying things, but I continued and probably even increased my research afterwards, especially when I saw a few sales and realized it was actually working. \n\n2. My second piece of advice, is that you will still have some flops. You can research and research, look at sales charts, consider sales rank, look at price history, etc..... Sometimes, you will still buy something and you will have to break even or take a loss on it. It's the nature of the beast when it comes to flipping, you can't be right 100% of the time and also be efficient with your time. Of course, if you only bought sure things for 5% of their value, you would technically be right 100% of the time, but you'd miss out on so many opportunities by playing it too safe. Part of learning is mistakes, but if you follow my advice in number 1, you can limit those mistakes to a minimum and overall, you will profit much much more than you lose here and there. You have to own your mistakes, figure out where you went wrong so that you can correct it and try not to make the same mistake twice, but ultimately, cut your losses and move on. Don't hold on to something that's a lost cause, get your money back for it or at least partially and look at the next thing, don't worry about it or let it get you down. \n\nI felt like that was more rambling than direct advice, but hopefully it helped you somehow. I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have thought, so feel free to comment here or PM me if you think of something else you'd like more info on. I'm by no means a Guru and haven't been doing this for years and years, nor am I doing this full time, but I don't mind telling you everything I've learned.

{"id":"d3c2hc3","author":"CellDood","body":"I've been in your shoes brother. Had to abruptly leave college (on a full-ride academic scholarship no less) due to a federal drug conviction. I guess I was \"lucky\" in the way that the 5 years I was away was long enough to allow bad debts to dry up from my credit report. It was also enough time to rearrange my priorities. I got out in 2008 with a 0 credit score and being a college dropout, pretty much zero chance of getting a decent job. \n\nSo I started from scratch. I was mandated to be under the authority of a halfway house for 6 months upon release, so I took a job waiting tables to minimize the impact of the 25% of gross pay requirement (unreportable income). I paid cash for things. I didn't take on debt. Not that I could have had I wanted to. I saved up $1200 with the intention of buying a car at a BHPH. Instead I bought a $1000 car in full at an auction and sold it for $2200. Then did it again about 6 more times... $8000 car paid for. \n\nI kept at least one shit job, if not two. Tossing papers, pest control, selling cars, whatever I could do that didn't require a background check. If the application asked, I checked the \"have never been convicted of a felony\" box. I figured I wouldn't be losing anything that I didn't already have. I even had a job (pest control) fire me after they found out. Better than checking the accurate box and not having a chance at all. Finally, I found the opportunity to get a CDL and did some more scrub work with that. Saved some more money and bought an old beater truck and started an LLC doing storm cleanup. Sold that business a couple of years later and now I'm half owner of a technology retail store. I also have no problem hiring felons. \n\nI got married a couple years after my release and eventually began financing a thing or two and got a couple credit cards.  Since I've got my head screwed on right this time and actually pay my debts, my credit score is now over 750. \n\nHaving your intelligence and engineering acumen, I'm sure your road will be totally different than mine. The point is it's a grind, but it is totally doable. You will definitely still get kicked in the nuts about your past. Get used to that. Just a week or so ago, I had a credit card company cancel an account of mine because it \"could harm their reputation in having me as a customer\". This was due to a forgery charge from 20 years ago, when I was 19 years old. Fuck them. I didn't need the account anyway. Only opened it because it gave me $80 off on an Amazon purchase. \n\nI know your situation is overwhelming now, but this thing is a marathon, not a sprint. Scrounge out opportunity where you can. Take shit jobs if necessary. Do the jobs no one else wants to do and take pride in them. You will have to do things unconventionally. You are not going to be hired by a Fortune 500. Nor do you need to be in order to have a fruitful career. Honestly, if I wasn't forced to, I would never have become a business owner. It's not all it's cracked up to be. Most of the time I'd much rather be working for someone else making $20 an hour and being able to enjoy stressless sleep at night. But that's not the path we chose. \n\nThis thing will absolutely kick you in the balls until you can barely stand it any more. The actual prison time is just the tip of the iceberg. I dare say it may be the \"easy\" part. Society wants you to fail because you broke rules and they didn't. Your PO wants you to fail because recidivism rate says you will. You fucked up and you will be constantly reminded of that. But if somehow you can be hardheaded enough to not let any of that stop you, then you will come out on the other side of this thing a better human because of it. \n\nMy driving thought in prison was that I would make sure that because of prison, not in spite of it, I would within 10 years be more successful than I would be had I not gone to prison. I would look back and THANK my younger self for being such a fuck-up that I was forced to \"end up in prison\". It didn't take me 10 years. It took less than 5. One does not \"end up in prison\" unless we allow ourselves. Prison is not an end, it is a beginning. The rest of the store depends on you. \n\nApologies for the long post that has very little to do with personal finance. I just want you to know, OP, that there are people who have been through what you are going through.\n\nTLDR- been through similar shit. Now moderately successful, but will always have  the vaunted \"felon\" label.  \n\n","name":"t1_d3c2hc3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-05-19 22:29:08","week":20}

Text says \"create coffee flavors\" but image does not relate.\n\n* Steam cup: I know you're thinking everyone loves a hot, steamy cup of coffee, but you do not SEE coffee. The image feels very stock photography and not unique to what you are offering.\n\n* Backs of two guys heads at a cafe. - why am I looking at the backs of two guys heads at a cafe? His sweater is more interesting than the dirty glasses on the counter and whatever is in his cup (again, you do not actually SEE coffee). Text says support small batch roasters, but again image does not relate.\n\nI would try replacing all those images with your product shots for now and possibly new photography later:\n\n*  \"Create Coffee Flavors\" - Show the two-pack shot of the flavoring with this text. If new photography is done, maybe show a picture of a vile next to a cup where you can see the coffee. Possibly take a photo of someone pouring some into a cup. EDIT: Ideally show the products that the flavorings are of, shaved chocolate around the chocolate oil product shot, hazelnuts around the hazel, peppermint leaves around peppermint, etc.\n\n* \"Enjoy Fresh Roasted Coffee\" - Have this text with a bag of coffee beans. If photography is done, show the bag with a cup of coffee. Also, \"enjoy fresh roasted coffee\" is not a unique selling point as you can enjoy fresh roasted coffee anywhere. Maybe just use the \"small batch roasted\" feature here (see below).\n\n* \"Support small batch coffee roasters\" - Sorry, but this isn't a selling feature. \"Roasted in small batches for an amazing taste\" or something similar is a selling feature. Supporting small batch roasters is not why most people buy coffee beans off the internet.\n\n* for the image on the last one, maybe show your equipment or show beans being roasted, as long as it is visually appealing. Otherwise maybe combine the \"small roasted batches\" with a product shot of a bag of coffee.\n\nProducts - **Where are your gift baskets?** People love to gift things people eat and drink. How about a Chocolate Lover's kit with the hazelnut &amp; chocolate oils and coffee beans? How about the Ultimate Coffee Lover's kit that's all your oils and all three of your roasted beans that comes in a nice gift basket? Give me the full Arcanum Coffee experience! Themed kits or special kits for mother's day, valentine's day, etc, offer these at the appropriate times. People spend hundreds of dollars on gifts, give them the option to spend that at your store.\n\nService - there is nothing that communicates service on your front page. Do you offer next day delivery? Two-day? How fast can I get these great tasting coffee beans and oils? There is a reason why Amazon always pushes how fast you can get something.\n\nClosing thoughts - I think you have two questions to keep in mind when establishing your communication priorities: Why do people buy coffee beans &amp; oils off the internet and why would they buy them from me? \n\nHope this helps.","name":"t1_d3c3rqd","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-05-19 22:57:50","week":20}

This figure adjusts the recently released US Department of Commerce Q4 GDP number up to 2.4% from its previous 1.9% to reflect possible growth in an alternate parallel universe.\n\nWall Street cheered the news as stocks rallied knowing that 2.4% could have been possible. Notable gainers were student loan lender Sofi Financial up 3% on the day as news broke that large loan balances where continueing to hinder economic growth by diverting disposable income to the lender. Earnings projections for the now largest financial company in the US have been revised up for Q1 2017. \n\nMajor company losers on the news were retailer Target (down 7.6%) amid growing concerns that the middle income Minneapolis based chain would continue to see poor earnings after the worst holiday buying season since the 2009. Target's Director of Investor Relations, Ed Warren, tried to reassure shareholders amid the sell off issuing a statement, \"...Despite the report detailing forgone earnings we *could of had*, Target continues to make necessary cost cuts to emerge in a slow growth environment. I am happy to announce that beginning in 2018 Target North America will roll our two pilot programs. First our high-end Target Alpha stores in 7 markets along the the West and East Coast of the US. Secondly, we will also be testing out our discount and thift concept stores, Target Omega in select college towns across the US...\" the statement lifted Target stock off its morning lows.\n\nAdditionally e-retailer Amazon (-1.2%) finished lower along with home builders, Pulte (-2.5%), Del Webb (-1.4%) and others. \n\nFamed Investor, George Soros expressed concern about the situation during CNBC Power Lunch, \"The DOP only reports foregone potential growth and has no real baring on what's actually happening. It would have been great to see an actual 2.4% growth rate but we got 1.9%. This just means the average American family holds off on a new car another year. Spends a little less on Florida vacations. Those types of cut backs, no big deal. Soros Global Investments has positioned itself strongly in insulated foreign markets with common sense education policies so we aren't really too worried about the report today.\"\n\nBut not all are unconcerned about the data released. 2016 presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders was hosting rally to a large crowd at the United Center in Chicago, IL as the news broke. Despite beefed up security by the Chicago Police Department the rally turned violent as indebted Millenials took to the streets rioting and chanting, \"Not our future. Not our fault.\" Chicago police were able to quell the crowd but not before the popular tourist attraction nicknamed \"The Bean\" was dislodged and rolled into Lake Michigan. CPD suspect an organization made up of University of Illinois sociology graduate students were responsible.\n\nPresident of the Federation of Unemployed College Kids Except Degrees (FUCKED), Christine Whipthorpe, issued the following statement regarding the government report, \"Again we continue to see the possible future for American Students, Alumni and Parents that never was. The most depressing part of the entire report was not the economic figures, but rather the human toll. There were an estimated at 13k unborn babies last quarter. Due to either economic insecurity or simply not able to procreate with their spouses while living at home with parents. How many hard working former college students will never know the joys of parenthood?\"\n\nPresident elect Donald Trump was asked about the report at his Boca Raton Estate between interviewing for key positions, \"Doesn't matter. America is gonna be great. So great. Soon as I'm in office there are going to be so many jobs, no one will want to go to college. Really.

{"id":"d3c6s5g","author":"_Aos","body":"So a few things about investing, the sooner you need the funds and the more you can't afford to lose the funds, dictacts the type of fund you will use.  This is true in all aspects of investing.  The reason Reddit is suggesting 90/10 is because it is referring to a standard retirement investment mix. (90% stocks, 10% bonds).  THis is a good makeup for most adults under 40.  As you age and near retirement, you'll want to start to shift that to a more conservative mix, 80/20, 70/30 and so on.  Target retirement funds do this for you so you can just sorta ignore them.  I say for most people, not using target retirement funds is more ideal and you'll probably do better.  Plus everyone has different comfort levels, not using a target fund allows for this. \n\nThe reason Vanguard might have reommended something different for you is because you probably answered some questions saying short term or mid term funding, rather than long term. \n\nAnyway, on to the house down payment.  Your time frame is sorta middle term.  And because you can't afford to wait for the market to recover in the event it drops (sometimes drops take a few years to regain its orig. value - think 2008).   I'd recommend tools like money markets or a bond fund.  Money markets are somewhat like savings accounts but typically earn more interest (look up on investopedia for more info on them).  I personally use Ford Interest Advantage Money Market b/c they typically pay higher interest than ones at Vanguard or elsewhere, but they are hard to work with and don't have the best site or set up process so that to me makes it low on my list to recommend.  Ally savings is another good source that comes recommended.  I also personally use Vanguard almost exclusively inconjuction with my bank (USAA) as a holding pot.  I can transfer funds in and out and do wires as I see fit from my Vanguard money market.  I also use a new bond fund they recently set up for some of my emergency savings because I can still write a check off of it and I get the dividend it pays.  I'm not very adverse to risk so this may not fit your style.  If you want something more conservative, go with a Ally and/or money market exclusively, like a little more risk, add the bond fund and request a check book.  I also, as a buffer, keep about $3k in my checking as a protective layer for smaller emergencies, where the rest of the savings is in a mix between the bond and money market accounts (typically i keep $3-5K in the mm and the rest gets put into the bond fund).  I also have a large large credit card allowance (50K)between all my cards - so if a super duper large emergency arose and I need time to move money around I have that option - which you don't have just yet so you may want to keep larger buffers in your checking.  The bond fund I use is VCORX, which there are others so look at some other and compare - investopedia is a good source to use to learn to understand what to look for when looking at funds.  \n\nAs for the credit cards, don't worry so much as to what card you have initially when you are trying to build your credit.  Use NerdWallet to find a card you can qualify for that will work for you needs, in a year you'll probably have high enough score (as long as you use your card and pay it off throughout the year), then you can start looking into adding distinct cash back cards.  Depending on your shopping habits, I typically recommend the Amazon Chase card for people with medium credit as I THINK it doesn't require as high of a score as cards like the Chase Freedom or Sapphire cards or the like.  But it does give decent cashback initially especially on those amazon purchases :)  \n\nAlso, from my banking experience the military ones (like Navy Fed and USAA) typically provide a much easier site to use and make mobile options and money transfers free and easy to use b/c of the nature of its users.  Don't pay fees for things, that's silly.  You don't have to have a savings account if you don't want to at your bank unless its a requirement to waive a fee - but those are the banks I typically avoid anyways.  Chase has some good incentives for joining their bank pretty much always going on, but if there is no branch near you that isn't the most useful.  You want to have a branch nearby b/c eventually you'll need some branch services - notary, home loans, etc.  If you bank with them, you can typically get a discount or some of these services for free.  Go with a well liked bank/credit union with good reviews.  :)  Don't stress either, if you end up switching its not the end of the world.  I personally will keep an account with USAA even if I don't use it as my primary b/c of their ease of services and my insurance is all there (home and car).  The issue me free checks and I have free ATMs services anywhere up to a certain $ amt in fees.  I can transfer money to anyone for free and shit doesn't take forever to clear (Wells Fargo was super bad for that in my experience and charges for most money transfers, Chase you can transfer but the other person has to set up an account and its sorta a hassle initially).  I have no experience with Navy Fed, but heard good things.","name":"t1_d3c6s5g","subreddit":"FinancialPlanning","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwze","created_utc":"2016-05-20 00:10:30","week":20}

It's a good idea to research manufacturing methods to find out what's possible and not.\n\nThe next step in learning, assuming you do not have the resources to pay someone, would be to learn to use some 3D CAD parametric software. Personally, at my day job I use Solidworks (3D CAD parametric, I've also used PTC ProEngineer in the past) and AutoCAD (2D drafting) - but this software is prohibitively expensive for us normal people to use at home. I have found one software, called Onshape (https://www.onshape.com/) which is free for use for hobbyist use and commercial subscription costs \"only\" $100/month (I think they're charging a little too much right now, based on feature set). It handles a lot like Solidworks, so the free version would be a good starting point if you really want to learn.\n\nWhen it comes to prototyping, I usually use Shapeways for 3D printing. I've also used Quickparts, which are more expensive but can have a faster turnaround - which probably isn't important if you're just messing around. Remember that your first prototype will most likely be wrong or you'll think of improvements once you have the physical object in your hands, so expect to order several revisions of your prototype. You should also be good with some basic hand tools. Dremel is an excellent tool to have for when you need to \"adjust\" your prototype. You can also sculpt features (Supersculpey is my typical go to) that you may want to add and epoxy them onto the prototype for testing. Then you would measure out the new features, go back to your CAD software and add them to the model.\n\nOnce you have a prototype that you like, you can send your model to a tooling manufacturer. A company like Protolabs will build the tooling for you and make the parts, but they own the tooling and you only own the rights to any parts that the tooling produces. I haven't gotten to the stage where I actually get to buy the tooling yet, but their quotes are VERY useful when you try to account for start-up expenses (tooling) and production expenses (per piece cost).\n\nDepending on the project you may also need to consider assembly. At which point you can use your garage (assuming low production volumes), rent/lease commercial space, or outsource to another manufacturer (helps keep overhead costs down!).\n\nOnce you have figured out manufacturing, you also need to package your goods. If it's a retail good, then it may get bagged or put in a box with some foam or cardboard. This step is effectively another assembly step in the process, so you have the same options as before.\n\nFinally, there is distribution. You could start your own website with an e-commerce store and handle shipping your self. You could have Amazon handle your distribution - then you just have to deliver goods in bulk to them. Maybe you could even sell to retail stores (bulk deliveries again).","name":"t1_d3d4tq9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-05-20 19:09:02","week":20}

The managers have to over ride the price reduction,  and should catch it there. If they are busy or not paying attention it might not get caught.

They didn't have any in Stock.  They matched it under the guidelines.  My store didn't.  \n\nNow the policy covers that.  Has to be in Stock.  Has to be sold by Amazon,  not a third party. Also they have changed wording so we don't match hardly anything anymore.  We match Bogo, but it has to be same item,  same size,  and have the per unit price on the ad. Most other grocery don't do the per unit price,  they say save up to.  So we don't match it.  \n\nWe went from having price match every other transaction to one every other week.  And usually it isn't one we will match,  or it is a scam of some sort.  So 90% of the time we end up having to argue with them.  They believe the coupon site over us. They think they know the policy better than us,  and because some idiot told them a manager gave in to them if they keep trying,  they won't give up.

This results in less wealth generated in the future. \n\nLets say the cutoff to being wealthy is making $1M/year.  There's already taxation everywhere, and people are still making that much.  But if you were making the much, and threatened with a 10% tax increase ($100k), you are probably still going to show up for work, but the worse that could happen is that you would hire someone else to do your work for you (at a higher tax deduction) and increase your own and that employee's happiness.\n\nTax rates at the high end actually improve production, innovation and growth: less risk from better tax deductibility of investment funds.  Just because the successful seek to avoid taxes does not in any way imply that they would have chosen to avoid success as a way to not pay the taxes.\n\nIts taxes on low incomes that may cause people to withdraw from the labour force.

Denmark has higher wealth inequality than the US, so even high tax rates don't stop anyone from becoming/staying rich.\n\n&gt; Consumption does not automate the economy.\n\nConsumption is the only useful economic driver.  Investment doesn't happen because there is a savings war chest lying around.  It happens because there is a hope of consumer/end user spending to buy the innovation.

Do you think that disproves the widely accepted economic premise that taxes reduce incentives?\n\n&gt;But if you were making the much, and threatened with a 10% tax increase ($100k), you are probably still going to show up for work,\n\nPlease stop with these infantile delusions. There are always people at the margins of giving up their efforts, for whom even a 1% tax hike will make the difference between retiring to enjoy their wealth, or continuing to work to expand their business and income.\n\n&gt; but the worse that could happen is that you would hire someone else to do your work for you (at a higher tax deduction) and increase your own and that employee's happiness.\n\nIt's absolutely despicable that you are this intellectually dishonest in the way you debate the issue. A person can simply stop expanding their business. They can stop looking to open new branches, stop looking for new opportunities, etc. Business is very difficult. You take the immense efforts that others expend to build the economy around you for granted, and assume that you can just walk in and take their income by force, without negative consequences.\n\nThis is infantile socialist garbage, and I don't have time for it.\n\n&gt;Tax rates at the high end actually improve production, innovation and growth: less risk from better tax deductibility of investment funds. \n\nAgain, empirically this is shown to be false. Countries with higher tax rates generally have lower rates of economic growth. Basic economic theory also disagrees with you. People don't invest more as a result of taxes. They invest less of their time and money, because the return on that investment is decreased by whatever percentage is taken by taxes.\n\nIf someone is contemplating investing $1 million in a new factory, and there is a 50% chance of failure, and a 50% chance that they will make $2.5 million in pre-tax profits, they will not make the investment if the income tax rate is 50%, but will make it if there is no income tax. In the zero income tax scenario, they weigh a 50% chance of a $1 million loss against a 50% chance of a $1.5 million  after-tax gain, and they decide to invest. In the 50% income tax scenario, they weigh the 50% chance of a $1 million loss against a 50% chance of a $0.75 million after-tax gain, and they rationally conclude that the risk of loss outweighs the chance of profit.\n\nI don't want to have to teach you the basics of economics here. If you don't understand this, you owe it to the world to learn some more economics, before spouting off on what kind of economic system we should impose on people.\n\n\n&gt;Its taxes on low incomes that may cause people to withdraw from the labour force.\n\nAll taxes on income should be eliminated. They're all harmful, and one is not more/less harmful than another based on some simplistic construction in your mind.\n\n\n&gt;Again, widespread infantile fallacy. There is an overabundance of savings that explains low interest rates everywhere and negative rates specific to Switzerland. The largest new companies never needed any capital (FB, GOOG AMZN) and only went public as a stock scam to make founders rich.\n\nAgain, you with your socialist idiocy calling basic economics \"infantile\". There is no \"overabundance of savings\". There is a shortage of profitable opportunities to invest in. Increasing taxes, to pay for more wasteful welfare, reduces those opportunities even further, by reducing after-tax profits, and with it, ROC.\n\n&gt;The largest new companies never needed any capital (FB, GOOG AMZN) and **only went public as a stock scam to make founders rich.**\n\nI can't believe I've wasted so much time trying to have an adult discussion with you.

Debt needs to be paid that is a given. If I added right its close to $900 which is a huge part of your budget. It is worth it to try a refinance. All they can say is no. Google Debt consolidation. \n\nRework your food budget. I feed up to 7 people on about $300 a month and we are low income. A lot of fresh veggies, fresh fruits, no prepackaged, no soda, cook from home. It is cheaper to snack of vegetables than on chips or anything prepacked. Make your own coffee. Window shop every single store in your area if you can. Write down the steady prices, average prices. Make an excel spreadsheet for it and then shop from the cheapest store. Rework every dime you can.  Buying in bulk is is also way cheaper for most things that you use a lot of.  Toilet paper for instance. \n\nYour garden can grow quite a lot. Maybe expand it and then even think about canning what is extra. It could save your family a lot of money. \n\nT-mobile is $105 for 2 lines of unlimited service. They also have cheaper plans. Cricket does too. Many phone companies will buy out your contracts. If you shop around more you will be able to find something that will work better. See what is in your area. What other internet is in your area? It may not be as fast but in my opinion that is ok if it comes down to being able to pay my bills. Seems the same with you. \n\nAmazon fire box is awesome +hulu+netflix+prime =$30 a month.  Fire box initial cost is $100 but you can buy it on installments.

I just cut the pepper spices waaaay down lol. We also got my husband's student loans on forbearance and put our credit cards into a debt repayment program to get lower interest.

{"id":"d3f9rbv","author":"alasko42","body":"Oh man this post has me all over it! I am really into skincare but I hate wasting money\nSome of my routine:\n\nBaby wash - $3 for 28 Fl oz. of the Walmart brand. I use this as a face cleanser after OCM and body wash. It is extremely gentle. My train of thought: who has the most delicate skin that we try to protect? Babies! So why can't I take the same care for my skin. It works well for me as a mild gentle cleanser. \n\nJojoba oil- $10 for 4 oz. NOW brand on amazon.  This isn't a frugal buy in itself but I get so much milage out of it I wanted to include it to give people an idea of a  multifaceted product. I would actually advise everyone to try mineral oil first but it breaks me out personally. Anyway, things I use it for:\n-Removing make up; nothing works like an oil\n\n-The oil-cleansing method. I follow up with the baby wash to get any residue oil off. \n\n-As a daily moisturizer. Many people shy away from oil as a moisturizer. \"ahh my skin will look like an oil slick!\" but you'd be surprised. A little goes a long way. After cleansing/toning in the morning while my face is still almost damp I take 3-5 drops of jojoba oil and spread them across my entire face and neck. It starts oily but after 10 minutes is soaks in gorgeously and gives you the most beautiful glowing skin (jojoba oil closely resembles your skin's natural oil,  sebum, making it a great moisturizer)\n\n-As a leave in hair treatment to liven up dry ends (again a little goes a long way) and in homemade hair masks\n\nVitamin c serum - I make my own. Vitamin c is great for anti-aging and skin brightening but you can sink a lot of money in tiny dropper bottle of serum that last a month. I bought a 1lb bag of vitamin c powder on amazon for $11. I have a dark blue dropper bottle from a serum I bought long ago. Every week or 2 I make my own serum with bottled water,  vitamin c powder,  and glycerine/aloe. I use this after cleansing and before moisturizing with jojoba oil in the mornings. \n\nRazors- $21 for one handle and 10 cartridges.  I get dorco razors off of Amazon.  The standard \"Pace 6+\" version.  It's a men's razor but that makes to difference to me personally,  I know they also have women's razors but I haven't tried them. Fun fact: this is the razor you would get from the dollar shave club,  but they mark it up. This is also the razor you would get from Gillette but they mark it up even more! \n\nThat's all I can think of right now.. .  That kind of turned into a novel. But the moral is always - Find something you want/need. If you can make it yourself give it a try! If you can't,  find the wholesaler. Same product,  less mark up!\n\n","name":"t1_d3f9rbv","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-22 17:54:54","week":20}

It's faster to scan and quickly determine if something is worth additional research, i.e. the Amazon prices compared to the cost in your hand have enough margin to be worth it.  If it is, then switch over to the Ebay app to see completed listings and better determine if the item will sell there at the same margin and fast enough.  If the Amazon value is low, it's unlikely the item is selling higher on Ebay.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that Ebay's UPC scanner is pretty useless for completed research.  It doesn't seem  to give results on completed based on UPC, probably because until recently most people didn't include UPC in listings.  So on Ebay, type out the search.\n\nFor Ebay \"analysis\" there's http://checkaflip.com/ But be cautious, the averages can be thrown off easily, for example a search for GoPro Accessory Bundle looks super profitable!

I shop a lot at Dollar Tree (not sure if they have Manhattan branches) for toilet and house cleaning products, but disposable bags and wraps are relatively expensive because there is a very small quantity in each $1 box.

{"id":"d3fmlap","author":"MrsKravitz","body":"*&gt;Whites are dingy, even if I throw in a scoop of oxygen bleach*\n\nGo find an old-fashioned product called \"bluing\" or \"laundry bluing.\" It's a concentrated blue liquid that you add to the washing machine that will brighten up your whites. I use one called Bluette, available locally for about $2.50 a quart. You might find it only in slightly old-fashioned supermarkets where older folks shop.  You can also use it if you have other colored fabrics in the same load, don't worry, it won't affect them.\n\nThe degradation of the elastic and the fabric of the bedsheets is often because of bleach, but that's not in your mix. Sorry, I have no other ideas. \n\nNB: I just checked Bluette on Amazon and I think it's a pretty good price, 12 1-pint bottles for $20. I buy it a little cheaper locally but that's not a bad price at all. I use about 1/4 cup per wash load.\n\nIf you try it, start your laundry by filling the machine with water before adding the clothes, and add the Bluette directly to the water before putting in the clothes. If you forgot, mix 1/4 cup (you don't have to measure precisely) of the Bluette in a bottle of water, then add the diluted mix directly into your washing machine.   \n\nI like your formula and I might try it, with the addition of the Bluette I always use.
