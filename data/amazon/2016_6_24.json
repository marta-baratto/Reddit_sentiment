{"id":"4o2snl","author":"blast73","body":"I am a game design student looking to break into the VR market relatively early. This would allow me to establish myself as well as the opportunity to corner a new market for nearly guaranteed sales on any game I make.\n\nIn order to do this I first need an HTC Vive. These run from $815 - $1,150. I do not currently have the means to buy this and saving up in this situation means less opportunities so I am looking for ways to get my hands on one sooner.\n\nMy only option at this moment is to buy from a reseller for $1,144.98 and pay it off using Amazon's special 12 month financing. Using this I would pay no interest is paid in full in 12 months but the thought of paying an extra $350 is appealing to me. There is also a used one on Amazon for $950 but I'm always skeptical of used goods, especially when they're priced over $100 more expensively than a new one.\n\nSo I am looking into other options and from what I can tell I can either try to get a loan or get a credit card and put it on their. Things to be noted; I have never owned a credit card and I am currently $28,000 in student loan debt with approximately 3-4 classes left to take. About half of that debt is subsidized and no currently gathering interest. Current income is about $13,000 a year but the plan is to release a few VR games to start a career in game development.\n\nAnother thing to note is that I know this is probably a bad idea but if I'm dead set on doing it (to potential extreme success) then I would love some input to make sure I go about it in the least damaging way. I will happily answer any questions if I'm leaving out any important info. \n\nThanks in advance.","name":"t3_4o2snl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-14 20:14:29","week":24}

{"id":"4o566c","author":"Spythe","body":"So I finally got a bluetooth scanner and man its amazing combined with FbaScan(I think there are others that have a local database as well). I been debating on rather I should get one for months since I \"barely\" scan books and now I regret not getting one earlier. If you're doing a decent amount of scanning I suggest grabbing one and picking a used one on Ebay for only 60 bucks. Compared to the 150 to 220 if you want to get an overpriced Opticon 2006\n\nBefore I got the KDC200i, I purchased a used Opticon/Scanfob 2006 for close to 200 bucks and it stopped working after 40min of actual scanning. I think the Opticon is built slightly better and slightly faster(like a millisecond) but I like the KDC200i because its bigger and has a screen on it. Which you can use to adjust setting and communicate with it unlike the Opticon. You don't need the barcode sheet to adjust things with the KDC200i\n\n* Can a bluetooth scanner work with Amazon Seller App? Yes but its super clunky and almost defeats the purpose. To get it to work on the Amazon App you have to click the search bar then scan the item(the scanner works like a keyboard and just writes whatever number the bar gives out). This guy breaks it down, starts at 4:15 \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWyDlGjPhvg\n\nI just wanted to make a thread for anyone that was in my situation because I spent hrs trying to make sure I purchased the right one.\n\n* How the device looks/menu options \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEEzNXhRYKM\n\n* Just type in KDC200i to find it on Ebay, its the seller that has New Battery in the sub title.\n\n* My set up for one handed scanning. I have 2 separate phone cases, one with the bluetooth attachable and one normal. Anytime I think I'm scan something I just swap them out. http://imgur.com/a/VwG3H\n\n* Here the fastener to attach the bluetooth, its like velcro but its plastic and a lot stronger. https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-Heavy-Duty-Fasteners-Inches-RFD7091/dp/B00347A8GM\n\nIf anyone has any questions just let me know.\n\nForgot to add 2 things\n\n* FBA scan doesn't always pop up the FBA offer so you have to click FBA on the app which will open your web browser and take you to the FBA offers on the Amazon website. I probably have to do this 30% of the time, it has to do with the Amazon API that only gives off 40 offers so if you have 40 merchant offers for 1 cent, the FBAscan app will show up as no FBA offers which is not true 99.9% of the time.\n\n* With local database searching you don't get an image of the book/item, however you do get it with live searching. Today I listed 48 Amazon items and 1 book didn't match the book art so I tossed it on Ebay.","name":"t3_4o566c","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-15 04:38:36","week":24}

{"id":"4o7y53","author":"jshogren10","body":"This was a post that I wrote for FE International ([see here](http://feinternational.com/blog/skills-needed-successful-website-investor/)), which is a website broker, and I figured this might be of interest for all of you who want to learn how to start buying/selling websites. In [my recent reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4lv8fl/follow_along_as_i_flip_this_website_case_study/) the number one question I got was people asking what skills they should learn so I figured I would write a post on it. I hope you enjoy!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n********\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBuying, growing and selling online businesses requires you to wear multiple hats at the same time. At 10 a.m. you might be doing keyword research for a new article, and then at 11 a.m. you are negotiating with possible advertisers. You have to possess a wide variety of skills so that you can keep your online businesses running smoothly day in and day out. With that being said, I have found that success usually comes from having mastered a certain skillset and then applying that skill to websites that you purchase. This gives you a competitive advantage when it comes to growing the site, and allows you to spot opportunities in websites before your purchase them. In this article I will be explaining why it is crucial to master a profitable skill if you wish to become a successful website investor.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##First and Foremost – Master a Skill##\n\nThe first step to being successful in any sort of online (or offline) business is to master a skill. It doesn’t even matter what it is, as long as it can provide value in some shape or form. Whether the skill is paid advertising or SEO, just know how to leverage that skill to grow your business. However, some skills will be of more value than others. That is where you will you have to use your own judgement to find those that interest you and can provide value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBelow is a list of possible skills that are valuable to running an online business:\n\n- SEO\n- Keyword research\n- PPC/Paid advertising\n- E-commerce\n- Social media\n- Email marketing\n- Conversion rate optimization (CRO)\n- Dropshipping\n- Link building\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBeing an expert in two or three areas is great, but if you are just starting out I would highly suggest focusing on just one skill. As you continue to learn and grow, other skills will come naturally to you, but it pays to have skills where you’re head and shoulders above the rest.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##The Benefits of Mastering a Skill##\n\nWhen you master one skill you become an expert, which leads to many benefits. Expertise allows you to identify opportunities to leverage, consistently be able to increase the value of a web purchase and it will help you avoid buying a dud. Below I will further explain each one of them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Identify Opportunities to Exploit**\n\nThis is huge. When you are an expert in a field it allows you to easily identify opportunities that you could take advantage of. For example, let’s say that you have a large amount of experience and success with selling physical products with Shopify, and you spot a business for sale where you could apply these skills.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet’s look at a real example with a website that is currently for sale on Flippa. The site is called gireviews.net, and here is the Flippa listing. Flippa is a great place to buy a starter website because you can find low-cost opportunities to build on, then sell later via an experienced advisor who can give it an accurate valuation and find qualified buyers. The site in this listing reviews Brazilian jiu-jitsu Gi-s, which are the outfits worn in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and makes an affiliate commission for every sale they make. Even as an affiliate they are making $1,000+ per month, which is not bad at all!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, if you were someone who has mastered the skill of selling physical products with Shopify you would know that you could create and sell your own brand of Brazilian jiu-jitsu Gi-s. This would give you another revenue source as well as allow you to make more money from each sale! Instead of making a 10 percent commission on every sale as an affiliate, you can now earn 30-50 percent profit on each sale when you sell your own brand. This diversifies your revenue sources and allows you to earn more money, both of which increase the overall value of your business. By mastering this skill you were able to identify this opportunity and you knew exactly what you needed to do to make the site earn more money each month.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Consistently Increase the Value**\n\nWhen you master a skill you will get a very solid understanding of what works vs. what doesn’t. To further explain this point I will use the same example of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu Gi review site I used above. Just because you could start selling your own brand of Gi-s it doesn’t mean that you should. By being an expert at selling physical product with Shopify you would be able to decipher whether or not applying your skill would be profitable and if it would make sense. Every website and online business is different and each scenario will require a different approach. When you are aware of the good opportunities vs the bad ones you will be able to choose only the best and pass on the rest. Someone who isn’t an expert with Shopify stores would have a much harder time deciding whether or not buying this Gi review website to start selling your own brand is a profitable idea.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, when you are able to find that good opportunity that allows you to leverage your skill you will have a very high chance of being a successful. When you master a skill you increase the chances of being able to profitably buy, grow and sell websites. For example, let’s talk about the website that I mentioned earlier in the article, and bought a few weeks ago for $1,250. I am very confident that I will be able to increase the earnings and traffic because I noticed areas that I could improve on using my own skills. With my SEO and AdSense optimization skills, I am able to spot opportunities that will grow this site right away such as creating more ads, testing the different ad networks, and targeting local long-tail keywords. Since I was aware of these growth opportunities before I purchased the website it gave me confidence in knowing that I would have a very good chance of having success with this website investment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis idea of using your skills to spot opportunities for growth is important because it allows you to know which websites you will be able to have a large impact on. This way you will only buy websites that you know you can improve, which in turn leads to you having more consistent success with website investing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Avoid Buying a Dud**\n\nMuch the same as you would be able to identify good opportunities you would also be able to spot the duds. This will keep you from wasting time and money on a website that has no potential. This is probably more important than being able to spot a good opportunity because a lot of money/time can be wasted trying to revive a business with no hope. Let’s continue to use the same GI review site that we have been using to explain this scenario. For this example, let’s say at first you thought that selling your own brand of GI’s would be a good idea, however, you soon realize that there are certain things that will make this very hard. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBelow are some examples of what could make this idea not feasible:\n\n1. When you reach out to one of your manufacturers to ask about this product and they say that production would cost a lot more than you originally planned. Now, instead of making 30-50 percent profit on each sale, you are now only making 15 percent.\n2. It is also going to take up to 6 months before your manufacturer can complete the first shipment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese are just example problems, but it proves the point that you may not be aware of all of the problems that could come with a business unless you have that expertise in that area. By mastering a skill you will be able to keep yourself away from toxic situations while the person with only a small amount of experience might be blind to such issues.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**A Personal Example**\n\nI now want to use my own personal skills as an example and show you how I have been able to leverage them. I would consider my two biggest strengths to be SEO and keyword research. I have been homing both of these skills for the past eight years, and I have had plenty of success from utilizing them. More recently, I have been able to develop my skill of optimizing websites that are monetized via AdSense thanks to working first-hand with multiple websites that were monetized via AdSense. I want to give you a real-life example of how I was able to apply these skills that I have mastered to help spot a website investing opportunity. A couple weeks ago ago I purchased a new website, You can see the website’s Flippa listing here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYes, I know it was only making $135/month and that probably doesn’t seem like it would be worth the time. However, I am very confident that I can get the site making $500/month within 6 months, which would increase the value of the site to $10,000 to $15,000. Why am I so confident that I can take this site from $135/month to $500/month in 6 months? From my experience and skills that I have mastered I know this site is currently extremely under optimized and missing out on a ton of targeted traffic. To give you all as much value as possible I am actually going to show you exactly why I think it is under optimized.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Opportunity to Monetize More Effectively**\n\nSkill Used: I was able to spot this opportunity due to my skills with optimizing AdSense layouts and knowing if a site is currently under optimized. Without this skillset I may not have been able to spot this opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, this site was making $135/month from AdSense, but all $135 was from only ONE AdSense ad per page. The screenshot below shows the one ad that is displayed per page on this site:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nScreenshot of the one ad - [http://imgur.com/smZjGfp](http://imgur.com/smZjGfp)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know that Google allows each page to have a total of six ads per page, three link units and three regular ads. From that alone I know that this site is leaving a lot of money on the table. I also know that job training and educational niches such as this one have a very high CPC because it’s a lucrative market for the advertisers. Just by adding a few more ads per page I am very confident that I can at least double the earnings from the site practically overnight.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd yes, I understand it doesn’t take a genius to know that this site was being under monetized. However, I knew that Google allows six ads per site, was familiar with the most common AdSense layouts, and also knew that this market has a high CPC, which allowed me to quickly assess this site and determine that it was a good pickup. Not to mention that knowledge allowed me to act quickly on this site and make a decision on whether or not to purchase it. This site was sold within a few hours of being listed on Flippa because it had less than a 10x monthly multiple. If I wasn’t able to make quick, yet knowledge decisions, I would not have been able to quickly seize the opportunity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Opportunity to Grow the Organic Traffic**\n\nSkills Used: SEO and keyword research\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was able to spot a huge opportunity in this site from using my SEO and keyword research skills. First, the site is not optimized at all in terms of title tags, URL structure and meta descriptions. However, that is not the area where I see the most potential. The opportunity that most excites is me is the fact that I can target keywords based on states and cities. For example, keywords such as “Florida HVAC license” and “Texas HVAC training” are ripe for opportunity. Right now, the website is only targeting two different states, Florida and Texas – that’s it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are 48 other states to target as well as countless large cities that get a decent amount of search volume. The best part about these keywords is that they are very easy to rank for since they are local search terms. I am not going after broad search terms such as “HVAC training” or “HVAC classes,” but instead very targeted local keywords which makes it easier to rank in Google. This site has already had success ranking for Florida- and Texas-based keywords and I think expanding long-tail terms to include other states will provide a ton of traffic. Below is a screenshot of the rankings for the page that is targeting Florida search terms:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKeywords ranking for Florida search terms - [http://imgur.com/XWiNLOx](http://imgur.com/XWiNLOx)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis proves that it is fairly easy to rank for these types of local keywords. Now, I can start expanding to other states, which provides a huge amount of potential. As you can see from this example, with my SEO, keyword research and optimizing AdSense knowledge I was able to spot this website. I am very confident in my ability to increase the value of the site by applying these skills. This same exact thing can be done with a ton of different skills as long as you have mastered them and understand how to use them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Examples in other Investments Types##\n\nThe idea of mastering one skill or a system is not new when it comes to investing. Matter of fact, it is actually one of the more basic investing concepts and it aligns perfectly with website investing as well. Let’s take a look at a few examples.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Real Estate**\n\nThere are countless types of real estate investments such as rentals, flipping, apartments, raw land, and duplexes. However, each one of these takes a different skillset to achieve success. You will often find that people have the most success in real estate by staying within one type of investment. Someone who has had success, buying old run-down houses, fixing them up and then renting them out will almost always stay within that type of investment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy? Because they have built up enough experience and knowledge within that one type of investment that they have mastered it. This allows them to continue to have success in the same area over and over again because they know what works and what doesn’t. All of these things apply to website investing as well. By sticking to what you know you are able to increase your chances of having success.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Stocks**\n\nSimilar to real estate, there are hundreds of strategies and techniques to trading stocks. For example, Warren Buffet has had a huge amount of success with value investing. This means he buys stock of companies that he feels like the market currently undervalues. This is Warren Buffet’s “system,” or skill, that allows him to consistently choose good stocks and make a solid ROI. Buffet mastered that type of investing and used it to make a ton of money. This same principle of mastering one system or skill translates over to buying and selling online businesses as well. Whether we are talking about real estate, stocks or websites you can see how this same idea of mastering a skill is incredibly important for continued to success.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Skills Every Website Investor Should Possess##\n\nMastering a skill is very important, but there are a few skills that every website investor should have that act as the foundation. Without having a solid foundation to build upon you will not understand how to apply the skills that you mastered in a meaningful way. Let’s take a look at these skills now and I will explain why they are important.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Market Knowledge**\n\nThis means having a good understanding of what is going on in the website buying/selling market. If you don’t keep a pulse on the market you will become out of tune with it and it will end up costing you. Below are some industry factors that every website owner should know about:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCommon Multiples: Understanding the common multiples that are used to value websites is very important. It will allow you to determine if a website is under or overvalued. A few years ago the common multiple was 2x annual profits, and now it closer to 2.5x yearly revenue. Also, you should know the kind of multiples different types of business models get. For example, SaaS businesses often get higher multiples than affiliate sites.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDifferences Between Marketplaces: There are many options when it comes to finding a place to buy and sell online businesses. Knowing the differences between marketplaces is very important. For example, Flippa is the largest marketplace, but it is also where the most scams take place due a lack of vetting process to list a website for sale. Flippa is also where the websites on the lower end of the scale get sold. On the other hand, FE International sells higher end sites and each one goes through a vetting process, which ensures each business being sold is legitimate. Knowing the differences between the marketplaces is very important, both when buying websites and selling them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKnow the Trends: Being able to spot trends is very important because it allows you to capitalize on them as well as stay out in front of them. One important trend to keep your eye on is the new business models that are starting to become popular within the marketplace. An example of this would be the Amazon FBA businesses that have become hugely popular in the last year, and now a lot of people are looking to sell them off. Other trends to keep your eye on are new marketplaces to sell websites, and the rising multiples websites are now getting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##The Best way to Gain Market Knowledge##\n\nThe best way to gain this market knowledge is to be in it every single day. What I mean by “being in it” is that you should be scouting listings every day. This means looking through each of the websites listed and understanding how the site was valued, where the traffic is coming from, how it is earning money, and overall just understanding how the marketplace works. I would suggest spending at least an hour everyday looking at and analyzing websites that are for sale.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Analytical**\n\nHoning your ability to analyze a website’s information to determine a good vs. bad investment is crucial. If you don’t analyze every single aspect of a website before you purchase, it you could miss important information that could make or break that investment. Due diligence is very closely related to being analytical, and they go hand in hand. I would consider the skill of being analytical to be vital in making sure that you purchase only high-quality businesses.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Delegation**\n\nYou may be able to run the day-to-day tasks of one online business, but as your portfolio of websites grow, your hours will become limited. This is when the skill of being able to delegate becomes so important. One of the best ways to delegate your tasks is to outsource them. Learning how to outsource parts of your business to free up your time for the most important jobs is vital to keeping your businesses growing. This means you have to know what tasks can be outsourced, how to hire people, how to train them and how to manage multiple employees.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Wrapping Things Up##\n\nIt is not easy being a website investor because you have to be knowledgeable in many different areas. However, as I explained within this article mastering a skill is the key to being able to have success buying, growing and selling online businesses. I hope that you enjoyed reading and before I end this article I want to say one thing – go learn and master a skill ASAP, it WILL pay off.","name":"t3_4o7y53","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-15 17:45:13","week":24}
{"id":"4o843w","author":"claxius","body":"I'm currently researching the saturated world of affiliate marketing and looking to dive in and make website soon. A few questions before I invest a lot of time in a site that might not work:\n\n1.) Is it essential that the website focus on a niche? \n\n2.) Could the website cover a wide range of products from a popular category (say beauty supplies) and be successful, IF there is additional content like a blog, reviews, and top 10 lists of certain products? Would that be enough to stand out? \n\n3.) What if you integrated a niche product into a website with more broad appeal? Say you write some blogs, video tutorial, top ten lists of just rainbow lipstick; but instead of having an affiliate website of just rainbow lipstick, that product would be integrated into a site that has many more products. In theory, you drive traffic to your site with rainbow lipstick, but then there are many more products to choose from. Is it possible to stand out that way?\n\n4.) How does one go about selling a product(s) on their site through affiliation if that product is not on Amazon? I assume I contact the seller and ask if I can sell their product on my website. How do I go about adding their content, selling it, and then making sure I get a commission?\n\nObviously I'm a noob and still figuring things out. Thanks for the help.","name":"t3_4o843w","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-15 18:16:56","week":24}
{"id":"4o889k","author":"EddyScanlan","body":"I got a bit of a wake-up call after posting about [logo design](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4njz1e/logo_design_fiverr_sucks_but_99d_is_out_of_budget/) the other day, but I wanted to update you all and get some more advice.\n\nI'm partly using [this guide](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4md772/how_i_help_busy_entrepreneurs_validate_their/) someone posted here a few weeks ago. (original thread was deleted - don't know why)\n\nI'm planning to launch a Kickstarter project on July 12th to help fund the business I am trying to start. It's called The Daily Jars, and our flagship product is a gratitude jar that you can take a note out of every morning and be grateful for whatever is written on the note throughout the day. It's to help you live a happier life by being more grateful for things that you normally wouldn't think of.\n\nWhat we've done so far:\n\n* Ordered mason jar samples from a supplier with about a $2k minimum order (3000 units) (this is lowest minimum order we could find that also was from a supplier that had 3+ years on alibaba)\n\n* [Setup a homepage landing page](http://thedailyjars.com/)\n\n* Setup another [landing page](http://thedailyjars.com/ebook) with a free ebook download that I plan to drive FB ads to so we can have some people on our email list to reach out to on day of launch. I used this [free course from Leadpages](https://lps.leadpages.net/facebook-advertising-course/) to get started.\n\n* Setup FB Pixels on every Leadpage for retargeting.\n\nWhat I'm still working on:\n\n* Making the ad.  This is my [pre-lim design](http://thedailyjars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FREE-eBook.jpg) which I made using Canva.\n\n* Setting up some other followup emails to keep the list warm between now and launch.\n\n* Referring back to [this guide](http://www.littlemight.com/kickstarter-step-by-step/) for other things to do, such as reaching out to media. Plan to do this closer to the launch and after the video is made.\n\n* Making a final prototype and use it to help film our video for Kickstarter. Planning to do this within the next week.\n\nSome questions I have:\n\n* Is using FB ads a good idea if we're already strapped for cash starting this? The whole point we're doing this Kickstarter is so we can both validate the idea and to get enough money to meet the MOV with the supplier on Alibaba.\n\n* If you do suggest I go forward with using ads, I know my targeting right now is terrible. I don't want to start blowing a daily budget before I have some input from others. Here's [a photo of my current targeting](http://thedailyjars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture.png) for FB ads. How can I improve here?\n\n* What thank you page do you guys like better? These would be one of the thank you pages that you're brought to after signing up at the [ebook download landing page](http://thedailyjars.com/ebook). [Thank you page with download button](http://thedailyjars.com/thank-you-ebook-download-gratitude). [Thank you page with share buttons](http://thedailyjars.com/thank-you-ebook-gratitude-share).\n\n* We're still working on working out our cost for each product and what we should be pricing it at. This also effects what we're set our target for our Kickstarter. I want to set the target at around $3000 to cover the $2k minimum order from Alibaba and the other $1k would go towards fulfilling the Kickstarter Backers which would entail everything else that goes in the jar and the design of it. We would only expect to use 500 Jars MAX to fulfill the Kickstarter Backers, which would leave the other 2500 jars for us to fulfill orders from our website on shopify and our listing on Amazon.","name":"t3_4o889k","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-15 18:39:02","week":24}

I was lucky my first two years of having generally respectful clients and an ability to provide extremely prompt service. This year, however, I'm having a notable issue of clients entering spaces they shouldn't. \n\nI'm looking to install an outdoor doorbell at my entry gate that clients can push for service. It needs to be battery-operated or solar-powered (no electrical outlets anywhere close, for both receiver and transmitter), with a range of at least 700 feet. The louder the better. Most things I'm finding on Amazon require an outlet for one of the two parts and have a whole bunch of bells and whistles (literally) that I don't need. \n\nAdditionally, where do I find signage that politely tells the customer to use said doorbell? \"STAFF ONLY\" signs are easy to come by, not so much weather-appropriate \"Ring for service\" signs.

{"id":"4odiuq","author":"kitsune-gari","body":"     \n\nMy husband and I are from the deep south. I am a book illustrator and do fairly well (I also teach part-time), and my husband has a MAT with a specialization in English education. He works, in general, with at-risk youth and/or teens with learning exceptionalities or a history of drug problems. He considers \"problem kids\" the most rewarding kids to work with, since they have the most room for improvement. He absolutely loves his work and takes it extremely seriously; Our Amazon purchase history is full of books that he purchased for his classes with his own money.\n\nIn March, he was offered a job by a youth rehab facility/GED prep school in Seattle. Everything seemed great! The job was offering him 30% more than he was being paid at his current job, and also offered to incorporate a \"moving stipend\" into his salary for the first year. We took our savings and relocated ourselves, driving from New Orleans to Seattle in a Subaru with two cats in the back (they were on cat drugs). It took us four days and was grueling.\n\nEverything was going well until his administrator called him in and informed him he was being let go for not being a \"good fit\". The teacher who is building his students a garden with crowdsourced supplies and buying them books with his own money and incorporating current events, music, and culture into his lesson plans is not a good fit? She also said something about how his contract salary was too high and also that some person (who she didn't name) overheard him telling the kids they could \"smoke as much weed as they want\" (he would NEVER have said that in a million years to kids in a rehab facility who were a hair's  breadth from real jailtime). Apparently, in spite of his two year contract, they reserved the right to terminate him for any reason (or no reason) within the first three months of employment, and they did it just two weeks shy of three months. It's obvious to me we were scammed. They never had any intention of keeping him until his contract began. Legally, though, I think we have no recourse.\n\nNow we are in debt for a move that was supposed to be a step up. We are moving back to New Orleans and had to beg money from our families just to cover the cost of moving our stuff during the summer (they charge a 4k lb minimum even though we have few personal items at this point). I tried to sell some gold jewelry, but was lowballed. I might sell my guitar if I can get anything for it. My husband is going to sell his new bicycle. Our building is charging us a termination fee of 2 months rent in addition to keeping our deposit. We are completely broken emotionally and financially. I have no idea how to act in this situation. It's put a strain on our marriage and broken his spirit so much that he will probably be risk-averse forever. I guess I just want to hear from folks who have survived similar situations, or maybe from anyone who has any advice on how we should act. I will be able to get my old job back when we return, and he will be able to collect unemployment (a fraction of his salary) until he is able to get another teaching job in August. Best-case scenario, we will be rebuilding our lives for the rest of this year...\n\nI feel like this is the worst blunder of either of our lives. We have always been middle class. I have never had to borrow money from people before just to survive. I feel so humiliated and am sick with worry.","name":"t3_4odiuq","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-16 16:16:14","week":24}

{"id":"4oe7m1","author":"respectablefucking","body":"Prepare yourself for an epic saga of bureaucratic injustice.\n\nSo about a year ago I moved from NC to RI where branches of my bank (Wells Fargo) were scarce so I decided to close my accounts there and switch to BofA. Sometime in mid May 2015 I paid off my credit card online as usual then went in person to a Wells Fargo, handed a representative my credit and debit card and asked to close any accounts under my name. This went smoothly and I moved a few days later.\n\nA month or two after that I receive word from my mother that a letter has been delivered at my old address from Wells Fargo claiming that I owe them some small amount of money (around $12.00). I tell her that there must be a mistake because I no longer have an account there and if I had still owed money then the banker I spoke to would surely not be able to close my account.\n\nI call customer service and explain the situation and ask that any accounts be closed and any fees be dropped seeing that the account was supposed to have been closed already. The person on the phone apologizes and agrees and we end the conversation with a definitive confirmation that they have done as I asked.  A few more weeks pass and my mother receives another letter like the first, but the amount I supposedly owe has increased due to late fees. I call them again and go through the exact same process ending with the exact same resolution- Their mistake, I owe nothing, and the account is now closed. A few more weeks and yet another letter arrives, I call somewhat exasperated, and we repeat the process on last time. \n\nThe letters do not stop and as a twenty-one year old graduate living independently for the first time and settling into a new place, I decide I have not the time, the patience, nor the facility to fight the battle further and simply begin to ignore them. I didn’t know what else to do.\n\nThat last call was sometime in the late Summer/early Fall of 2015. Fast forward to April 2016. I have just moved to Maryland for a job and my ancient car dies. I buy another one, but not before checking my credit score online. Last I knew it was near perfection. To my dismay it has dropped over 200 points due to “serious delinquency”. I know exactly where it’s coming from.\n\nThis time, I go in person to Wells Fargo and calmly explain the situation to a very nice banker named Sylvia. When she checks my account history she informs me that there were some purchases made on Amazon with my old credit card before I remembered to switch my payment method (which should not have done anything if the credit line was closed as I believed it was). She also sees my long history of paying off the card in full each month and realizes that I am not a credit delinquent. She cannot help me, however, as anything credit card related is dealt with over the phone by a remote department. She calls the number and does her best but they transfer her repeatedly and keep her on hold until the bank closes and she has to leave.\n\nSylvia gives me the number to call myself with the advice NOT to simply pay the amount (some $130 now) as it would be accepting fault in the eyes of the creditors and would not help my situation. Instead she says to get something in writing that acknowledges my innocence which I can then send off to the credit companies.\n\nI call the number. My call is answered by the most unhelpful and, quite frankly, rude woman I have ever spoken to. She flat out tells me there’s nothing she can do and accuses me of trying to get the bank to accept fault for my own oversight. She says any representatives I spoke to previously were in error and the only thing I can do about that is file a complaint. She says that my two options are to “settle” or “pay in full” neither of which she explains in any way. When I ask how either of those courses of action will affect my credit she replies “I don’t know I’m not your credit advisor”. I ended the interaction no closer to a solution.\n\nSo that brings us up to now. They claim it’s my fault because they sent letters. I claim it’s theirs because I called and was “helped” by either liars or idiots. To me, the whole point of a credit score is to show whether you can be trusted to borrow and return money, which I can be. My current credit score is false representation and I refuse to live with consequences incurred by the ineptitude of Well Fargo’s employees and their system as a whole. I really don’t want to have to involve a lawyer but it’s looking more and more like my only option. Please, PLEASE, can anyone help me?","name":"t3_4oe7m1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-16 18:29:01","week":24}

{"id":"4ofdbl","author":"vegaseller","body":"Contrarianism is a must if you want to generate alpha in the long run. As Peter Thiel says, the world is full of secrets and mistaken consensus. This thread is dedicated to contrarian ideas, long and short term, both relating to inflection points and mean reversion. \n\nMy contrarian idea revolves around China:                \nGenerally western investors are quite skeptical about the country in the long run, various fund managers that I admire (soros, kyle bass) have pointed out at the unsustainability of its corporate debt, its vast shadow banking sector and a chain of trust companies with duration mismatches which will bring it all tumbling down. Some of this skepticism around the short/medium term cycle have carried over to the long term as well. Now ft/economist articles regularly talk about overcapacity, aging population. I am bearish in the next 1-3 years on China but I think the long term trend is in tact. China is following the footstep of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan in its industrialization and it is still at a low base of about USD7-9k per capita GDP, it is very reasonable to believe they will get to 20-30k level over the next 10 years, which will make them by far the largest economy on earth. Many people are skeptical about Chinese entrepreneurship, pointing towards the copycating which was prevalent for the past 20-30 years, giving Japan as an example of a country that caught up to the US and then stopped. I think China will be different for one major reason. \n\nAlthough China is demographically/genetically very similar to all the other east asian countries and is the source of most east asian cultures, there is a big cultural difference between the Chinese and Japanese and Koreans, which is a very very high risk tolerance. Chinese people are generally willing to take on much more risks. You see this in the business world, there is the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, Google and Facebook in Alibaba/JD, Baidu and Tencent, while Japan and Korea never developed a formidable tech industry. Chinese companies raised 37 billion in VC capital in 2015, second only to the US at 68 billion, and far greater than any other country. While the Koreas and Japanese went after safe conventional sectors such as cars/shipping, you see China going after new frontiers, some successful (DJI in commerical UAV), some not so (Solar). As a result, I see China's future economic potential as being higher than that of Japan and Korea. Just as the U.S. experienced myriad of recessions/depressions/civil wars and disturbances on its path to become an economic giant, so will China experience turbulence in its climb to the top.

{"id":"4ofge3","author":"Nastrod","body":"I've got a side project that I've been running for the past couple of years that is pretty popular. It's the most popular site for its very particular niche. Most months I get around 300,000 - 500,000 page views, and around 100,000 unique visitors. I typically generate around $200/month in ad revenue. Last month was my best month ever with over 1 million views and about $500 in ad revenue. (That level of traffic hasn't persisted to this month -- there was a lot of excitement about a development in this niche. Traffic on average is still higher than before, but nowhere near as much as last month.)\n\nI think it might be possible to turn this side project into a livable wage if I were to devote myself full-time to it for ~6 months - 1 year. Some ideas on increasing revenue:\n\n- Improved ads and ad placement (given I just work on the site in my spare time I have not given much thought to ads at all -- and thus my CPM is real low)\n- Utilizing Amazon Associates more (I've earned a good chunk of money from Amazon over the past couple of months, and would like to investigate strategies on how to keep that up)\n- Improve the site in general and release features people have wanted for ages (helping to increase traffic and word of mouth)\n- Release a mobile app - people have been asking for this for ages. Would need more research to determine if it should be paid or ad supported (my initial inkling from talking to a bunch of my users is that a ~$2 app would do decently well -- selling maybe 500/month?)\n- Expand to other related niches. There's a lot of interest for the same service in other areas. Off the top of my head I can already think of 10 sites that could be built. I've already got a loyal user base to start from (since there would be a lot of crossover between the niches), so it wouldn't even feel like starting from ground zero each time, giving me a decent chance of at least having a few become moderately successful. \n\nI realize there's a very good chance that I won't be successful and will totally fail to make the necessary livable income off of this. That's why my plan is essentially:\n\n- Continue to work on the site in my spare time for now, increasing revenue where possible\n- Save up until I have a year's worth of expenses in savings (which should be very soon - like, within the next month or two)\n- Once I've got that saved up, quit my job and spend 6 months focusing on this project full time.\n- If at the end of six months I can pay the majority of my monthly expenses from the site(s) I will keep going. If not, I will go find another job.\n\nThe reason for running this experiment for 6 months but saving up a year's worth of expenses is that I'm a firm believer in the importance of a 6 month emergency fund. Having that extra 6 month buffer should (in my mind) reduce the inherent risk of this by quite a bit.\n\nI realize it might be smarter to just stay at my current job and continue to build this out in my free-time. Here are some of the reasons I don't want to do that:\n\n- I hate my current job, and am looking for a new one anyway. If this fails I'll just find another (better) job, and have a fun experiment under my belt (and one that should help my resume)\n- I'm 27, single, and have zero debt. This may be the only chance in my life to try something like this.\n- My site is already popular, so I'm not just embarking on a totally untested idea.\n- My overhead is literally just hosting fees. I'm a full stack developer and can build this all myself (with perhaps the occasional commission for a logo or design)\n\nAny thoughts or advice?

Well I want to change that and be more fluent on here. With that out of the way, I just wanted to share an idea I just had for a new business.\n\nIt would be a t shirt business that is built on users voting (liking) for designs that other people made. They would draw up a design, post it via Twitter, Instagram etc. and whoever has the most likes at the end of the month, would see their design made into a shirt for purchase. The artist's design would come to life and I feel like it's a good model for getting people involved in what they want to see. The winner would also get a free shirt!\n\nI'm thinking there could be categories ie. music, food, science etc. but I am getting ahead of myself. I don't know if you can integrate Amazon Merch with Shopify, but that's just a baseline idea to get the shirts made and not have to deal with all the headaches of getting them made in China with a new design every month.\n\nWould need to get followers via social media platforms whether it be through word of mouth, growth hacking, I don't know yet. It needs to get big and have a good following first.\n\nAny and all questions welcome, and don't be afraid to judge me like an asshole, I enjoy criticism.","name":"t3_4oftqa","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-16 23:38:14","week":24}

{"id":"4oi08v","author":"KenjiMishima","body":"I wanted to try and be helpful on this subbreddit so I figured I would talk about some apps that have probably be brought up but not really talked about how they could be utilized. \n\n\n\nSo these apps are things where you are given a certain amount of points or $$ for uploading pictures of your receipts. This is used and sent to companies for market research. Rebate apps are apps where you scan the reciept and product, and you can earn a rebate for certain products. Eg. I just redeemed a rebate for some orange juice for .75$. I will get into the rebate apps after I go over the 3 main receipt ones.\n\n\n\n1: **Yaarlo**, its by far my favorite app, and the one that I have earned the most on. They give you cash instead of point values, they give the most out of the 3 apps, and they take the most receipts. I have about 45$ with them, after a few months. Ive uploaded corner store receipts to gamestop receipts and been paid for them. This works well because for my digital game selling business I can earn a bit off the receipts. While they do take any receipts you will still earn more off grocery type stores, from the values I have seen. Redemption start at 20$ for paypal, and 10$ for gift cards. For Yarrlo my ref code is \"JAMEAL523\", you dont have to use it, but it would be appreciated if you did.\n\n\n\n2: **Receipt Pal**, The second best app in my opinion. This one works a bit different than the other two. Instead of getting value based on the recipt you get a flat rate per 4 receipts. For every 4, you get 100 points. You can earn up to 300 per week. You can also connect your email to the app, and forward them email receipts, if you have a paypal debit card this works to your advantage, when buying online. With this for the most part they accept any receipts, and they can be of any value. So that means even if you just went to the store and bought an arizona, you can earn something for it. Chances are Yarrlo wont give you anything for something like that. Redemption for this one start at 400 for a 1$ amazon gift card. The more points you have the lower the denominations for the cards get. \n\n\n\n3: **Receipt Hog**, Lastly we have receipt hog. With this one you have a few ways to earn, first you can earn just like the other for your receipts. With qualifying receipts you can earn coins. With receipts that arent qualifying you will earn spins on their slot machine, which gives you a chance to earn coins. In addition, every week you upload a receipt you will earn additional spins based on on the amount of weeks in a row for the month you have uploaded. You also have a \"level\" you level up based on how many weeks you have uploaded receipts, you only need to upload 1 per week for it to count towards leveling. At the lower levels you earns spins for the slots, and at the higher levels you begin earning coins. The coins you get for this app are pretty linear. If its under 10$, 5 coins, 10-50$, 10 coins, 50-100, 15 coins, and anything over 100 is 20 coins. You can only earn up to 100 coins per week. After that everything else you upload will earn you 5 coins, no matter what the value is. With spins, you have a maximum of 20 per week, after that you may as well save them. Rewards for this start at 1000 coins for 5$ paypal, and 1000 coins for 5$ amazon gift card.\n\n\n\nBefore I move on, I wanted to go over some small tips. The first one being, if you havent figured it out yet, you can use all 3 of these apps with the same receipts. You will be able to earn off all of them. Sure its only pennies on the dollar, but hey its better than nothing, you were probably just going to crumble up those receipts anyway. Secondly, if you got family that lives with you, just tell them to save their receipts as well, my aunt happily does this for me. Third, if you are someone who \"flips\" things, or does Retail Arbitrage, via Amazon or Ebay, take a note to snap your receipts when you go to a store to source. This way you add just a little bit more to your profit. Not a whole lot, but this is beermoney we are talking about anyway right? I have 1 more tip, but I will say it later on. \n\n\n\nNow for the rebate apps, I am mainly going to talk about the one that I use, some are already familiar with it.\n\n\n\n**Ibotta**: With this, you would look for products that have rebates on them. Only go for things you are going to buy or things that are similar to what you are going to buy. Do not shop for rebates, you will end up losing money in the end. When redeeming you take a picture of the products barcode, then one of the receipt. You can use this in combination with the first 3 apps of course. The rewards for Ibotta start at 20$ for paypal and giftcards. What you are thinking is correct, and that is kind of alot. If you use my ref code as you will start off with 10$ towards your balance, I believe you get get it after 1 rebate. You also get added to my team, with anyone else who joins, with a team when everyone is doing their thing with rebates, whatever they are buying, we can get special bonus money earn just for getting rebates. My ref code for this is \"8ic6ga\". Again you do not have to use but it is appreciated.\n\n\n\nThe other app I will briefly mention is **Checkout51**. I am not going to talk a whole bunch about it really. Because its the same thing as Ibotta, without the team part. However sometimes when the planets aline, you will find something that has a rebate on Ibotta, and Checkout51, which you can upload to both the rebate apps, and then to the receipt apps on top of that. My ref link for Checkout51 is http://c51.co/i3Qjryh, the non ref one is https://www.checkout51.com/ by using my ref you earn 5$ after uploading your first receipt. Rewards for Checkout51 start at 20$ for a check, I know its kind of inconvenient. \n\n\n\nTo the last of things, for the tip I mentioned earlier, it is simply this. If you receive any sort of food government assistance. For me that would be SNAP benefits, these apps are alot more valuable. You can somewhat earn off money that was given to you to help your family. Now when you are able to redeem something off each app, you can use the extra bit of money you earned to push a bit further. \n\n\n\nPersonally I think a diverse pool of people can gain alot from these. From families who spend hundreds of dollars on groceries per week, to people who flip things from retail stores. The only reason to not do any of this is if you feel small numbers are insignificant and thus are not worth the hassle. \n\n\n\nI hope that the information in this post helps you all, I did put alot of work into this post, it did take like an hour to write. I appreciate anyone who signs up under me, and appreciate this wonderful community. Its small forums like this that made it so that I could figure out a way to make money online and survive a bit without a job, due to having foot issues for the past 3 years. So I hope everyone finds my contribution to the community worth it. Any bonuses I get from referrals will be used so I can get some new glasses.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has questions I will answer the to the best of my abilities.

{"id":"4ok8l6","author":"Barbaric_Emu","body":"I just MADE money upgrading my phone and wanted to share it with someone so I thought this might be a good place.  I had an iPhone 5s that was getting close to 3 years old.  Everything worked fine so I wasn't really looking too seriously into upgrading to a newer phone.  I am an eBay/Amazon reseller so I am always checking for good deals on anything to resell.  I follow Craigslist and Facebook buying and selling groups to find these deals.  The other day I saw an iPhone 6s with a cracked screen going for $180.  That's a pretty low price so I let them know I could buy it right now.  We met up and I got my new phone.  Now onto fixing it.  Luckily I also work in cellphone repair, but sadly the screens on the 6s cost around $130.  I decided to test my luck and bought an $85 China screen to see if the quality would be good enough for me, and I ended up getting an original Apple part that had a small defect that you can't really notice.  Totally worth the savings.  Then I listed my cracked screen on eBay and it sold for $70.  Minus fees and shipping I'm looking at $57 back from the screen.  Lastly, now with my new phone all fixed and working, I posted my old iPhone 5s (that had a custom red back instead of black) for $220 and it sold same day.  I have officially made money upgrading 2 generations ahead.  I actually recommend people to look into upgrading every year or 2.  The phones don't differ in price that much within the fist year of a release so it's usually pretty cheap to upgrade if you can watch closely and find the good deals","name":"t3_4ok8l6","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-17 19:08:40","week":24}

{"id":"4ole1w","author":"Fishering","body":"Hey, this post isn't like the rest. Still very on topic, so I figured some people really might like it. Mods, obviously do your thing if this doesn't belong.\n\nIf you ever have used Google Express, it is a service similar to Amazon. You buy things with 2 day or 1 day, or 1 hour shipping. It's not available everywhere, so make sure to check.\n\nIf you've used google express in the past, you probably got an email saying 'here's $15 to spend this fathers day'.\n\nThe email contains a code for $15 off.\n\nIf you have costco as an available store (you need membership), they have cold stone creamery gift cards (pack of 4x$15 codes), total of $60. They sell them for $40, so that's 66% to begin with. Unlike every other gift card on Google Express, you are allowed to use the $15 off on these gift cards, so that will bring your total to $25 for $60 worth of gift cards. \n\nShipping and handling *should* be free, and if it's not, they offer a free 3 month trial. Super easy to start and cancel. \n\nIf you are new to Google express, never signed up, you won't get the $15 code, but my account has an option to 'refer friends'. Give $15, get $15.\n\nDon't worry. I know that a decent percent of people reading this don't want me to benefit at all for sharing this. I won't benefit. The $15 credit goes on an account that no longer has membership, so I won't be using the credit anytime soon.\n\nHere's a link: https://google.com/express/invite/9FUCFB52E\n\nIt should give you $15 off your first order (no minimum). \n\nIf you don't want $15 off, not a problem. https://www.google.com/express\n\nAlso, if anyone wants a $15 off code, comment and shoot me a PM. I've got a few of them. Can't be stacked on one purchase. I usually use the $15 credit to buy food from some stores. Get $15 worth of food for maybe $2 (tax). \n\nHope this helps! \n\nAnother note. If anyone is not able to access the coldstone creamery offer, shoot me a PM as well and I'll see about buying one and then reselling these gift cards to you for a similar rate.

I was at a garage sale and they had this semi quick selling computer part for $1, sells on Amazon for $25 used after fees. Oh and just so you know it *looked* like it was taped, like it was new. So naturally I'm stoked. I get home and open the box to check if it works and lo and behold, the box is literally empty. Besides the wrapping paper and manual there was no product. So don't be an idiot like me and double check especially at garage sales.

{"id":"4oo66g","author":"pitbullcross","body":"**The backstory:** \n\nTwo months ago I came back from travelling and, unsure exactly what career direction I wanted to take, I created a Youtube chess channel. A short while later I started streaming chess on Twitch. I am a very strong player and I have put in quite a lot of work into this, so I have been able to grow these channels at a rate of about 10 new followers on Twitch per day, and around the same - 10 subscribers - on Youtube per day. I haven't done much to advertise, it has largely been organic growth. I now have around 400 followers on Twitch, and 450 subscribers on Youtube. It's not much, but if I keep things going and posting material on a daily/near-daily basis, I suspect I'll continue to add followers at at least the current rate of growth. Assuming that my rate of growth remained unchanged (which I think is a conservative assumption) then I would have around 4,000 followers on Twitch and 4,000 subscribers on Youtube a year from now. \n\n**Where I am at now &amp; my short-term plan:**  \n\nI am embarking on a career as a chess professional and in the short run will be focusing on most of my income coming from teaching chess in schools when the new academic year begins in September 2016. So, until September I'll be relying on keeping expenses low and covering costs by way of occasional online lessons + Twitch donations. And from September 2016 to June 2017 I'll be earning enough money with schools chess that I will be able to do a little more than keep my head above water. But it won't be enough money to be overly comfortable, and this part of work has the problem that in the long run I would like to live abroad &amp; travel. \n\n**My medium to long-term plan:**\n\nI'm prepared to work hard for the next 2-3 years and stay local if needs be, but because I am quite nomadic by nature, I would like to generate enough income streams from online chess work that I could eventually turn this side of things into my main job. Or perhaps use any of the skills within e-business that I may have picked up along the way to make a living online within a different field in the future; if such an opportunity presents itself. \n\n**Uncertain about how to develop:**\n\nBasically, I feel like if I continue to put in the work with streaming &amp; uploading material to Youtube, I'm going to steadily grow into a follower/subscriber base of a few thousand. However, a 'naked' youtube channel of a few thousand subscribers isn't going to produce any significant revenue. A Twitch channel with a few thousand followers I *do* feel can generate enough donations that it can represent a % of my income. But for the most part it seems like the only way I'm going to be able to generate enough income from this is by leveraging the exposure from these platforms by setting up additional offerings and 'embed' them into Twitch &amp; YT. But...there appear to be so many options that I am not just enthusiastic about things, but also overwhelmed! I'm also really struggling to find ways of informing myself as to how to develop. \n\n**Here are the things that I am definitely going to do:** \n\n* Continue to focus on Twitch growth, and aim towards getting the subscriber button. Donations to date on Twitch have been surprisingly generous, so I see a lot more potential here than on Youtube.\n\n* Have my own basic website where I list out the coaching services I offer and a basic profile, at the least.\n\n* Increase activity on Twitter, and make a Facebook fan page.\n\n**Here are some other things I *could* do but am unsure which to focus on, or even in what order**: \n\n* Produce Kindle &amp; Createspace chess books and use my channels + website to advertise them and obtain greater sales than if I didn't have these platforms to reach out to an audience. \n\n* Create some affiliate links, be it something general like an Amazon link, or more specific like doing a video where I review a book or other material that I have really enjoyed and then affiliate link to it. I've noticed some ppl do that on Twitch and let their viewers know that this is a way in which they can support the streamer while actually purchasing something, rather than a straight-up donation.\n\n* Expand my website to include a small shop. If linking from Twitch, it can have Twitch-specific things like custom t-shirts. Otherwise, my idea would be to have a small shop of chess material that I like &amp; recommend. I should note that I'm not interested in exploiting my customers in any way - I want to generate additional revenue by offering my followers good deals. The idea of a small shop appeals to me because I have many recommendations in mind about what is good chess material and what is bad, and I think that it would be helpful for my viewers if I made specific recommendations by topic in chess based on my own experiences with that material or my knowledge of the authors in question. \n\n* Become an Amazon FBA seller and link to my shop. The logistics of this would be a little more demanding, but there would be potential beyond just leveraging the social platforms that I'm on. Because I'm also going to be involved with live activities, purchasing large quantities of things like boards &amp; sets from Alibaba could prove beneficial if I end up focusing more on in-person activities than I am anticipating at the moment.\n\n* Publish paid chess content online. It is reasonably straightforward these days to create a paid content website, so I am considering producing some longer video series and using my Youtube following to attract traffic. This would be nice because as things stand there are a few ideas for series that I have, but I cannot justify the time investment given that my channel is so small that I'm getting zero returns on it currently. I'm talking video series that would take about 25-30 hours to properly make. If I could charge even $5-7 for access to the whole series it would make it financially appealing. \n\n* Another related option is to offer chess courses on independent paid content sites like Udemy. The process is more tedious, but it would be a nice skill to develop and I do have a friend who would help me with any necessary video/audio editing as well as any animation I wished to insert. Some chess courses here are going for pretty significant sums of money so it certainly is appealing. \n\nAnyway, there are far more ways of monetizing that have crossed my mind in recent weeks, but hopefully this paints a suitable picture of how challenging I am finding it to develop a specific action-plan. I don't have much business experience, so I'm finding it hard to keep my thoughts structured when faced with many tempting ways of adding revenue streams. Perhaps I am even missing the most obvious and recommended routes. \n\nIs anybody able to provide some advice? \n\n**tl;dr** I have a few hundred followers on Twitch, and a few hundred on Youtube after a couple of months. It's a chess channel. Judging by other channels and the reception I have received so far and my rate of growth, I'll probably have somewhere between 3000 and 4000 followers by year's end, with steady growth thereafter unless something goes seriously wrong. In itself that's not enough to justify an investment of 20-30 hours of work per week. Looking therefore to leverage this following by adding multiple revenue streams around it. Not quite sure which options to pursue, or even to pursue first. Looking for any thoughts from people with any related experience.\n        \n\n\n","name":"t3_4oo66g","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-18 13:36:25","week":24}

I have two kids 8 and 6 and two adults in the house to feed and we overspend to the tune of over $3k with eating out and groceries in a given month. There is a LOT of food waste and we are trying to improve.  What strategies have helped you in significantly reducing food spending - meal planning, bulk shopping, learning how to eat cheaply?\n\nBackground psychology is two adults who had single moms as parents with mild food insecurity and now that we are adults and making enough money, we spend ALL of our money on food so it's always there.  We want to do better.  We also have horrible yuppie spending habits like Starbucks.

Each one took about six months of work. They weren't your turn and burn shitty E-Books. I dedicated countless hours to each one. They bring in about $10.00 a month. (ROI was pitiful.)\n\n* I have a blog that brings in a decent amount of cash per month from Adsense, Amazon Associates, and the E-Bay Network. I worked on this for about a year and have about two-hundred posts. I have another blog I started a few months ago that has about 80 posts so far. No income on this one yet, but I hope to have about 250 posts at the end of this year.\n\n* I had a drop ship business and had about $20,000 in sales for the first month but the business model fell apart on me and the time invested I simply did not have. \n\n* I've done some freelance writing here and there browsing job boards.\n\nWhat ideas or projects are you working on?","name":"t3_4otc54","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-19 15:39:18","week":24}

I'm trying to figure out who most would want these guys.  When I picked them up at auction I had delusions of monetary re-sale grandeur but I've taken a few steps back from that.  I still have them listed on eBay and Amazon but would like to offer them here as well.\n\n[Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/hQ9Bh) with pictures of one of the banner stands and a few example photos from another retail site.  This is the most damaged one I have (see the dent?) so anything you get will be in better shape.  All are fully functional.\n\nYou'll need to provide your own graphics (unless you want to use the pre-installed Hitachi graphics).\n\nShoot me a PM if you're interested and we can work out cost/shipping/pickup.  I'm not trying to turn a huge profit, for now I'm just hoping to break even and provide a reasonable rate to small business owners who may otherwise be unable to afford something like this.  They retail for $130 without graphics and I'm looking to sell them for around $20-30 each.\n\nThanks, all!","name":"t3_4otfxe","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-19 16:09:49","week":24}

{"id":"d46u37d","author":"nrhinkle","body":"I wrote the review /u/lxivbit linked to, and have written dozens of other bike light reviews. I'm very familiar with the marketplace, and have relationships with all the major light manufacturers. Very few bike lights put out thousand**s** of lumens. None of them cost under $100. The lights you see on Amazon and eBay claiming thousands of lumens for $30 are lying. Myself and other people have measured these with an integrating sphere and found them to be drastically lower output than claimed. For example, one popular model which is sold by thousands of online vendors and is typically labeled \"Cree U2 Solarstorm X2\" or various things like that claims anywhere from 2600 - 5000 lumens depending on which listing you look at. Actual output I measured on a NIST-traceable calibrated integrating sphere? 950 lumens. \n\nIt's going to be nearly impossible for you to compete effectively in the off-road bike market. The people who don't give a crap about quality are already using super-cheap chinese lights like the ones you've described. The people who do care about quality are either buying very nice lights that really do put out thousands of lumens, from reputable and established brands, for lots of money, or they don't really need thousands of lumens (few people do!) and are instead buying lights that cost less but are still very effective. Fenix is competing very well in that space; their BC30 is a single-piece light with 2x 18650 batteries and puts out 1200 lumens on high. Other manufacturers are starting to catch onto 18650 batteries as well. \n\nBased on your comments here, I suspect your level of familiarity with the bike light market and technology is insufficient to effectively develop and sell a novel product. I'm not saying this to be rude, I'm saying it to be practical. If you prove me wrong and do successfully come out with a light that can match or even beat what's currently on the market in terms of price, features, performance, and standards compliance, please let me know - I'd be happy to review it and give you some good press.

{"id":"d478yr9","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"I had 1 extremely successful auction this weekend. First, I bought a Nady speaker for $25. There was nothing on eBay or Amazon about this speaker, so it didn't get bid up too high, but it should be a $200 speaker.\n\nThen, I bid on what I THOUGHT was just a lot of guitar pedals and processing units. I won it at $65. But inside the J-Station box was a bunch of SNES video games! http://imgur.com/a/4Yu0n  Definitely going to make some decent profit there.\n\nAfter that, I started getting reckless. I bid $10 each on 6 really nice humidors, filled with cigars. So now I have several hundred cigars that I have no desire to smoke and no way to sell (as I'm not licensed to sell tobacco). I may end up donating them to Cigars for Warriors or Cigars for the Troops, if I can't find some sort of loop hole that allows me to sell them for collectible value or something. The humidors are extra nice though, and will make me a hefty profit.\n\nLast, I bid $10 on a bookshelf and the contents. I got a stack of old Dungeons and Dragons books (total estimated value: $200ish), I got a stack of guitar tab books and music lesson stuff (total estimated value $50 to $100), and I got an entire shelf full of manuals for his audiophile level sound system equipment (lots of these are LISTED at decent prices, but slow to move... I'll probably end up selling the entire lot to someone who specializes in selling manuals).\n\nSpent $165, plan on making about $1,000. Not bad for 2 hours at an auction. I could have made more, but it was EXTREMELY hot and humid out, and I was already dying.

Executives love it because it is downward pressure on wages and they can do a RIF (reduction in force) of non H-1B's every quarter and keep replacing until everyone is working for H-1B peanuts.\n\nTech is not the only career that will be ruined by this program: Air traffic controllers, doctors, Nurses, accountants, customer service, etc... There is even talk of them coming over for traditional blue collar jobs like mechanics and janitors. They will bunk up with six or eight people to an apartment so housing becomes very cheap.

They don't know that these and many other practices are illegal in the U.S. degrading further the working conditions and leverage the workers have in reasonable negotiation with companies.\n\n**tldr;**\nExecutives want H1B's as they drive down wages and creates a workforce that will fear exercising any rights they have or demanding pensions or a 401K that actually works.

I am unclear on how many miles you earn in that. Also will it restrict you to using only a particular airline and have blackout dates (Like no flights on some days etc ?)\n\nI think the benefit of this card is pretty straight forward. You don't need to memorize categories or different criteria. For every dollar you spend you get 2 cents back (you can use this to redeem any travel like a bus/train/plane ticket or buy Amazon gift cards doesn't matter). I rarely use it to buy travel. I buy amazon gift cards and sometime I redeem my bus pass. So it meets a different purpose for me which is what I like.\n\nThis is an ideal card which complements something like a Discover card where you get 5% cash back on changing categories. I just use this card as my daily driver for any random purchase I make and I use the Discover card to purchase any category specific item I want (currently they have a restaurant category going on so I used it to buy Chipotle for example).","name":"t1_d47ptrt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-13 21:32:29","week":24}

{"id":"d47v8zj","author":"enfier","body":"It's going to take you 5 years to really understand the landscape and for the downsides to be apparent.  Government entities tend to take on an institutional character of their own and can be highly resistant to change.  You may realize one day that management doesn't actually care if the projects succeed or that your success is upsetting the oxcart and getting you sandbagged.  It may be a simple as the realization that the more work you do, the less work everyone else does.  I'm not saying you'll hate it, I'm just saying there's no telling right now if you are really going to love the job 20 years from now.\n\nThere's also other opportunities - if you succeed where you are, you may be able to switch to a different agency or private company for higher pay.  Try to reduce the amount of time you spend with your hands tied if possible just so that you have the freedom to chase a great opportunity if it comes along.\n\nYou may have both a 457b and 401k.  If that is the case, you can double dip and contribute the max to both.  The 457b is better than the 401k since it has no minimum age, so you could use it as an unemployment fund just as easily.  If there's a match, you may be able to get the match on both.\n\nWhen I talk about stagnation, I just mean that on a personal level. There are a million and one ways to keep yourself moving forward outside of working on FI.  It might be at your job, or lifting weights, or rock climbing or building your side business.  Just beware of falling into complacency, it's real easy to just watch TV when you get home, order a pizza and do the minimum at your job for 20 years.  You won't be happy with the result.\n\nIf you are going to be working anyways, then start trading your money for time in intelligent ways.  Take a look at anything you do that you don't enjoy and figure out if you can throw money at it instead of time and what the exchange rate is.\n\nExamples:  \n\n30 minute run to Target instead of Amazon.  Save $5 on the items, spend $1 on gas/mileage, pay rate $2 per hour.\n\n1 Costco trip per month that takes 3 hours.  Save $300/yr on groceries, spend $50/yr on membership, $60/yr on extra driving.  It comes out to $16/mo saved or around $5 per hour.\n\nMove to an apartment 1 block from work.  Cost $500 extra per month.  Commute of 30 mins saved x 2 trips/day x 20 work days per month = 20 hours.  $5 per day of gas/mileage saved x 20 work days = $100.  So cost is $400, time saved is 20 hours, it will cost you $20 per hour for that time.\n\nHire a maid - cost $80.  Would take you 8 hours to do the work yourself, cost $10/hr.\n\nDine out instead of cooking - cost $20, 30 minutes saved.  Cost $40/hr, plus you won't be eating as healthy.\n\nSome back of the napkin math will help you to make smart, deliberate trades that increase the amount of free time you have for doing the things you enjoy.","name":"t1_d47v8zj","subreddit":"leanfire","subreddit_id":"t5_38u7g","created_utc":"2016-06-13 23:27:50","week":24}

Beggars can't be choosers, and all that.\nIf you know what you want your diet to consist of and just want to buy those specific things at the lowest price, then chances are that Costco will usually be your best bet, but the savings will be modest.\n_____\nBig ticket electronics are similar. If you want to buy a new TV this weekend, Costco will probably have the lowest price. If you are willing to put the purchase off for potentially months at a time, then you will find significant savings online.\n_____\nBulk buying non-perishables like paper towels, dish soap, etc is seemingly random as to whether or not Costco or Amazon will be cheaper. They are both competitive, so it is best to check.\n____\nProbably the only area where I have *never* seen Costco's price be beaten is over the counter meds.\n\nEDIT: See the answer /u/palolo_lolo gave below.","name":"t1_d48c0ew","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-14 06:10:34","week":24}
{"id":"d48ckya","author":"MuNot","body":"With the exception of NVidia, Intel, and arguably AMD (Good argument if you think console eSports is going to be big) this is hard to answer. Those three companies are basically the only game in town for hardware.\n\neSports is better modeled by Soccer than baseball or any of the other big American sports. What I mean by that is, ignoring that they're private, if baseball was speculated to rise you'd invest in the MLB. With soccer you have a distributed model of clubs and leagues.  Though this ignores the fact that you are talking about a bunch of different games. If StarCraft takes off again you might not see huge growth in interest on the FPS titles.\n\nComputer peripherals companies (Logitech, Razor, Turtle Beach, Mad Catz, or their parent companies) might be a good play, but I'm not sure of that. Would investing in Wilson be a good play to capture baseball's growth? It'd most likely go up, but might not be close to the optimal play.\n\nWhat about the companies that host the events? Well most are either private or do so as a marketing move, so play that as you will.\n\nYour best moves, if you think eSports is going to explode, is to invest in the game companies that are great positioned to make the big eSports games.  Right now that'd be Blizzard (StarCraft 1 is the father of the movement, Quake is the grandfather), and EA (Biggest gaming company putting out AAA titles, they have the capital to capture a significant portion of the market). Honorary mentions are Valve(DotA, but a private company) and Tencent(LoL) but they are a (gigantic) Chinese company so there's added risk there.\n\nThere is also Amazon(Twitch) and Google(YouTube), but now you're asking if the rise in eSports is enough to significantly move their stock price.\n\nIt might be best to ask yourself how well do you understand the gaming market. Besides grabbing your typical bluechip stocks and index funds, it's investing 101 not to invest in markets you don't understand. Most of the players in this market are large conglomerates, so an increase in eSports might not give you the stock gains you want.","name":"t1_d48ckya","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-14 06:27:08","week":24}

I suggest starting with clothing for your own gender. I look for both men's and women's, but I focus most of my attention on women's because it's what I know best. Also, I find that most thrift stores have a bigger selection of women's clothing than men's. \n\nDo you have any good quality/brand clothing in your closet that you can sell? I would start there to get your feet wet. That way there's no initial trial and error on what to buy, and you'll get a feel of how brands you like sell. Then you can take your pure profits from that and start buying from thrift stores. Don't limit yourself to just the one Goodwill down the road, figure out where every thrift store is in your area and visit them all. After a few trips, you'll know which stores have the best pricing with better finds (higher profits). It's important to have a decent knowledge of what's in style, and especially how to recognize quality. I can see and feel it without even looking at a label almost instantly, because I've learned what wool, cashmere, silk etc looks/feels like. I've been buying the bulk of my clothing, which is fairly high end, from thrift stores for a good 8 years now. But I still routinely see brands I don't recognize. So don't base what you buy solely on the list I just showed you... It's important to look up brands on eBay (sold listings, used) when you see something you don't know.\n\nA tape measure is a must, get the sewing kind on the craft aisle at the store. I have a nice mannequin but rarely use it... I prefer hanging pieces on the wall on a clothes hanger. I have a cheap roll of background paper from Amazon pinned to the wall, to make the background of my photos look nicer. When listing clothing on eBay, measurements are a good idea but good pictures make a major difference. The more the better. Check each item meticulously for flaws (stains, snags, piling, etc) and go overboard on describing its condition. Better to have a buyer get your item and think it's better than they expected rather than the opposite.\n\nI dabble in other items but I find that overall my profit margins are best on clothing. I pay $2-6 per item (sometimes $1, sometimes a little more) and my average selling price is $30. I'm a stay at home mom to one year old twins, typically have 160-180 active listings. Most days I sell at least one item, today I sold 6. I've been able to consistently pay myself $500 biweekly, and I'm finally using what's left of my profits to buy more inventory (no longer using my personal money). Even though I have my hands full with babies draining my energy, I dedicate about 20 hours a week to listing and shipping. I don't count shopping for items, because I enjoy it. I probably spend 10-15 hours a week at thrift stores.","name":"t1_d48ffl9","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-14 08:06:23","week":24}

{"id":"d48rfjh","author":"LzyPenguin","body":"Chase has a 5/24 rule. All of chases own cards are under this rule, the Marriott cards, and United cards are also co branded cards that are under this rule as well. A major mistake most people make thinking chases 5/24 rule only applies to 5 chase cards, but it's any 5 credit cards. Even if you have 3 Amex and 2 citi cards, you are now over 5/24. There is a lot more information in the sidebar about 5/24. \n\nWhy are chase cards so valuable? Well chase cards earn your ultimate rewards (UR). These are (imo) the most valuable points from cards. Some people consider spg points, and a few consider typ the best, but it's all about how you want to use them. My favorite thing about UR is that if something happens in the future and you can't travel and just need cash, UR can be cashed out at 1 cent per point, which is much better than Amex .6 cents per point. If you use the points through chases portal, you get a minimum of 1.25 cents per point, and if you transfer to partners, you can get a much better ratio. I just transferred a bunch of mine to Hyatt and getting 1.8 cents per point, which is still on the low end of the spectrum. Many people can get 2-4 cents per point with redemptions. \n\nOk, so UR are valuable, but what about the cards? Well chase has a few cards to consider, the first is the freedom unlimited. This gives you 1.5 UR per dollar spent. When considering you can pretty easily get 2-3 cents per redemption this is like getting 3-4.5% back on every purchase, which isn't bad. \n\nThe second would be the freedom. This has rotating 5% categories (5 UR per $). Some are easy to MS, like the grocery category currently. This theoretically gives you 10-15% when transferred to partners. \n\nThe third and most important the Chase Sapphire Preferred (CSP). This card gives 1 UR on everything, but does give 2 UR on all travel and dining purchases. This also has 55k sign up bonus, so almost $550 in just cash back, or a lot more when transferred. This card also comes with a TON of benefits, and is one of the more popular cards to book the payable parts of vacation with because you get free trip protection and a bunch of other stuff with it. The MAIN thing about this card is it allows you to transfer your UR to travel partners, like southwest/Hyatt/ihg/and so on. Without this card, you cannot transfer points. Without this card you are stuck getting 1 cent per point UR with the freedom cards. Having this card is what unlocks the possibility of getting the awesome redemptions. \n\nThen the fourth is the ink+. This is the same as the CSP, except it's a business card. This card gives 60k (sometimes 70k UR as a sign up bonus) It doesn't come with as many benefits like travel protection and stuff, but it does allow you to transfer points to travel partners like the CSP. This is one of the most popular ones also because you get 5 UR per dollar at office supply stores. This is cool because you can get Amazon gift cards, Starbucks, and most restaurants, and all will be 5% back. (Again, more like 10-15% when you transfer to travel partners). \n\nThen United, United credit card is great because you can't transfer UR to it. The only points that can be transferred to United is SPG, which is why they are valued by some as the most valuable. But the United is now under chases 5/24 rule, so you cannot get it if you have more than 5 new cards. This is a new policy that just came into effect 5/22/16. (It was already in effect for chases own cards, but just hit this and all the Marriott cards on that date). United points are great because it's one of the best ways to fly to Europe for a low amount of points, and very low fees. \n\nIf you start with cards like discover it or other credit cards, these will be on your record and will take one of the 5/24 slots for 2 years. Which just takes one of the slots that you could be getting a much much more valuable chase card. If you don't plan on churning for 2 years then definitely get some cards like that to build your credit, but if you don't plan on waiting 2 years, be very careful with your first 5. After than you can go crazy. \n\nAny other questions let me know. ","name":"t1_d48rfjh","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-14 16:27:20","week":24}

YOu sell at their platform or go work at the McDonalds ecommerce. Its silly to lay over and accept rather than fight for something better.  I guess people should have never created factory unions (I dont care for them now) and just continued to accept the \"Industry standards.\"  \n\nEbay having this policy won't kill ebay, not even close Amazon has already started that snowball and its not because of their return policy, but I do believe 3 days is to early.  The majority of people do not buy items because of a return policy.  But I will say that the fear of returns has produced higher quality items that are bought.\n\nWe all know the issue with the buyer vs seller word, but the real problem is I havent seen anything really change for the seller since ive been around 10 years.  So people have laid over and accepted that \"its part of business\".  What should be part of business is that I have the option to decline business.  Yes I use their platform but let it hit my metrics, but not risk booting me off ebay/amazon.  Change that first, then implement someone elses idea about having a stat that people can look at that determines the number of return requests vs the number of items they have bought. And if ebay is concerned about low feedback buyers not being able to buy, then implement a discount to selling an item to someone with low rank.  But overall the seller should have more control over who they sell to.  Its not like poeple are going to suddenly reject all sales, people in ecommerce want to resell their inventory as fast as possible but let us have more control on that.","name":"t1_d48trag","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-14 17:19:24","week":24}

The problem I've found with companies is they fail to communicate changes properly, resulting in conflicting info on different portions of the company's domains and team members. \n\nFor instance, when I worked at Amazon our documentation said every call about X topic had to be transferred to a given specialty team. After a while that was changed and we were informed by the specialty team about this instead of getting that info beforehand (meaning we ended up trying to transfer hundreds of calls to them = wasted time).\n\nNow don't get me wrong, Amazon was pretty good at communicating these changes via alerts and this was something that somehow slipped in. We'd normally get alerts stating policies or procedures have changed in a timely manner.\n\nIf you go for something like this, aim it at companies that don't have a pipeline like Amazon does for procedures. Make it so you can integrate it to their platforms and every change is alerted to the relevant team if not everyone for clarity. \n\nYour best client will be: companies expanding and in need of this pipeline to standarize procedures and communicate them properly.

Its more for letting you know when its trying to connect to bluetooth, bluetooth connected(it beeps when connected and when you disconnect), it displays battery life, and it stores all the UPC codes you scan.

You might want to add new streams of revenue as some do not perform as well or are no longer available.\nFor example I have an affiliate site which sell a very niche product. Sellers on Amazon have a little stock and don't necessarily renew it after it is over. Therefore, I have to find new products to advertise and write about them.

I use it for voice, text, and data. The data can get expensive, so I just keep data turned off on my phone and use the internet when I get on a wifi connection. \nIt's a prepaid service with no monthly minimum.\nWhen I got it last month, TruPhone was $29.99 for the sim, but $15 of that is a credit for service (I'm not sure if it has changed price). Google Voice and Google Hangouts Dialer are a free download and free to use as a service. TruPhone uses the T-Mobile network (at least here in So Cal and the Bullhead City, AZ area). On TruPhone, incoming calls and texts are free, outgoing calls are 9 cents a minute, outgoing texts are 9 cents each, and data is 9 cents a MB. But, if you have access to wifi, you can use Google Voice for outgoing calls and texts for free.\nI've had the plan for about a month and a half and have spent about 81 cents so far.\nI bought a brand new unlocked Moto E from Motorola, through Amazon, with a list price of around $99. When I went to pay at checkout, I was asked if I wanted to sign up for an Amazon Credit Card and receive a $60 discount on my purchase, so I did. My phone ended up costing me around $40.","name":"t1_d4a3mbn","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-15 15:01:49","week":24}

When it comes to investment focus, music/music related is not really even on the shopping list, if we are being honest. I think ultimately what the music industry needs is to break away from the traditional label structure and politics and bring it back towards the music rather than creating celebs and personas first. \n\nI mean, look at what Fugazi created and the success that they had with Dischord records, all while keeping to their rules and ethics. They showed that one could exist outside the traditional industry and still do quite well. I've seen a lot of concerts over the years, but the main note that I have is that I'm happy I got to see Fugazi a few times. Tremendous performances and the ticket price was $5. Now a days, if you want to see a musician, you are paying a fucking fortune (I don't even go anymore, really; it's just ridiculous how much concerts are - I know Fugazi charging a few bucks is a unique instance, but concert tickets in general have gone up astronomically over the years.)\n\nI'm surprised that Amazon has not started music self-publishing and allowed people to bypass the traditional process and get their music out to a very large audience.

You can do a review blog and do affiliate marketing that way, you can do an Amazon affiliate site just posting products, you can do a Top 10 review site, etc. Many options.

{"id":"d4ag15a","author":"FEInternational","body":"Hi there, answers to your questions are below!\n\n1. I would suggest focusing in on one specific niche, especially if you are just starting out. Doing so will allow you differentiate yourself from the rest of of the sites out there that cover a broad niche. Also, by focusing on just one niche you can become an authority a lot easier which will allow you gain traction in the market.\n\n2. There are already a ton of websites out there that cover the popular products. You would probably be better off focusing on a smaller, less known, product category. Pick a category that no one has really covered yet and produce as much content around that one category. You can always expand into more product categories later down the road, but it is important to gain initial traction in the market by being unique.\n\n3. You won't \"stand out\" by doing this but this will encourage people that go to your site for one thing to continue looking at other pages on your site which could lead to more sales. However, I would still recommend staying within your specific niche.\n\n4. If it is now on Amazon you could check if they have an affiliate program through other affiliate sites such as shareasale, cj.com, or impact radius. If you still can find an affiliate program for their product then you might be out of luck in terms of being an affiliate. However, I would still email the owner and see if there is a possibility of working out a deal with them. \n\nI hope this helps and if you have any other questions feel free to ask!","name":"t1_d4ag15a","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-15 19:40:34","week":24}

{"id":"d4aq075","author":"Mikazah","body":"To anyone who is interested:\n\n&gt; Part 2: The Next 7 days \nSurveys: In the mobile phase of this study (starting tomorrow), you will be asked to complete 6 surveys each day (delivered via text message) at random times between the hours of 8:00am - 10:00pm. Tapping the link in each text message will send you to a website (Qualtrics) containing a short survey (that should take 1 minute or less to complete). All items contained in these short surveys can be answered conveniently by just tapping on your answer choices. \n\n&gt; Daily Tip Messages: In addition to the 6 daily surveys described above, you will receive 3 \"Daily Tip\" messages each day (accessed by clicking on a link delivered to you via text message) during Part 2. Tapping the link in each of these text messages will send you to a website (Qualtrics) containing a short message for you to read. These \"Daily Tip\" messages will be sent to you at 8:00am, 12:00pm and 6:00pm during Part 2. \n\n&gt; Part 3: Follow-Up Survey on Day 9 \nFinally, you will receive one (very brief) final follow-up survey via text message at 9:00am on Day 9 of the study. \n\n&gt; MOBILE PHASE RULES: \nPlease take a moment to review the following four rules for completing the Mobile Phase of this study: \n  \n&gt; RULE 1: Safety first! If responding would be dangerous for you or anyone else (for instance, if you are driving a car), wait until it is safe to respond. This rule takes precedence over all others. \n  \n&gt; RULE 2: Maximize the time we can notify you. The daily study window is from 8:00am to 10:00pm. Please make sure to have your smartphone turned on at all times. If you do not want to disturb others, consider setting your phone to vibrate rather than turning it off completely. Also, please make sure to have your smartphone with you at all times, and that it is properly charged to last throughout the whole day. \n  \n&gt; RULE 3: Respond as soon as possible. Ideally, please respond the instant you receive the notification or within the first few minutes. In cases where immediate responses are just not possible, please respond as quickly as you can. During Part 2, each survey link will remain active for one hour before it gets deactivated. The survey sent during Phase 3 will remain active for 24 hours.  However, try your best to minimize the number of times you delay responding to the signals. \n  \n&gt; RULE 4: Do your best to report your experience at the moment you received the notification. If there’s a delay between when you’re notified and when you’re able to respond, please report on what you were experiencing at the time when you received the notification (see the time stamp in the text message), not at the time you are actually able to respond. Try taking a mental snapshot of your experience when you receive a notification so you can report it as accurately as possible. \n\n&gt; Reminder About Compensation: \nIf you complete at least 80% of the daily study surveys sent to you during Part 2 of this study, you will be compensated with a $15.00 Amazon.com Gift Card*  (sent to you via email within 5 business days of study completion). This means that you must respond to at least 33 out of the total 42 surveys that will be sent to you (via text message) over the next week in order to receive a $15.00 Amazon.com gift card. \n  \n&gt; If you respond to less than 33 surveys during this phase of the study, you will still remain eligible to win a bonus $200 cash prize. As a reminder, the more study surveys you complete, the more chances you will have to win the $200 bonus prize! Specifically, in addition to the 10 raffle entries you have already earned by completing Part 1 of the study, you will receive one additional raffle entry per survey completed during Part 2 of this study (up to 42 additional chances to win). Completing Part 3 of this study will earn you an additional 5 raffle entries. \n\n&gt; Thus, if you complete all study surveys in Parts 2 and 3 of this study, you will receive a payment of $15.00 (in the form of an Amazon.com gift card) and will be given 57 chances to win an additional $200.00 cash prize. \n\n(Part 1 was just a long survey and some mobile phone verification).","name":"t1_d4aq075","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-15 23:04:41","week":24}

Bookstore, gas and grocery purchases is a good amount of where my spending goes (Amazon is a bookstore, btw), so this Sallie Mae BarclayCard is really great for me.  Find a card that offers something like this.\n\nSecond, the way to stay out of the debt trap is to use your credit card like a checking account.  Literally, track each purchase and only make it if you have the amount in your checking account to pay it off the second you make the purchase.  I use my accounting software (GNUCash) this way.  In my checking account I have a funds transfer for each CC and I have for the total amount owed.  What this shows is an instantaneous true amount of funds I have available (checking account with all outstanding checks, less CC accounts).  I also have all my upcoming bills already scheduled with their normal or \"high watermark\" amount so I can look ahead and see if I'll be running low and shouldn't make a purchase.  I have never paid interest on a CC in my life.\n\nBack to your original question, new credit card deals come out all the time.  Don't over-apply for them, and don't ever close your first few accounts (they look at the average age of your accounts when generating your credit score), but find ones that fit what you need.

{"id":"d4b0rxd","author":"computersaregreater","body":"I used to be in the same boat. I was hired by a large company as a full fledged engineer before I graduated. After that company dried up, I had a couple of lost opportunities because of rigid hiring managers refusing to believe that I had designed key technology with just a lowly high school diploma. \n\nI also tried going back to schools, but wound up spending a lot of money and hitting that wall where you realize that the school is just a business and not really interested in providing you an education. \n\nMy advice is this: forget school, teach yourself. Maybe get a \"course guide\" to help you get an idea of all of the topics, but to be honest at this point, the internet holds all of the information you'll ever need in order to learn the subject really well. It even likely has problems posted, or at the very least, Amazon will have the course books you'll need. Buy them, read them, learn them , all on your own. \n\nNow here's the kicker...learn to program. Literally everything is done on computers nowadays, so you'll need to know that at the very least in order to begin making calculators for atmospheric phenomena (I ended up doing this essentially while I was making an atmospheric lensing tool for a solar company). \n\nOnce you have these skills, just start cranking out spreadsheets, modules, and small programs onto a small blog or wordpress site, so you can showcase your work. With that portfolio, start looking for atmospheric work, but instead of looking to hire from within, try approaching companies you'd like to work for as an outside consultant. Show them your work, and you'll be surprised.\n\nExpect a LOT of places to tell you no, but that's normal and that's business. In reality nowadays, NOBODY cares about education for subcontractors or outside contractors. They're only concern is \"can you do this?\" and if you have a little blog full of tools showing you can, that's more valuable than any degree. \n\nIn the end, you'll spend only a few hundred bucks, still learn the material, and be just as competitive as the next guy who's in crippling debt.

{"id":"d4b2n05","author":"decima205","body":"I buy all of my textbooks as ebooks. If it's not available as an ebook, I get a super dirt cheap used copy off Amazon or something, undo the binding, and scan it to a PDF (my college print center was able to do this for a very low fee; you can also scan it yourself with a high-speed document scanner). For notes, I either took them directly on my laptop (for humanities/social sciences classes) or on a notebook that I then scanned into my computer. The only paper I ever carried was that one spiral notebook (for math classes; $1 each at the bookstore), and at the end of the semester I just tossed it.  For handouts that professors gave, I would snap a photo with my phone (Genius Scan is the app I use) as soon as class was over, upload it into my Google Drive, and then immediately toss the papers. Everything is scanned, so if I need to use them again later, they're in my Google Drive (labelled in folders by class and chapter/lecture date). You'll have to invest in a portable scanner; they're $150 but it's usable for years so I found it a great investment.\n\nIt was really hard to make the change originally; I was a Moleskine notebook lover, had used a paper planner since I was 8 years old, and had literally 5 bookshelves full of books. I got rid of all of those by going paperless. The books, since I didn't want to rebuy them on Amazon, I undid the binding and scanned. Most of them were paperbacks anyways, so it was a fast process. Literally set it in the scanner, and then I can do homework or leave or room or whatever I want to do while it scans.","name":"t1_d4b2n05","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-16 04:19:25","week":24}

{"id":"d4b411h","author":"Jancy52","body":"Grow your own!  you can grow spices in a container (in limited space for little cost other than initial set up.)   I usually harvest seeds from grocery produce  but this year I also bought seeds from a collection:  I bought a premixed collection of  \"12 common kitchen herbs\"  several months ago on Amazon and I still keep harvesting and they keep growing.  I bought \"HERB SEEDS AMERICAN GROWN Variety Packets Fresh Germinate-Ready Complete Heirloom Seed Herb Kit For Planting Your Own Perennial Organic Herb Garden - Indoor Potted or Open Herb Garden Beds. NON GMO \"  Note to moderator: I am not selling anything, just advising the OP of what a good deal it is to buy seeds in a combo pack. \n  This evening I harvested basil, savory, cilantro, dill and thyme.  I still have plenty more growing in the garden, but only took what I needed for my chicken dinner and mashed potatoes for tonight,  and then for our potato soup and  ground chicken sandwiches tomorrow.   Any excess herbs gets put into the dehydrator and when dried I grind it up and put into pretty labeled jars in my kitchen for later use.  I also buy green onion, cut off the bulbs and restart them in the garden bed until it is full of green onion which I trim as needed, never displacing or removing the bulbs until end of season after the first winter frost.   I also restart carrots and celery and radish.  \nI had a 10 pound sack of potato in the spring and didn't use all of them so I ended up with several growing eyes which I quartered and restarted in my garden.  My potatoes are going crazy in the yard! I grow potatoes in a rusty old garden fence formed into a circular bin with straw and potting soil  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cIyxM2X.jpg)   \n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/FgoXOuc.jpg)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/pPSeZQg.jpg)\n\nWhat spices do you like?   Every region in this country has their own ideas based on cultural dishes , so dig in and just explore! IF you cook a lot of mexican be sure to stock up on fresh cilantro and chilli powder.  All of us were NOOBs at one time. \n \n   Don't be a boring plain salt and pepper kind of person... explore your options.  It's knowing when to add herbs and spices that makes all the difference when you cook... you can cook the life out of the flavors if adding too soon because some herbs and spice take time to develop.  With herbs less is often more (using less gains you more flavor than overwhelming the dish with too much.)  Some spices are overwhelmed if you dilute them with too much fluid and some seem to take on a life of their own when cooked!  I've never had any luck with Oyster sauce in my Asian cooking,but fermented fish oil does seem to work for me, especially that Korean fish oil stuff.   Dongwong's powerful stuff and made with fish and sunflower seed oil.  \n \n  Ever have left over spaghetti that was better the second time around?   That's an example of merging flavors developing with time.  I've had rotisserie chicken that smelled great but had almost no flavor because they seasoned it too soon at the wrong time and baked the life out of it.\n     \nDon't forget about fragrances and  aroma's like Almond oils, and vanilla extract and others.    I love the smell of sugar cookies fresh from the oven!  I keep a bottle of peppermint oil in my kitchen for use when I want to freshen up from any bad smells in the kitchen...  i keep a kettle dedicated to boiling water with peppermint oil on the stove. \n\n   I use an  almond oil moisturizing food grade oil on my dogs to oil their skin after their baths (they smell great for days after their baths.)  I also use the almond oil on my own skin as this food grade oil is safer to use than any commercially packaged skin lotion.    \n\n Experiment and learn what you love to taste and smell.  Rosemary is great with chicken as well as is savory.   My sons love potatoes fried with a special custom Greek dill seasoning my Ex found in a greek restaurant for sale in Huntsville, Alabama!  WE keep a couple jars in stock at all times just for them.     I keep onion and garlic powder available as well as the real onions and garlic in my kitchen (one does NOT replace the other!)   I make ginger/lemon salt and infuse butter with fresh roasted garlic to have on hand when making garlic bread with an italian meal.  I love to experiment and have had plenty of really awful failures in my time, but WTF just learn what each spice and herb tastes like so you can use what you want to suit your own personal tastes!  There are no hard and fast rules....  Don' forget there are plenty of sauces that  also have their own special blends and  tastes you should also invest in - I like Korean fish sauces and Cock Sauce in place of Salsa, and often use Balsamic Vinegar in place of white vinegar with salad vinaigrettes...  and have slowly learned to eat sweet chilli sauce on my tacos instead of taco seasonings.(which you can also  make at home yourself)  \n\n    There are really no hard and fast rules... though cinnamon on fish is not a favorite - yuck!     Think of spices in terms of heat and herbs in terms of flavor.    You can make your own sea salt flavors easily by combining any special herb treatment with kosher salt for use as a standard salt in your own kitchen.... so why be a common place or normal cook?  Why not learn why some of us are dedicated foodies enjoying a variety of flavors  and really learn what each spice actually tastes like raw! \nI keep turmeric, cumin, dehydrated lemongrass (finely chopped) and minced dehydrated sweet bell peppers in jars as well, but buy those at speciality markets as I can't find them in the supermarket!  I roast and cook garlic for infusing with real butter for use on fish and hard bread.     \nI also harvest pecans from my tree, mince the meat of the nut for use over muffins, mixed with brown sugar or sugar in the raw and cinnamon.   \nEach cook will develop their own specialities, so enjoy yourself.  I puree a paste out of fresh bell peppers and dehydrate it, storing it in a air tight jar for use in my kitchen when I want the sweet flavors of bell peppers on my morning eggs... it's a bit of trouble but tastes fantastic, as does spicy \"hamburger jerky\" on eggs.    I also get a supply of Kefir lime leaves from a cousin in the LA area each summer when she is thinning out her miniature Kefir  tree in July.     I dry the leaves and either freeze them or  grind them down for use in dishes.  She also provides me with  lemongrass and bay leaves from her garden and sends me an annual supply for which I send back to her any dehydrated herbs she likes that I grow.    Having your own herbs and fresh veggies is almost decadent in this fast food world,  and world of box meals and poor cooking skills.  It is almost too costly to buy them fresh, but give it a try, your tastebuds will thank you.   The first time you can put a sprig of mint you grew yourself into a cold glass of tea you'll soon understand why I am suggesting you grow your own.   Cooking and gardening go hand in hand. \n\nDon't bother buying a collection of prepackaged dried spices in a packaged group - they are usually old and lifeless.   IF you can get green herbs do so!  The difference between fresh green herbs and the old packaged stuff is like night and day.    It only  takes awhile to develop an educated palate.  So Have fun exploring!      \n  \n  http://www.spicesinc.com/p-477-top-25-spices-every-kitchen-must-have.aspx\n     ","name":"t1_d4b411h","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-16 04:57:25","week":24}
{"id":"d4b4hlk","author":"mechiah","body":"I just ended nine years of being motorcycle only. New job required a car. Great sadness. \n\n\n/u/bitter_hag had great points and I agree with them. \n\nA few other things: \n\n* Location matters. I live in South Louisiana, where there were typically only three days a year I shouldn't ride due to icy conditions. Rain is solved by a cheap rain suit, an expensive Kriega water proof backpack, and leaving a change of clothes at work just in case. \n* Not owning a car isn't so inconvenient for hauling. My wife and I vacationed in rentals. Moving across town? U-Haul is $40/ day. Need to bring lumber home? Home depot rents work trucks for $20. Amazon prime helps. Still come out way ahead financially. \n* The rain, while surmountable, takes a measure of fortitude. There will be days where you're sick of packing your rain gear just in case. There will be days where you get up in the morning, see it pouring, and look at putting in your rain suit like it is just SUCH a drag. Hell, sometimes your riding jacket will get to you. \n* On that jacket... factor that gear into your initial financial calculations. Do ride in a real jacket, helmet, and gloves. Preferably riding boots and pants as well. $400 full face helmets are not proven to to do much more than $100 full face helmets other than cost $300 more. Still, full face is s must. I'll let you Google impact rates on different parts of the head and let you see. Don't lose your face for fashion, is a line I like. Ankle protection is oft overlooked. A simple loss of balance in the driveway can be a life altering injury if you've got 400 lbs plus pivoting on your ankle. \n\nAnyway, a budget for reasonable entry level gear, using known name brands from Amazon or Revzilla:\n\n* Helmet $100\n* Jacket $150, $100 for an Icon on clearance maybe\n* Gloves $30\n* Boots $100 - $150 higher for boots that can secretly double for casual/work shoes. \n* Rainsuit $60 for a crummy, sweaty one. $40 more to cover your gloves and boots. \n* Waterproof backpack or luggage: $150\n* Jeans whatever, though I do recommend upgrading to real riding jeans when convenient. \n\nSizing: consider having enough room under your riding jacket for winter layers, and enough room under your rainsuit for those layers and your jacket. \n\nI ride with two pairs of pants on in the winter. Most dudes do thermals under they pants, but I find that dumb. Getting to work, stripping off pants and thermals, then putting pants back on, is a chore. Instead, I just put old fat jeans on over the pants I want to wear. \n\nBefore I upgraded to waterproof backpack, I kept my important papers (wallet, registration, insurance) in Ziploc bags in my backpack, and would wear my pack under my rain suit. That sucked. \n\nInsurance: get quotes before you spend a dime on even your riding course. In Louisiana, at 28, I spent $300/ year for comprehensive and medical. Nuts, right? **However**, when I lived in Quebec, it was $1100, and you're not even allowed to ride November through May. Be prepared. \n\nEdit: that sounded negative at times, as I was trying to prepare you for real world pains. Sometimes getting geared up in the morning is a chore, true. But after a crummy day at work, nothing made me happier than knowing I was gonna have a bitchin ride home. \n","name":"t1_d4b4hlk","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-16 05:10:13","week":24}

It doesn't take much time and if you have the right tools, it's pretty easy. A heat gun or hair dryer will help a ton, heat up the label/sticker and it should come off if you pull slowly. The residue left behind can be taken off with zippo lighter fluid. It's naptha which is a solvent that evaporates quickly and doesn't usually leave behind any stains. If it doesn't have a bar code on it, I don't think Amazon requires the removal, but it will impact the condition of the book to have a bunch of old stickers and stuff stuck on it still. \n\nI have sold some textbooks and only been burned by one, but it can happen at any time. BSR only shows how well it's sold up until this day, and pricing is just what's up for sale at that moment.

I took it to several places to get an estimate on the repairs and they all come out to around $600-$800. \n\nIf you have someone handy in your family, see if you can get one of them to fix it. Thankfully, the places that gave me an estimate also told me exactly what was wrong and what needed replacement. I spent a couple hours on the internet learning how to remove and replace the exact broken part on my car model, less than $300 on all the tools and the parts on Amazon, and a few hours later I had repaired the AC myself. Still works flawlessly (actually, better than before it went out).\n\nI have to admit that I'm a little bit on the handy side. I change my oil, brakes, rotors, and other routine maintenance stuff on my own. However, repairing the AC was the biggest car repair project I did and it was a great learning experience. I now not only know how to repair the AC and know how it works, I have a better understanding of how to troubleshoot some car issues. And, I still have the tools required to fix an AC system in case something happens again later or a friend needs help.\n\nPerhaps there's someone in your family or a friend who can help with that if you don't feel comfortable doing it.","name":"t1_d4br34b","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-16 18:19:28","week":24}

{"id":"d4brzp2","author":"myrpfaccount","body":"&gt;When she checks my account history she informs me that there were some purchases made on Amazon with my old credit card before I remembered to switch my payment method (which should not have done anything if the credit line was closed as I believed it was).\n\nThis is your problem. That's not how credit cards work. If you make a charge on them shortly after being closed, they open the credit line back up. This debt is entirely valid and 100% your fault.\n\n&gt;When I ask how either of those courses of action will affect my credit she replies “I don’t know I’m not your credit advisor”\n\nGood - any advice someone in collections gives you is manipulation. She was honest and is actually being one of the good guys on that side.\n\n&gt;To me, the whole point of a credit score is to show whether you can be trusted to borrow and return money, which I can be.\n\nIn the eyes of a lender, you can't. You couldn't even be trusted to stop using a card you claimed you wanted to close.\n\nYou screwed up here - the rules are confusing, but you did agree to them. Write to (don't call) the collections people and ask for a debt validation. They need to prove they have their ducks in a row for you to actually owe them. Tell them the account is \"disputed\" and they should report it to the credit reporting agencies as such.\n\nOnce they've validated the debt to you (which is simple - they say who you are, what you owe, and to whom), see if you can negotiate a \"pay for delete\". You might even be able to get them to accept either a fraction of what they're asking, even down to the original balance. If you can negotiate a pay for delete (which they don't have to give), make sure they send you that offer in writing before you pay them. This will remove the negative remark from your credit report and your score will recover immediately. If you can't negotiate it, at least try to negotiate a settlement (where you pay a fraction of what you owe them in exchange for them reporting the account as paid) so you don't have to pay all $130. Get everything in writing.\n\nIf you can't negotiate a pay for delete, this will sit on your credit report for 7 years. \n\nWhether you like it or not, the creditor did try to contact you to figure out what was going on. Repeatedly. You stonewalled them and then eventually ignored them. Doesn't sound like someone I want to lend money to.","name":"t1_d4brzp2","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-16 18:38:13","week":24}

{"id":"d4c5tg6","author":"oceanalwayswins","body":"Ugh, I read your story about selling the iPhone and realized how easily that could happen to anyone, or to me. And the lady who bought the Precious Moments figurines is just a shitty person, like a small percentage of buyers out there. \n\nI can also relate to your situation - I have 13 month old twins and stopped working when they were born. Having two kids, regardless of them being twins or not is rough. That piled in with trying to make a legitimate living on eBay can make life stressful at times. About two months ago I sold a lady two high end blazers. I had both listed separately for like $60 each, and they weren't moving. She asked if she could buy both for a discount... normally I stray away from that, but she was very polite and I rolled with it. Somehow my eBay settings were set to accept returns automatically, and she requested a return on the first blazer. Claimed the sleeves had been altered, and that it had stray messy stitching all along the inside. I know that wasn't true, and the pictures she included did not match the exact same locations of the pictures I posted. But the return was already accepted. I didn't feel like eating another $12 to get the blazer back, so I told her to keep it. Then I shit you not, an hour later she does it the second time. Claims its stained and includes a picture, and I forgot to turn off the auto accept for returns. I nearly threw a bitch fit. If it weren't for my family desperately needing the supplementary income I make on eBay, I would have quit right then and there. But then I cooled off and took a deep look at what it is that I'm doing, and the profit margins I have / how much more I could be making if I keep selling.\n\nI'm not sure where you get your inventory, what kind of items you mostly sell, or how many listings/sales you get a month. I do mostly clothing and probably pay $3-4 on average for my items, and sell them for an average of $30. So my profit margins are pretty high, and my investments are low. Even on the two blazers, even with the free shipping I only lost a total of $22. I've had a handful of other returns, but that has been the only one I've had a bad experience with. \n\nI never go to the store for supplies, unless I'm out of bubble wrap and need some ASAP, which has only happened twice. I order all of my padded mailers, bubble wrap, etc. on Amazon. The bubble wrap is actually like $1-2 cheaper on Amazon, and the padded mailers to use for first class mail are too because I get them in bulk. I like to physically drive to the post office after my husband gets home from work, because it's my time to get out of the house alone for a few minutes. But you can schedule a free pick up the night before, and the mail man will pick them up from your front door. Or you could have all of your items packed up ready to go the night before, and have your husband drop them off the next day on his way to/from work.\n\nUltimately you've gotta do what's best for you and your family.

{"id":"d4ci53e","author":"Cavball9","body":"I don't mind at all.  When I first started investing, the most significant mistake I made was trusting everything my father told me, most of which came from his FA.  I don't want to paint him as a terrible investor, rather one who throws money away while making relatively smart investments.  He's a guy who probably sees 6% returns when he could be easily seeing 8%.  He has a nice portfolio and will retire pretty wealthy, but I shudder to think of what he could have if he invested more efficiently.  It cost me thousands because I trusted his recommendation of the FA he used through our family business and it cost me thousands of dollars by not verifying his advice/guidance with other sources.  He put me in some things that made him a lot of money and me average money.  Shame on me.\n  \n  \nMistake number 2 was waiting too long to track all of my finances - income, expenses, investments, savings, budgets, etc.  It's scary as hell when you set up your first real budget and start discovering how much money you waste every month/quarter/year.  I accumulated needless debt and was wasting so much money on beer (most of which could be argued was wise investing!), food and crap I didn't need &amp; couldn't afford.  I think I was aware of what I was doing, but I subconsciously convinced myself things would change.  The problem is, things don't change if you don't change.   If you're not tracking all of your finances already, that should be your first order of business.  Lay everything out and start organizing it.  If you're spreadsheet savvy, use it.  Some other easy options are mint.com, ynab.com, or Quicken.  Whichever you decide on, do it right from the get-go and keep up with it.  Prioritize your debt - highest first - and start paying that down.  You shouldn't be investing if you have credit card or similar debts.  Low-rate mortgage/auto loans are fine.  No reason other than liquidity to pay those down vs. investing.  At your age, you can either generate or sacrifice exponential future wealth.  Similar to some sage advice I once received about planting trees, \"The ideal time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.\"  Investing long-term is the same idea.  Plant the seed and watch it grow.\n  \n  \nMistake #3 was trying to set the world/markets on fire.  I was trading on emotion and thinking I could find the next AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, etc.  Nothing wrong with taking some risks, but when you start letting emotion drive the car, you're going to lose more often than you win.  Fortunately, I lost money I could afford to lose.  It was my \"fun money\" account - I gambled on some extremely risky stocks and most did what extremely risky stocks do - they tanked.  I would hold off on this sort of thing until you have spent a significant amount of time learning about the intricacies of economics, the markets, valuation, etc.  Even then, make sure you're only using some fun money to play these sorts of deals.\n  \n  \nThe best advice I was ever given was from a friend's father who was running a parent company which owned a handful of multi-million dollar businesses.  He was about 50 and likely carried a net worth around $5-10MM, though you would never know from speaking with him.  I was discussing some investing topics with him while having a beverage or two - picking his brain and whatnot.  I had mentioned that I was beating myself up at the time because I had little-to-no liquid assets at the time and I wanted to buy a boatload of auto and bank stocks (think late 2000s).  He smirked and said, \"You know, that's funny.  I just dropped $5k in about a dozen bank and auto stocks this week!\"  He went on to give me his investing and business philosophy - don't set the world on fire, don't reinvent the wheel.  For every Amazon and Google, there are thousands of rocks at the bottom of the ocean.  Quit trying to BEAT the market and BE the market.  Minimize expenses and play the market returns while saving your risk for reputable companies at a discount.\"","name":"t1_d4ci53e","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-17 04:21:03","week":24}

I'd just stand over the sink in the bathroom and it would take me maybe 5 minutes, put a towel down in the sink.

{"id":"d4d0dgb","author":"outofbandii","body":"cinebardfilms.com\n\nI love the name!\n\nI think you're trying to address two audiences with one message, wedding video and commercial video. What's the 80-20 there, does one bring in significantly more revenue than the other? I'd be considering doubling down and specialising in one or the other. One issue there is that weddings are (hopefully) a one-time thing, whereas if you get a business as a client you could turn that into recurring revenue. Maybe start with a loss-leader \"30 second YouTube ad\" offer to get them on board and offer upsells down the line. I'd also be doing a lot of reading about the video aspect of content marketing with the goal of becoming known as an expert in that area, helping businesses to increas sales.\n\nIf sticking with the two audiences, consider removing the large slider (aside: it switches sides way too fast), and maybe putting up two sections there, one \"For businesses who want to use video to increase sales\" and another \"For couples looking for a cinematic wedding video\" (or good versions of something along those lines!)\n\nThe more I look at the site, the more I think you need to hit each audience with the thing it's looking for rather than mixing it all up. Make a customer avatar (sometimes known as a \"buyer persona\", horrible name) for each type of ideal client and figure out what their biggest problems that you can solve are (meta comment: I'm doing just that by asking small business owners what online marketing problems they have).\n\nYou mentioned wanting to see more new client contacts. One thing that stands out because of its omission, is a strong Call to Action. This is where you have a big button that contrasts against the rest of the site design and demands attention from the viewer. Check out the Add to Cart button on Amazon or other ecommerce sites. Put a big orange \"[HIRE US]\" button near the top and bottom of each page. \n\nOr go with the lead generation option and make a free give-away as an email opt-in incentive that helps them solve a problem that they have. E.g. for your wedding customers \"Essential Guide to Hiring Wedding Videographers\" where you call out many of the issues and mistakes that people make. You should do a couple of blog posts like this too - look up questions that couples have about wedding videography, and write a few \"How to X\" posts on the blog addressing that.\n\nYour site speed - specifically the time to first byte - totally sucks, and I'm in no way surprised when I see that you're on Bluehost. This is usually bad hosting or a sign that you need caching enabled. I'd set up a caching plugin first, but if you were my client I'd definitely be moving you to another (non-EIG) hosting company.\n\nYour permalink settings seem to be right, but I see some links on your homepage (above the Latest from Blog) that look like this, so I'd change those for SEO &amp; speed reasons cinebardfilms.com/?page_id=891\n\nSEO in general is pretty good (Yoast SEO plugin tends to take care of a lot of details out of the box so good to see you're using that).\n\nChange the Gmail address to one on your own domain to look just a little bit more professional again, it's easy to set up a forwarder from e.g. hello@example.com to forward to your Gmail.\n\nI like your About page, very friendly. How about putting a video in there where you introduce yourselves and show some clips of work you've done?\n\nI hope that helps you guys out :)","name":"t1_d4d0dgb","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-06-17 15:54:41","week":24}

I was skeptical that a such a large charge would go through, but by /u/cyclostationary's advice, I called them. Five employees and half an hour later, I got to a senior analyst who said I could do it(!) if I pre-pay, and she set the payment up.\n\nCouple of days later, I needed to change the bank account for the payment, but I couldn't do that online, was told to cancel and set up the transaction again (by a chat rep), called again when I couldn't do that either, only then to be told that it wasn't possible since the charge wasn't made yet, but the system would still let me make the charge. I pushed to have someone set up the payment again, but they said it wasn't necessary. *Ok then*\n\nDeclined - had to call again, pushed for setting up the payment again, only for them to not do that and told to do the same thing after 24 hours - aaand declined again.

{"id":"d4dfk35","author":"cheddarben","body":"It is not even close to GoPro or Fit Bit in terms of similarity.\n\nWhat is the barrier of entry to making video cameras strapped to your head? What is the barrier to entry to making a somewhat accurate heart rate monitor that integrates to a phone?\n\nI am guessing a semi-good DIY guy could make these things with fairly small overhead. I think any large sized technology or sports company could come in and provide similar services at prices that could put fitbit or GoPro out of business. \n\nA time period of crazy oil prices AND government bailouts of auto companies from the 2008-2012 area created an environment ripe for disruption. Add a persistent genius to the mix who doesn't give a shit about money - and there you have Tesla. The barrier to entry into car manufacturing is no small feat AND until Elon, the biggies have been pretty successful at crushing them.\n\nOK... now, what is the barrier to entry of creating a car company? Beyond that, how about penetrating the auto market? How about changing how vehicles are sold? How about changing the power on which vehicles operate and the battery industry? How about having the market edge during a time when several countries are starting to make electric vehicle commitments? How about building a nation wide charging infrastructure far before it's necessity (https://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger)? How about that the Nissan Leaf electric orders are down dramatically and some attribute it to TSLA? How about a company that has a reservation list of over 350,000 when Fords total units sold last year was about 3,000,000? Over 10% of the sales... for an imaginary product that doesn't even exist yet. \n\nI think a lot of the neigh sayers are a bit premature or don't understand the potential upside. And yeah, there are some ginormous risks.\n\nShit, I live in North Dakota and KNOW, for a fact,  there are more charging stations in my state than Teslas. That is going to change very soon, though. I saw another person on this sub saying that maybe TSLA is just paying the innovation tax, and that might actually be so - but I don't see any other company with a nationwide infrastructure currently in place to support charging the way they have. And if they fully disrupt the selling model (which they have been pretty fucking good at so far) by selling in Nordstroms or whatever store, shit could get real real for them, real quick.\n\nElon is swinging for a homerun, but anybody that swings big can also miss big. And part of the allure AND a huge part of the risk of putting a bit of money here is that he isn't even really swinging for profit or investment return.... he is swinging for the technology. Making money is merely a function of continuing to support a stock price so they can raise more money, if needed. If it were up to him, I don't think he would have never gone public to begin with. He needed money though.\n\nThe story here, IMO, is that there is this super genius who sleeps at the end of his production line and is single-mindedly (well, tri-mindedly focused) on revolutionizing the world. \n\nIf I were to compare TSLA to another technology company right now, I would say AMZN. And like AMZN, lots of people bitched and complained about no profit for a very long time, but as of right now it is going pretty good. People bitched about Facebook. People bitched about AAPL. Part of a company that changes the game is having people who bitch about them and say it will never work. Often, to be fair, it never works. \n\nI certainly don't bet against Tesla.

{"id":"d4e0p0j","author":"Indecision1","body":"There is so many ways to source items to sell. For the community don't know what is the most popular, probably thrifts.\n\nThrift stores - Go to a thrift store armed with knowledge in your interests and the eBay app on your phone. Check items that you are considering selling, consider how you will post items and profit made on item, also consider if the item may be broken upon testing. You will probably pay over 10% eBay fees so factor that into it too.\n\nGarage/Yard Sales - People want to get rid of their items, they want money for it but don't want to be bothered listing it themselves. Many items can be found at garage sales that you won't often see in a thrift stores and good garage sales are cheaper than a thrift store.\n\nRetail Arbitrage - Items for clearance, or just any item that is lower in price than selling online. I believe this is more of an Amazon thing, you can scan items with the Amazon seller app and see the rank of your items and price they sell for on Amazon. Then send to Amazon FBA. Although I have seen this in other markets, for example someone here took a picture showing his secret (when he was drunk effectively introducing a lot of competition) showing a currently popular novelty kitchen item that was priced at a cheap store for 99c in front of an etsy listing selling for about $20\n\nAuctions - Buying items from auctions, sometimes they have dodgy practices, need larger investment money, a way to move items, but suits people who want to move larger volume.\n\nSourcing from people offloading/liquidating business. Also large scale stuff probably not the best for a newbie.\n\n","name":"t1_d4e0p0j","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-06-18 07:44:01","week":24}

A big enough position to counter some losses but not significant enough to anchor your portfolio. \n\nHypothetically, if I believed him that market was going to fall off a cliff, this is what I would do. I would purchase long puts on ETF SPY that expire weekly for the first week of September probably around the First or Second week of August; we never know, he could have miscalculated the first date and we're trying to be safe. Let's say we believe Sandy Jadeja's clairvoyant corrections that average ~9.8% we get a target price of ~187$ to today's price of 206 assuming nothing happens and the market remains relatively stable till then. With roughly 200$ worth of puts all placed @187 you could make roughly 240,000$.\n\nGet rich quick scheme?\n\nMy math is probably all wrong... but the reality of being able to accurately predict a 10% correction in a very short period and being able to accurately buy and sell puts at the right time is just so highly unlikely that your return would be phenomenal. Not saying it's impossible as I got lucky with a 10% jump on Amazon that gave me a 565% gain...\nhttp://imgur.com/WwNO5Q2\nIt just means your 99.999999% chance of losing all your money and .000001% of this event happening exactly in the numbers and dates that he's saying. \n\nYou have a 1% chance of ETF SPY correcting from 206$ to 195$ by the end of this week, and it has Brexit, what does August 26th have?

{"id":"d4fm97m","author":"kubutulur","body":"1. inter-market arb. I have no issue with market-making\n\n2. More powerful computers, more powerful networks, higher throughput, lower latency are products of natural technological progress and not an argument for quote stuffing HFTs that pay extra to be notified of MKT orders so they can make a decision which of 10000 bid/offers they sent they don't want to execute.\n\n3. As stated before, I don't have issue with having many exchanges. The fact that they would compete for business for the listing company would drive the cost down. Second issue that would drive the cost down is the exchange would not need to be concerned about connectivity issues to other exchanges and quotes getting out of sync, which sounds simple, but not really.  They also get to enjoy better economy of scale for the listed security as all of volume would go through them (other than bank selling to each other). Point being eliminating the 20B arb quote stuffing industry would lower costs to end users of exchanges even more.\n\n4. \"As much as market fragmentation can really suck in terms of price discovery, trading itself has been so entirely commoditized\" This is not an argument for market fragmentation. It's a statement that technology has gotten better and despite the fragmentation, we kind of managed to learn to deal with it from technology point of view. \n\nedit: do you mean SSF (single stock futures)? I'm not too familiar with who trades those. They seem like not a very popular product. In EU, I've heard that CFD (contract for difference) are popular way to scalp stocks rather than buying 1000 AMZN, you would get a few CFDs, which is a way to get insane leverage as you're not borrowing money to buy the actual underlying, but holding margin against an adverse move. if you mean normal futures, trading ES is like 500 SPY, so cost for round trip for ES may be lower than fi you were trading shares (at least for retail)","name":"t1_d4fm97m","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-06-19 20:37:39","week":24}

{"id":"d4fqhaf","author":"ValueInvestingIsDead","body":"In typical google fashsion, Express does nothing but link two existing entities together. Very little overhead, and rake in small amounts of every transaction. This is great.\n\nThe original idea was that someone would google a product, find the best store to buy it at, and buy accordingly. Google could then create a shortcut to these a la Express. Unfortunately for them, Amazon has already topped Google in the \"first website for online shopping. I've read many times now that [people now start on Amazon.com to start shopping](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazon-dominates-the-online-shopping-world-survey-shows/). \n\nBy the looks of it, Amazon is attempting some sort of retail or even \"consumption\" singularity. They did to online shopping what Google did to search...the upside of that is yet to be even whiffed. I'm almost positive Google knows this, and to un-seat such an entrenched incumbent would be a waste of resources. \n\nWhile 35% of shopping is still a huge number, Google does have a 10x better or bust mantra...so there is definitely some upside tob e seen, though I just don't see it taking off.....aka being great and dying in 2 years, like the other guy said. \n\nBUT, Google is undervalued and it has nothing to do with Express, I'll tell ya whhuuttt.\n\n*TL;DR HELOC maxed out on GOOG &amp; AMZN.*\n\n*TL;SDR  Express is great but since we're talking about autistic OCD monopoly-seeking schmucks, they'll probably abandon it.* ","name":"t1_d4fqhaf","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-06-19 22:29:25","week":24}
