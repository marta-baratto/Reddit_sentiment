{"id":"4h8anz","author":"Raynerteo","body":"**Law of large number and how it impacts your trading**\n\n\nBefore anything else, you must understand the law of large number.\n\n\nWait, what’s that?\n\n\nThe law of large numbers is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed. – Probability Theory\n\n\nFor a trader, this means you need a large number of trades for your edge to play out.\n\n\nYou will not be consistently profitable every week, taking 5 trades a month.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nBecause according to the law of large number,  results are random in the short run, but will be closer to the expected value in the long run.\n\n\nSince the law of large number requires a certain number of trades for your edge to play out,  how does it impact your trading?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**What is consistency?**\n\n\nSince the law of large number requires a certain number of trades for your edge to play out,  how does it impact your trading?\n\n\nHigh-frequency trading – Trading at very high frequency, like 10,000 trades a month. You can expect to be profitable for most of the months, or even every day like Virtu Financial (But I wouldn't recommend this route if you're a retail trader as you need the right technology and deep pockets).\n\n\nDay trader – Trading an average of 3 – 5 times a day, you can expect to be profitable in most of the quarters.\n\n\nSwing/position trader – Trading an average of 5 – 15 times a month, you can expect to be profitable for most of the years.\n\n\nThe more trades you put on during a shorter period of time, the faster your edge will play out. \n\n\nBut without an edge in the markets, the more trades you put on leads to blowing up your account even faster.\n\n\nUnderstand this and you’re ahead of 90% of traders out there.\n\n\nNext:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Find a trading style that suits you**\n\n\nNot only that, it has to also fit your schedule. If you have a full-time job, it does not make sense to be a day trader.\n\n\nGo read Market Wizards. It contains an interview with successful traders of various trading styles.\n\n\nThis way you’ll learn what works in the market, and pick one trading style that suits you.\n\n\nOnce you’ve decided on one, find out everything you can about it.  Let’s assume you want to be a trend follower.\n\n\nYou can look at:\n\n\nAcademic research papers – You can google academic research papers. E.g. Search for ‘trend following academic research papers’. These are useful research papers you can explore.\n\n\nBooks – Search for books relevant to your trading style. E.g. Search for ‘trend following’ on Amazon. Here’s a list of books that I would highly recommend.\n\n\nYouTube – Watch videos and learn the thought process of other traders. E.g. Search for ‘trend following’ on YouTube.\n\n\nGoogle – You can always find a hidden gem here. Like interviews, podcasts, and blogs related to trend following.\n\n\nSocial Media – You can connect with traders who are successful. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook etc.\n\n\nNow:\n\n\nUse all these information you have and build a trading plan.\n\n\nHere’s how…\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Develop your trading plan**\n\n\nA trading plan is a structure or a set of guidelines, that defines your trading.\n\n\nIt removes subjectivity in your trading, minimizes the roller coaster emotions, and keeps you prepared at all times.\n\n\n So, how do you develop a trading plan?\n\n\nBelow are 7 essential questions that every trading plan must answer:\n\n\nTime frame traded\n\n\nYou must know the time frame you are executing your trades.\n\n\nFor day traders, you would be trading lower time frames like 5 minutes. For swing/position trader, you would be trading higher time frames like 4 hours or daily.\n\n\nMarkets traded\n\n\nYou must know which markets you will be trading. Would you trade all markets, or just trade a certain sector?\n\n\nRisk management\n\n\nYou must know how much risk you are putting on each trade, and how it will change as your trading capital increase/decrease over time. What % of your account will you risk on each trade?\n\n\nWhat are the conditions of your trading setup?\n\n\nYou need to define what is the exact market condition required before you put on a trade.\n\n\nWhen to enter\n\n\nYou need to define how exactly will you enter a trade.\n\n\nWhen to exit if you are wrong\n\n\nWhenever you enter a trade, you must know the point at which you are wrong, and get out. Which is the point on the chart that will prove your wrong?\n\n\nWhen to exit if you are right\n\n\nWhen the price goes in your favor, you must know how you will exit your trade. Would you trail your stops or set a profit target ahead of time? Would you look to take partial or full profit?\n\n\n*Disclaimer: Below is a sample trading plan that I came up with randomly, please do your own due diligence.*\n\n\nSample trading plan\n\n\nI like to use the IF THEN syntax in my trading plan. It helps keep me more objective with lesser room for discretion.\n\n\nIf I am trading, then I will only trade Eurusd and Audusd. (The markets you are trading)\n\n\nIf I place a trade, then I will not lose more than 1% of my account. (Your risk management)\n\n\nIf 100 EMA is above 200 EMA on daily, then the trend is bullish. (Conditions before entering a trade and time frame you are trading)\n\n\nIf the trend is bullish, then identify an area of support where the price can retrace to. (Conditions before entering a trade)\n\n\nIf price retrace to your area of support, then wait for a higher close. (Conditions before entering a trade)\n\n\nIf price closes higher, then enter long at next candle open. (Entry)\n\n\nIf you are long, then place your stop loss below the low of the candle, and take profit at swing high. (Exit when you’re wrong, and when you’re right)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Execute your trading plan**\n\n\nOnce you’ve completed your trading plan, forward test it in the live markets.\n\n\nYou can do it on demo or small live account.\n\n\nI would suggest trading micro lots on a live account, to take into account how psychology affects your trading.\n\n\nYou have to execute your trades consistently according to your trading plan. This is where your discipline comes into play, only taking trading setups that meet your trading plan.\n\n\nWarning 1: If you entering trades based on how you feel instead of following your trading plan, then it would be impossible to tell whether your trading plan has an edge in the markets.\n\n\nWarning 2: Do not change your trading plan, or jump onto another trading system when you are having a series of losses. I know you are tempted to do so.\n\n\nRecall the law of large number?\n\n\nResults are random in the short run, but will be closer to the expected value in the long run.\n\n\nThis means if you change your trading plan after a few losing trades, you’d never know if you have an edge in the markets. And you will be running around in circles forever!\n\n\nI would recommend having a sample size of at least 100 trades, before deciding whether your trading plan has an edge in the markets.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Record your trades to remain objective**\n\n\nExecuting your trades consistently isn’t enough. You must record down your trades to collect relevant statistical data.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nSo you can make an objective conclusion and know whether your trading plan has an edge in the markets.\n\n\nYou can easily do this on an excel spreadsheet with the relevant metrics below:\n\n\nDate – Date when your trade is entered\n\n\nTime Frame – The time frame you are entering on\n\n\nSetup – The trading setup that triggers your entry\n\n\nProduct – Financial product that you trade E.g. Apple, Gold, Eur/Usd\n\n\nLots – Position size you entered\n\n\nLong/short – Direction of your trade\n\n\nTick value – Value per pip. E.g. 1 standard lot of Eurusd is $10/pip\n\n\nPrice In – Price you enter your trade\n\n\nPrice Out – Price you exit, at profit or loss\n\n\nStop loss – Price where you will exit if your trade is wrong\n\n\nProfit &amp; loss – Profit or loss from this trade\n\n\nInitial Risk in $ – Nominal risk value of this trade\n\n\nR – Your initial risk of this trade. E.g If you made 2 times your initial risk, you made 2R.\n\n\nReview your trades and find your edge\n\n\nAfter you have a sample size of 100 trades, you can look to review your statistics to see whether you have an edge in the markets.\n\n\nThe most important trading equation you must know:\n\n\nExpectancy = (Winning % * Average win) – (Losing % * Average loss) – (Commission + slippage)\n\n\nIf you have a positive expectancy, congratulations! You have an edge in the markets.\n\n\nBut what if you don’t have?\n\n\nYou can consider:\n\n\nIncrease your winning % – Be more selective with your entries. Look for other confluence factors that can be added to your trading plan.\n\n\nIncrease your average win – Ride your winners longer. You can do this by trailing your profits as price moves in your favor.\n\n\nDecrease your average loss – Cut your losses. You can do this by cutting your losers quickly.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\nIf you do not have an edge in the markets, increasing your frequency of trades will not make you profitable. It will only make you lose faster than before.\n\n\nLikewise, reducing your risk per trade will still cause you to lose, but at a slower pace.\n\n\nOnce you’ve identified the issues and come up with a solution, repeat the entire process over again. Develop &gt;&gt; Execute &gt;&gt; Record &gt;&gt; Review\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI hope this will shed some light on what it takes to become a consistently profitable trader.\n\nDon't hesitate to let me know if there's anything, I'll be glad to help.\n\n** **You can view the original post [here.](http://www.tradingwithrayner.com/how-to-be-a-consistently-profitable-trader-without-paying-for-trading-courses/)**","name":"t3_4h8anz","subreddit":"Forex","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhmq","created_utc":"2016-05-01 10:19:35","week":17}

Last month I put all my food and gas on the cards for the first time, and paid it all off and I'm now hooked on the cash back bonuses.  (I know I can handle the money management part.)\n\nI got an offer for the Citi Double Cash Card, and it looks like a nice pairing to my Discover card.  The Amazon card is just going to be blown out of the water for usability when Discover starts its 5% cash back program (amazon) at the end of the quarter.  The Citi matches the amazon in usefulness in every way besides purchases from Amazon.  \n\nI'm thinking of just abandoning the Amazon card outside of the occasional purchase, and switching to the Citi for all my non categorized purchases.\n\nMy question is how is applying for this card going to affect my score?  It took a big hit a year ago when my student loans dropped, and I've gotten it back up a bit.  I'm at 767 right now, but don't want to drop below 760.   I plan on this being my last credit card pull for a while (years perhaps.)\n\nAnother thing is that sometime in the next two years I would like to finance a new car, but am concerned too many hard pulls (3 this year) could affect that.  Or am I being overly paranoid?\n\nThoughts?  Better recommendations than the Citi Double Cash?\n\nI'm actually thinking of using the Citi Card to buy a fairly expensive purchase that I want.

{"id":"d2o7lof","author":"80spizzarat","body":"It depends. With Amazon FBA you are packing multiple items into a single shipment. Amazon handles the picking and packing for individual orders and most of the customer service. You still have to answer customer messages, but that's about it. The downside is they also handle most of the customer service, so if the customer makes a big enough stink the CS reps might just give them your item for free. This has happened to me a couple of times, but thankfully not on anything expensive. One was an inexpensive tennis accessory and the other was a printer ink cartridge. Both were retail arb and still sealed. I can't imagine what kind of line the ink cartridge buyer fed the rep, but it wasn't expired and they got a refund somehow.\n\nAnyway, before you get into FBA you want to read through the regulations on the Amazon site. There is no trial period and they don't give you many chances to screw up. Getting back into Amazon's good graces after getting suspended is frustrating at best, almost impossible at worst. You also have to be careful about what you send in because certain companies take an extremely dim view of people outside of authorized resellers selling their product as new. Amazon will allow you to list these products, then the company will complain and get your account shut down.","name":"t1_d2o7lof","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-01 09:16:22","week":17}

{"id":"d2ogq8t","author":"excaliboor","body":"Wherever you see wealth, I can tell you there's two things in common:\n\n* **Earn more than you spend**\n\n* **Trade** (Buy cheap, sell expensive)\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIt's always those two, the rest is only different forms. Labor, stocks, goods, books, cars, real estate, art, whatever. I can get more richer more faster because at any given moment I have a diverse portfolio - stocks here and there, couple buildings, couple pieces of art, ... all of it bought cheap. When there's somebody who will pay a lot more for it then I bought it for, I'll sell.\n\nNow some life advice:\n\n* **Be ready to be poor**. Accept it as a possibility. You will become relaxed and lose the pressure to perform. You will become comfortable in your current position to think your way to the top - with clarity.\n\n* Passion. Very important. My first business flopped so hard, because I was in for the money. It's not about *following* your passion. You'll get passion when you get good at something. Have patience and trust the process; don't try to be a teen billionaire. Allow yourself to take 20 years if necessary. Life doesn't work like in the movies.\n\n* Clear vision. Without a clear vision, you have no ambition. Imagine being a steward asking your caption for the course, and he replies \"Just go!\" It may sound cool in movies, but in reality: without direction, you'll soon meet the \"*How the hell did we end up here?*\" moment.\nImagine two people on the base of a mountain. One looks to the top, one looks at his feet. And both start walking. Guess who's more likely to hit the top?\n\n&gt; \"I always knew I'll become a billionaire.\"\n\n&gt; - Jeff Bezos\n\n* Discipline. Live for tomorrow. This is the \"Earn more than you spend\" part. Eat healthy. Skip the expensive accessory/gadget. Wanna buy a new PS4? Don't rush. Invest in stocks and pay for the PS4 with dividends from the stocks. Now you'll have both stocks and the PS4. Stocks go naturally up in price, if nothing just due to inflation. (When in doubt, buy safe - e.g. P&amp;G.) So now you can sell them, have more money, and a PS4, just because you waited instead of impulse buying. That's the power of discipline.\n\n\n* **Just start**. (Beating inertia.) Trick yourself by just doing one step. Don't wanna do a workout routine? Just do 1 pushup. While you're already down, you will keep pushing. So now you actually harness the power of inertia. Do just one and then you can stop and feel that at least you've done one. So just wash one dish. Just put one piece of clothing in the washing machine. Just write one sentence. Just do one homework assignment. Go up to a girl and just say \"Hi.\"\n\n* Harness the power of acting. If you have no kids, imagine you have. Imagine you're the only provider for your 3 kids. What would you do if you were broke and had 3 kids to feed? How hard would you fight? Would you still procrastinate and watch porn and Netflix all weekend long? Would you make dinner for them, or give them snacks? How late would you stay up, and how early would you rise?\n\nAct like you're in a movie, playing the soon-to-be millionaire. Kick some ass and make some lemonade.\n\n* Set your environment up for success. How does a millionaire's home look like? Is it messy? Are the dishes done? Does it smell good? Are his friends junkies, or does he spend time with successful people? What type of clothing does he wear?\n\n* Set up your mental environment for success. Talk to yourself like a motivational speaker. When you see a nice girl, imagine you have your best friend with you who builds up your self-esteem, and he's saying: \"You're confident. You're worthy of her. She will like you. You have lots of positive, attractive traits. You're funny, you're good looking.\" When you're waking up, tell yourself \"You work hard.\"\n\n* Read! It's all out there. All of the worlds knowledge is in books, and thanks to Amazon/Bookdepositry/whatever, just a week away from being in your hands. Pro tip: Start with Felix Dennis' \"How to get rich\". (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Dennis#Writing_and_performance): *In 2006, Dennis wrote a best-seller on how he became a multi-millionaire in How to Get Rich.[11]*) Link and referral intentionally omitted.

When you first searched that set, Amazon had no stock left. You saw the price of the cheapest marketplace seller (\"twilightmedia\") at $22.49 with Prime shipping, available because that seller mails all their stock to an Amazon warehouse for fulfillment in advance. They could have just one DVD set available at that price. When someone buys it and you look at it on Amazon's site tomorrow, you're going to see a price from a totally different seller, a higher one since it's always the lowest price with shipping that gets shown. This morning, Amazon got a new shipment of DVDs from their distributor, so their listing at $16.49/16.99 went back up, making that the lowest price, which you took advantage of. At no point in this whole chain of events was anyone at Amazon changing any prices.","name":"t1_d2ojb6x","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-05-01 18:27:20","week":17}
{"id":"d2okg8m","author":"coolandrefreshing","body":"You need a system. One day (or time of day) for listing, one for sourcing, one for shipping, etc. Figure out what works for you. I have been in the same boat as you. I started a few months ago. I'm a full time Mom and I work part time. Some have suggested FBA over Amazon. That seems to work well for some. I have both frontiers open, and I'm finding that I prefer eBay. (But my second favorite part of the process, after sourcing, is packing and shipping. So...) FBA is a lot less labor intensive, but it is not ideal in my opinion. You pay through the nose for the placement. They take a very large cut. You have to more or less package your items to ship anyway. But a very good feature is that you don't have the stuff around so you can let it go and move on. Trying out FBA is easy. That might be the route for you. I loved eBay instantly. FBA is love-hate for me. To date they have lost 4 of my items, all excellent things. Someone in the FBA forum claimed they'd reimburse at my price, but no. So far I have received from Amazon a grand total of $0.14 for one of the items that I had planned to sell for $15. Be careful. Don't send a huge shipment of valuable stuff to them. That's my opinion. (I will get slammed for it. There are a LOT of violent defenders of FBA on these forums.) A good thing about FBA: It might really address your anxiety issues, because once you ship items to them, you can basically let it go and forget about it. You can take as much time off as you want and know that your items are getting shipped and the customers are being communicated with.","name":"t1_d2okg8m","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-01 18:58:56","week":17}

And if you're still debating what you should sell, here's what I've learned from the successful ecommerce entrepreneurs I've spoken to:\r\n\r\n1. Build an audience first or serve your existing audience (I have an audience of ecommerce entrepreneurs and know how to market to them already)\r\n2. Work off of your strengths (I'm good at creating content so I don't have to learn a new skill like manufacturing a physical product or even selling t-shirts).\r\n\r\nIf you want to follow along I already released 3 vlog updates.  Each update teaches a bit about the stage that I'm at and updates you on the stage that I'm at:\r\n\r\n1. Choosing an Ecommerce Niche - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTMWBd-RWko\r\n2. Using Amazon For Market Research - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx2TM--38SQ\r\n3. Getting Traction on New Social Media Platforms - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXbjuuieowA\r\n\r\nIt's kind of nerve-wracking to launch something like this publicly, but I find it therapeutic to talk about the struggles of entrepreneurship and if others can learn something along the way then why not?","name":"t3_4gd71m","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-25 15:00:06","week":17}

{"id":"4ge1a6","author":"levi815","body":"Hey r/beermoney:\n\nI posted this link two weeks ago, and I wanted to give everyone another opportunity if they missed out.\n\nG2 Crowd is sending Amazon gift cards ranging between $5-$25 per review submitted for underrepresented software on the site.\nThe only stipulations are to have actually used the software and to login via LinkedIn. This time around, (new) users can leave up to 5 reviews that are each rewardable with a gift card. Reviews also only take around 5 minutes to complete.\n\nHere is a list of every software on their site. You can search the page and click on a product to see if a review is eligible for a gift card, and what the card total offer is here: https://www.g2crowd.com/users/~/stack?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=reddit-l\n\n*I work for G2 Crowd, so I can vouch for the validity of this offer =)\n\nCaveats include: \n-In order to be reimbursed for your gift card, your LinkedIn must be real, as this is how reviews are verified. If a LinkedIn is empty, has no connections, and doesn't list an employer, it's impossible to tell if the user actually uses the product, and the review will be taken off the site. Just a heads up!\n\n-Our site is geared towards professionals, so we're mostly looking for users of business software. So while this might not exclude everyone, generally we are looking for users of software in the workplace and not students.","name":"t3_4ge1a6","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-25 18:15:43","week":17}

Pasta maker , juicers ? All those parts sell and fast.\n\n\nVacuum cleaners are always at the curb . attachments are worth a lot . If you are handy you can tear a vacuum cleaner apart and sell the motor , cables , switches , hoses , rollers for way more money than selling a used vaccum . Even the plastic shell and handles \n\nMicrowaves also are in the garbage a lot  - sell the plate , the rolling wheels , light bulb , the keypad if it's a popular model . If you open these up they have the megatron and power supplies . Model numbers are always on it . \n\nBroken tvs with cracked screens ?  Open it up and all the boards have models on them and can be sold .  I never tested one board on a trailer of broken tvs and 99% of them never had an issue . The only test you can do at home is if the tv doesn't power on then the power board is garbage but the rest should be fine . \n\n\nPyrex and Tupperware lids. \n\nNone of these will make you a millionaire but can help you stretch out more profit on items .

{"id":"4gkt4a","author":"waitingforgoodoh","body":"I hope this will apply to many of you who are still waiting to jump in and start something.\n\nI’ve loved the idea of starting my own thing for a while, but I never really associated with those **“entrepreneurs at heart”**-- the people who started selling painted rocks at the beach when they were 7 years old.\n\nStill, I’ve spent MORE than enough time consuming “entrepreneurship porn”-- Lean Startup, Rework, Zero to One, $100 Startup, Smart Passive Income, and countless other podcasts, blogs and forums (this one included, thanks to everyone who posts quality content here).\n\nI guess I finally read enough times that **just doing something is so much more valuable than endlessly researching it,** but a couple of weeks ago I decided to pull the trigger. I wanted something with a low startup cost, that had the possibility of revenue from day 1, and something I was interested in.\n\nThese factors in mind, and given that I’ve probably been brainwashed by Pat Flynn and his disciples, launching a website/blog seemed like a natural idea. I thought about different topics, but settled on creating **a blog about dating apps.**\n\nI chose this topic because I have a lot of experience with them (after college, I learned to use dating apps to go on zillions of dates, and have enjoyed the process a lot), and I figured I could start by selling dating consulting services immediately, while growing an audience through content. I also have found that there is not a lot of quality content written in this space, but that was of secondary concern starting out.\n\nI thought it might be helpful to document my process over the first two weeks, to show people a realistic view of what they might expect if choosing to do something similar. Below are the biggest things I’ve learned so far, followed by a journal I created in real time throughout the past two weeks.\n\n* They’re right, dammit. Starting something--anything-- is wayyy more valuable than endless research. This is **by far the most important thing,** and I’ll consider this post a success if you stop reading now and go try to make something\n* It’s very easy to get **caught up in vanity metrics.** In my case so far, this has been page views. I’ve found it very tough not to compulsively check throughout the day, even though without conversion, they are essentially as meaningless as Reddit Karma.\n* Getting a website up and running in 2016 is, technically, about as **easy as shipping a package from Fedex.** Making it a quality experience for the end user is still difficult, though\n* Writing content can be hard work, but it can also be really fun, if you like thinking about what you’re writing about\n* It’s super important to find your audience. The same post got **250 upvotes in r/seduction, and 3 upvotes in r/dating_advice.**\n* Formatting is extremely important. Learn to use bullet points, spaces, bolding etc.\n* **Entrepreneurship shouldn’t be your only interest/hobby**. Not only because it makes you less well-rounded as a human being, but because, funnily enough, it limits your options in terms of possible businesses to enter, making you less effective as an entrepreneur\n\nJournal:\n\nDay 1. Finally pulled the trigger, bought datingappsdemystified.com and registered with Bluehost through an affiliate link on smartpassiveincome.com. Spent $120 in total. Feeling nervous that I didn’t really research the domain name and didn’t shop around enough for hosting, but I felt I just needed to stop reading and start doing. Have a very basic idea of what WordPress is, so far it seems fairly intuitive. Started writing content.\n\nDay 2. Wrote more content, and posted an article on Reddit (in r/dating_advice). It was received well (23 upvotes), this validated my idea and pumped me up. I was very nervous to post/ share the content, but it is intoxicating to know people are interacting with your work.\n\nDay 3. Worked on formatting the site. Biggest fear right now is that I invest a lot of time into this Wordpress theme and then want to switch later. Looked around a bit for a good way to start collecting email signups, and glad I am doing that. Settled on Newsletter (a WP plugin). The webpage looks like a real, albeit shitty, website, and I’m excited. Very energizing knowing that everything I’m working on directly impacts me. I feel like I’m learning quickly now.\n\nDay 4. Felt rather unmotivated-- like getting to revenue was a pipe dream, that even getting any traffic would be super difficult. I watched some videos about WordPress, and it seemed like I had pretty much done everything right, which was encouraging-- good to have external validation. Starting to think about how to get people on the site.\n\nDay 5. Feeling a bit better/ more motivated. Posted a couple of links in answers on Quora questions, set up analytics through Jetpack (I figure I’ll set up Google Analytics later, when I actually need it). Going to try to crank out some content and reach out to people in my niche.\n\nDay 6. Created a twitter and an instagram account for the site. Got inspired and started writing a bunch of tweets and scheduling them out through hootsuite. Already starting to think of pivoting my site, because it feels more fun to go in other directions creatively. But, going to stick with this for a while.\n\nDay 7. Interacted with a bunch of people on twitter and posted to instagram. Got 13 views yesterday, 3 today. Need to make sure to keep what I’m doing aligned with making money.\n\nDay 8. Played with new themes, which was a bit frustrating. Installed Tesseract based on a youtube video, but it was very slow to show changes when customizing, and so I abandoned it. Went with Activello because it seemed highly rated and popular. It’s going better, but I think I will have to look into customizing it with CSS. Daunting, but kind of exciting and fun to learn about. Pushed out some more content, and linked it to reddit. Learning: better response when including my “credentials” in the post (gone on 100+ dates through dating apps).\n\nDay 9. I think I’m getting too wrapped up in chasing page views, but it’s good motivation. Got 23 yesterday and 23 today so far. It’s cool to know your page is being looked at. Most of it off referrals from Reddit. Getting into a groove with content, cranked out a new piece, 1000+ words today and it was fun. Set up Google Analytics, it was easy, just copy paste the code into the body.php file. Big takeaway: A lot of marketing is boring. Just posting a bunch of shit and trying to drive traffic.\n\nDay 10. Exciting day! Posted my latest post to r/seduction, and it’s gotten 250 upvotes and I have 228 page views. Really nice reading the comments from people who found it useful. It’s kind of nerveracking, but I know it’s good getting it out there! Still waiting on email signups, and pondering having a popup. I know it’ll help my conversion rate, it just feels off though. Bought a logo on fiverr, don’t love it but it’s fine. Putting that up today.\n\nDay 11. Some interesting stuff today. I listened to a podcast by Michael Hyatt and decided to put more effort into collecting email addresses on the site. I’d always heard how important it is to have an email list, but it still feels kind of uncomfortable asking for an email address. A bit of residual traffic today from yesteday’s reddit post. I also posted the same exact post on r/datingadvice, and it’s gotten 4 upvotes (compared to 250 on r/seduction). Shows how fickle reddit can be, and the importance of testing different channels.\n\nIn terms of learning, I feel confident now setting up a basic site. In retrospect, nothing about it has been technically challenging at all\n\nOh, I also made an “about” page, because supposedly that’s the second most visited page on a blog.\n\nDay 12. Submitted a couple of posts to StumbleUpon, which was surprisingly effective. Got about 50 views in the first 3 hours, and around 100 views overall. Seems like if you’ve got decent content, SU can be a really useful way of driving views. However, they’re pretty low-quality (really high bounce rate).\n\nDay 13. Learning that I need to limit my compulsive viewing of stats. Also, need to do things other than think about the site. Starting to run out of content that I’m excited to create. Still no email signups, which is discouraging. But, another wave of traffic from StumbleUpon, this time without me doing anything-- another 100 or so visitors.\n\nDay 14. Set up an Amazon Affiliate account. I had heard about this through listening to the Smart Passive Income podcast. It was ridiculously easy-- within 15 minutes I had updated the links to books on my “Resources” page. I had never worked directly with HTML, that was cool.\n\nSo, that’s two weeks of my working on the site an average of about 3 hours a day. Thanks very much for reading. Happy to answer any questions, or hear any critiques of the site (http://datingappsdemystified.com)!

{"id":"4gncz2","author":"Michael_McEnder","body":"First I'd like to say after lurking this subreddit for a while I have learned a lot of useful things and have started planning ahead (a big improvement from just \"going with the flow\") and while that information has been great, I came to the conclusion I may be screwed..\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo to start with my situation. I currently own the following debits:\n\n* $3500* in student loans deffered until 6 months\n\n* $1970 on an AMEX card that has 0% APR until the 4th of June\n\n* $580 on a Amazon store card. Interest free until August\n\n* $240 on a Discover card (it's gonna be paid off by the 05/10th)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAssets:\nA Pontiac Bonneville 2003 that's really beat up and doesn't have working breaks (a $1100 repair)\n\nA 2005 Dodge caravan that's also beat up and has a major crack(s) in the power steering system (a $1500 repair)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIncome\n* $9hr working 35-40~ hours a week. Take home pay would be roughly $550 every 2 weeks\n\nAND I'm currently looking for a part time job (going to work 20 hours a week at, at least $9 and hour) (I have a couple of good leads, one is bound to work out). In that case that would be $600 a month (after tax roughly) a month disposable income.\n\nI'm also open to other ways to make extra income, please share them if you have good ones.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy current expenses are:\n\n* Rent $290\n\n* Electricity $40ish a month\n\n* Gas $10\n\n* Cell Phone $45\n\n* Internet $17\n\n* Credit card minimums are $35, $35 and $25\n\n* Google Music $10\n\nI walk to work (and would be able to walk to the second job as well) so I don't have to pay gas for my (broken) cars and I don't pay insurance for them as they're not drive-able.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCurrently I'm pouring all of whats left into my debit, and I feel like that has been working greatly for me. my goal was to reduce my debit and get my credit score up so I could get a car, but then I realized that November will be here before you know it and that's when my lease is up. I currently stay with my partner, their friend and the friends 2 year old son. When we move it'll only be us (when I say us I mean me and my partner), the friend will not be coming with us. We wanted to buy a house (found a few for around $80,000k-$90,000k) and that would be our price limit. We would split it down the middle and they're entitled to a VA loan through the national guard. We wanted to get a three bedroom house and rent out the other two rooms (current roommate slacks on bills so that's why the friend isn't an option).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow with that in mind (and yes we do intend to stay in one location for a good while), would we even be able to finance a house without a down-payment (with the VA loan)? How much of one should we have saved up if we do need one? I calculated how much money I'll have by the time the lease is up and it ranges from -$1000 to $3000 depending on how soon I get the second job and if I sell my car(s). Which of course that amount assumes I don't put any money back, which leads me to my next question..\nIs there even any point to saving money when you have high interest (20%apr) debt? I know when I was paying off a Chase card I had and my Discover card's balance sat there almost maxed out, I'd be charged $16-$28 in just interest a month. I want to be charged the least amount of interest possible (0% after it's all paid off ;P).\n\nI do intend on creating a emergency fund as soon as I pay off my debit (gonna save up 3 months of expenses) but what's the point now?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso about my car(s). My Bonneville has had power steering fluid poured into the brake fluid reservoir (which as you may now, messes up all the rubber inside) and now it screwed. I put in on craigslist and someone offered $500 for it, should I have taken that offer? Granted they'd have to come pick it up (put that in ad) and I only paid $960 for it (after tax and registration too). I just don't know because I'm terrible at pricing cars.\n\nAlso I do want to sell my Caravan however it's currently in Mississippi and I'm in Arkansas. My dad thought he could fix it for less than $1500 so he offered to pick it up and take it there but he hasn't had the time to take a good look at it. There wouldn't happen to be a way to sell it from here, would there? Honestly if someone offered me $200 for it I would take it. It's considered a complete lost to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe automotive talk brings me to my next question:\nafter reading on various subreddits, a lot of people agree the Toyota Corolla is a very reliable vehicle and I want one as my car. My next question would be is should I buy a newer one or older one? The average used one in my area is about a 2007 model $4000 with 128,000 miles OR a newer one (2010) is about $8000 but it has less miles at about 80,000. Actually there's one I really want for $7900 and it has 89,000 (from a dealer too) that I'd like to buy. Also to add I would be driving a 190 mile trip, twice at least once a month. But that being said, that leads me to my next question\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWould it be hard to get a car loan and mortgagee at the same time? My credit score is currently at 650 (and rising, it's only low because of my balances). I know the score is kind of a vague thing (and it'll be around 700-720+ when I get either/or) but I just want others experiences of getting car loans close to mortgagees.\nThis is really long and I don't know how I would shorten it so if you read it al. I don't expect anyone to answer the whole thing themselves so thanks for any information you might share!","name":"t3_4gncz2","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-27 09:04:52","week":17}

Basically you link your email address to it and whenever you buy something from an online retailer in their system (Hellllooooo Amazon!) it records the price for 14 days. If the price drops they send an email to the retailer on your behalf requesting a price adjustment. The refunded amount goes back onto your original form of payment. They make money by charging you up to 25% of the reimbursed amount monthly (but nothing if they don't save you money), and you can reduce the amount you pay as low as 0% for referring people.

{"id":"4gpkcb","author":"VirtualBruiser","body":"I've posted a similar post to this about two-three weeks ago when Rewarding Ways was giving $1 (by using their promo code) for having paid over $300,000 to its members but I forgot to mention that you must've earned at least $5 to withdraw the free $1. \n**&lt; This promo expired, by the way.**\n\nSo I decided to make a *correct* and actually informative post about it (yes, it will be my last) and share it with /beermoney and /beermoneyglobal.\n\nRewarding Ways works like any other GPT site but better (in my opinion). I say this because I've tried many GPT sites but none of them worked for me as well as this one. I kid you not, some beer money sites didn't even let me sign up and that's because I live in the Caribbean. So I can vouch that this works Worldwide.\n\nOf course if you're not from USA or UK you won't get as many offers, or (especially) surveys but there's still a lot to do. You can do Worldwide Offers, offers from the Offer Wall that include watching videos, PTC offers ($0.001 up to $0.01 per click) and more.\n\n&gt; The minimum payout is only a dollar ($1) if you cash out using PayPal (doesn't need to be verified), PayPal Instant or Skrill. You can also cash out using Payza ($10 min. payout). \n\nThe site also has a point system (one point = $0.01) and when you reach 500 points you can request a $5 Amazon Gift Card that will be sent your email for immediate use. You can also convert cash to points. $1 = 100 Points.\n\n&gt; [Payment Proof](http://imgur.com/a/2QMon) / Link: http://imgur.com/a/2QMon\n\nIf you **sign up using my ref you get a $0.20 bonus** so you'll only have to earn an additional $0.40 to cash out which can take under 10 minutes if you do the right offer(s). \n\n&gt; [Ref](http://www.rewardingways.com/members/withdraw/list.php?refid=311434) / [Non-Ref](http://www.rewardingways.com/) \n\nThere's also a contest going on and to participate all you have to do is complete the most daily surveys, worldwide offers &amp; offer wall tasks. $1000 Prize Fund. Worldwide Contest. (PTS offers do not count).\n\nThe top 20 members who earn the most by 31st May 2016 win a prize.\n\n&gt; How much you earn depends on where you live and how much time you spend on the site. It took me about 20 days to get to $20 dollars, because of my location and the time I spent on the site. Less than two hours a day; watching videos, doing PTC offers and downloading apps and absolutely no surveys (because I don't qualify for them). Please also note that if you use a VPN service and they detect it, you will get banned. Speaking from experience here.\n\n**I tried adding as much information about the site as possible but if there's any question, don't hesitate on asking.**","name":"t3_4gpkcb","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-27 19:27:14","week":17}

{"id":"4grv8v","author":"ffstriker","body":"Hi friends,\n\nJust writing to see what fellow small business e-commerce people do in this situation. \n\nSo, I sell Cell Phones and Cell Phone related items both on my site and on Amazon. Business is good which is awesome. We are getting about 6-10 orders a day via both channels.\n\nWe have a continues issue with Amazon though that I need some help with. Amazon has this amazing feature to protect buyers called A-Z Claims. If the buyer does not get the item, is different then what is sold, or something else along those lines. Amazon will take care of the investigation with the seller. On paper, this sounds amazing and as a honest seller this means alot to me.\n\nI got and order at the start of April and shipped it. The shipping service we use (DHL) delivered and confirmed it. AWESOME. A few weeks later, I get an A-Z Claim for this order that it was not received. Amazon stated I have 5 Business days to respond. I got my team on it right away.\n\nWhile we were on the phone with DHL. I get an email THE SAME DAY saying that they are refunding the order from my account. We are dealing with a iPhone here. This is not a small amount of money. More so because we are a 4 man/woman operation. \n\nI did not have a chance to even prove myself to Amazon. Sure enough, I have a signature, conformation, time stamp and date that the package was signed for. This address signed for was the intended address as per the order.\n\nI contacted seller support and after getting to 3 different reps who didn't understand what I was trying to do I finally got someone who escalated me to a supervisor. The supervisor said he would escalate it with his people.\n\nI get an email today saying that they see my point but are not changing their ruling. The buyer would have to cancel the A-Z Claim. At this point, from my investigating this customer has the device. \n\nWhat should I do. Do i now take this to the police in this customers area? Amazon doesn't seem to want to help. \n\nThanks in advance. ","name":"t3_4grv8v","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-04-28 04:01:50","week":17}

{"id":"4gtzaj","author":"montecarlo1","body":"Problem #1: The business owner is wanting to add some credibility to his website, he has some funky review feed on the bottom of his website that his developer put there at one time but its outside of the eye of the consumer. Or he may not even have this at all. However, the business owner has some really good reviews in multiple sites.\n\nSolution #1: Reviewmetrics allows for any business owner to easily place a continous feed of reviews from multiple review sites (Yelp, FB, Google, TB, foursquare etc.) to immediately show credibility to potential customers. All with just a copy/paste of an embedded code. No more touching after that, it updates by itself.\n\nProblem #2: Business owners have multiple locations and/or are represented in various review sites like Yelp, FB, Google, Foursquare, Amazon etc. but don't want to waste time sorting through all the different sites to find bad reviews to reply or attend. Or simply with the rythm of the business, there is no time to place attention to new reviews that probably need immediate attention.\n\nSolution #2: Reviewmetrics tracks all reviews from multiple platforms in one dashboard. Business owners get notifications via email and/or text when a new review is posted. They can also sort by location and respond accordingly. The tool also allows them to view insights, trends and other useful analytics regarding their reviews.\nThis is the MVP concept and depending on the validation and feedback, it can definitely add more services/layers on top of this such as dispute/conflict resolution etc.\n\nHere is the landing page for more information: www.reviewmetrics.co\n\nJust looking for feedback on the potential product.

I need your advise, fellow entrepreneurs, about marketing and getting more traffic to my website.\nOur website includes around 200 affiliated products, mostly from eBay and some from Amazon. The products are from varies categories, kind of \"everything in one website\". We collect the products manually, adding them to our website and showing the price online compared to retail price. This site is one of a kind in Israel and we have no competition, but I'm afraid we are just not able to create this new market of people who know to purchase online but doesn't know what.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRegarding marketing, This is was I've done so far: I have appeared on a local TV channel for about 3 minutes interview about the site, this got us a lot of traffic but only for 1 or 2 days, definitely not returning visitors. We also have a Facebook page which I post to every day or so about specific products or tips for smarter online shopping, but because of lack of motivation, I didn't post anything for the last months. In addition to that, I know that \"content is king\" (as geryvee likes to mention), so I wrote about 7-8 1000 word articles to educate people of online shopping and tips, but it seems that people don't get excited by them and they are not generating the traffic I imagined - so I stopped writing.\nI also tried some Facebook ads and dark-posts, they seem to get clicks but rarely that they generate income - so I stopped trying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA new thing I'm trying to work on is creating weekly videos to share education materials about online shopping, to catch the eyes of Facebook visitors if they don't like to read the articles - this is in progress and no video was uploaded yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*For your review, here is the link to the website. It's in Hebrew, so you won't understand a word, but it's mainly numbers so I hope you'll get the idea of it: http://www.dealosaur.co.il*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat else can I do to get more quality traffic?

{"id":"4guywy","author":"carl0071","body":"I've been flipping on Amazon for about 2 years now, and if there's one tip I can offer, it's this:\n\n**Never form an emotional attachment over items of stock**\n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer when you read it out loud, but when I first started buying items to resell, I would price something over what I paid for it, even if it was selling for half that price.\n\nMy mindset was \n\n**\"I paid X, so I can't sell it for less than that... plus it must be worth more than Y because it looks nice\".**\n\nThen I decided that that sometimes it's best to recoup as much of the investment as you can and move on to buying more profitable stock, rather than having £1000's tied up in overpriced stock which isn't selling.","name":"t3_4guywy","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-28 19:08:19","week":17}
{"id":"4gv4tg","author":"Wedge129","body":"Here's a little compilation of a few apps i'm using to make around 30$ a month for 10-15min a day of clicking.\nIts a list for Android.Maybe a few of those apps can be use with iOS, but i don't know.\n\n\n\n           *** I'm not an native English speaker, feel free to correct me ***\n\n\n\n\n**Cashpoint**: \n\nOne of my biggest earner. Its easy to use, the payout is easy to obtain ( 2$) and its fast (24H). The currency in this app is Coins. You obtain Coins by spinning the wheel(0-100 ), you can spin the wheel maybe 20-25 time a day. It goes on cooldown after you use it, and the  cd timer depend on how many times you uses the wheel in the day.(10sec to 1800) \n\nYou can scratch and earn too( this is where we make our Coins). Scratch and earn will cost you 18 coins to play, and you will often get 0. BUT, Cashpoint allow the user to click on add(under the spinning wheel). Clicking adds will double your earning on the wheel and the Scratch and earn. I would recommand you guys to always use you 2X on scratch and win. Cashpoint offers download for Coins, daily bonuses, up to 500 coins ( if you log in for the whole months), and wait and earn.\n\n  You can refer people, and get 5% of their earning(not sure about this one).Like i said, minimal Cashout is 2$, but if you want paypal you'll need to get to 50$ . I use this app for Steam GC, and sometimes Amazon. 2700Coins =5$\n\nFor those of you who cannot redeem after 1 or 2 times, you just need to go look in the reward shop, look at the number of identifiying credit you have. You need to have the same amount as your Coins. If you don't have enough you will need to start clicking on adds.\n\nREF:2747141\n\n**Whaff**:\n\n Its my download for money app. They standout because they offer you $ for installing the app, but for keeping it on your device too. They have 2 download section, premium and classic. The premium one give you money for installing the app, playing with it for 2-5minutes, and keeping it for X days.\n\n You'll sometimes make 0.25$ for an app in 2 days , and some other time 1$ for 5 days. They offer daily loggin(0.01$) , refferals gets you 0.30$ every time someone uses your code.The minimum payout is 10.50$ and they pay with paypal. Takes around 72 hours to get your money. The currency is $$\nRef Code:CL38125\n\n\n**WalletBuffet**:\n\nNot my biggest earner, but still an app worth it.  You watch video, and after you can scratch a card. You might , or might not , get something from the card. They have around 12 card you can scratch. They reset daily. The app count every card scratch , and win or no win when you reach 100 card scratch you get 250 credit. \n\nThis is where it get tricky. The apps has 2 currency. Credit and points. Points are worth money , 1000Points =1$, and credit are worth points, 2000Credits = 1000Points. They offer paypal and check . You'll need 10 000 Points for the check , and it will be a 10$ check.\n\nOnce you're done scratching, you can watch videos. Every Videos gets you 5Credits. On good days, i can watch 15 videos before they run out of adds, and bad days 7. \n\nThe earning might not seems like a lot, but you win fairly often with your cards. Every card is worth a different amount of points, and if i win its for the 500 points ones, but still 0.50$.\n\nThe reedeming may feel squetchy, since they take you out of the apps, into your web browser, but follow the steps , and you will see your money. No refferals for this one( i think)\n\n**Watch&amp;Earn** :\n\nAnother video apps. Really easy to use . 2$ Payout. Paypal Cashout. 72Hours delay. \n\nWatching video get you Coins. 2000 Coins = 2$. Watching a video gets you 1 coins. Good days, i get 20-25 videos, bad ones 10.\nYou can dowload apps for coins too, but they dont really offer a good payout for them. The other nice thing of this apps is the Play&amp;Earn section, where you get coins for clicking on a box that pop adds. 90% of those adds are Static, so you can open and close them very quickly. No auto-player\n\nThe apps offer a daily bonus of 10 coins. No Reff system in place yet.\n\n\n**Free Gift Cards** :\n\nAnother video apps. 2$ payout. Paypal,Amazon,Steam,iTunes, PlayStore GC. 72hours delay. \n\n4 category of adds you can watch, 3 of  them gets you 1 Points, and the other 3 points per videos. You can get a daily bonus 5 points first day, 10 the other,15,20,25,30. If you logging everyday, you will get 30points . No auto-player\n\n2500Points= 1$. 4600Points= 2$ , 10000Pts=5$. \n\nRefferal gets you 200Points , and 100 points the person using it.\n\nYou can download apps too, but they rarely payout. I wouldnt. \n\n\n**AppTrailers** : \n\nAnother video apps. 0.5$Payout, Paypal,Amazon,Steam,iTunes. If you dont get flag, 60sec, if you do 24h. I always get flag for some reason .\n\nThis one is a love and hate story. Some days i can get 1000points (1$), and others none.  They added a banner that let you watch adds, and only adds. You can get up to 10pts per banner click.  They added an auto-player for apps trailer, and other videos. You can let your device watch 10-12 Videos before they ask you if you're still watching.\n\nYou can reffer people, but i have no clue if you or the person using it gets anything.\n \n500pts= 0.50$\n\n\n\nI ofc uses SB apps,lockscreens apps, but you guys know all about it.\n\nI'm Canadian, so those apps should be working for the CA and US, not sure for the others. Would be nice if you have access to these apps, to tell me your country so i can update the post. \n\nHopes i was able to help.\nPM me any additional question too, i'm usually answering in an hour.\n\n","name":"t3_4gv4tg","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-28 19:41:32","week":17}

{"id":"4gv8r0","author":"eattheyellowcrayon","body":"Hey guys,\n\nAs a casual writing project over the course of a year, I have been putting together an eBook that acts as a beginner’s guide to flipping and a basic intro to FBA. I will be releasing it on May 03 and will be offering it for free.\n\nI started this project because so many of my friends were interested in how I made my money. I wanted to give them an easy way to get started. I started putting together little tutorials for a couple of them. Eventually, I had a collection and finally decided to try to put it all together into a more complete guide.\n\nLiving overseas means I can’t do much with eBay anymore, but I still do FBA. I am no selling wizard or mastermind, but I have plenty of experience that has allowed me to successfully quit my 9-5 job and move to Asia. Flipping isn’t my dream job, but it’s allowed me the flexibility and time to do more cool things, like traveling or whatever else I’m interested in at the time. I think reselling online can be a great stepping stone away from the restraints of a traditional job. I’m sure most of you are aware of that.\n\nBecause I was quite poor when I started out, I was forced to be frugal and creative. That is why I made sure to cover many cost-efficient methods and money saving techniques that I learned. Being frugal was key for me. This guide does well in covering how to get started in a very cheap and efficient way. I share many of my personal tips, tricks, suggested tools, apps, resources, supplies, etc.\n\nThis is my first real attempt at writing something of value so I hope you guys grab a copy and let me know what you think. Also, if you happen to not get a copy while it's free, and you are tight on money, just send me a message and I'll be happy help out.\n\nThanks for reading. I’m open to any critiques or questions as well. Cheers! http://flippingintoamazonfba.com/\n\n\nEDIT: Some are asking about not receiving an email. Don't worry, I will send one just before the ebook release directing you to the download. Later, if you guys are interested, I'm thinking I will also offer additional material such as my spreadsheet for tracking expenses, prices, item details, ROI, etc.\n\nEDIT: Hey! Sorry guys, I'm a bit delayed in the launch. I'm trying to make the best possible book I can and work out some kinks, so please allow me just a couple more days, please :) I will still be giving it away for free for awhile, so do not fret!\n\nEDIT: Ok, I ended up publishing the ebook with Amazon KDP. [It's available now](https://www.amazon.com/Flipping-Into-Amazon-FBA-Introduction-ebook/dp/B01FEQIZ42?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=flipping%20into%20amazon%20fba&amp;qid=1463001028&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1), but if you wait until May 16th, you can grab it for free :) Sorry for the long wait, guys.

{"id":"4gvmmo","author":"chinupcheerup","body":"We know that my husband's car needs to be replaced within the next 10,000 miles. It has blown through two CVT transmissions, thankfully both under warranty. We would like to replace it before the warranty on the most recent transmission ends, which is about 10,000 miles/end of summer. We would also like to get one of the new Costco credit cards, which come out in June. We currently have an Amazon card that we use and pay off in full every month, but we are faithful Costco shoppers and the rewards on it look better as an every day card for our situation.\n\nI have gathered from /r/pf that we should go for the car before the card, because we will have to get a loan for part of the amount, and the hard inquiry from opening the card, combined with the decrease in length of time of credit lines, will ding the credit score enough that we may not get as good of a rate.\n\nAm I right here? Should we hold off on the new CC for now and just focus on the car? Or will the inquiry for the new CC not be as big of a hurt as I am anticipating?\n\nNeither of us have requested our free reports in the last 12 months, so that is going to be my first step before the car or card happen.","name":"t3_4gvmmo","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-28 21:22:58","week":17}
{"id":"4gvq94","author":"wadarbr549","body":"REF  http://grindabuck.com/register?r=jcDN3s221tmVm5Q=    NON REF http://grindabuck.com/ \n\nHello folks there is a site called Grindabuck that isn't mentioned very often on this sub Reddit very often. Im not going to lie and say you will get rich by using this site, but it is a great way to make extra money. Today I wanted to share a few things about thids GPT site with everyone. Grindabuck is a GPT site in many ways it is similar to some of the other sites we all know and use it has several offer walls including Adgate, Peanut Labs, Adscend, Personally, MinuteStaff, and more. This month alone I have earned over 300$ on Grindabuck all from doing offers on there walls. here are links to screen shots of my PayPal account [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/A8e2bxF.png)   [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Prqkid2.png)   [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YAKhEDf.png) .\n\n\n\nGrindabuck pays out in BitCoin, Verified PayPal, Amazon, Walmart, Steam, and papa johns. The first time you cash out on this site the minimum is 10$ but after your first cash out the minimum cash out is lowered to 5$ and as your VIP Level raises your minimum cashout amount lowers. For example my minimum cashout is 1$ . Also Grindabuck pays out fast they have a 24 hour payment processing time but pay outs are usually processed in 6 to 12 hours. Grindabuck also gives there members a monthly bonus based on the amount of money they earn each month for example this month my bonus will be around 25$ and i will receive that on the first of the month. here is a link to information on how the monthly bonus system and the VIP system works on the site http://grindabuck.com/vip#monthly .\n\n\nGrindabuck is currently only accepting memberships from residents of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Australia. It is very important to use your real name and birth date when joining the site because you must verify your account when making your first cashout. This can be done 2 different ways. There is an automated system where you can use your Social Security Number to verify your ID. If you are not comfortable with that then you can manually verify your account by sending them a copy of a state picture ID . There are no exceptions to this rule if you are not comfortable verifying your account this way then you will not be able to cashout. It is a simple process and as long as you are honest there will not be any problems getting verified.\n\n\n\nthere are a few things that set Grindabuck apart from many of the other GPT sites and are the main reasons i use there site more than any other site. For starters they pay more on there offer walls than many other sites do. The next thing is that they offer full versions of the offer walls that they carry. If you do not know what I mean by this then go to the site and open up Peanut Labs, Adgate, or Revenue Universe. Grindabuck offers a much larger version of all of these walls than most sites do. I have not found any sites that have the amount of offers available on Peanut labs than Grindabuck does. The last reason I use Grindabuck more than other sites is because of the monthly bonus system whisch i mentioned above and have a link that shows the details. as i said earlier on the first of the month ill get around a 25$ bonus just for using the site.\n\n\n\nThey have a guide on the site that tells you how to do the offers on the wall and includes the most important information like setting up your browser properly and clearing cookies between offers. here is a link to there offer guide http://grindabuck.com/knowledgebase/  it is very easy to reach your fisrt 10$ on this site. if you follow the directions in this guide it can be done in a very short amount of time. If you have a brand new account there are enough easy offers on Peanut Labs and Adgate alone to reach this cash out very easiy.\n\n\n\nIf I missed anything or you have any questions please feel free to ask. \n","name":"t3_4gvq94","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-28 21:44:27","week":17}

{"id":"4gxtee","author":"IncendiaryGames","body":"I had a huge, expensive, learning experience. I'm still new to options trading. I was doing an earnings play on a bear call credit spread on Amazon and it turned into a loser after earnings. I was watching it carefully and in the last 15 minutes during Amazon's drop down to $600 I saw it flashed close to my max profit so I tried to close it out early but wasn't able to before the market closed. \n\nLooking back on this trade I should of set a limit good till cancelled order on the spread. I might of had a chance when option pricing was going wild.\n\nAre there any drawbacks to using this method to possibly get your gains on defined risk/defined reward option trades like spreads? I completely realize you shouldn't use this for a stop loss as the bid ask spread can become quite illiquid. How about for gains? Anyone have experience?

According to Webretailer.com despite the burst in interest, the number of sellers on the platform has remained at a constant of 2 million active sellers.  Why is this? The answer is simply people start run into some resistance and then quit.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe Resistance, Why They Quit\n\n\nMost sellers start the journey extremely optimistic with a distorted view of how competition is on Amazon.  They think simply picking a product in the Top 100, promoting it to a few friends, and turning on Facebook ads will turn them into overnight sensations.  After all, this is what they were told would happen after all the instructional Youtube videos, Udemy courses, and books.  This is not the case.\n\n \n\nSIMPLY PUTTING AN “IN DEMAND” PRODUCT ON AMAZON WILL NOT LEAD TO SUCCESS.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe Secret To Success on Amazon (PART1)\n\n\nThe secret to success on Amazon is one word, TRAFFIC. \n\n  \nThe more opportunities potential customers have to actually see your product the higher your chance to make sales.  Don’t get confused this is only the first part of the equation. If you start putting up banner ads, Google ads, Facebook ads, and directing them to your brand new product, you will get the same results you have been getting most likely 1 sale, every 5-6 days if you’re lucky. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe Correct Traffic Source\n\n\nIf you want the highest conversion on your product page, the correct traffic source to use is Amazon.\n\n\nMost forget Amazon itself is a search engine.  Who is more likely to buy the person who is actively looking for baking mats on a website (Amazon) that you can buy them on or the person that randomly liked a “baking” page on Amazon on a random Thursday when they were bored. \n\n\nThe first is that Amazon does all the heavy lifting for you.  Once Amazon sees your product as a profitable part of its catalogue it will begin to promote your product through retargeted ads, email marketing, and “Customers Also Bought…” ads. \n\n\n\n\nThe second principle is that Amazon is a keyword-based platform much like Google.  If you have your product target the keywords (this can be done both in the title and the backend keyword section) that generate sales this will give you great leverage when it comes to organic sales.  Of course where your product is located in the keyword results is tied to how many sales it garners as well. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe SERPS (Search Result Pages)\n\n\nYou will find on Amazon using a tool like the Junglescout app that estimates the number of sales a certain product has that the farther back you go the less money a product makes.\n\n\nCheck it out using the term baking mat.\n\n\n\nHere’s Page One… http://i.imgur.com/lzzSIDf.png\n\n\nPage Two… http://i.imgur.com/hVDoJ9B.png\n\n\nAnd Page Three… http://i.imgur.com/LSXBqMb.png\n\n\n\nThis is why ranking for a keyword is so important to sales for your product.\n\nKeywords\n\n\nAlways continue testing keywords for your product.  You should try to remove certain keywords from your listing.  You may want to try to add keywords in the back office of your product page.  You want to make sure you target all the keywords profitable to your product that bring traffic and thus sales. \n\n\n\n•\tUse Merchant Words and Amazon’s search suggestions to determine your main and secondary keywords for your product.  Focusing on your main keyword is a priority because the most searched for term gives you more opportunity to garner the sale.  Amazon Pay-Per-Click is a helpful tool for determining which keywords will lead you to the most sales. \n\n\n•\tFind your main keyword and promote it heavily.  When you reach page 1, begin focusing on your secondary keywords.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHow do I find these Keywords?\n\n\n1.\tType in a keyword, and click on the suggested keywords\n\n2.\tClick on the 1st 3 products (that aren’t sponsored ads)\n\n3.\tScroll down and look for the Amazon Bestseller rank in the top category for each\n\n4.\tThe keyword which has the most products with LOWEST (lower=better) Amazon Bestseller Rank in the top category for each\n\n5.\tIt means that on average that keyword is relevant to more best selling products\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHow Do I Rank? The Product Listing Page\n\n\nWhen potential customers search the keyword that leads to your product they have to choose your product over the others that appear.\n\n\nHere’s the elements that will help you draw the sale and rank consistently for your keyword. \n\n\n1.\tProduct Title: can drive a massive amount of traffic from Amazon because it is the primary source for keywords\n\n\n2.\tProduct Images: have to be highly quality, and stand out to SELL your product-- DRAW ATTENTION\n\n3.\tWell-written Product Description: learn to write sales copy, focus on benefits of the user and differentiate your product and others\n\n\n4.\tReviews: from your first customers to get social proof your product is worth the dollars; the more social proof (reviews) the better. \n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nA Little Secret about Product Detail Page\n\nMost Amazon Sellers are extremely lazy!  Do your best to get the best quality pictures and spend time on your listing.  Make your bullet points and description aid in the selling of your product.\n\n\n\nFor more detail go here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3nvor4/let_me_save_you_6000_dont_buy_an_amazon_course_5/\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nKeyword Rank Strategy\n\nIt's extremely important that you use the correct keywords when listing your product.  Amazon is a search-based platform.  This means that Amazon serves product search results in order that they are most relevant to the keyword searched (similar to Google).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSome Factors that Determine How Your Product Ranks for a Keyword\n\n\n1. Product Relevance to keyword (listed in title, back office keyword terms, reviews)\n\n\n2. Conversions upon being pulled through the specific keyword\n\n\n3. Number of sales through both the relevant and related keywords\n\n\n\nNote: The reason you use a launch service (to be covered later) is to increase all these factors so when people search your product's keywords it show up.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAmazon PPC: Keywords\n\n\nYou can usurp organic rank results by using Amazon's PPC platform.  But, where you rank in the organic search will result in higher conversions than PPC when it comes to impressions (number of times your product is in view of potential buyer on their computer screen).  Don't look at Amazon PPC as a savior to your product it is simply a traffic source not a magic sales generator. \n\n\nAmazon PPC can help raise keyword ranking if you find you continuously convert well for one or two keywords.  Do not depend on it to take you to page 1 though. \n\n\n\nJust check out Merchantwords.com a site where you can get estimates of how many times a keyword is searched a month. \n\n\n“Baking Mats” Keyword Results: http://imgur.com/WRRdti2\n\nCheck that out baking mat is searched 264,000 a month.  Imagine being on the first page of the search results for this keyword.  This 264,000 opportunities to make a sale. \n\n\nNow, you’re next question should be “how do I get to the 1st page of the search results.  The answer to this is in my highly controversial post (hint: SuperUrl)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3nvor4/let_me_save_you_6000_dont_buy_an_amazon_course_5/\n\nThis is only part of the solution; you can get this entire lecture for ABSOLUTELY FREE, I repeat absolutely free…by going to this Youtube link (Start at 4:45):  Selling on Amazon has been a big trend the past two years.

Do not depend on it to take you to page 1 though. \n\n\n\nJust check out Merchantwords.com a site where you can get estimates of how many times a keyword is searched a month. \n\n\n“Baking Mats” Keyword Results: http://imgur.com/WRRdti2\n\nCheck that out baking mat is searched 264,000 a month.  Imagine being on the first page of the search results for this keyword.

{"id":"4h2bq8","author":"collin_ph","body":"The stars happened to align for me. I have a friend from China who mass produced hoverboards and many wound up in the US after Amazon stopped selling them. One thing led to another and I sold several of them, but in the process made some connections and am putting together an Electronics store business here in Oklahoma. I have a great job, and the guy who's running it is a guy who started one of the largest stores here in Oklahoma (which is still running nicely), but it was sold out from underneath him. \n\nAnyway, due to some problems a couple of years ago, I have terrible credit (and haven't really needed credit until now).\n\nAnyway, the store is well funded, but I've put this deal together and I need to come up with $10K for my share of the store. I checked out a few places and wound up at Kabbage, but I'm not going to do business with them-- they're loan sharks. \n\nI need some advice on what to do next.  I'm bringing a pretty cool deal with me (I have a bunch of inventory of Amazon type items, cell phone chargers, etc.) that will lower our initial expense, but we still have to pay for them after we sell them.\n\nI'd rather just bring cash to the table when we start and do the inventory deal inside the store (as It's really hard to place a value on a \"good deal\").\n\nI'm thinking some kind of business/personal loan would be best for me. I can afford about $500/month out of my budget assuming no income from the store.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nSo, the question is: How's the best way for me to get my ownership in the store (being that I've put no hard cash into it at this point). I can get a loan (from various places) or perhaps negotiate for ownership without bringing much cash to the table. If I bring $10K to the table, I'll be about 1/6th owner based on cash basis (as the other investors have ponied up $50K).

{"id":"4h2c01","author":"sriram88","body":"Here are the plays I made this earnings week.\n\n1. NFLX 1 Apr 22 credit call spread 110/113 for $1.33- I was pretty confident about NFLX going down, I didn't buy the fact that they have increased there users. Also the fact that they are producing more shows isn't exactly improving there bottom-line.  \n\nP/L: $133\n\n2. Sold GOOGL 1 Apr 22 IC 720/725/825/830 for $1.34- 1.5SD iron condor, delta neutral position. Got a little bit scared post earnings release as they missed expectations and lowered projections. Closing price came close to $735. \n\nP/L: $134\n\n3. Sold AAPL 2 Apr 29 IC 95/98/110/113 for $1.10- I went a little over 1SD but not all the way to 1.5SD as the risk reward sucked. AAPL tanked on earnings real bad like never before and the stock opened at $96 the next day and my short puts were ITM. I do believe in AAPL and think it can go to $98 so I rolled my 95/98 put spread to May expiration. In doing this I had to buy back the 95/98 put spread for $0.88 and hence my loss went to $(0.88-0.37)*100*2=$102 for the time being. If AAPL does end up above $98 in May then I would profit $1.59*2*100=$318 on the put spread and hence make a profit eventually. Also, I let the call side expire which gave me $0.28*2*100=$56. Hence, this is a trade in progress and we will see what happens.\n\nP/L=-$102 at this time.\n\n4. Sold FB 3 Apr 29 IC 94/97/119/122 for $0.41- Again a little over 1SD trade. FB opened at $120 the next day. I panicked and sold the whole IC for a loss of $102. By the end of the day, the markets tanked and FB settled to $116 which was inside my IC and now I feel fucking stupid.\n\nP/L:-$102.\n\n5. Sold 2 AMZN Apr 29 IC 535/540/690/695 for $0.70- I made this trade when AMZN was trading at $615 in the day. 1SD was $50 so I went 1.5SD away. The problem was that AMZN closed at $605 for the day which made my position long delta. So I prayed for a earnings beat and AMZN delivered. Closing price today was $659 which made me full profit.\n\nP/L:$140\n\n6. Sold 10 CVX Apr 29 IC 97/100/108/111 for $0.20- I made this trade when CVX was trading at $104 during the day and had a 1SD of $2.5. So I made a trade with strikes $4 away. CVX closed at the end of the day at $102 and I was again at a situation where I was praying for earnings beat. CVX missed estimates but the stock still closed at $102.18 for the day. This was a trade that made me very nervous because of the leverage I was playing with. 10 contracts is a lot of leverage and max loss is in the thousands. One thing I learned after is that the call spread was only worth 1 cent and not worth doing at all (I paid more commissions than premium). In hindsight, I should have looked at the options chain more closely and placed my call spread closer.\n\nP/L:$200 \n\nTotal P/L=$403 excluding commissions. AAPL is still an open trade and I might gain/lose that trade but overall this earnings week has been good gambling. Some trades like google and amazon were highly profitable (&gt;30%) while some were low (CVX 7%). No YOLO by any means.

Should I say half of my new salary to account for only earning money during the second half of the year?  Should I just state the whole annual salary?  Can I put that salary at all considering I haven't started the job yet?\n\nAlso, is there any hope of starting out with a ~$2500 credit limit?

{"id":"4h5ial","author":"lucaspm98","body":"If you have an Android device, or even better an Android \"farm\", I highly suggest checking out Cash Pirate. I very rarely see it mentioned around here. It's one of the many apps that promise to pay you to download and try out apps, but it's by far the easiest and highest paying.\n\nCash Pirate has always been the most consistent app downloading program I've ever used, and I've tried them all. Basically all you do is go to the Earn Coins section, choose an offer wall, and download the apps to get credits. You just have to open them for around 30 seconds to be credited before deleting them. It's as simple as that!\n\nThe main benefit is their \"Pirate Picks\" that they post new apps on daily that don't show up on other app downloading programs. This is their own offers instead of the random offers from other companies that sometimes don't credit well. They pay great and I've never had a single one not credit. They also have the same offer walls as the other apps but pay more and credit 100% of apps downloaded.\n\nUse my code **BXZEMS** when signing up for a 50% bonus on your first 1000 points earned (500 point bonus equals $0.50). You have to use the code when signing up otherwise you can't use it later and you'll miss out on the bonus. Another plus for Cash Pirate is that it's available globally!\n\nI earn from $15-30 a month from Cash Pirate on my main device alone depending on how much time I put into it. I'll log in and install as many apps as I can, wait for them all to download, and open each of them for a few seconds. Make sure you get credited for all of them and repeat. I just redeem every time I hit 2300 points for $2.50 Amazon card, but there are tons of other rewards like PayPal as well. It has never taken a gift card more than 10 minutes to hit my email inbox.\n\nIf you have more android devices laying around, for instance if you have multiple devices for Perk, they allow you to use Cash Pirate on every one of those devices and download the same apps. The best part is that you can use refer all of those devices under your main account and get a 10% bonus on your main account. This can take your earnings from $20 a month to $100+.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask!","name":"t3_4h5ial","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-30 20:11:43","week":17}

I make calls from my cell with the Vonage Business app and the caller ID shows my business' main number. \n\nLive Chat would allow you to setup group chats and have \"agents\" log in. Zopim is what we use and it's great. \n\nTo tie it all together, we use an order and warehouse management system - there are a lot of them out there but we use StoneEdge Order Manager. Others include [Dydacomp](http://www.dydacomp.com/), [Order Dynamics](https://www.orderdynamics.com/), etc. A centralized order management system keeps ALL your customer data, order information, etc in one place. You can sell through multiple channels, like your own website, Amazon, eBay etc and everything downloads. \n\nWe notate all customer orders in Order Manager anytime we have contact with a customer. If they email, we paste the email into the system. If they call, we notate the call. If they are in live chat, we copy and paste the chat log as a note. Anytime we look up an order we have a series of notes (some automatic like shipment information or emails sent from the system itself) and some manual like when a customer calls. It's very organized and efficient and really helps when a customer calls with an issue and we can look up their order and see every interaction we have had with them.\n\nHope that helps!","name":"t1_d2funsi","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-04-25 00:36:44","week":17}

{"id":"d2g6htx","author":"moumouren","body":"This was a great analysis from a management consulting standpoint, but I think the author doesn't really understand where Apple is coming from. Take it from someone who has been following the company for a decade, both as an analyst and as a tech geek.\n\nFirstly, I think he is reading too much into management's plan to grow 'Services'. When Apple talks about focusing on Services, they are not referring to extracting a modular business segment out of the iDevice ecosystem and pushing for growth in 'Services' as a distinct business segment. I can understand why the author might think that, as his rationale stems from the fact that sales growth in the iPhone is moderating, hence management needs a new product line to replace slowing iPhone sales. As you can see from the way he contrasts hardware vs services and the different management strategies required to run them (i.e. gunpowder vs paint), his whole argument is built around 'Services' as the new growth story product line to eventually replace sales from the iPhone.\n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth. If you know Cook and Jobs, they are singularly focused on one thing: creating a great user experience that will make customers come back for more. When Cook and Maestri talk about pushing 'Services', they mean that they want to improve this relatively neglected segment of the entire ecosystem for the benefit of the ecosystem as a whole. The impetus for this stems from the comparison of Apple against Android, where fans of both sides have been complaining about iOS's lack of flexibility and customizability. (Android of course has its own drawbacks)\n\nWhat kind of services might Cook be thinking of? iOS has a huge amount of relatively stagnant infrastructure which has been far less optimized for sales than its competitors. e.g. walled garden means apps still can't communicate with each other as well as Android. Nobody really knows what Siri is, when in fact it has tons of potential real-world applications (look at Echo). The App Store is a labyrinth to navigate, and its structure penalizesdeserving apps from the top spot (unlike indie-friendly Playstation store). There still hasn't been a strong push into gaming, despite iPhones and iPads being nearly as powerful as consoles (iPad Pro = PS4). These are just some of the many 'Services' which fans and techies have been clamouring for for years, and which Apple make a big impact if they really wanted to.\n\nWhen Cook talks about improving 'Services', this is what he means. Tapping the unused potential in existing infrastructure and becoming a dominant force in *existing markets* where Apple is still small. He isn't trying to enter new markets by 'growing' a new division, the way the author describes. The iPhone/iPad will still remain as the face of the company - it's just going to become much more relevant to new people. It's not going to be like Amazon branching off into AWS - a totally different business - by leveraging on its existing infrastructure. So the concerns in the first half of his article is not wholly relevant.\n\nIt is also why Apple's insistence on staying 'focused', the concern in the 2nd half of his article, is not an issue. I understand why the author may think Apple's unitary organizational structure is a problem, in the context of his concerns. Not holding individual managers accountable to their respective P&amp;L's, e.g. by having separate divisional profits for Siri vs Apple Pay, is a problem when you're trying to grow 'Services' as a distinct business segment from the iPhone. On the other hand, if what you're pushing for is organically growing the existing segment by continuing to build on existing infrastructure (in contrast to cultivating a brand new segment by leveraging on existing infrastructure), then it definitely makes no sense to have managers view their respective segments as silos. You want them to see their segments as part of the greater picture, as contributory to the wider vision, and Cook's approach emphasizes that.\n\nPart of the reason why this could be effective at Apple but not at other companies could be due to the employee culture at Apple. Apple employees are extremely loyal to the company and have tremendous ownership in what they do, and because of that they're highly motivated to turn out something great, even if they're just a cog in the machine. They all buy into the CEO's vision: of creating a great user experience for the customer. This is another reason why having a single P&amp;L works for Apple, where it might not at other companies. It's not gunpowder and paint here; more like both sides contributing to creating a single mindblowing product, the atom bomb.

[Here](http://www.valuepenguin.com/amazon-com-rewards-credit-card)'s a review.\n\nFirst of all, you only get 3% cash back on Amazon. If you mostly care about Amazon rewards, you're better off with Discover It, which offers 5% cash back on Amazon for about half the year (buy yourself a gift card to use when there *isn't* cash back on Amazon). Actually it's really 10% for the first year because they double all points for the first year. Or use the Amazon Store card to get 5% back on Amazon year-round.\n\nSecondly, the sign-up bonus is low (~$30) and keeps getting lower. If you care more about sign-up bonuses, you're better off with Chase Sapphire Preferred ($500 to $625 sign-up bonus) or Barclay Arrival Plus ($400 sign up bonus). For both of those, make sure to cancel or downgrade after a year to avoid the annual fee.\n\nIf you spend $2k on amazon, you'd only earn $60 in rewards with the Amazon Visa... I'm not sure how much you spend on everything else, but unless you spend more than $20k-$30k on credit cards yearly, you're better off maximizing your rewards through sign-up bonuses.","name":"t1_d2g97tp","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-25 08:08:00","week":17}

{"id":"d2gedg5","author":"clamclam9","body":"You only have 6 items for sale, unless you're selling an item that has a high demand, most items take at least 1 week to sell up to many months or a year. The book for instance is the only copy listed, and none in completed. If you look on Amazon it actually has a decent rank but sells for $3.79 with free Prime shipping so it won't even be worth your time to send in or price match on eBay. I wouldn't even bother having this listing up and clogging up your dashboard.\n\nNext, looking at the Kalin 240mm quill stem. Yours in the only listing for that particular item, none in completed. Looking at other sized Kalen quill stems there are a handful in completed for $15-$20. The right buyer for yours might show up, but it will probably take many months if not a year. Also shipping is listed at $11, that can fit in a USPS flat rate padded envelope with a layer of bubble wrap around it for $6.80. You should set the listing to free shipping (on all your items) and add the shipping cost to the overall price (you need to make sure you understand how much shipping is going to be or you can lose money on an item). Play with USPS's calculator and always estimate off the farthest away Zipcode. For the quill stem I would list it as $17 + free shipping. That means $17 - $2.21 (13% eBay + Paypal fees) - $6.80 (shipping) leaves you with $8 profit.\n\nNext the toe clips and bike light. You should split these up into 2 listings. Very few people are looking for either of these items to begin with, very unlikely anyone wants both of them - even at a good price one of the items is essentially garbage so its irrelevant. The title sucks, no one is going to find it. You have to use keywords, right now the only people seeing the listing are searching for 'vintage bike light' or 'toe clips'. Very generic and unlikely the people searching for those terms are actually interested at all in your items. You should make a listing like \"Vintage Christophe Chrome Road Bike Toe Clips\". There's a decent amount of listings for them, and decent amount of completed listings for around $15. They're in better condition than yours though. No one is going to buy yours even at $9, when they can get shiny ones for $15. You should hit them with a toothbrush and some baking soda mixed with water into a paste. Retake photos and list them for $11 with free first class shipping if they weigh under 1lb (either in a bubble mailer or small box preferably). That is $11 - $1.43 (13% eBay + Paypal fees) - $3.30 (shipping) leaves you with $6.27 profit.\n\nThe light should be listed with a title like \"Vintage Panasonic 6V 3W Generator Bike Light\". There's a couple sold for $20+ in the last two months, and the weather is getting nice out so bike related items should be selling well. Price it at $17.95 with free shipping (should be under 1lb so it can go first class in a bubble mailer or preferably a small box) and it will probably sell in 1-2 months, maybe a couple weeks if you're lucky. That's $17.95 - $2.33 (13% eBay+Paypal fees) - $3.30 (shipping) leaves you with $12.32 profit.\n\nThe handlebars have no completed listings and with shipping and fees would probably only make you a couple dollars if they even sold, I wouldn't bother with them. The same goes with the raspberry pi case. Most people are going to buy the $3 one from China so don't even bother trying to sell little tiny cheap things like that, not worth the nickel in profit you'll make.","name":"t1_d2gedg5","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-25 13:18:20","week":17}

The first store I went to had even more of the item that I've been constantly selling. I don't understand, every time I go there I buy them out. I always ask if they have more and they reply no. I come back and sure enough there is an isle full of them. Decided to pass on it this time since I know no one is going to buy it (as no one did these past 3 weeks) and rather wait for my inventory to sell. Hopefully by the time mine sells, they will have dropped the price again.\n\nAnyways, passed on that but went to goodwill on my way back home and found a Logitech racing wheel set. I didn't even notice it at first since it was behind the jewelry case on the floor. Decided to look it up and it sells for $250 - $500 (eBay and Amazon prices). Can't sell it new on Amazon but doesn't matter since it sells for $330 - $500 used anyways. \n\nTalked to the manager (since he was the one that gave it to me) about dropping the price. It was marked $100 so I asked to buy it for $60. He laughed and asked me what was the price it's selling for. I said $180 on eBay (which was the first number I saw on a bid). He laughed again and said he'll do $80. I said how about $75... he said ok and I got it for $80 after tax!\n\nAnyways, here is everything I got so far. All for Amazon FBA.\nPaid / Sells For\n\n* Logitech Racing Wheel and Pads | $75 / $330 - $500\n* Keurig Coffee Holders | $13/each / $40\n* Xbox Cable | $8 / $30\n* Life Blu-Ray | $15 / $40 (though prices are dropping)\n\nAnother story.

{"id":"d2goz4k","author":"capcalhoon","body":"Those are some good choices. Here are my pros/cons on each:\n\n* Discover IT and Barclays- you know I like this pairing, you do have to remember to either downgrade or cancel after the first year or pay the annual fee. Again, not the worst thing in the world to try it out then downgrade. Also, forgot to mention the 40,000 sign up points come only after spending $3,000 in the first 90 days. Sounds like you can do this organically but remember to keep track.\n\n* Discover IT and Quicksilver (1.5% cashback)- I have the Quicksilver, they have an AWESOME current promo of 20% cash back on all Uber rides (I use this all the time) but it ends April 30th. The thing to consider with CapitalOne is they do pull from all three credit bureaus at once to issue; that means three hard pulls plus the Discover hard pull. Because of that I am not a huge fan of starting out with a CapitalOne card as that is a lot of hard credit pulls on your record at once. Also, these two cards are slightly redundant- they both give cash back for purchases at a set rate. If I were applying for two cards I would want different types of cards based on what my end goal was; this is why I like pairing an \"everyday spend\" card and a \"spend to get my travel wishes done\" card for targeted spend.\n\n* Discover IT and Citi Double Cash (2% cashback)- I ALSO have the Double Cash back card; you have been to the churning subreddit so you know how crazy we all get. Same thing with the Quicksilver; both the Discover and the DoubleCash are \"get straight cash back on all purchases at the same rate\" type cards. I would say it is redundant to get both and just choose one until you get the hang of the credit card game.\n\nSo, if you just want a simple strategy of straight cash back then just get one card and choose between the Discover, Quicksilver, or Double Cash and put 100% of your spend on it. If you want to diversify and maybe get some more value out of a good sign up bonus/category spend then look into one of those three cards and pair it with a travel or category-specific card. If you are into Disney there is a card for that spend, if you are super into Amazon purchases there is one for that as well. If you want to maximize travel there is a card for every airline and hotel chain; if you have a specific home airport or dream destination you can use that info to apply for the right card. Or, again, if you just want to keep it simple then go for one of the three cash back cards.\n\nAgain, don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, I am in a waiting pattern at work to hear back from a client so have a few hours to kill!","name":"t1_d2goz4k","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-04-25 18:23:29","week":17}

{"id":"d2grgb4","author":"capcalhoon","body":"The Discover can get you 5% on Amazon 9 months of the year; there is a rotating bonus category every 3 months and, for 2016, Q1 was gas stations (where I bought amazon gift cards for myself), Q3 is home improvement (you can buy amazon gift cards at Home Depot) as well as amazon.com and Q4 is holiday shopping (which includes amazon.com). \n\nSo I would think Discover can be your everyday cash back card/quarterly bonus category card. For travel, have you considered a Chase hotel card? So either the Chase IHG card or Chase Hyatt card offer no FTFs, will give you a nice sign up bonus (60,000 IHG points or 2 nights at any Hyatt) and if you keep the card after the first year and pay the annual fee you actually get a free night at their properties each year. \n\nI think the IHG is a better card so let me use that as an example- you get the card and get 60,000 points (let me research, there might be a better offer). You can use that to book Holiday Inns, Crown Plazas, Intercontinental Hotel, etc. You get no FTF and if you travel and use the card at those hotels you get like 10x the points for every dollar spent. After the first year you can keep the card if you pay the $49 annual fee BUT you also get a free night at ANY property each year, even their ultra expensive Intercontinental!

This is a common trend when it comes to churning. Do that for 1 plat card, then for another, then for another, etc. \"Worst\" case scenario you're paying $50  to trade $400 in cash with $400 gift card, global entry, priority pass, centurion lounge access, 0-100k MR, etc. Best case scenario you're getting all above for free.\n\nYou can compare Plat with Prestige all you want but Amex won't and that is my point. Why? Because they know prestige isn't sustainable and won't last in its current state for long. You really think it is going to be as it is with $250 credit + golf credit + better priority pass + 4th night hotel? Think again. Prestige has undergone changes at least twice already.\n\nFYI, I've prestige. It is a great card but as I said before it won't last as it is now.

I did go through some of the threads on the sidebar and it is helpful. Here is my current situation:\n\nActive credit cards:\n\n1. Arrival Plus\n2. IHG\n3. BOA (not really used, but since this is my oldest card, I keep it open) I also get roughly 5% cash back for gas since I am a platinum BOA member\n4. Mattress firm (opened only to get the 0% apr for 1 year) - opened in september '15\n5. HHgregg (opened only to get 0% apr for 3 years) - opened in september '15\n6. Amazon CC  - opened about 10 months ago. \n\nPrimary goal of my churning would be primarily for funding vacations. I recycle 2 big vacations every 4-5 years. One being disney world and the other being Hong Kong (have family there). We take smaller vacations between the big ones. \n\nIt seems to me that I may not have the best credit card setup for what I am shooting for. At disney we always stay on property and after reviewing the disney credit card it seems that my best option there is to stick with a travel rewards card (arrival plus). I understand that SPG would be a good option, but we really like staying on the monorail, so I am all ears if there is a better option out there. We also drive to disney as it is only 2 states away. And flying would take just as long because we are in a state with no direct flights to orlando. \n\nAs far as flying overseas to HK, I tend to cash in on the arrival plus points saved up and generally can afford one plane ticket. We honestly do not fly very often so I never really looked into a airline credit card. I have been relying on my arrival plus card here as well especially with the barclay rewardsboost using expedia. When in HK I tend to stay at the Crown Plaza hotel and this is where my IHG credit card comes in. I find for $50 annually, this seems to be the best bang for my buck with all the promos IHG runs throughout the year. \n\n\nSo my question is given my 2 most big ticket expenditures what can I do to maximize savings in terms of credit card churning? It may help to know that the vacations we take between HK and disney are much smaller. This is where I usually use my IHG credit card to collect points with hotel stays.

{"id":"d2iaeic","author":"nannooo","body":"Alright. I was in your position 3 years ago. I bought about 5 sites from Flippa. Most of them had revenue already and / or a stable userbase. Or so I thought... I am not that kind of guy who spends 1-2k just instantly on a website. I do my research, but all of the tricked me at some point. \n\nLet's sum up a few of the sites I bought: \n\n**1 Amazon search engine, making $500/month.**\n\nIt was basically a search engine with affiliate deals on it. Getting 1000's of page views every month. All of it was paid traffic. This guy had great reviews on his profile. 100% positive over 10 sales. All of the websites were somewhat the same and it looked really legit. \n\nBefore making an offer, I wanted to find out more. I asked for GA access and wanted to see his revenue in Amazone. He showed it all. The GA was legit. All of it was paid traffic (red flag, I found out later) and the people really interacted with the content.\n\nHe made screenshots of his revenue on Amazon. It was real. He even hooked up my Amazon ID and I got some revenue on the hours that it was on there. I was convinced that this worked. I hadn't found out a reason why it wouldn't work. So I bought this website from him for a couple of thousand dollars (can't remember the exact amount). \n\nIn the upcoming days he placed my ID back on the website. The traffic was still coming and I sold a few items. I believe I made 30 dollars in commission in a few days. Nice! Unfortunately he stopped responding to my messages after a few days and never told me were he got the paid traffic from and he didn't transfer the website. After two weeks Amazon abandoned my account. According to them a search engine based on affiliate offers is against their policy. I never got any money from Amazon. Well that's it.\n\nHe got banned after a few weeks.\n\n**2 Blog with 15k uniques / month making 100 dollars per month**\n\nAlright. After the first mess up, I tried something different. Something that should have worked. This guy made about 100 dollars in profit from the blog with some paid links and advertisement. The blog was over 6 years old and was ranked quiet well in google's SERP. He had a spread sheet with all of the contacts who had advertised with him. He showed my his GA and at that time I couldn't find any problem with this website. He placed one article per week on the website and got returning visitors. On the other hand, the site looked horrible. The design was not optimized for mobile devices and the colors were not *my style*. I thought: this is my chance to double the amount of visitors. This guy had a 100% positive account as well and many good reviews. \n\nI decided to buy it. Transaction went very smooth and the amount of users started to grow. At some point I was posting 2 articles per day and getting 500 unique visitors per day, with Adsense in place I made a couple of bucks, but not like I expected. I made 2 dollars per month.\nThis guy made his money by selling links (this is very bad for your SEO) and I didn't want to go that way, so I replaced the links with advertisements. \n\nAt some point the traffic dropped and I was still making the same amount of money with advertisements. Turned out: he had some kind of visitor generator running on the website. Just long enough that people gave him a good review on Flippa. Well, great....\n\n**3 Wix alike custom website.**\n\nThis website was quiet advanced as people were able to create there own website. It created subdomains and email address autopilot. Websites were up in minutes. I investigated everything after the last two failures. I even got an admin account from the owner on this website to check the back-end out. Pretty nice. One thing I couldn't get a grip of was the source code. \nHe claimed everything was unique build. From the design to the back-end. It seemed legit. \n\nTurned out: The code was (partly) indeed one of a kind, but it was one mess. Vulnerable for SQL-injections and nothing was structured. Just one **big** mess. The developer of the website (which was not the seller) was willing to work with me on new features, but was asking ridiculous amounts of money (2-3x as much as I paid for the whole website). The front-end was a standard theme. I had to give up on this one.\n\n**NOTE:** With all of the sales, there were red flags, which I couldn't identify at that time. I am sure there are some good sites on Flippa, but just be careful if you want to go that way. I might have seen only one side (the bad one) of buying websites. Above are some of the things you should check out before you make a bid. \nI was not much into online business and just wanted to make a couple of extra bucks. THAT is not what should be your goal. You need to have some sort of a passion and some technical and marketing knowledge on how websites work and how to make them work. Also, there is no such thing as a website who runs on 'autopilot'. It needs work to make it work. Constantly.\n\nI won't buy any site from Flippa anymore, I would rather build it from scratch.\n\nOne last note: I have had over 40 conversations with different sellers on Flippa and I looked back a while ago to those. Turned out 70% of them got either banned or suspended. I might have been out of luck a long time or reacted on the wrong kind of website, but...\n","name":"t1_d2iaeic","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-26 20:57:25","week":17}
{"id":"d2ibeqi","author":"atomstartup","body":"I would suggest you try the affiliate route, but first you need to  understand your audience demographics before you can make an informed decision. Amazon has a very good affiliate program you can join. But like I said you need to understand who your audience are. For instance it wouldn't make sense to join Amazon's US associate program, if most of your traffic audience are from the UK in that case it will be best to join Amazon's UK associates. I'm also guessing that since it's an Economics blog most of your audience are students who come to understand your simplified Economics. You could make affiliate commissions by pointing these students to the books you read in order to come out with your blog posts as further reading. The good thing about Amazon is that their cookies are sitewide, that is anything that somebody buys through your cookie you make a commission regardless of it not having anything to do with your link.","name":"t1_d2ibeqi","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-26 21:18:53","week":17}

It will also give you some insight into the world of investing and saving once you're debt free.\n\n**Edit**: Also you mentioned closing the accounts once you pay them off. I would advise against this *unless* they have an annual fee. If there's no annual fee, just let these accounts sit, maybe put a recurring monthly charge on them like Netflix or your electric bill. Having more accounts helps your credit. (Dave Ramsey gives an alternative where you close all accounts and have no credit score at all.

{"id":"d2j8buy","author":"MikeFallopian","body":"Hello, I'm new around here. I've been using credit cards to get cash back for a while now. I've even signed up for a card to get the signup bonus a couple times when I had a big purchase lined up. But I never read about trying to maximize the value of my points or signed up for a bunch of cards around the same time. I've always been a cash back person because I didn't understand how much a mile/point was really worth (just give me my cash back!) and always felt I didn't fly/spend enough to amass enough points for a trip.\n\nI applied for the amex PRG on 4/16 and somehow found my way to /r/churning after reading about CCs online. Now, after reading a bunch of the topics here, I understand how points can be more valuable than cash back and how it is possible to collect enough points to get flights. I'm excited to figure out the best cards to apply for and hopefully get enough points for some amazing travel!\n\nSince finding /r/churning I've applied and was approved for my first new card, the CSP, making it the first card I've successfully churned (I had it back in 2012). Now I'd like some help figuring out the optimal path forward with new cards.\n\nOkay, enough story time, here are my stats:\n\n-----\n\nFAKO score: 816 TransUnion, 804 Equifax\n\ncurrent cards:\n\n|Approval Date|Card|\n|--------------|-----|\n|5/1/2011 |Chase Freedom|\n|6/8/2011\t|Chase Amazon|\n|3/14/2012\t|Chase Sapphire Preferred|\n|4/21/2014\t|CapitalOne Quicksilver|\n|6/8/2015\t|Citi ThankYou Premier|\n|4/16/2016\t|Amex Premier Rewards Gold|\n4/21/2016\t|Chase Sapphire Preferred|\n\n-------\n\nMy goal is to try to amass points while being smart about which cards I apply for as to not disqualify me for another card in the future (mainly referencing 5/24 here). It would be amazing if I could use the points for a trip to New Zealand that will probably happen around January. I realize I might be getting a late start, but I figure if it doesn't work out, I will have points for the next trip.\n\nI have around 34k (flight to South Africa, Australia, and others... compare that to a single signup bonus) United miles already and it looks like I can get 2 RT tickets to NZ for 160k points. Since UR transfer to United, a few chase cards have nice signup bonuses, and it makes sense to get them first due to 5/24, I was planning on targeting chase first. Do you agree that United is my best bet? I fly out of DC (IAD, DCA, or BWI if necessary)\n\nSo my tentative plan forward is to apply for the Ink+ next. How long should I wait considering I applied to two cards in the last two weeks? I was also targeted for an amex platinum 100k for 3k spend in 3 months that I'd like to go for (expires June 17). I'm thinking of waiting to June to stagger the credit requests and min spend as much as possible. Also, being targeted is not the same as being pre-approved, correct? So it's possible that my recent and near future hard pulls would affect my ability to get approved. Do you think I have to worry about that?\n\nGoing Ink then Amex plat would disqualify me from getting the FU, but I figure I could use that as a card to downgrade to in the future. Or should I sneak the FU in between the Ink+ and amex? Looking a little further out, should I start going for chase co-brand cards before 5/24 is applied to them? Is Ink+, Amex Platinum, Chase co-brands my best path forward?\n\nI think the CSP and Ink+ alone should get me to my 160k target:\n34k + 55k (CSP + AU bonus) + 60k (Ink+) + 9k (1% back on CSP + Ink+ min spend)  = 158k\nI should easily be able to get that extra 2k if some of my CSP or Ink spend is in the bonus categories. So maybe its possible to hit my points for a January trip if all goes according to plan.\n\nSorry for the lengthy post. I'd appreciate any advice if you managed to make it all the way through.","name":"t1_d2j8buy","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-04-27 14:43:24","week":17}

Level 3 requirements only require you to fill out your profile to jump to Tier 3. \n\nI'm not sure the ratio for earnings to prize cost is really bang for buck for everyone vs existing sites. Obviously, you have to take into account how much each offer/survey offers but the payouts don't seem out of the norm. While different reward sites may have different denominations I wanted to give a quick comparison as the idea remains the same that you would need double the points to claim the prize on rewardshoppping vs other sites to claim the same prize.\n\n**Rewardshopping**:\n$10 Amazon GC: 20,000 points\n\n**Swagbucks**:\n$10 Amazon GC: 1000 SB\n\n**InstaGC**: \n$10 Amazon GC: 1000 Points\n\n**Prizerebel**: \n$10 Amazon GC: 1000 points\n\nIn addition, there are improvements they could make to their tier system. Even at their gold, platinum(which requires you to pay), or diamond level the minimum pending reward claim is 7 days. At Prizerebel, we would probably at max take 2-3 business days for all members with the majority of users getting their prizes instant. I'm sure that applies for most of the other reward sites as well. Attached a screenshot below of rewards page and tier levels.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/IdFnK\n\nIn terms of way to earn points, I don't see anything that really differentiates themselves. They only have one offer wall for surveys and mostly just offers. They really need to build up an inventory to be beneficial for users. \n\nFinally, the reward button is my biggest gripe. I know its all RNG( randomly generated) in terms of how many points I'll get but out of my daily 25 spins I only won once for 20 points. It might as well be changed to one daily spin a day to get the most use. \n\nHopefully they'll work on these changes as I think it would benefit them as well as the users!","name":"t1_d2jo273","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-04-27 20:50:29","week":17}

The Starbucks will lure people in, the book covers will entice people to buy.\n\nParents will still take their Children to bookstores.

It took a couple months to get everything in just because they decided it'd be worth it to save in areas they knew for a fact they could save, to allow for mishaps down the road. They're still in business through their own site and Amazon.

Or he may not even have this at all. However, the business owner has some really good reviews in multiple sites\n\nSolution #1: Reviewmetrics allows for any business owner to easily place a continous feed of reviews from multiple review sites (Yelp, FB, Google, TB, foursquare etc.) to immediately show credibility to potential customers. All with just a copy/paste of an embedded code. No more touching after that, it updates by itself. \n\nProblem #2: Business owners have multiple locations and/or are represented in various review sites like Yelp, FB, Google, Foursquare, Amazon etc. but don't want to waste time sorting through all the different sites to find bad reviews to reply or attend.

Business owners get notifications via email and/or text when a new review is posted. They can also sort by location and respond accordingly. The tool also allows them to view insights, trends and other useful analytics regarding their reviews. \n\nThis is the MVP concept and depending on the validation and feedback, it can definitely add more services/layers on top of this such as dispute/conflict resolution etc. ","name":"t1_d2k8uux","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-28 05:13:40","week":17}

{"id":"d2ki4jj","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"Before I start, I'll refer to this article (which I recommend reading): http://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen/2016/02/29/sears-holdings-retailings-headless-horseman/#6782bde1deb9  which is a brutal look at how fucked up Sears has become under Eddie Lampert's reign and includes this: \"The hard and cold reality is that Sears Holdings will disappear. The only question yet to be answered is when. Sears Holdings eventual demise will bring with it the closure of almost 2000 mall and off mall stores. Though some locations may be successfully repurposed by either Lampert’s Seritage Real Estate Trust, or other involved landlords, most may very well go dark and stay dark. Coupled with store closings at Macy’s, JC Penney JCP +1.48%, other mall anchors and specialty tenants, Sears’ closures may signal the eventual death rattle of many of the B, C and D level malls throughout the US.\" That's not something I disagree with.\n\nYears ago, Bruce Berkowitz said that Sears was worth North of $150 based upon the real estate and other factors. Today, Sears is in the teens (although it has spun-off a REIT and a number of other assets, most of which have been some degree of crap.) Berkowitz, who is still the largest stockholder aside from CEO Eddie Lampert, has gone activist on Sears. Berkowitz was buying when Sears was well over $100. Berkowitz and his adventures in crappy retail have been going on probably at least around 7-8 years now with not a lot to show from it aside from much less AUM at Fairholme than there was years ago when Berkowitz was Morningstar's Manager of the Decade. 7 or so years later, there's also a lot of opportunity cost as Berkowitz has waited for his thesis on Sears to pay off and the stock has headed lower. Now the fund is nearly at the bottom of the category YTD, 1YR, 3YR and 5YR and not looking to great on 10YR performance at this point. \n\nYears ago, Berkowitz made his case for that Sears retail was worth oodles, in one slide comparing Sears to Simon Property and GGP in terms of square footage. Firstly, Simon Property and GGP have class A real estate. As much as I hate the mall from an investment standpoint, those two operators have crown jewel assets. Sears has a ton of K-Mart properties that will probably sit abandoned, not to mention many Sears stores that will probably have serious difficulty finding a new tenant.\n\nElsewhere, JCP, Kohls and others are going to be trying to sell retail real estate into a market that's over-saturated already. Eddie Lampert may still have a grand financial engineering finale planned for Sears, but for Fairholme investors, it's been seven long years of waiting and wondering what the fuck Bruce was thinking. Given the fact that he had to go activist against Sears, perhaps Bruce is - to some degree - wondering what the fuck he was thinking, too. Lampert has badly mismanaged the chain, initially neglecting the fuck out of it, then more recently talking about a \"turnaround\" that makes him seem completely delusional after how poorly he's treated the company.  Lampert's prior shareholder letter complaining about how companies like Uber and Amazon are treated differently than Sears just made matters worse.\n\n\"So let's go back to 2006 -- shortly after Lampert orchestrated the merger of Sears and K-Mart and took the reins of the newly formed Sears Holdings. At the time, Sears' enterprise value stood at $22 billion, it took in $49 billion in annual revenue and made $2.2 billion in cash from operations. Today, its enterprise value is around $4 billion, and it's been five years since the company reported a profit.By any financial measure -- sales, profit, cash flow -- Lampert has done nothing but rip apart the retailer. He's also saddled it with a lot of debt, tapping $5 billion in two years from capital raises and asset sales. He's sold off divisions such as Lands End and Sears Canada and spun off the bulk of the company's best properties into a real estate investment trust. He used all of that money to fund the operations of a company that continues to bleed cash.\" (http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-02-26/eddie-lampert-s-sears-promises-lack-results.)\n\nBut Eddie continues to play a \"heads I win, tails I win\" game with Sears, loaning the company money with a loan backed by choice real estate and again the other day, with Lampert and Cascade (Bill Gates' fund) loaning Sears money backed by mortgages.\n\nDoes Macy's have genuinely high quality real estate? I'd say yes. Will the stock suddenly jump to $70? Probably not, although spinning off real estate may boost value. Macy's having valuable real estate has been discussed for a while now, it has not stopped the stock from having a huge decline over the last year or so. As that article mentions, financial engineering does not help the fact that the core business has problems that need to be addressed. Eddie Lampert has caused tremendous value destruction at Sears with his attempts at financial engineering, turning the retailer into a financial engineering Frankenstein, with the retailer losing obscene amounts of money. Ackman did well with GGP (and becoming chairman of Howard Hughes, whose assets at GGP before spin-off were referred to as \"Shitco\"), but was denied by Target, Borders went under and his time with JCP is not well-regarded. Still, long-term I'm certainly more positive about Macy's than the \"will be a case study in business schools\" disaster that is Eddie Lampert's Sears. \n\nFor me, it all goes back to: do I feel strongly about the core business, do I have a thesis as to why I would want to own the company longer-term?  That's really what it comes down to for me: I want to own something where I have a very strong degree of certainty about my view of the strength of the business as a whole. People can do very well making bets on catalysts, but I personally don't want to bet on a catalyst where I don't feel 110% about the underlying business.  That's not to say that I want to own something forever, but if I'm investing it's with the idea that I am very comfortable with the idea of holding it for 5-10 years+ and feel 110% about the underlying business. If there is a catalyst potentially there (company is the subject of acquisition rumors, underlying real estate discussion, whatever), would I want to own it long-term for reasons beyond that if those catalysts did not occur or did not achieve the rumored results?\n\n If the retail is not spun-off or is not the value creation that is hoped, do I like Macy's? Not really. As I've said in other threads, I do not want to have exposure to the mall. I just think that the era of the mall in the US is drawing to a close. That's not to say that there won't be malls, but that in the years ahead, operators are going to have to evolve and really create more of a lifestyle destination. Many of the generic, \"dime-a-dozen\" malls that dot the landscape are going to either be sold or abandoned. \n\nTLDR: Macy's absolutely may unlock value with the real estate, but that isn't going to fix problems elsewhere at the company. Private equity could be interested in purchasing Macy's, but that's such a maybe. The stock may absolutely do very well (I'd consider Starboard a very strong activist fund) if they go through with it (although without trying to fix underlying problems, how sustainable the boost is who knows), but I'm okay missing out on that. \n","name":"t1_d2ki4jj","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-28 11:54:06","week":17}

{"id":"d2knexu","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"I think there is a desire to invest in things that they know and understand and furthermore, I think there is a desire for younger people to be able to talk to other people about how \"I'm invested in Tesla.\"\n\nPersonally,  I don't get annoyed with the focus on hype in here when people own it to a reasonable degree, but it rarely seems like it is. I have actually said: have a strong, core portfolio and leave a smaller portion for speculation, which forces you to be selective about more speculative investments.\n\nBut instead, you get Reddit portfolios that are AMZN, TSLA, NFLX, GOOGL, FB, DIS etc. When things are going well, everything is awesome. When things are not going well, they're posting on here \"OMG WTF IS HAPPENING!?!?!?!?!\" and they find out their tolerance for risk.\n\nThe idea that I've tried to offer on here (and my philosophy is if you want to listen, great, if not, fine) is to try and adjust people's view towards creating something that is more consistent and stable, but allows them to have some portion of their portfolio that is meant for such investments. It also tries to address long-term risk tolerance, as well. Ultimately, investing is a marathon and I think people (eventually) have to start looking at it as such. I think rarely does panic serve people well, and the idea is trying to get people in a place with their investments that's a little more consistent and stable over the longer haul so that they're not just like \"fuck this I'm out\" and just hit the sell button on everything when times get bad.\n\nI own some more speculative names. I own things like Equinix (EQIX), but there was definitely a strong thesis behind that investment and the view that this was something I viewed as potentially owning for 5-10 years. However, being a REIT, in the meantime, I'm at least getting a moderate dividend. Plus, it's definitely done well.\n\nI'm not advocating no risk by any means; it becomes orchestrating a more balanced portfolio and having a very strong sense of risk tolerance. I have Equinix (EQIX), but I also own railroads and things like Ecolab (ECL). Ecolab is not sexy. They sell things like this Lockheed Martin-esque fly warfare device (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rATU3Rn6O5Y) and they are the largest hygiene/sanitation company. However, what I do find attractive is that the majority of the business is essential consumables that have to be replenished by businesses of all shapes and sizes again and again and again. Lots of highly recurring revenue and products that businesses have to use. They deal with food safety, too, which - as we have seen with a certain chain recently - is an issue. \n\nWhat I own are  my best ideas. Someone else's best ideas are probably not going to be mine and that's great. If you own your best ideas - companies you feel really strongly about and have researched considerably -  and your risk tolerance is appropriate, times like January and February are not going to be fun, but you're not likely going to be panicking and puking up your portfolio, either.  And if you are not panicking and are looking at markets with a clear view in a time like Jan/Feb, you will find opportunities.\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_d2knexu","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-04-28 15:34:08","week":17}

Unfortunately, despite the fact that Bitcoin is really cool and there are some great apps out there, Bitcoin isn't mature enough, widely adopted enough or easy enough to get your grandmother to pay for her news using it. What's more, micropayments being made on the blockchain will quickly raise the cost of doing transactions to the point where micro transactions will occur off-chain anyway, and as such we decided to use a non-Bitcoin system as our solution. That said, some of the ideas for the construction of our app were based on the ideas behind Bitcoin, and we will accept Bitcoin payments on our platform. \n\n&gt; What are you using to make this?\n\nIt is running on Node.js+express+angular on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk + DynamoDB. Stripe is our payment processor. \n\n&gt; Also what will you do about getting a lot of people on board with this?\n\nWe really think that there is a market for people to pay for unique and original content, but we have to show we are committed to supporting content creators. We really want to make publishers trust us, so they will have full access to anonymised data on users on their sites so they can trust us an know that they are getting the maximum value out of our relationship with them. \n\n&gt; What do you think of Apple's news app?\n\nSlick and easy to pay but there are two problems. Firstly, only a small proportion of the population actually use Apple devices, so they are limiting themselves from the outset. More importantly, they limit the type of content that can appear on their platform. It is not working from the providers' own website, it is an aggregation service, and hence custom content is hard to get into their news app. \n","name":"t1_d2lsr9i","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-04-29 08:39:58","week":17}

I'm sure someone can come up with a story or an example of how I'm wrong. And its true, some people have made it rich off of penny stocks. But there are a lot of people that have gone broke doing it, as well.\npersonally, I would suggest you get rich slowly and invest in safer companies. Its not as much fun, you might not make as much money, but at least you won't lose it all.\n\nAs for investing in penny stocks online, you'll need a broker. One that will work with low priced stocks, as well. There will probably be extra restrictions. I don't have too many suggestions on brokers for that. If you come across some names I may be able to suggest further.\nAs for the last two questions, I'm not sure on personal investing in work account. You'll have to read the terms and conditions.\nLet me just reiterate my point about getting rich slowly. Is it exciting buying, say, $UL (unilever) and letting it grow and reinvest dividends? Nope. Not really. But its better than losing a few thousand dollars. You could also invest in an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), or maybe you'd be more interested in Facebook ($FB) or Amazon ($AMZN)? FB and AMZN are faster growers, but are riskier. Theres a lot to learn in investing.

Spend less, and get yourself out of debt as priority one, especially the credit card debt. Start anticipating and tracking your expenses/expenditures so that they aren't always \"needs\" and surprises.\n\nTrack your lease information. Don't go over mileage, and take care of the car. You \"need\" to turn this car back in at the end of the lease, and you \"need\" to be ready for it, so have $3,000 - $4,000 ready to buy a car in its place so that you aren't paying for a lease, as well as full coverage insurance, etc. Another thing is to track your other spending. Are you eating out? Stop. Are you going to the movies, paying $40 or more for 2 hours of enjoyment? Stop doing that, as you can rent a movie on Apple itunes, Amazon, or Google play for $3-$5.

Yes, some are better than others so use your discretion when it comes to that. But depending on your niche, you can become an affiliate for well-known websites such as Amazon or even GoDaddy. The opportunities are limitless. \n\n2. Email Marketing - I'm sure you're building up a list with your website but if you aren't you should mos definitely look into that. Email marketing companies such as Mailjet are a great way to grow your list and begin serving them up emails to further build that relationship, which leads into the next point.\n\n3. Sell Your Knowledge - Many people probably want to learn how you achieved XYZ with your business, so sell your knowledge. This can be an eBook which you can sell on your site or using a company such as Gumroad. Or you can create an online course and sell access to that. The key thing is you have three ways to sell it to your audience: your email list, your facebook group and your website.

{"id":"d2mof6j","author":"serialboss","body":"I wrote an answer to a similar question in an older Reddit thread. Pasting it here below for you and tweaking it to better suit your question! But I might be able to help more if I know what type of product are you selling and what retailers you want to solicit?\n\nHere's my Reddit answer:\n\nI sell children's products (toys for girls age 0-6) to small and big box retail stores all over the country. I started with literally 0 sales experience so I think I can offer you some insights.\n\nSome background - I worked at Macy's Corporate (NYC) on the buying team for cosmetics and then later for home products, so I really got to know the \"mind\" of the buyer and I think that's what's made my pitching techniques so successful when I switched to the sell side. Now, I sell stores like Walmart, Toys R Us, Zulily.com, Amazon, HEB, Kroger, etc. as well as small boutiques, local chains and more.\n\nI hope this helps! I'm not sure what the rules are for posting links, but I have a blog focused totally on this topic so private message me if you'd like more info. Happy to share.\n\n**Step #1 - make a list of the retailers you want to reach out to.** I'd start with a general Google search for your product category. Whoever pops up first are usually the big guys to note.\n\n**Keep in mind that some of the best retailers you might not even be aware of yet!** For example, when I first started in \"toys\" I never thought grocery stores had anything to do with that. I figured my best toy buyers would be places like Toys R Us, Babies R Us, FAO Schwarz, etc. Guess what? It turns out there's a major market for toys happening in grocery chains and they're now a huge portion of my business! Same goes for rest stops off the high ways (kids always picking up new toys there), airport shops, etc.\n\nThink outside the box for the non-obvious answers! There's usually less competition in those realms.\n\n**Smaller regional chains (5-20 stores) are great to start with too. **Their buying procedures are usually much less complex, it's way easier to get in touch, and it's way easier to get a \"YES\" than it would be reaching out to someone like a Walmart. Plus, if you succeed in stores like this, it's GREAT leverage to use when you finally start approaching the bigger guys.\n\n**Larger retailers LOVE knowing your product is already a success story.** I once landed a major retailer (who continually ignored me) by telling them via cold email that \"I'm having great success with X item at a similar retail store - we sold $XX dollars year-to-date and we're turning product X times/month. The item is proven. I think it would be a great opportunity for your stores too.\" I got a reply QUICK.\n\nThey love easy wins focused on sales, margin, and turn. USE THOSE KEY WORDS if you can!\n\n**Step #2 - Get personal contact info. Don't submit your product or your company through a \"new vendor\" portal on their site.** While I know this is \"protocol\" for some retailers, it's essentially a dead end in my opinion. It could take months to hear back and you never know if it got to the right person. Instead, find the exact buyers' names on Linkedin. Contact the buyer directly via private message or email.\n\n**Step #3 - Perfect the pitch. Write an email that is CONCISE and to the point. Introduce yourself in 1 sentence or less.** No one really cares about your \"story\" or \"company history\" or all that other fluff we add in. They'll hear more about it later.\n\nInstead, get right to the point. \"Hi, my name is [X] and I'm the [TITLE] from [X company].\" is enough as an intro. Make a direct request immediately (whether it be for a meeting to show your product, permission to send samples, etc). Attach a photo or link - something that gets them interested. \n\n**The shorter, less \"beggy\" your email is, the more enticing it'll be.** Buyers get solicited all day long and hear the same over-lengthy, over-fluffed pitch continually. Be concise. That's what will make you stick out. Be confident. \n\nRe-read your email before hitting send and ask yourself:\n\nDo I sound like I'm begging/desperate? If so, change it. Imagine that you're doing THEM the favor (which, you kind of are if your product turns out to be a success!)\n\nWhat can I cut out to make this email more concise? Now what ELSE can I cut out to make this email concise?\n\n**If you're targeting mom &amp; pop retailers, smaller boutiques, and the such** - it's DEFINITELY worth visiting the store and bringing **line sheets**! Bring samples, be ready to answer questions about your lead time, production capacity, and pricing!\n\nGood luck!!

{"id":"d2mojfc","author":"Kendizzle","body":"1. It'll save you a lot in the long run if you prep the items yourself.  One of the mods of this sub /u/resalerabbit has a youtube channel and has recently been putting out more videos about how easy it is to prep items to ship.  Also Amazon has their own youtube playlist tutorial on how to prep and ship items for FBA.  Once you get in the groove of things and start sending in more items to sell through FBA, the savings will add up.\n\n2. The fees associated with a sale are taken out of the sale price of the item before it gets pooled into your deposit amount.  As for Storage fees, this is from the amazon website:\n&gt;On February 15 and August 15 of every year, FBA conducts an Inventory Cleanup, at which time inventory units that have been in Amazon fulfillment centers between six and 12 months are assessed a Long-Term Storage Fee of $11.25 per cubic foot.\n\nAs for the money questions, it's best to get a CPA for that.  Accounting is different for everyone depending on your local laws and regulations so it's best to take the advice of keyboard accountants with a grain of salt.

{"id":"d2n32zj","author":"ISBUchild","body":"This is a level of micro-management no budget requires. The frugal question is whether or not to buy the iPad in the first place, a decision you have already made. This is like fretting about the price of jumper cables after you bought a $40k car; You're committed now and the accessories are part of the total cost of ownership. That said:\n\n&gt; Keeping it charged increases the battery life\n\nI'm not sure that this is the case. Apple's battery tech is top-notch, and it doesn't really run off of the outlet when plugged in. What it's really doing behind the scenes is a constant cycle of \"run down battery a few percent, recharge, run down battery, repeat\". On net, the battery is getting about the same amount of load.\n\nMost of the battery-optimization strategies don't really apply to LiPo technology, or are so ineffective as to not be worth the effort. Just don't worry about it: Apple rates that battery to be 80% effective after 1000 cycles. The battery will probably last longer than the device is technologically relevant.\n\n&gt;I bought a 10ft lightning cable for ~$10. \n\nThis is suspiciously cheap. As you may have heard, counterfeit/non-compliant cables are all over, even on reputable sites like Amazon, with a majority of third-party USB C cables not meeting the industry standards (I hear similar issues exist for Lightning cables). These can cause issues if they aren't built to spec. For example, I was trying to diagnose an issue with the recovery mode terminal randomly failing on my Android device - turns out, my lovely new braided cable was non-compliant, and was corrupting the data. Switching back to the manufacturer cable fixed the trouble.\n\nThe power is a problem too. Cheap cables will skimp on copper, which causes voltage drops or overheating. In the former case, your device may suffer if it can't get the full power it is designed for, causing slow/inefficient charging, or possibly some damage. In the latter case, cheap wires can be a safety hazard. I had a counterfeit \"15 guage\" power cable from Amazon that was actually something like 24 AWG - when our staff turned on the copier, it melted and caught fire. (The copier survived; I bought the expensive cables from then on.)\n\nJust buy an extension cord and plug the first-party power supply into that.","name":"t1_d2n32zj","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-04-30 08:17:27","week":17}

{"id":"d2n9ypm","author":"jhall830","body":"Hi Everyone! I'm new to flipping and hoping to get a little insight on a couple random questions I have.\n\n1) I'm wondering how you guys try to determine how well a used item will sell? On ebay are you just seeing if there are completed listings for that item or something similar?\n\n2) I know BSR (best sellers rank) is a good indicator of how well something is selling on Amazon, but how does the item being used affect this? I'd assumed the BSR is mainly indicative of that brand new item\n\n3) As a way to differentiate I've hear/seen people mention bundling as a way to help sell things. For instance if you find a couple complimentary items at a garage sale or thrift shop and they might take awhile to sell individually on Amazon, you create your own listing and bundle them together. Or maybe even if you are able to bundle a couple brand new items that you got on clearance. If you do this, your listing will have 0 reviews. Wouldn't this potentially make it a tough sell on Amazon?\n\n4)As an example I could have purchased this receiver for $350: http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-NR1030-9-2-Ch-Network-Receiver/dp/B00KUB3RCW\n\nThe back corner had a small dent and few scratches. Other than that the receiver is in amazing shape and completely functional. Is this something you would buy?\n\nIf I could flip it locally, I'm assuming I can get a few hundred bucks out of it, but could take awhile?\n\nAfter Amazon Fees, I'm not sure there is much left over? and ebay could cost a fortune to ship? \n\nJust curious what some of the veterans would do here.\n\nThanks so much!","name":"t1_d2n9ypm","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-04-30 15:17:20","week":17}

I think you can get $30-$50 each time and can donate 2-3 times a week. So that's about $100.\n\n* Find stuff in your house you can trade in to Amazon. They cover shipping and will pay you in Amazon gift cards (which you can then exchange for cash, although it'll probably take a week or two for them to come through since you have to ship the items).\n\n* Find stuff to sell on eBay. \n\n* Go door-to-door selling stuff (but this is basically a job now, isn't it)?\n\n* Create a GoFundMe. You're gonna have to convince people to give you the money, so it really depends on what it's for and how likable you are.\n\n* Become an Uber/Lyft driver, or courier for services like Postmates, DoorDash, Caviar, Favor, etc. Again, this is approaching job territory. \n\n* Mechanical Turk will get you a few bucks in your spare time, but I suspect you'll maybe be able to eke out $50-100 in six days if you're doing it full time.\n\n* Freelance on Upwork.com. This only works if you have marketable skills and are willing to work for a terrible hourly wage until you build up a reputation. \n\n* Make stuff to sell on Etsy. Again, this depends on what skills you have.\n\n* Create an account with Square so you can use your phone as a credit card terminal, and go to people and sell something. Maybe bake brownies en masse, idk. It depends on your skills.\n\n* Cut your expenses by $305 for the next month and use that money up front for whatever you need in six days. A few ways to save that much money:\n\n1. Get free food and groceries (see my submission history and my website, http://freefoodguy.com). \n\n2. Airbnb your home, if possible. \n\n3. Reduce driving as much as possible. When you are driving, maximize your gas mileage by not using air conditioning, driving as close to 55 MPH as possible, driving close behind large trucks (to take advantage of drift), accelerating slowly, etc.\n\n4.

For platinum and PLG, platinum is up about the same amount as gold and silver recently but still cheaper than gold, and the stock is up less than the other metal mining companies YTD.  It just looks like the actual metals have more room to go, and that these companies may be a good buy especially if gold and silver do continue to rise.

Does anyone purchase VGCs from bonus category stores and use them for everyday spend? Other than the added hassle of tracking the balance on multiple GCs, are there any downsides? I would effectively be earning 5X UR points on everything.\n\nAlso, I use a different card for each type of purchase to maximize rewards (CSP for dining, Freedom for groceries, etc.), and I saw several references to this being risky if every purchase on each card is only on bonus categories. Are there DPs on this? The only MSing I'm doing at the moment is $1k/month with online loads to Serve so I'd expect to be staying well below their radar.","name":"t1_d2nmsuo","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-04-30 21:42:05","week":17}

Yes, Coke can absolutely diversify its product line, but I think what upsets me about Coke is that you have Vitamin Water. While there is Vitamin Water Zero, Vitamin Water regular has as much sugar as some sodas, which I tend to think negates any vitamin benefit. There's Coca-Cola Life, which is part Stevia and part sugar. What annoys me is this inability to make a break from sugar. I'm still fucking furious that Starbucks moved away from stevia-only in its canned refreshers drinks. People have complained about the taste of Stevia in canned drinks, but I think Refreshers really did get it right and if you look at Amazon and elsewhere, a lot of people have complained that they made the change.\n\nI have nothing against oil, but no real interest in Exxon. \n\nIt's honestly difficult for me to pick either. I'd rather STZ (although that's more volatile and certainly a smaller - but growing - dividend) than KO.
