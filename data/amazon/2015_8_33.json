{"id":"3gey9f","author":"thaifighter","body":"So my wife and I are starting our business selling Thai folding chaise lounges. They are not very popular in the US, so it is hard trying to find a customer base. We started with hand making them and selling them on etsy, but we haven't had a sale despite driving over 1000 hits within a two weeks.\n\nOur supplier can scale as large as we need providing them  already made, but we need to have a market share before I can take that risk. \n\nI would love to sell them on amazon fba, but they are large items with a price about $160 each, so we lose a large portion of the profit. \n\nSo I was hoping you guys can give me some advise on how to sell something people don't know about. I don't have a huge budget for advertising and I am not having luck with Facebook and etsy ads. Our product isn't an impulse buy due to price, which I think might be hurting us. We are going to try to add lower cost pillows and accessories to lure in more traffic. Beyond that I am not sure where to start. We are considering local craft fairs, but we just had a baby so we are trying to keep the extra workload down. \n\nMy second question is I was wondering how to deal with stocking and shipping larger items. Amazon wants $25 to stock them, is this similar to most fulfillment warehouse's pricing? My hopes are to get enough sales I can just have a full container sent direct to a fulfillment service. Are there services that can help coordinate this. \n\n\nEdit: not sure if this is against the rules, but here is our store if you see anything we are doing wrong. https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThaiSupplyUS\n","name":"t3_3gey9f","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-10 03:59:12","week":33}

{"id":"3gg6b3","author":"carnotredditor","body":"Hey guys. So on 08/05/2015, I went ahead and paid off my Amazon.com Store Credit card. The balance was $210.92. The next day, it was deducted from my Chase account (to which it links to), no problem. However, two hours ago as I'm sleeping I get an alert from Chase about an overdraft warning. I opened the email and it turns out I've been charged again by Amazon, for $210.92, the exact same amount that I paid just 5 days ago. Now, since I overdrafted, I'm going to have to end up paying a fee because my savings account balance is now under the $300 minimum (Chase has overdraft protection that moves money from your savings to your checkings automatically to cover the cost, but my savings balance was right at 300), I'm going to have to pay a service charge.... for something that wasn't really my fault.\n\nI'm a pretty broke college student so the service fee is going to be pretty annoying to have to deal with, but what are my options here? I've contacted Amazon, who told me to contact Synchrony, (the company in charge of the credit card), which I did, but I still haven't heard back from them. In addition, I contacted Chase about getting the service fee waived and they told me that I wouldn't be able to.\n\nWhat are my options here? Syncrony is being painfully slow at contacting me back (I first messaged them almost 2 hours ago now), and Chase is saying that they can't waive my service fee.\n","name":"t3_3gg6b3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-10 12:19:49","week":33}

{"id":"3ggkxt","author":"joeldare","body":"You'll find my first coloring book product on the website below. Your feedback is appreciated.\n\nhttp://color.joeldare.com\n\nHere's why I thought this was a good idea and the steps I've taken so far.\n\n1) I researched the idea online.\n\nAnother coloring book for adults is currently listed as #1 on Amazon's best selling books list and it has over 1,300 reviews. There are two of these in the top 10, four in the top 25. Lots of advice says to duplicate something that's already working so I tried that.\n\nGoogle Trends shows \"adult coloring\" and \"adult coloring book\" as recently spiking trends. I interpret this as something that's hot right now but might be a fad. Long term outlook could be a risk.\n\nThe Google keyword tool estimates over 40k monthly searches for the term \"adult coloring book\" and another 2k for \"adult coloring\". Competition is listed as high and medium for these keywords which may raise some challenges. I'm not looking for a million dollar product but I hope the market is big enough for a small side business.\n\n2) I created some coloring pages\n\nAfter convincing myself there's a market, I created a bunch of coloring pages in Adobe Illustrator. I printed and colored a few of the finished pages and snapped pictures of those with my phone. There's serious room for improvement with my photos but I did this myself in one day; finding a professional or doing a better job myself will have to come later. Bad photo quality might kill this but I wanted to get something going.\n\nI tried to create a feeling of nostalgia by using lined paper in a subject folder instead of a bound book. It's similar to what you might have colored in class back in grade school. As an added bonus I don't need special equipment or services for printing or binding the first few.\n\nThe combination of bad photos and my attempt at nostalgia might make this look amateur so I might back off on the loose paper idea. I'm pretty fond of the result when I hold it in my hand though.\n\n3) I created a quick sales page using the free service from GoSpaces.\n\nThis allowed me to get a nicely designed site online in a few minutes. It works well on both desktop and mobile. I selected both PayPal and Stripe for payment processing.\n\nMy total cost so far is exactly zero plus my time. All the services I used were free and everything else I used was sitting around my house.\n\nIf this shows any promise I've got ideas for improvements and other editions. I'll probably add some hand drawn pages if I get a few orders.\n\nTL;DR Did some research on the market. Illustrated and printed some coloring book pages. Took some photos with my phone. Setup a GoSpaces site and put a product up for sale.","name":"t3_3ggkxt","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-10 15:03:21","week":33}

{"id":"3gidf4","author":"mrbigglessworth","body":"Confused on options.\n\nFor regular stock trade, you buy xyz, at $15 a share, you want it to go up enough to cover your commission (if not on RobinHood,) and sell for a profit.  Or hold it if it pays dividends and collect the cash or reinvest it.  Pretty straight forward. \n\nHowever, every time I try to read about options I lose interest and hope for understanding.\n\nI seem to (possibly mistakenly) remember reading that there is a way to trade options where your maximum amount that you could lose is the cost of the premium whether it was a call (price of stock goes up) or put (price of stock goes down). \n\nSuch as that if XYZ was $1.42 per contract, it would cost $142 to buy the call option.  If the strike price was say $5 and the current price was $4.5, if it hit $5 or higher, your contract would go above a price of $1.42, you sell it and pocket the difference in profit.  If it never hits the strike price, you simply let it expire and you are out the $142 in this example.  You never had to own the actual stock, (or 100 shares of it).\n\nThe put example is what confuses me the most.  From reading about options it was about the right, but not the obligation to sell something via the options contract and you can own the option in whatever, but not the actual stock unless you wanted to do a covered call (you actually owned the stock).\n\nLet's say I thought Amazon would have a weak quarter (as it isnt Christmas yet) and I wanted to buy a put where the current price is $524, and I belive in the next few weeks or month it could hit $520.  That contract is currently $9.05 with an Aug 28 expiration. I do a buy to open put for AMZN 9.05 Aug 28.  That would cost $905 for one contract.  Lets say it dips to $518 a share, I am now below the strike price and the options contract has gone up to say $10.75 at that point or whatever.  So at that point I would \"sell to close\"?  for $170 in profit?\n\nIf it never reaches strike, or goes higher the option just sits and expires (or if I forgot to sell it or understood the wrong expiration date, or whatever happens in these circumstances)\n\nThe other aspect is where reading about this is confusing is that it seems with put options you have to have the underlying stock in your actual account.  If that was the case Id have to have $52,400 of AMZN to option off of.\n\nCan anyone give some good advice that would simplify this a bit?\n\n\nedit= After watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erdCzwMBczw it seems what I am looking for is the buy to open, sell to close for a call (if I think its going up).  Would the reverse be true for a put, (if I think xyz is going down)  Pick the strike and expiration I am looking at, buy that put, and wait, if it goes below strike, just sell the contract back into the market and pocket the difference minus whatever the commission was.   Or let it expire if it never gets there.  Just dont exercise the option and be on the hook for the actual 100 shares of whatever it is.

I've been trying to figure out a long term strategy for a while now, and while I think I have an idea of the right cards to get I'm struggling with the order to get them and how to use the miles.\n\nMy goal is two fold. \n    \nFirst is two round trips in economy to **Europe** from **SEATAC** either in **March 2016** (I think this might be too close) or **Oct 2016-March 2017**. \n    \nSecond two round trips in economy to **Australia/NZ** in late **2017/early 2018**\n\nMy credit scores are **767** and **763** from credit karma.\n    \nMy current income is **35k**\n\nMiles I have currently:\n\n* AA: **25000**\n\n* United: **60000**\n\n* SO's United: **40000**\n\n* Avios: **52500**\n\n\n\nSome combo of miles I need:\n\n\nEurope: \n\n* United Miles **120k** for 2 RTS\n\n* AA miles **80k** for 2 RTS\n\nAustralia \n\n* AA **150k** for 2 RTS \n\n* United **160k** for 2 RTS\n\n\n\nCards I currently have: \n\n* Chase: Amazon rewards, Amtrak, BA (will be canceling eventually), United mileage plus (will be canceling eventually), Sapphire\n* Barclay: Arrival+\n* Capital1: Quick Silver\n* Citi: AA plat select(canceling soon), thank you, diamond prefered, thank you preferred.\n* Amex: Blue and Blue Sky? \n* Discover: Cashback\n\n**Only I am applying for cards not my SO**.\n\nSo i'm thinking some combo of CSP, Citi ThankYou® Premier Card, Citi Prestige, Citi AA gold and or Executive would get me enough for my goals. I'm just not sure of the order and I'm worried that this plan is too CITI heavy.\n\nI need to wait until summer/fall 2016 to get the CSP (more than 5 cards in past 24 months).\n    \nI was thinking citi premier and prestige could get me enough miles to transfer to singapore airlines and then book 2 RTS to Europe via star alliance rewards. \n    \nThen some combo of united and american miles to Australia.\n    \nOr trying to get enough AA miles to Europe and using united to Australia. Although since Europe is closer waiting the 18 months to get another AA plat card will be putting me really close to my trip window. \n\n**ANY advice is greatly appreciated. I've been struggling with this for weeks. I'm trying to not screw myself on one trip by doing the other.**  \n","name":"t3_3gj2ho","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-11 02:08:13","week":33}

{"id":"3gmn9v","author":"inflated_waffles","body":"So I've got a product that I've been working on and have a rough prototype made already with plans in the works for revisions.\nI have not begun to market or sale my product yet as I feel it is not ready and I would like to learn more about the world of online retailing.\n\nTo those that have seen my prototype they tend to really enjoy it and I have received some great feedback for it. My product is something that I have not been able to find on the market in a pricing bracket that is friendly to consumers and competitive to what is already on the market. I have done research into the topic and feel I can bring it to market at a competitive price.\n\nCurrently I have been working with supplies from stores like Lowes and Home Depot and getting what I can't get from them online at places like Amazon. But this is getting rather expensive and selling it to make profit would make the price absurdly high. I have been working with hand and power tools to get the prototypes made and have been decently successful thus far.\n\nMost who have seen my product are not the people I would be marketing to (although they tend to like what I have made) so I have been asking people online to review and give feedback and ideas for improvement who are in my potential market. I have made revisions to my designs without changing the overall aesthetics of the product based on what my potential consumers have stated they want.\n\nI have been in contact with local machine shops and have priced things out for buying parts in bulk and I know what I have in the works will be a great product to market.\n\nI am also currently working full time and saving for my wife to go back to college so there isn't much room for savings to start my own company yet.\n\nTo make 10-20 products first round + all startup costs (starting online store, shipping, packaging, legal stuff) it seems like I can get the ball rolling for around $5000. I can run everything out of my house and ship from here. I have local machine shops and suppliers lined up to keep most of what I can domestic (I feel that point is lacking in my industry). What I can't get locally I can source from places like Alibaba for the smaller things.\n\nI would like to bring and investor or co founder on board (someone who is more tech savvy than I am for setting up a website and such), but I don't know how to go about finding one or even if I should.\n\nRight now (because I don't know what to do next) my plan has been to start an Etsy shop and sell 3-5, then start a Shopify store and try to sell 10-20 and then go from there. But even that seems a bit out there as it will take me another 6-12 months before I can have enough saved to bootstrap it myself.\n\nIs this even a viable option or if I don't have a co-founder/investor should I just save as much as I can and start my own online store from the get-go?\n\nI was thinking that if I do the Etsy&gt;Shopify&gt;Online store route than I can feel out things along the way in regards to pricing and advertising.\n\nSorry for turning this into a stream of text but I'm really at a stuck point trying to figure out what to do next.\n\nAny advice would be great.\n\nThank you\n\ntl:dr Have a great idea for a product where there is a hole in the market. Unsure if I should find a co founder/investor or go at it alone. Also unsure where to look for a cofounder/investor. Also unsure of where to start selling product first.","name":"t3_3gmn9v","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-11 21:16:04","week":33}

We bought a nice computer, nice phones, a new DSLR for me, guitar for him, gym memberships.

Now it's halfway through the year and we're now realizing we've been pissing our money away little by little.\n\nHere's where we are at right now with debt/savings:\n\n+ We've made a decent dent in our student debt - mine is now down to $10k (from $17k) and his is less than $5,000 (from $10k).\n\n+ We collectively have 3 credit cards, 2 get paid down to 0 every month, 1 has a balance of around $2k (at 0% until next July)\n\n+ We have no real savings because we've just been dumping any extra money straight into our debts. I have a little under $2k sitting in a Vanguard account (not currently invested because of the $3k minimum)\n\nBelieve it or not we are both smart individuals who were once super frugal in our college days. But we know we've been stupid and let all the extra money catch up to us. We desperately want to get back on track. \n\nWe cold stopped eating lunch out. No more unnecessary \"stuff\" purchases. We cancelled our gym membership. We have been tracking our expenses manually.\n\nThere are some expenses we just can't seem to cut down, though. I could use some advice or creative ideas on how to save in these categories.\n\n+ Rent. Housing prices are horrible here in the bay. We live in the \"suburbs\" to save money but it's still $2100/month. We live in a pretty small condo, plenty of old and broken stuff, and we have crappy ikea furniture. I don't know if we can cut down in this category. When our lease is up I am going to try to find somewhere cheaper, but it may not be realistic. We'd really rather not have roommates or cram ourselves into a studio, but are we being divas?\n\n+ Auto insurance. We own our car outright and pay about $120/month for insurance. We don't *need* a car but it vastly improves our quality of life, especially on the weekends. We frequently drive down to LA to visit family, and flying would be much more expensive. Would you still suggest selling the car? Or should I try to get a policy with less coverage?\n\n+ Pet health insurance. We had an unexpected vet bill in February of $3k (no, we wouldn't let our cats die) so we got a policy at $40/month for our two cats. I know it seems silly but it provides peace of mind. Should I cancel it? Is it worth the expense?\n\nFinally, what's next? Should we go full-steam in paying down the student loans and try to have those squashed by the end of the year? Should we focus on getting together a solid emergency fund? Frankly I'm not too worried about job security - things are going well at my current company and there are tons of jobs here in my field otherwise - but I guess you never know.\n\nWhat should I do with the $2k sitting in the Vanguard account? Should I grow it to $3k so I can invest it, and basically keep my \"emergency fund\" in there? Or should I keep savings in a normal bank account? (I do have a separate 401k, which I just started this year, and has roughly $5k in it. Unfortunately my company does not yet do 401k matching.)\n\nAnother detail: My husband graduated with a less lucrative liberal arts degree and has struggled to find stable employment, so we have avoided taking on any expenses we can't afford on my income alone. He is working, though. Next month he finishes a summer internship where he's been making $20/hr. He's now teaching himself web development on the side with hopes to get into web/UX design as a longer term career. He wants to take a formal class at a university extension, which will cost $800. We both think it's a good investment because it'll teach him some more formal processes and also look more \"legit\" on a resume.\n\nSorry this post was so long, I just wanted to provide as much context as possible. I'm a long-time lurker of this subreddit and have learned so much from your collective wisdom, so thanks!","name":"t3_3gorpq","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-12 07:03:26","week":33}

{"id":"3gsvoz","author":"persfinacthrow1","body":"Hi all,\n\nLately I've been looking at restructuring how I handle all my banking so I was hoping to get some insight or recommendations. I'm in New England (US) if it's relevant.\n\nRight now my current setup is entirely with TD Bank, I have:\n\n* Checking 1\n* Checking 2\n* Money Market Savings \n* TD Cash Rewards Card\n* TD Debit Card tied to Checking 2\n\nI work two jobs, one of them deposits into Checking 1, the other into Checking 2. I put 99% of all my  daily expenses on my credit card and push transfers in online multiple times per month. I have no debts. The only check I write regularly is for rent. Each bi-monthly paycheck I'll scrape off whatever is in the two checking accounts and deposit it into the savings account.\n\nIt feels good having the savings account and finally saving away some money but the rate is still only 0.2%. I've been looking at Ally and their 1% rate and I feel like I'm missing out on a low risk way to grow my money a little (or at least fight inflation) especially since my savings are adding up at a fair rate.\n\nLast night I opened an online savings account with Ally and I was going to transfer money from TD but I realized there was a $3 external transfer fee for TD Bank. Now if I kept my transfers limited it's not a big deal, but each transfer eats a little bit away at that interest and also reduces the rate at which I can get savings from my latest pay check into that account.\n\nMy thoughts then were to open a checking account with Ally, have my two jobs deposit into that checking account. From there move money into the Ally online savings account and then close my TD savings account (and move all the money in it to the Ally one). I decided I would keep the two TD checking accounts since it's nice to have the brick and mortar option and I can keep using my TD Credit card. Does this seem like a good idea? If I transfer money from Ally to TD there does not seem to be any kind of fee.\n\nHowever, this will add a little more effort needed to ensure I always have enough in the TD accounts to pay off the credit card. But this also got me thinking if I should try out some other cards, or even go a little r/churning but I have no idea how paying off other credit cards would work using my Ally account. If I have to pay some kind of transfer fee it seems like that would add up quickly enough to make it not worth doing. If I were to say, get an Amazon CC, can I pay it off online without any hassle/fees?","name":"t3_3gsvoz","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-13 04:36:20","week":33}

This got me thinking about the item of not joining the 'race to the bottom' and looking to make a quick ..but small profit . 20-30% or so seems typical. \nIf one doesn't need constant cash flow(has another income source/job that pays the bills), it seems like this strategy has some advantages. .\nI would view it like comparing a stock trading that is day trading looking to make a tiny percentage quickly versus a more long term investor. \n\nEven if one is making 200% (2x) versus 20% but waiting..that's still 10x more profit. \n10x more profit ..for the SAME amount of work. You drove to buy the product once, you spent the time to find it once, you listed and shipped it once. \nIf you are making 20% you have to do all that stuff 10 times, if you think about it. \nI'm not sure exactly how this would work but I know of course that Christmas (4th quarter) is obviously when a ton of toys are sold. I suppose that there will be a demand during Christmas time for certain toys being cleared out/liquidated now. \n\"Little Johnny wants the same toy that his cousin has...but I can't find it at the stores...but they have it on Amazon\" \nOr \"Little Johnny broke his toy and wants another for Christmas...it's only available through Amazon\"\nJust a couple scenarios. \n\nAnyways I'd like to hear thoughts on this..This could apply to eBAY too over course. \nActually many years ago, I did retail arbitrage with a certain inflatable toy and didn't even realize it. I was surprised that people were spending so much for these items on eBAY even after Christmas..it was a Christmas inflatable..but there are people that collect all kinds of things if you think about it. \n\n","name":"t3_3gt5c7","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-13 05:59:13","week":33}

{"id":"3gz9fd","author":"jcpoling","body":"We've had this crazy boom of new subscription services for everything from diapers to bacon. At some point we'll reach subscription saturation and people will realize they have hundreds of dollars in subscriptions for products they don't always use on a regular basis. \n\nThe reason I've been hesitant to sign up for many of these subscription services is because I know, inevitably, I'll get sick of (x) product subscription. \n\nIn the future, what type of subscription services will win? Will it be an individual company that provides actual products we all use on a regular basis? I'm thinking about the Amazon pantry products that allow people to select the daily essentials to be shipped on a regular basis. \n\nWhile Amazon's service of shipping essential items on a regular basis is nice, it's somewhat inefficient. I've had toilet paper on subscription. As our lives have changed (baby born, wife at home) we've used more toilet paper since we're at home more often. I forget to update my Amazon subscription delivery service and now we're out of toilet paper. So I run to Target and buy a huge pack. A week later I get the Amazon subscription toilet paper. I know, I know. I could have modified the subscription. Cancelled, delayed, whatever. It's a step to change the delivery preferences and I have to remember to do it. In the end, it's just easier to swing by a store a get more.\n\nSo my question becomes, where do subscription services add the most value? \n\n1. Variety of products delivery? (Bacon of the month club, etc.)\n2. Ability to sample many products without thinking about the source? (Birch Box)\n3. Ability to set and forget (Amazon)\n\nAnd lastly, where is this trend heading? What part of subscription services are the most frustrating? What doesn't exist today that a large number of people would find value in?\n\nFor me personally, I'd like to see a subscription service of products that I actually need and use regularly delivered to me when I need them, without thinking about it. Maybe this involves a real person contacting me to adjust the subscription? Some sort of personal concierge service.\n\nLooking to start a discussion around this. I think as entrepreneurs, we could all benefit to understand future trends and discuss new ideas about where this exciting subscription business model is heading. As I see it, it isn't going away but will evolve into a more polished way of consuming products.","name":"t3_3gz9fd","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-14 16:22:04","week":33}

She had about a year of rent from her severance package + savings. I stayed in school looking to finish but around the end of the year, I was offered a position to work full-time at the library I had been working at as a student. I dropped out of school at the last second, with only one class left to take before the BA, in order to secure this income (~$40k salary at the time) and keep up our ability to pay rent. Unfortunately my mom had to pull her retirement early, earning much less than she should have, in order to continue affording her split of the rent. \n\n\nFast forward to a year later, I am now able to keep up with bills, we have done some repairs on our very old, very neglected mobile home (built in the 70s I think, didn't have working faucets, toilets, tubs, for a decade), but it still has a lot more work to be done. The roof leaks, the carpet is murdered by years of grime, pet grossness, fleas, broken washing machine, etc. We are trying to get things done, but the repairman we like who is cheapest and provides quality work won't ever return our calls, so my \"frugal\" mother refuses to get estimates from other repair people and get things fixed. In the meantime, we suffer.\n\n\nI am lucky enough to have a great condition used Prius C that gets fantastic gas mileage, as it helps to balance out being ~15 miles from my workplace. It has about $15,000 left on the loan I took out through my credit union at a 2.49% APR which comes to $326/mo paid for by my dad and stepmom, as it was a graduation gift to me. However my dad has never been dependable on finances so I am afraid he could lapse on this at any moment, so I would like to be prepared just in case. He's paid it for the past two years, but I just can't be sure. My insurance for this is covered as well, for the time being.\n\n\nI have spent a lot in the past year at this full-time job, so I am looking to cut back on spending. I've replaced my 12 year-old bed, replaced an old computer, gone to festivals regularly, and traveled around some. By eating out less and cooking more, I am looking to free up a lot more money, but eating out is almost always a social event with friends/significant other, so I like to keep some of those outings intact. \n\n\nGoals:\n\nLong-term (10 years from now), I'd like to have the down payment on a home. Probably something like a $500k place in SoCal, as I have many connections here and wish to remain in the area. Right now, I'm looking at a few more years in this job before I will feel confident in applying to grad schools in the career field I wanted to get into (psychology) in hopes of a better paying and more fulfilling career. During that time, I'd like to kill my student loan, work towards killing the car loan, repair the mobile home in hopes I can sell it when my mom can't live unassisted (she's 65), and have money saved for when I enter grad school. I'm not sure if I'll be competitive enough for a position where my tuition is covered by scholarships and I receive a monthly stipend, so I'd rather have funds available to live on and not take out as large a loan when the time comes.\n\n\nI would like to retain some semblance of a social life by having some meals out, some trips across the country to visit friends a few times a year, but I'm starting to wonder if this is unreasonable given my higher priority goals and current expenses.\n\n\nGeneral question:\n\nAm I on the right track? Is there something I could be doing better/considering? I've considered asking my SO to move in with my mother and I to reduce rent costs, but it'd take a lot of work figuring out how to fit her in to the space we have. My room is entirely too small for me, let alone another person too.\n\n\nMy job right now is fairly low pay (~$44k), I understand that, but for someone who doesn't have a BA yet and for how stupid-easy it is, I'm very comfortable. Seriously, I get to watch Netflix/anime and play video games for 6 out of the 9 or so hours I \"work\" every day. I can't complain about anything beyond it being very unfulfilling.\n\n\nThanks for reading and for any advice/observations!\n*edit for line breaks*","name":"t3_3h0ic8","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-14 21:34:41","week":33}

{"id":"3h4gh8","author":"AsyrafAzizan","body":"Thanks to Carrie Kirby who’ve write a brilliant article on WiseBread.com regarding this topic. It should bring great help to them who is planning on making their first step to start saving.\n-------\nTime for a question: Are we conscious enough using our money rightly?\n\nEither we realize it or not, we tend to spend money on some needless things. Whether it is on every week, month, or year basis.\n\nWhen is the last time you checked on those? I believe this question will urge us, if not, drive someone to take radical action on this matter.\n\nPlus, it’s your money on the line. Means that it’s our very own responsibility.\n\nNow, still thinking on moving forward? Good. Let’s move on then.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the 5 unnecessary household expenses that you can cut off and save sums of money.\n\n#1 – Cable/Satellite TV.\n-------\nFor some reason, I understand why people subscribe to these kinds of services. Most of them want to have instant access to live sporting events.\n\nWhy waste a dime on it if you have others option, which is almost costless?\n\nHere are some ideas that are going to work fine as a replacement:\n\na) Use Blu-Ray player with an Internet connection.\n\nb) Install high-powered antenna. You might be surprised by the variety of programming available.\n\nc) Pay the fraction of the cost of cable/satellite TV for Netflix, Hulu Plus, or an Amazon Prime Membership, which includes streaming video.\n\nSport fans can also view their favourites by using sport-specific service, for a lesser cost than a year of subscription of cable/satellite TV. It’s the age of World Wide Web though. Duh!\n\n#2 – Household cleaning products and toiletries.\n-------\nSome may take this as a hype. To the fact, it’s not. People who have tried it knows best. These 2 household product works like magic – baking soda and vinegar.\n\nApart for being inexpensive, they have quite a number of specialities. Think as if we are buying a 3-in-1 solution. But these can literally do more than 3.\n\nSo, what can these things do, you ask?\n\nHere are some to spark your interest:\n\na) It helps clean counters effectively.\n\nb) Able to unclog drains.\n\nc) Make tubs and toilets sparkle.\n\nd) Clean your dishwasher.\n\ne) Boost your laundry.\n\n#3 – Late fees.\n-------\nProcrastination. The mother of contributor to late fees or penalty.\n\nWhen we do have money to pay, then do it right away. There is no reason to hold the payment just to pay extra, unless you willingly or planning to pay more than you should have.\n\nA good mind will question:\n\n“Why should I?”\n\nWe can start by:\n\na) Organizing the calendar and make reminders. It’ll certainly helps us a lot, especially to keep track of to-do tasks.\n\nb) Take fast action when you get hold of your money.\n\nIf the banking agent want to waive the fee, one trick we can do is by asking to be transferred to a retention specialist and threaten to cancel your account.\n\nChances are, if you have good banking track record, they will not put your threat to the test.\n\n#4 – Any current subscriptions and memberships.\n-------\nTake note on everything we subscribe currently, from magazines and newspaper to online services. Do we pay any organisation or say, yoga class or gym sessions?\n\nIf yes, we might want to reconsider those.\n\nYou might be surprised that you might paying for something you have stopped using years ago.\n\nBut if you’re still using it, then ask yourself. Is it really necessary to use the product or service?\n\nYou can always replace it for free. Make time to go to the library and read your favourite magazine there, or you can always read articles online. Seems like a perfect time to save some papers.\n\n#5 – Phone bills.\n-------\nThis part can be a great nuisance if it’s not in control. Many people have a hard time dealing with phone bills, as they tend to be more ‘flexible’ in charges.\n\nGot to love the face we’re making when receiving the bills in detail, don’t you agree?\n\nThere are lots of mobile application that possess ability to make voice calls, without any penny needed.\n\nFor instance:\n\na) Skype allow us to call mobile and home phones, domestically or internationally.\n\nb) There are others apps too. Viber and WeChat would be a good example.\n\nYou can also change your postpaid plan to prepaid plan, in case you worry someday the postpaid bills will wreck your financial health by force. Prevention is always better than cure.\n\nTest these tips, say, a couple of month for a start. You will see how much you’re able to save in such short period of time.\n-------\nP/S: Hope these will bring much benefits to all of us.

My ebook has just exploded in sales in the past couple months, I wrote this thing back in January and have made just a little over $2000 in sales (After fees and everything) on Fiverr. In fact, I submitted a post in this subreddit talking all about it a few months ago [Here]\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/30fa6p/fiverr_is_awesome_made_over_450_in_about_4_weeks/)\n\nI made a listing on Amazon for Kindle like some of your suggested about 2 months ago, and I haven't made one sale. I'm just confused how an ebook could be doing so well on Fiverr, which is more for services, than on Amazon. Maybe I just did something completely wrong with the listing? I mean, when you search certain keywords, you do find my listing, but why not one sale in over 2 months? \n\nIs there anyway I can \"transfer\" the mass amount of positive feedback that I have been left by buyers on Fiverr over to Amazon so that I have some credibility? I feel amazon buyers are hesitant to purchase since there's no feedback.\n\nIs there a trick or finesse to starting out of Amazon kindle? Perhaps selling, or rather giving, away your ebook for FREE in the beginning, just to build up feedback/credibility, then jack up the price?\n\nAny help to generate more sales would be awesome.

I earn £1000 P/M and my SO (Not Married) around £500/600 a month (She is a domestic cleaner so her pay is irregular). We also receive around £250 in rent which may or may not end this month. \n\n------------\n\nMy SO has a bond due to July next year worth £29,000, and the house sale should next around £130,000. Flats can be found in our area for around £100,000 and ideally we'd like a second property for rental income. However I am bankrupt and she is self employed so mortgages will be hard to come by. She would also, and quite rightly too, like to protect her considerably larger wealth should we break up. \n\n---------------------------------\n\nOn the housing situation she owns 50% of the house outright, her brother owns the other 50% and its currently up for sale. Neither of us pay into a pension, and I have a student loan but don't currently earn enough to be make the payments threshold.\n\n--------------------\n\nHere are our expenses. They come to about £630 a month.

Try building an audience or sell something where your customers already are (eBay, etsy, Amazon).  \n\nThe opportunities for making money online are unlimited, but if you can't afford shopify fees then you  probably need to rethink your strategy.\n\nI would recommend retail arbitrage, which is very low cost to get started and very easy to make money.

At least it is not hard when you deal with Amazon affiliate sites you build for yourself. If you start checking Amazon best sellers lists, analyzing current trends or following your own interests you will have to narrow a niche and get fewer products in your store. As a result you will get less traffic, few clicks and small commissions. When we speak about Amazon affiliate stores that should include hundreds and thousands of products we are interested in a broad niche.To find a good niche for your Amazon affiliate store I recommend that you go to Amazon.com and check the list of categories in the right sidebar. In my opinion there is no point to go deeper. Here you will find enough ideas to choose a niche for your store.

{"id":"ctxwfsc","author":"1-Down","body":"There is almost certainly a local library, or several, in the area.  Instead of buying books and other media, get a library card.  Many libraries have several branches and you can request that they move something from one library to another for you - it usually takes a day or so.  Also, you can often get movies, music, and internet access from a library.  Really - we have pretty good libraries and they want to bend over backwards to serve you.\n\nDon't buy cable.  Get a Netflix or Amazon Prime account.  If you have to choose between one or the other, Amazon Prime is probably the way to go due to the ability to ship whatever you want to your door in 2-days for no charge.  It doesn't take long before you start to ask yourself \"why am I going to the store when I can just order it?\"  Prices are typically excellent (though not always 100% the most inexpensive) and the variety is far more than what you'll get from a brick and mortar.\n\nBe cautious about getting a gym membership.  Fitness is great, but some gyms are really skeezy when it comes to things like making you sign contracts.  YMCA is usually a pretty safe bet.\n\nCars are expensive beasts.  You basically have three routes to go on maintaining one.  A lot of people take their car to a dealer for service.  This way is typically the most reliable, but most expensive.    Also, some dealerships ARE idiots, so it's not a 100% thing.  You're going to pay a frightening amount though - I believe shop rates start at about $75 an hour, parts not included. \n\nThe second way to go about it is find a local shop.  If you find a good one you can save some money.  There are varying degrees of \"good\" out there though, so it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nLastly, you can try and service the car yourself.  Generally speaking, you can do most things on the car (oil, brakes, some part swaps) pretty easily, but tools are expensive and take up a fair bit of space.  You can decrease tool cost quite a bit by going to garage sales, though it's pretty random what you end up with.","name":"t1_ctxwfsc","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-10 15:07:44","week":33}

Just a quick FYI: My Prime this year is at least 15months long and I've made back all the money I spent by a long shot...\n\nAmazon will either give you money/gift cards/extra months of Prime for any slip up in the process. They promise 2 days and if it comes on the 3rd it's an ~~automatic~~ extra month of Prime. If it comes 4 days late it's extra months of Prime AND money. When I ordered my TV it was 5 days late and they gave me an extra month of prime, 10 dollars to spend at Amazon, and a refund for 10% of the price. That paid for my Prime for the year.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon will refund the difference of any price drop within 7 days of delivery. I don't even call, I just write them on their chat interface. At least one out of every three things I order has a price drop. Use Camelcamelcamel to figure out the price drops. You can also use Honey to auto-check promo codes.\n\nBoom.

{"id":"cty5djb","author":"tinycatsays","body":"Basically, anything I would go to Walmart for, I go to Sam's for.  Same company, less hassle to get in and out, slightly better prices.  So that's things like toilet paper, paper towels, ziploc bags, \"feminine products,\" paper plates or cups (I don't go through many, so that's a rare purchase).  Laundry detergent, dish detergent, soap refills.\n\nDepending on your store, it may be possible to get grocery items.  The prices on meats at my Sam's are pretty good, but the quality and selection depends on when I go.  Got a 2-pack of whole chickens for about $2/lb (cheaper than grocery store), so I got them, cooked one, and froze the other.  Again, the value is in large quantities, so you've got to make sure you've got room in the freezer, if you buy meat here.\n\nFruits and veggies are on par with grocery store prices; I know for sure that watermelons cost more, and strawberries were similar price to grocery store, last time I was there.  Potatoes, onions, garlic, etc. were cheap, but of course in large quantity.  All of those can be stored for a long time, though, so go for it if you've space and use them a lot.\n\n\"Irregular purchases\" -- I've found that movies/TV shows on DVD/blu-ray are usually cheaper at Sam's than elsewhere, though not always, and not by a huge amount.  You can also get kitchenware, housewares, and small appliances for a decent price, though you might still want to shop around.  I got a really nice (mid-range, I guess) Belgian waffle iron for $15 at Sam's, Waring Pro ~~one of the better brands for waffle irons (can't think of it off the top of my head, though)~~.  Same with larger appliances, but as always: shop around!  So far, my large appliances have been best bought elsewhere, and I'm hoping not to need any others for a while yet.\n\nEDIT to add waffle iron brand.

{"id":"ctyekq4","author":"fwho","body":"Nothing amazing actually. When I started, me being me jumped in balls deep from the get-go buying hundreds of an item at a time. So a few of my first purchases became loses before they even hit Amazon, and eventually I sold them at a loss because I needed capital. On a whole I am still partially recovering from my stupidity, on individual items I now net between 10-20% ROI because I still focus on low ranked, fast movers. \n\nFor example: a few weeks ago I bought 100 of these http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P542UH2 for $15.50 ea. and averaged around $17.50 net on them. Three days after I bought them Walmart lowered the price to $12.50, and seeing the rank/price now I kind of wish I would have held out a little longer. So there are two opportunities I missed to earn better profits, but I am not really into speculating swimming gear at the end of the season.","name":"t1_ctyekq4","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-10 23:10:48","week":33}
{"id":"ctyf06k","author":"KeronCyst","body":"&gt; Such as that if XYZ was $1.42 per contract, it would cost $142 to buy the call option. If the strike price was say $5 and the current price was $4.5, if it hit $5 or higher, your contract would go above a price of $1.42, you sell it and pocket the difference in profit. If it never hits the strike price, you simply let it expire and you are out the $142 in this example. You never had to own the actual stock, (or 100 shares of it).\n\n&gt; Let's say I thought Amazon would have a weak quarter (as it isnt Christmas yet) and I wanted to buy a put where the current price is $524, and I belive in the next few weeks or month it could hit $520. That contract is currently $9.05 with an Aug 28 expiration. I do a buy to open put for AMZN 9.05 Aug 28. That would cost $905 for one contract. Lets say it dips to $518 a share, I am now below the strike price and the options contract has gone up to say $10.75 at that point or whatever. So at that point I would \"sell to close\"? for $170 in profit?\n\nBoth of these ¶s are correct except for the more complicated matters of theta and vega affecting the option price. Even if the underlying stock goes to $5 (or down to $520): if it moves up/down at a turtle's pace, the option might not accrue that much in value and you might still lose.\n\nYes, you would sell the put to close the position.\n\nI don't like the \"right but not obligation\" crappy wording myself. Let's put it this way. Buying a put gives you the temporary ability to force someone to buy your 100 shares of the underlying stock at its strike price (which is just a mutually agreed price between you two), if the current share price is under that strike. You don't actually have to ever own the 100 shares, but if you do, the idea is that you want the stock to go down as far as possible. Then you buy 100 shares at $10 (for ex.) and exercise the put's right to force your put's seller to buy your 100 shares at the strike price of $20, and thereby pocket the difference.\n\n(Off-topic: therefore, calls are the opposite. Buying a call temporarily grants you the ability to force someone to sell his(/her?!) 100 shares to you for the cost of the strike price, assuming the current share price is above that strike. The cost of the call itself is the \"premium\" to have this right.)\n\nYour method, though, is more common: simply sell the option contract itself, which also changes value with the stock price, and thus don't bother to have to deal with shares and rights-exercising.\n\nJust watch out for theta. Theta is time decay. The cost of options (that $9.05 you mention for AMZN) loses theta for every day that you hold it (if theta=-0.11, it loses 11¢ every day, and so on). There is also volatility, which is a measurement of how much that stock is predicted to move, one of several calculations by which options are correspondingly priced, because each stock has its own unique range of movement (buy on low implied volatility, sell on high implied volatility).\n\nUsually if I go long, I would want to buy at least 1-2 strike prices in the money (ITM; that would mean a put's strike above the stock's current share price). ITM options aren't so sharply hit by theta.\n\n**TL;DR:** First try virtual trading an option or three with fake money on a paper account. It's really vital to do this to safely understand more about how the whole scheme works.\n\n**EDIT:** Why the *heck* did someone downvote this person's honest question?

{"id":"ctyfr6d","author":"Dont____Panic","body":"&gt; Tacky posters, messy, smells like curry... then some foreign guy with poor people skills comes up to talk about your issues with you. It's like a low-end mechanic ambiance\n\nThis is because there isn't a lot of money in it.\n\nIt's difficult to get someone to pay you and the people that do pay complain bitterly about it.\n\nI've done it and was the manager at a place like that (when I was 17).  The owner tried to do retail sales (selling parts, etc) but they often go obsolete while in inventory (and you have to sell at a loss to beat Newegg or Amazon anyway).\n\nIf you don't have parts, you're doing software services, etc.  Your job often takes 3-4 hours to fix something complicated.  The rate you need to charge to break even is on the order of $100/hr, but then you're charging $400 to fix a machine that can probably be replaced for $350.\n\nWith the proliferation of $300 computers and $80 tablets being \"good enough\" for most people, I don't see a market in the desktop/laptop computer industry unless you're business focused.\n\nAnd a strip-mall isn't the place to be business focused.\n\nAlso, staffing will be an issue.  You'll either end up with your slightly racist \"curry\" comment, or you'll end up with a teenager who doesn't want to work there.\n\nWell educated and experienced locals expect (sometimes unreasonably) to be compensated well.  Your average Tier 2 IT guy who fixes PCs makes $40-60k.  You probably need someone who can run a store and do the books too.  He's got to fix a lot of computers to break even and then stay late to close up shop and do the books for the day.  \n\nOr... you hire a permanent manager and get a bunch of teenagers or other lower-paid staff to work on things, but accept a higher rate of poor service.\n\nEither way, your experience with low-quality shops and service is probably because the people doing the work are willing to work for $15/hr and don't have cash to invest in capital improvements.\n\nTake it as a sign.","name":"t1_ctyfr6d","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-10 23:42:19","week":33}
{"id":"ctyfve0","author":"KeronCyst","body":"Well, the option won't drop to $0 right away; it will just gradually decrease in value over time (and if it's ITM, then it can always be sold for a certain minimum amount all the way to expiration). So you can sell the call or put at a small/moderate loss, not 100% loss, just as you could sell your $0.50 shares of SD at $0.30 instead of waiting for the company to go bankrupt (lol... ugh).\n\nRead about delta. If a put's delta is 0.60, that means for every $1 AMZN loses, the put gains $0.60 in value. Gamma is the rate of change of delta, though, and messes around with delta itself (all the Greeks often fluctuate in value).

{"id":"ctymlk6","author":"makingauser","body":"Advice here from someone who filed about 3.5 years ago.  This is some information I posted previously, but feel free to ask me some questions.\n\nAfter my debts were discharged I waited about three months before applying for a secured card. I applied at my credit union since I had an auto loan that I paid on time for six years with them and thought maybe they would take that into consideration. I was declined :(. So I waited until I got an offer in the mail (since yeah, bk is public information and they will start mailing you). I think it was only a month or two later. I read all of the offers and did a lot of research online and waited until I got one that didn't have some $700 application fee for an $800 limit. So I was approved for Orchard Bank/HSBC (which has been bought out by Capital One) secured card. It has a $35 annual fee, but I acknowledged that initially that would be what I would get. I sent them a check for $800 and they put it in a savings account and I got the card. I made a clear effort to only put less than 20-30% of the limit on the card per month (and obviously pay it off every month). \n\nI continued to just watch offers in the mail until I would get one that wasn't really stupid, and then applied for my second. I tried to space out my applications because of the hard inquiries. I also requested a line increase by sending my Orchard bank card additional funds. Basically I waited to receive offers instead of looking for offers online. This past month I was pretty scared when I applied for my auto loan that they'd offer me some ridiculously high interest rate, but after a couple years of diligence it would appear that I have actually made progress; I was a bit astounded that it was 3.75%. I want an auto loan on my credit history, although I plan on paying it off early. I still can't get a Chase card and I haven't even tried for Amex (I GOT A CHASE CARD SINCE I MADE THIS POST), but I do have cards with no annual fee plus rewards now so I'm pretty happy. I use Mint and CreditKarma and I have a Google Docs spreadsheet to really hard track all of my monthly expenses. I only earn a little over 40k so it's not like I'm dealing with the big bucks, but I will say that I feel good about where I am at two years later. I have 8k in retirement (NOW 16K) and an emergency fund as well. I don't have kids so I'm not spending there, and although I am frugal I really don't feel like I have been living without (Example I get organic food).

You can translate from English to Portuguese (and vice-versa), for example, or if you know any other languages you can translate them as well. I've made over $150 with this one, but with a lot of work.\n\n- UserTesting: You won't get tests everyday, but when you do, they're very simple to do. You get $10 for every site video review/test you do, and it's not anything complex - just talk a bit about the website, answer the questions they provide you, etc.\n\n- Prolific Academic might be the best one. You have to check the website regularly for studies (surveys), as they don't send you emails, but it's worth it. Some studies pay more than £5 for simple questions. To be honest, these even require less work than surveys I've done for sites like GlobalTestMarket, and pay a lot more.\n\nThere are survey sites like GlobalTestMarket (I don't get a lot of surveys), Toluna (it'll take you a while before you get to any sort of reward, and I still haven't), OpinionsWorld (the rewards for Portugal are awful); there's TranscribeMe in case you're willing to transcribe audio files.\n\nRelatively to smartphone apps, considering Swagbucks and Perk don't work in our country (unfortunately), you can use FreeMyApps.

{"id":"ctz7r1y","author":"finalDraft_v012","body":"This is a little difficult to answer, and I don’t fullyyy understand your question, so apologies if I’m off topic.  I’ve lived in NYC for all my life.\n\nWe do have a few Costco's, but you will likely need a car to not only get there but carry your purchases home.  Personally whenever my friends/family go to Costco, I end up not buying anything....cuz either I can find it cheaper elsewhere and closer to home, or it's something I can't carry or consume before it's gone (ex. 10lb of potatoes, not really healthy to eat all that myself anyway).\n\nNYC is pretty big, and unless you have a car, your location GREATLY impacts where you will end up shopping and how much you buy.  For instance, I take a 20min subway ride to Chinatown to stock up on Asian groceries, like noodles and sauces that non-Asian groceries don’t sell.  The amount I buy is limited by how much I can shove in a backpack and carry home on the train.  If you see something on sale for cheap at your local grocery, you can stock up there….but I can’t really think of anything like Costco.  Trader Joe’s has good prices on stuff, so you should definitely check out that chain when you get here.\n\nYou’re gonna use at least a month to get acquainted with your neighborhood - your neighborhood around where you live, which is probably the primary place you’ll shop, and the neighborhood around where you work.  It’s convenient to grab stuff on your way home.  Weekends can be good for venturing further (ex. I wouldn’t go to Chinatown after work because then I’d get home at 9PM…).  Different stores, different chains have different sales, and it rotates every week.  You could be lucky and happen to live by a Korean grocery, as an example, who happens to have cheap produce and that ends up being where you buy 3 green bell peppers for $1 (and you can buy as many as you think you can eat).  Once I got to know the current neighborhood I live in, I realized the grocery 5 blocks away was cheaper overall than the one 2 blocks away, so I can’t emphasize enough how much you need to know your area.  I get a big 12-pack of paper towels for $9.99 at that grocery when it goes on sale, and I’ll stock up.  I’d consider that a bulk buy since it takes months to go through.\n\nI should also say though. If your apartment isn’t that big, you may not necessarily want to buy bulk of everything you used to buy.  Think about your storage space in your apartment.\n\nWe have a lot of discount stores that sell household items in the city.  Those are GREAT places to stock up on things, like you can get those deodorizer beads for $2 at a certain one, whereas the same jar at a CVS would cost $6.  Many are not chains, so again you have to EXPLORE your neighborhood.\n\nOther than all that, I have to say a lot of my bulk purchases come from Amazon.  Definitely compare the prices to what is around you, sometimes those discount stores or grocery sales are better.  But also sometimes I just order from Amazon cuz I can’t carry home, for example, 48 rolls of paper towels at a time.\n\nHope some of that helped, I can clarify anything if needed.","name":"t1_ctz7r1y","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-11 17:24:37","week":33}

Rather than trying to break stuff down my paycheck, look at your total monthly spending.  So, assuming 2 paychecks a month - you take home $1960/month.\n\nFrom that your bills are:\n\nRent and utilities: FREE (to you)\n\nFed Student Loans: $430 (25% of take home)\n\nPhone Bill: $98 (5%)\n\nWells Loan: $56 (3%)\n\nCareCredit: $280 (15%)\n\nAdobe: $30 (2%)\n\nCar: $283 (15%)\n\nECSI: $40 (2%)\n\nMisc (undies, shave, Netflix, gym): $38 (3%)\n\n\nSo, before food, gas, etc you are spending 70% of your take home.  And that's with no rent, no utilities, no car insurance.  But let's add in the expected spending from your other spreadsheet:\n\nAmazon: $200 (10%)\nFood: $200 (10%)\nGas: $100 (5%)\nMisc: $300 (15%)\n\nthat's a nice 110% so far.  And that is with only $50 (3%) going to a 401k and multiple normal bills being paid by your mother - you aren't 'free' to live in her house, she has higher bills because of it.  Sure, this doesn't count your side income, but it just looks like you are working your butt off and spending it on 'MISC and Amazon' so you can keep working your butt off.  you make $500/month and spend $500/month.\n\nThe problem is you are living like you make $75k on what looks to be about $30-35k (maybe 40-45k after all your side jobs).  you are over spent on everything and don't even have rent/utilities to pay.  you are spending almost $200 a year on new underwear when you are drowning in debt.\n\n","name":"t1_ctzb1mw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-11 18:47:58","week":33}

I can't think of any way that a person could file a scam claim while getting to keep their money *and* the item, especially on such an easily returnable item.  I guess they could accidentally break it within 30 days, and then make a crappy claim to Amazon that it had been sent to them broken.  I guess if their account was in good standing then Amazon would keep my money and I'd get negative metrics, or Amazon returns my money and the broken item and negative metrics.  Right?\n\nAnd then I'd have an almost worthless broken item and *then* consider selling it on eBay.  ;)\n\nAs an Amazon customer, the only way I have ever gotten a refund plus keeping the item is when I sent them photos of a truly cheap broken item (Amazon Basics iPhone cable) or with a huge 70-pound 7.1 audio system that was repeatedly delisted from Amazon due to customer complaints after I had sent it to the manufacturer for fruitless repairs.\n\nThank you all for your insights in this thread.","name":"t1_ctzh4ru","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-11 21:12:01","week":33}

{"id":"ctzti4a","author":"MaxK","body":"No -- it's not wishful thinking.  It's the law of the land.  Increases in automation increase the productivity of the average worker.  If you employ a man to dig an irrigation ditch with a shovel, he might be able to complete the task in two days.  If you employ a man to dig an irrigation ditch with a back-hoe, he might be able to complete the task in two hours.  The same man is worth MORE because of the technology that put brigades of individuals carrying shovels out of work, and therefore it makes sense for me to pay him more.  The same principle applies to driverless vehicles: I can pay a bus driver $20 an hour to drive a busload of people from one place to another, or I can pay an Operator $120k to oversee the automatic function of a fleet of buses carrying passengers.  But just as the increase in productivity means the back-hoe operator can dig ditches eight times as quickly, enabling us to engage in more construction, larger projects, and complete them faster, so too do the commuters benefit from the possibility of more frequent buses, 24-hour operation and cheaper fares.  Automation may mean free overnight shipping on all your Amazon purchases.  It means Sysco (the company that supplies alll the restaurants with their food and cooking equipment) can make automated deliveries overnight.  Now with cheaper, more reliable public transportation and cheaper acquisition of business supplies, businesses are more profitable and hire more workers who spend less on transportation and therefore keep more of their earnings.  Now you might see new businesses started that were previously impossible.  Companies start loading up driverless vehicles with (now cheaper) freshly-cooked food and now you can order Indian delivered to your office by a driverless vehicle free of charge instead of having to walk to lunch.  This might enable a new breed of on-demand restaurants.  Shit!  I forgot to pick up milk on the way home.  No worries -- I'll open up the grocery store's app and order it now.  I'll pick up some produce and cat litter while I'm at it.  Somebody at the market gets hired to pack up the driverless truck the moment the order comes in and it gets dispatched to your house within ten minutes.  Your app beeps when the truck is outside, you pick up your fresh milk and produce and walk back in the house, happy you don't have to lug that heavy bag of cat litter yourself anymore.\n\nEntirely new businesses are possible once the technology becomes available.  So yeah, maybe instead of driving a delivery truck you'll be packing groceries, managing a fleet, or cooking Indian food but the point is when productivity goes up you become more valuable.  You get paid more.  And new jobs in previously-nonexistent industries get created.  Humans haven't changed much in the past five hundred years.  If you plucked up the average modern American and dropped them in early colonial America circa 1550 there's probably about a 50% chance they'd starve to death within a month.  But if you sent them back there with a tractor and a few drums of diesel they'd be a retired by the time the oil ran out.  Increases in productivity enrich us all.  So despite there being only a small fraction of the population dedicated to farming compared to 450 years ago we ALL live much better lives.  It's true that none of us are farmers, but it's okay because some of became Uber drivers and cable installers and brain surgeons and traffic cops and all the other many, many jobs that never existed back then and we live like kings in comparison because that productivity has risen.","name":"t1_ctzti4a","subreddit":"economy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhpn","created_utc":"2015-08-12 02:35:07","week":33}

{"id":"ctzyiyw","author":"Casaham","body":"Also a high schooler here, but luckily able to take advantage of my school's online courses. I'm at home for most of the day during the week. I'm not really a beermoney \"master\" but my routine is as follows:\n\nWake up, run Bing Pong while I make breakfast. Bing has been being an enormous pain in the ass lately, so I'm probably going to have to drop this soon. I have around ~25-30 accounts and I have it set up to where each account is run under a different IP address. A few months ago, I would grab over $100 in Amazon gift cards at the end of the month. Lately, it's been closer to $45, if I'm lucky. \n\nOnce breakfast is done, I'll start up Swagbucks. It's not my favorite beermoney website, but it's been true to me for the last two or three years, so I stick with it. I tried the more popular instaGC but I was constantly being banned for fraud even though I never put in any false information, but that's another story. \n\nI'll check /r/swagbucks real quick to see if there are any crediting special offers. Check my survey walls for quickies. Then, I'll start running their semi-passive video things on my second monitor, primarily SBTV. Since I spend a lot of time during the day in front of my computer, I'm able to babysit it. It doesn't autorun anymore AFAIK, which is a pain. SBTV will run in the background all day. I also have three different iDevices which will run the SB mobile apps for the majority of the day. On semi-passive SB crap alone, I probably make close to $12-15 a week. It would be more if it weren't for the SB apps crashing constantly. \n\nAll of that is running while I am completing school work, housework, etc. The most active way that I make beermoney is primarily through Postloop right now. I'm subscribed to pretty much every forum/blog that they have available, and I average like 60 comments a day, at about 6-7 cents per comment. That may seem like a lot, but I've been doing it for so long that it only takes me a couple of minutes to write each comment. I'll do a dozen or so posts whenever I have some free time. This gets me a little over $3.50 a day. \n\nAll of that, on top of other miscellaneous things that I do (HITPredictor weekly contest, various panels and what not) I can usually make around $200 in a month, or $6 a day. May sound impressive on paper, but it's probably closer to just right considering how much work is put into it. Really, the key is just knowing how to effectively multitask.

{"id":"cu1dos3","author":"imnotminkus","body":"For around $100, you can help Bob Barker control the pet population.  [Here's a list of the benefits of spaying and neutering](http://www.spayusa.org/benefits.php).  One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that neutering male dogs will generally decrease aggression, and some dog parks require dogs to be fixed.  \n\nIn terms of the cheapest place, your best bet is to Google something like \"spay neuter [your city]\", without the quotes.  The ASPCA has a [locator](http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter) for low-cost spay and neuter programs, but it doesn't seem to be very up to date, and the place I used (2 miles away) isn't listed.\n\nOther notes on affordability:  \n\n* Flea and tick: buy the largest dosage of Frontline and divide doses accordingly (eg. large dog 6-pack is the same price as smaller dog 6-pack, but contains 5 times as much medicine).  Store opened vials upright, sealed with plastic tape in a ziplock bag, in a cool, dark place.\n\n* Stomach worms: buy fenbendazole liquid for goats on Amazon or at a feed store.  Calculate correct dosage.  It's the same active ingredient as in dog wormer, but much less expensive.\n\n* Heartworms: get heartworm test to confirm dog is heartworm-free (if a dog has heartworms and is given a normal dose of heartworm preventative, it could die).  Get ivermectin for sheep, horses, etc. for very cheap, divide dosage accordingly.  Check and double check.  Also, if your dog is one of the breeds listed on [this page](http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/toxicity/c_dg_ivermectin_toxicity), don't use ivermectin.\n\n* Food: There's no limit to the cost of dog food people will insist you need to buy.  I initially fed my dog Ol' Roy high energy at $25 for 50 lb ($0.50/lb) from Walmart - it's better than many popular brands, but not great.  Since I've gotten a Costco membership, I now get Kirkland Signature Adult Chicken (and I mix it in with some Kirkland mature dog food for the extra glucosamine).  It's much better than the Ol' Roy, and only $0.68/lb.  http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/ will show you ratings for different dog foods and explain the ingredients.  They also have a [guide on how to choose a dog food](http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/frequently-asked-questions/choose-dog-food/).  \n\n* Treats:  Get a cheap pack of hot dogs, cut into as thin slices as you possibly can.  I get ~80 \"treats\" out of one hot dog.","name":"t1_cu1dos3","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-13 10:09:07","week":33}

You will get 5 points upon completing that. Additionally, you can get Amazon giftcards, which is important, instantly. Actually instantly. Enter the points you want to redeem, and bam a cash converted amount from those points will appear within the second. So, basically you can get that done within the hour. Not available to anyone except for Australians, but you can VPN it I reckon. \n\nOriginal Post:\n\nHow to make money?\n\nAt YourVoice, you can make money by completing surveys. A point is worth 10 cents, and minimum redemption for PayPal is $20. Minimum redemption through Amazon is $5. Keep in mind that although they say they're going to pay you $6/hr of survey completing, you can brush through $15 worth of surveys per hour. The time limit is very warped, so don't worry. Everyday, they will give you $10 worth of surveys to complete, and it takes only 40 minutes to complete. This is important for your daily routine! It is a part of mine.\n\nHow is this better than any other survey website?\n\nFirst of all, PayPal payments are instant. That's right, instant. When you hit the payout, just type in how many points you want to redeem, and then sign in with your PayPal (look out for the green PayPal bar), and then payment is instantly made. Amazon payments are also instant. All payments are instant!\n\nWhere is it available to?\n\nThis website is open to Australians only. It's great to have a website just for us Aussies!

Amazon also got a boost from a 34.3% increase in year-over-year gross merchandise value through “Fulfillment by Amazon,” in which Amazon handles orders, payments and customer service for retailers who sell goods through its marketplace. The percentage of goods not fulfilled by Amazon from all channels, including search, website and other third-party management systems, stayed about the same at 2%, compared with 1.9% in July 2014.\n\nIf you are selling MF, I would definitely jump on the FBA bandwagon.\n\n2. EBay’s same-store sales for July grew 5.8%, about one-third of the 15% rate that research firm comScore predicted for overall e-commerce and a slowdown from eBay’s 7.2% growth in June. The major reason: eBay’s continued auction declines, down 33.4% in July on top of a 25.5% drop in June, and a 5.2% year-over-year increase in its fixed-price sales, according to the ChannelAdvisor report.\n\nFuck auctions.","name":"t1_cu1gbiv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-13 13:06:21","week":33}

You are also mixing up sales tax and \n\n&gt;GC's are a lot like coupons, they have no cash value. No one can demand $5 cash from Amazon for a $5 Amazon card. GC's have no cash value. The value comes from the fair market price of the redemption.\n\n&gt; Perhaps this will prove my point. If a customer does not redeem their gift card, the merchandiser can offload the gift card onto a state controller. The customer can still claim the gift card from the state, or choose to ignore it. In any case, the customer is not taxable for a GC they did not redeem. \n\nIf the merchant offloads the gift card to a state controller, then the MERCHANT is not taxed on the gift card. \n\n&gt;GC's are a lot like coupons, they have no cash value. No one can demand $5 cash from Amazon for a $5 Amazon card. GC's have no cash value. The value comes from the fair market price of the redemption.\n\nGCs are almost exactly like bonds. The only difference is that there is no maturity wait. They both have 2 values: a face value, and a street value. If you want, you could even go about investing in gift cards, buying them for cheap and selling them for a higher price, but then you would have to pay capital gains tax on that.  When you BUY a bond, it is not taxable income, as you have just exchanged one form of financial asset for another financial asset. Likewise, when you BUY a gift card, there is no tax, as you have exchanged one form of financial asset for another. However, when you get a gift card for free or as [compensation for work](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/taxation-gift-cards-employees-19006.html), then it is income, and the IRS wants a share.

{"id":"cu1qwp0","author":"matterhorn1","body":"There was a really good article I read a while back that explained this, I wish I knew where I read it.\n\nBasically you need to sell A LOT of books, likes hundreds or thousands per day to make this worthwhile. By shipping so much stuff, they get really big discounts from USPS. So Amazon is charging X amount (let's say it's $2) to the customer, but it only costs you $1.80 to ship and pay Amazon fees, so in the end you come out ahead by $0.20. IMO it is really not worthwhile, and I am sure everyone would make more if they just raised the price of all those penny books to $1-$2 (people would still buy them since you still won't find anywhere cheaper than that). I am sure these are huge operations that have a group of people working on the shipments, and they are probably getting their books for free (Actually I think I also read that some people use a disposal company so that publishers pay them to take their books away). You sell 1000 books per day at $0.20, and that's $200 profit per day, (take away whatever you are paying your employees, and what much be a huge warehouse rental fees from that...)","name":"t1_cu1qwp0","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-13 18:52:05","week":33}

If it's a slow mover of course they won't be in a rush to buy more of it. \nWhen I was younger there was an item that was available in local stores, but apparently was not as easily found elsewhere in the country. There was a big gap in price between the store price and the price on eBAY. My family and I were doing retail arbitrage and didn't even realize it. I remember them even driving further out to buy up stock like an hour or so away from the house. \nThe only way I realized this product was going for so much on eBAY was because someone stole ours from our front lawn..it was an inflatable , and I looked for them on eBAY and saw the crazy high prices. \nFinding a product like that is rare though...and nowadays with the Amazon marketplace , everyone would probably throw those items on Amazon and it would be another race to the bottom situation. \nI think the key was that it was sold at a drug store chain - Rite Aid..which may have not been in some other states/cities in the country..or those other stores maybe just didn't stock the item.

Okay- so I bought two mattresses on amazon- and lemme tell you about them- just search amazon for name, because I dont think im supposed to post links.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Signature Sleep Contour 8-Inch Mattress** (169$ for a full) (225$ for queen) -- I bought this for the guest bedroom when my roommate moved in, and had no money, and needed a bed. I got the queen, but I'm positive I only paid like 200 even for it so it looks like the price has gone up a bit for the queen. She slept on it for over a year until we threw it away about a month ago. we only threw it away because her bedroom window-AC unit leaked, and we had the boxspring and mattress sitting directly on floor, and the entire thing became entirely moldy. she LOVED this mattress, and when I first got it, I was actually very jealous and considered using the new mattress for myself and letting her use my two year old brand name mattress that cost me well over 800$ but i decided not to. this mattress is very soft, which i love, though you may want something thats firmer and has more support. when it comes time for me to buy another mattress, I will definitely purchase this\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nalso  the\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sleep Master 6-Inch Smooth Top Therapeutic Memory Foam Mattress**  -- which I got the full for 131$ but is now listing for 140ish$.

(not as much as the other mattress, which was only a little bit more and was a queen instead of king). I used to take small naps on it, and my back always felt really great afterwards. I had a couple guests stay, one for an entire week and they LOVED it. the guest that stayed for a week actually ended up buying this for their guest room at home when they learned I only paid 130$ for it. Now that we had to throw my roommates mattress out, my roommate is now sleeping on this... it's been like two weeks now. She said it was a little firmer than she is used to, and sleeping on a memory foam took a bit of adjusting, but she LOVES it now. she says she misses her old bed, but that's because we are soft bed people. she thinks this one must be better for her back, and she says she's really happy with it and she feels really good in the morning.","name":"t1_cu33x70","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-14 21:17:42","week":33}

Most of my rationale stems from a simple cost perspective. 5 to 10 subscriptions at $5 to $10 dollars a month translates into big bucks over the course of a month, year, and lifetime. \n\nI see \"on demand\" replacing subscriptions. If not \"on demand\" it should be so flexible that it feels like on demand. We did subscription diapers for both kids through Amazon Mom. Overall it was good for the cost savings, but we had several times when we had to either buy \"emergency\" packs or had a surplus of diapers. Having a surplus of diapers when the child is on the cusp of changing sizes is also a big problem. Lots of blow outs. \n\nFor items that are not needed to sustain life, subscriptions are probably one of the first ways for someone to reduce monthly costs. In a bad economy, subscription services will tank hard. \n\nI reckon everyone in the subscription selling business has seen a precipitous drop from places where OIL is big employer. Ie.

{"id":"cu3luy7","author":"TheSmokey1","body":"Man I'm so glad I saw you post this and it's almost explained a question I've been trying to figure out with my Amazon store card. Being my first \"credit card\", I wasn't fully aware that interest from individual purchases could all hit at one point, especially after the introductory period. Once the interest hit, I suddenly found myself over the credit limit. Long story short, for about two years now my balance has been around $2100. At the time, I was buying equipment for a side business I was going to start up and then my work schedule changed. I've been doing the minimum payments because it's all I've been able to afford (yeah yeah, I know, I screwed up and I've been literally paying for it ever since, but being my first card I just really didn't fully understand how the interest would accrue). \n\nBecause this interest never seems to end and I can't really afford to fork out $2k out of pocket (I know, I know, don't put more on credit than you can feasibly pay off each month - lesson learned) my plan is to get a loan through the credit union (I've got good credit and have done several small loans through them to build credit in the past). \n\nWow Jesus I got off on a tangent just to ask this question... What is the magic number you pay to zero out the card so that you owe nothing else? If my current statement says $2100, is that literally what you pay and then you owe nothing else, no further interest accruals or anything? Or is it the statement balance you pay that pays it off completely? My plan is to pay it off so that I have no further payments left to make on it and then I just don't use the card anymore unless I can responsibly pay the balance each month on items I may need.

If you wait at each moment to be profitable, you're going to grow very slowly.\n\nMost times it doesn't work out, but with Uber is really is. Uber is growing at an insane rate, and at any moment they could stop growing and just be a stable business with hundreds of million a year in revenue.\n\nMany startups do fail, which is why it's called venture capital, but Uber is not one of them. They are huge already, and doubling their revenues every quarter. They are the unicorn.\n\nWhat people like you don't understand is that investors in startups know that eight out of ten companies they invest in will fail. They accept that. It's not a bad investment though, because the ninth one recoups the investors money, and the tenth one pays out twenty times the original investment.\n\nIt might not make business sense to grow so aggressively, but it's what investors demand. Startups are often forced to sacrifice stability and profitability in pursuit of hyper-growth strategies to satisfy their investors.\n\nIt's a very high-risk, high-reward kind of thing. But it works out. Personally I've made more money doing this than I would ever have made doing anything else, and the fifty people we employ have jobs because we are taking this approach.

As noted in the Deposit Account Agreement, we reserve the right to adjust the amount of your rewards or close your account due to irregular, unauthorized or fraudulent activity in your Checking Account. For example, splitting up one standard monthly bill payment into several payments to receive $0.10 per payment is deemed as irregular activity as it's not standard bill payment practice. The same holds true for debit card transactions. Asking a merchant to swipe your debit card repeatedly for each item at checkout instead of using your debit card to make a complete purchase of items at one time is recognized as manufacturing transactions and not normal everyday debit card behavior.\n\nI have had no problems when buying a bunch of $0.50 Amazon gift cards, except that after like 15 identical transactions in quick succession they start getting declined.

One of the most important things on our end is that you know how much 'selling' you should be doing when you meet with clients. Analysts on teams like mine are turned off by any RMs who act like used car salesmen. The most important thing is that you let the product's process, philosophy, etc., speak for itself. Know everything about the product that you possibly can, and be able to answer questions about why the strategy works, not just that it outperformed its benchmark on a 1 3 and 5.

Basically, be knowledgable, polite, and professional. Being funny helps too, but it's very important that we get the impression that if we give your firm an allocation, you're going to do whatever you can to help us stay informed about what's going on in the strategy, if the PMs still have conviction in that stock they're holding that's down 73% YTD and why.

You're saving them a shit load by not having medical, dental, eye, death, disability, unemployment, retirement etc. \n\nHere's what I'd do: \n\n1. Open an mint.com account, and an online savings account (Mint can recommend some to you - like FNBO).\n2. Automate money transfers from your checking into your saving account every pay day. NEVER spend the savings account $.\n3. When your savings account has 3-6 months emergency salary in it keep contributing but at a smaller rate. For example if you were putting in $200 per pay check, take it down to $50.\n4. open an investment account. I like Fidelity, but chose whatever you want. Now start automatically transferring the $ you were putting into your oh-shit saving fund into the investment account. Using the example above this would be the $150/pay check that is not longer going into savings. \n5. once the investment account is big enough start thinking about where to invest. read suze orman and david bach for simple investing and money advise basics. they are both excellent humans and write pretty simple books. maybe you'll put it into moderate risk mutual funds. or a foreign blend investment fund. or a roth IRA. Or maybe all 3. Or maybe you'll split between a Roth IRA and Amazon stock because you have a thing for Amazon. Whatever. You'll get the hang of it over time. \n\nOnce you have 3-6 months saved in the savings account, and 10k+ in various investments KEEP CONTRIBUTING. Part of the trick is that you never stop. But you should pat yourself on the back because you are making steps to secure your future and feel more financially independence. Which is one of the most wonderful feelings in the world. In 3-4 years you'll look back at the accounts and you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish.

{"id":"cu4kych","author":"whattodo-whattodo","body":"Mostly, I like it.  The site is properly structured, consistent and clean.  You went with a framework that met the type of business that you want to do.  Many people pick the biggest frameworks just because they're the biggest.\n\nI don't have much input regarding web design.  However I did have 3 ideas on the business side of it.\n\n(1) I imagine that the papers, grinders and other inexpensive items are what gets people in the door.  These are the things that you have and they need, but they aren't the things that make you money.  The bongs, pipes and other expensive items where there is more room for markup will make you money.\n\nAs a result, I don't think they should all be treated equally.  A small, single image with a single line of text describing your flagship items won't really sell them. I think that the bulk of your efforts on content should revolve around the items that are most worthwhile to sell.\n\n(2) On the topic of papers/grinders and other consumable goods, I think it's worth extending repeating services.  These are things that people may go through in a pretty predictable way.  If they need to log onto your site to get the things they need, then *maybe* they will.  But if they've signed up to get these things once per month, then the job is to return it.  And, again *maybe* they will, but this is a much better situation for you.  I don't know enough about it to say which bundles would be grouped or which quantities, but I do think this is a service that needs to exist for this vertical.  \n\n(3) Lastly, after your customers have signed up there won't be much hesitation in ordering *again*.  But getting customers from zero to one is a big challenge.  If you sell on any of the Marketplaces (eBay, Amazon, etc) I think it's worth linking the two so that others can read your feedback.  You'll probably always have better prices on your site, but it's worth showing people that you are not a fly-by-night company which may never ship their goods.","name":"t1_cu4kych","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-08-16 06:48:51","week":33}

{"id":"cu4ure3","author":"kitikitish","body":"\"Amazon Mom is free with your Prime membership, which costs $99.\"\n\nSo if you have a $99 Prime membership, Amazon Mom is free.  You may be confused because in the past they offered Prime for free/discounted rates to students and mothers and the like, but Amazon is definitely changing into a less cool company.  If their \"Christmas in July\" thing is anything like your exclusive coupons and discounts, they are not worth considering and just a gimmick that attracts stay-at-home mothers.\n\nMost Subscribe &amp; Save deals I have seen let you save ~15%, so the fact that they are only offering a 5% non-Mom subscription discount is probably a reduction from a previous offering and a ploy to convince people to switch to the free Amazon Mom and feel the $99 Amazon Prime subscription is more worthwhile.  \n\nAnd recently, if you waive the free 2-day shipping for Prime members, they give you a $5 pantry credit, but of course those don't stack because then it might actually be worthwhile.  You have to find some over-priced Amazon Pantry item, then get a $5 discount to bring it back to a reasonable price.  It seemed like a great deal, but I'd prefer the stackable $1 MP3 discounts that they have offered in the past.\n\nIn summation, Amazon Mom seems designed to make you feel better about your $99 Prime subscription but offer minimal benefits, aside from getting the previously normal subscription discount on diapers.

{"id":"cu4wykp","author":"Alex-Gopson","body":"Making it possible?  Not so much.\n\nYou want to look for very high ROI when it comes to retail arbitrage items.  Prices can drop FAST at any time with the Amazon race to the bottom.  Plus with high FBA fees, it just isn't worth it to spend $20 in a store to sell something for $35 on FBA.  After the fees you have essentially spent $20 to make $7.  Not a good use of your money and time.  Even if you have a coupon that takes $3 off the $20 item, or 5% off your cost of the item, it still is not a great buy.\n\n**Generally speaking,** if an item wasn't a good buy without a coupon or cashback reward, it won't be good buy with them either.  HOWEVER, it is still worth looking into because it can reduce your cost in acquiring inventory on valuable items.  That's just good business.\n\n---\n\nOf course, there are exceptions to this.  We've all seen those shows about people who get a cart full of items for $4, or where someone buys 100 tubes of toothpaste and gets paid $12 from the store because of some odd loophole....\n\nBut I think those stories are exaggerated, and the exception rather than the norm.  I also knew a woman who was into couponing and she spent HOURS every day scouring different blogs.  I just don't think it's worth it, especially because the manager of a store, at any time, has the discretion to just deny your purchase.","name":"t1_cu4wykp","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-16 17:50:47","week":33}

{"id":"cu54ghp","author":"pershingcubed","body":"Found this online:\n\nHow to value a biotech company? There's a question merits being broken down into its constituent parts, so let's take each word in turn.\n\n\"How to\"\nThe Vault Guide tells us that there are three methods of valuing a company. I interviewed so many candidates for investment banking analyst positions that I would have to commit suicide if I repeated them again, so I won't. Look em up if you really care--the short answer is that the \"how\" of valuing biotech companies isn't dramatically different from the way you value industrial companies or tech companies. The metrics differ, to be sure, as do the parameters. I can't think of anyone who pays attention to GAAP EPS in biotech; it's either Adjusted EPS or (since most biotechs are loss-making) something related to sales.\n\nBut there is one salient difference from other industries: You can't sell drugs in the US, or most countries for that matter, without approval from the national health authority. Until FDA or EMEA says your drug works, or at least determines that it doesn't kill people faster than the disease it's indicated for, there is no guarantee that you will sell any of it. Hence the need for biotech investors and companies to base valuations off of expected sales, which are sales estimates adjusted by probabilities that have been derived from years and years of data on drug approval/rejection rates. Companies, hedge funds and most sell-side analysts do this. There's another way to account for the risk of regulatory rejection, which is to simply bump up the discount rate that you apply to future cash flows--some sell-side analysts do this, but for their sake I won't say their names.\n\n\"value\"\nA couple of weeks ago, a banker told me a funny joke (well, funny for biotechies): \"Knock knock.\" \"Who's there?\" \"Gilead.\" \"Gilead who?\" \"Gilead Sciences Inc., the most successful biotech hedge fund of the last decade.\"\n\nFor those of you who aren't \"in the know\", Gilead is not a hedge fund at all. It's a regular corporation, a biotech company that's based, like many biotech companies, in Northern California, and was founded in the first great boom of biotech sometime in the 1980's or so. It is also currently worth about $160 billion dollars. It's the biggest biotech company in the world by market cap, eclipsing even Silicon Valley's other legend,  Genentech, when it was gobbled up by Roche in 2008. Gilead is 2.5x as valuable as Hewlett-Packard, 4x as valuable as EADS, the world's largest airplane manufacturer, almost 3x as valuable as Ford Motor Co., barely smaller than Oracle, and comfortably larger than two of the five Oil Supermajors. \n\nIf you had bought a share of Gilead in September 2004, your split-adjusted return since then would be about 1,100%. There are probably hedge funds that have returned more, but unlike them, your share of Gilead wouldn't have cost you 2% of your basis and 20% of the profits in good years. Unlike many hedge funds or other highly acquisitive companies like Pfizer, Gilead has an astonishingly good track record of creating shareholder value through investing in external growth. In one of the most spectacularly successful M&amp;A deals that the US healthcare industry has ever seen, Gilead paid $11 billion in late 20011 for Pharmasset. The notes the next morning were brutal. \"Overpaid.\" \"Significant development risk.\" \"Don't understand the thesis.\" Blablabla. Three years later, the company has more than quintupled in value, and the drug that Gilead acquired with Pharmasset, PSI-7977 (sofosbuvir) is expected to exceed that purchase price in annual sales.\n\nWhat is one to take from this parable? Well, I think it boils down to 3 things:\nYou can be denounced as a fool until suddenly everyone realizes you are a prophet.\nBiotech companies hate being \"value\" companies. They want to be \"growth\" companies.\nValue in biotech is not relative. It's absolute.\n\n\"a biotech company\"\nWait, what? What's so complicated about \"a biotech company\"? Well, start with the obvious problem: \"Biotech company\" is about as specific a term as \"tech company\". Is AAPL a tech company, or a consumer company? Is AMZN a tech company or an internet company? What about IBM? Oracle? Strictly speaking, the healthcare-oriented meanings of biotech refer to the relatively recent ability of humanity to harness biological processes to make drugs or detect diseases. \n\nAnd many, perhaps most \"biotech companies\" do exactly that--use biological processes to make drugs. Gilead does that. Amgen does that. Genentech, now owned by Roche, does that. So do Vertex, Alexion and Regeneron. Unlike the traditional drugs that your grandmother force-fed to your mother, \"biotech drugs\" like recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors are made with the help of processes that are, in many ways, far smarter and far more efficient than anything human minds could ever have come up with on their own. \n\nBut quite a few prominent biotech companies have very little to do with these types of drug, or are not valued solely on the basis of these drugs if they have them in their portfolio. The newest blockbuster drug to hit the market from Biogen Idec, an enormous company that plays heavily in the nervous system diseases space, is a multiple sclerosis drug called Tecfidera®; if you used to work with leather a lot, you might know it by its generic name, dimethyl fumarate, and as a chemical entity, it has been very known for decades. It was used to treat leather so as to prevent mold growth. Another gigantic biotech, Celgene Corp., was actually spun out years ago from a big industrial chemicals conglomerate called Celanese Corporation. Celgene has a dynamite franchise of drugs for blood cancers and multiple myeloma: REVLIMID®, Pomalyst® and THALOMID®. All three are derivatives of thalidomide, which like Tecfidera was known to doctors decades ago and prescribed as a treatment for morning sickness (this usage eventually stopped, because thalidomide causes ghastly birth defects). Clearly, then, being considered a biotech company doesn't really have much to do with how complex the molecules are that drive your core revenue streams.\n\nAdding to the confusion is the existence of hulking old Big Pharma companies that are increasingly starting to look like biotech companies. Nobody doubts Pfizer, Merck &amp; Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson are pharma companies, but there's a small chorus of people who think that another stalwart of the American drug business, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., behaves a lot more like biotech than pharma. Certainly on a multiples basis it trades at a premium to some of the Big Biotechs I mentioned above, which would appear to be a violation of the conventional wisdom that biotechs are more expensive because they are faster-growing. French pharma giant Sanofi SA scooped up Genzyme, a maker of biologic drugs for extremely rare diseases, and holds a big chunk of Regeneron, another biologics company that does cancer and eye diseases. AstraZeneca plc fended off an unsolicited offer from Pfizer in part by arguing to shareholders that it ought to be valued like a biotech rather than a pharma, which is to say, big dependence on a \"pipeline\" of highly speculative immunotherapeutics, for things like cancer. \n\nTo be sure, nobody claims that Sanofi or AstraZeneca are biotech companies, nor is anyone about to do so. But what exactly constitutes a biotech company is now a very nebulous concept. There was a point in time when biotech could be distinguished from traditional pharma by the discovery, research and development methods used; but now, those methods are used in drug development everywhere. One might have argued some years ago that the chief distinction between biotech and pharma was simply one of higher multiples to give credit for faster growth potential. Perhaps, but that is no longer the case. Many pharma's, like AstraZeneca, BMS and Takeda, have gone on acquisition sprees in attempt to gain some of the biotech mojo (with varying degrees of success), and there has been a considerable amount of cannibalization among biotechs too. A few years hence, the distinction between biotech and pharma may disappear altogether. A few years ago on CNBC, I saw Sam Isaly, one of the founding partners of the brilliant life sciences hedge fund OrbiMed Advisors remark that it was perhaps just a matter of time before the Big Four of biotech--Gilead, Amgen, Biogen Idec and Celgene--either got acquired by pharma companies...or themselves went out and acquired pharma companies, thereby dissolving the barrier between the industries for good.\n","name":"t1_cu54ghp","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2015-08-16 21:39:59","week":33}

{"id":"cu55bzc","author":"ktchong","body":"I also was also banned from Bing Rewards earlier today.   I had only one Bing reward account, (i.e., my only Microsoft account.) I had never used a bot. However, I saved my favorite search terms in bookmarks.  Every day I reloaded those bookmarks to earn the reward points. I believe that was what got me banned.\n\nWhich has turned out to be a good thing, because I started using *Google* to find information about Bing bans. That was how I found out about [Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/), (way better than Bing rewards; I just joined and started using it a few hours ago.) I decided to close my Microsoft account - i.e., my main and only Microsoft account. I wiped clean all traces of Bing from my search bars, PC, notebook, smartphone and tablet.  Good riddance because Bing was actually a horrible search engine. I had been using Bing for three years. I had hoped that its interface would improve, but it had stayed horrible throughout those three years. Microsoft has made absolutely no attempt to make even the slightest improvement to Bing during those three years.\n\nAnd I will not be buying anything from Microsoft ever again. Not an Xbox. Not a Microsoft keyboard or mouse or whatever. Not a Microsoft phone. Nothing from Microsoft, ever. I am a PC gamer, so unfortunately I am stuck with Windows for playing games. At least I do not have to directly pay a dime for Windows. And I will not be using Bing, Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer or Edge or whatever Microsoft is calling it now, or any other Microsoft products even if they are free.\n\nI have saved up about $320 worth of credits on Amazon, from Bing rewards and (mostly) recycling bottles from my home, work and rental properties.  Do you know how I will be using those $320?  \n\nA *Playstation 4*.

Save that kind of thinking for when you are in your early twenties with actual responsibilities.\n\nAs for now, I would pick one or two companies you really like and buy their stocks on the next down day.

I picked Apple stock (AAPL) when I was your age and ended up nearly tripling my initial investment a few years later.

{"id":"cu5885d","author":"furryoso","body":"I interviewed at Amazon and find these \"expect them to be right\" pieces utter bullshit. Amazon is looking for members of a hive. When a worker bee or higher questions the hive, they are excommunicated and banished.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy interview process was an 8 hour day full of questioning styles that ranged from friendly, to tag team (good cop/bad cop), to people looking for exact specific methods of making a task work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe interviewers ranged from working peers to mid management to head of department.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon itself was filled with contradiction. I would be told how  individual creativity was greatly valued but noticed the work flow to look like cut-out examples of the same catalog; no more than 2 - 3 brands of clothes, colors, or styles-- accompanied by a starbucks cup firmly in grasp.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's a place that \"values individual creativity\" but makes each person use their keycard to enter a room. Not open a door mind you... but track where you are in the facility. So, if I used my card to open the door for 8 people, each person uses their card to check in the door... then the hallway... then the next room... next hallway... etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIndividuality was expressed in the form of stickers on their computer, as long as it was an amazon related sticker... because \"we are awesome!\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI knew when I walked in that this wasn't the right fit for me, so I spent most of the day determining the number I'd give them for a salary. The question I asked myself after each interview was \"how much would I need to make to enjoy coming to work here?\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter each interview, the number increased.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt the end of each interview, the person or team would ask me \"what questions do you have for me?\" Each time I had only one... *how long have you worked here?*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost people were 1 - 2 years. The head of the department was just over a year. Noone was more than 2 years-- with the exception of HR, who I spoke with last, and who had been there for 8 years.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a great, very real conversation with her. She was awesome. She told me of the perks for my position and then asked me what I would expect for a starting salary.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI showed her my notes with numbers crossed out and increased.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first number I wrote was 95k. I told her my minimum salary requirement was $750k over 3 years, guaranteed unless I quit. She didn't seem shocked but did ask me to clarify.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI told her that we both knew I wouldn't be working here in 3 years and needed to have enough money to move my family to the west coast and back again to the east coast when they've decided to end the relationship. (Plus, I didn't think the timeframe would be beneficial for my wife to find work and then leave, trying to find work again... so perhaps better to let my income support us until we figure out where we'll go after Amazon.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe awesome  HR employee nodded as I talked. I told her that I thought Seattle was truly one of the cleanest cities I've seen and the view of Mt. Ranier was truly magnificent. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI told her how I felt about the prisoner tracking (keycard) and understood why noone I spoke with, excepting her, had been here longer than 2 years.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe took notes, thanked me, and said they'd call. A week later they countered with 500k. I doubled down for 1.5mil. I'm still here on the east coast and have a little smile everytime I see one of these articles about working for Amazon.","name":"t1_cu5885d","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-08-16 23:34:23","week":33}
