{"id":"3bp4ij","author":"Breaking-Glass","body":"Just received an email from Amazon about the change. It's only for the holiday season. I'm curious how this will affect your plans in the winter, if at all. If it will effect you, how do you feel about it? Here's the text of the email. \n\nHello from Amazon Services, To maintain a great customer experience this holiday season, we are announcing the holiday selling guidelines for the Toys &amp; Games store. Effective November 17, 2015, only sellers who meet the following criteria will be eligible to sell in the Toys &amp; Games category from November 17, 2015 through January 5, 2016. \n• Your first sale on Amazon.com must occur prior to September 18, 2015; the sale does not need to be specific to the Toys &amp; Games store\n• You must process and ship at least 25 orders from September 1 through October 31, 2015; the orders do not need to be specific to the Toys &amp; Games store\n • Your pre-fulfillment cancel rate for the period from October 1 through October 31, 2015 must be no greater than 1.75% \n• Your late shipment rate for the period from October 1 through October 31, 2015 must be no greater than 4% \n• Your order defect rate must be no greater than 1% short term as of November 1, 2015 Orders that use Fulfillment by Amazon will not be subject to the above criteria provided your account is in good standing. You can find your cancel rate, late shipment rate, and order defect rate in the Performance section of your seller account. If your account does not meet the above criteria, we encourage you to take corrective action now to help ensure your eligibility to sell in the Toys &amp; Games during the holiday season. Amazon Services reserves the right to cancel listings, remove selling privileges, and prohibit the sale of specific products to maintain a great customer shopping experience. Here are some steps you can take to remain eligible to sell in Toys &amp; Games throughout the holiday season: \n• Monitor performance metrics and take corrective action when necessary\n • Utilize Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to ship products to customers • Check your orders frequently in the Manage Orders section of your account \n• Minimize order cancellations; only show inventory for sale that you have available to ship \n• Ship orders and confirm shipment in a timely manner • Ensure your seller policies are up to date \n• If you work with outside drop-shippers, solidify their SLA commitments for providing prompt shipping confirmation\n Thank you for selling on Amazon. Regards, Amazon Services\n\nMy only concern is gonna be hitting the 25 in a month, but lately I've been getting lots of sales. Hopefully my inventory will grow, and with the busier season I'll make the cut.\n\nAlso Mods, I'm on mobile, and have no clue how to tag a post Could you message me on how? Or please tag this as discussion. Thanks.","name":"t3_3bp4ij","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-01 02:31:58","week":27}

{"id":"3bpert","author":"camthedon","body":"Hi there,\n\nI am a seasoned wantrepreneur. I have been wanting to build a brand, specifically, bath and beach towels. I don't know why, but i would like to build a luxury bath towel product geared towards beach goers mostly female aged 18-50, also, home use. \n\nAnyways, would anyone be interested in following along with me as i progress i.e. current updates about the product (minus who my source is) but everything else would be 100% transparent including costs. \n\nI will go through product samples, packaging, shipping, website creation, possibly Amazon FBA. I honestly have never started a business other than casual blog websites for adsense. That said I don't know if I will be doing the LLC route and most likely be doing things on the amateur side. \n\nI will also be attempting to do all this on a budget of $300-500 dollars max. If anyone is interested, let me know, i think it will give me a kick in the butt to move on it. I think also it would give others motivation to stop trying to buy knock-offs and start building their own brands. \n\n--Update 1-- \n\nThanks for the feedback so far. I don't know why a lot of the comments are being downvoted though. Especially the people who are just excited and commented that they are interested. \n\nI would appreciated feedback from the people who downvoted as well. \n\nThanks!\n\n--Update 2--\n\nAlso! I don't plan on going through Alibaba to get the product. I am planning on finding wholesale through google searches.

{"id":"3bsep6","author":"badwithmoneythrow","body":"I'm 25. I live in Eastern Washington State.\nI'm terrible with personal finances.\nI got my first bank account at a local bank when I was 18, right after I got my first job. I was young and dumb and thought I was now wealthy and spent money I didn't have. I overdrew around $200, then couldn't pay it back and my account was eventually shut down.\n\nMy second account was at US Bank, I got it after I got a new job that only did Direct Deposit. The job paid really, really well and I wanted to build credit so I signed up for a credit card with them. I spent a bunch of money on the card then was let go from the job a week later. Eventually my account was shut down. I owe about $800 to US Bank.\n\nThen I opened an account at Bank Of America. And a little mix up with a subscription to Amazon Prime that I wasn't aware of eventually caused that one to be shut down. I owe about $250 to BoA.\n\nSo now I've been working a new job for a few months and they do paper checks. Every payday, I go to the issuing bank to cash it and I'm charged a fee. I've gotten tired of those fees. I'd like to open an account at a new bank or CU but honestly I'm scared to be rejected.

Like I said, for fun. I love it, and I like to at least try all of them that can be done for around 100 bucks or whatever.\n\nIts became a hobby of mine to see if I can generate even a dollar with each popular method. My adsense has paid me 200 bucks or something, my niche site 0, ebay at times thousands, flipping salvage goods truckloads 14k a year or so, fiverr gigs 0, etc. etc. \n\nBut, I can safely say the I could easily take 1000 dollars and replicate over and over again a real \"way above average\" income with retail arbitrage on Amazon FBA.\n\nMy questions is this, if I wanted to create an ebook that showed the absolute basics on how to do this, so everyone can try it...is there even a way left to market it to where people would buy it because they believed what was claimed?\n\nI feel as if the ebook market is insanely saturated. I just want to sell a book for $4.99 or whatever with very crude \"this is how you do it\" steps, so people can get started trying it. But along side my book are millions of get rich quick books being marketed by really really good marketers, not a guy trying to show your something real, but also profit from it. \n\nP.S This books does not exist, there isnt a link, and I, at this point, am not trying to trick you into buying it. But I can write it. Just want to talk it through first.\n\nThoughts?\n\n","name":"t3_3bsr2x","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-01 23:09:11","week":27}

{"id":"3bsvfi","author":"Tully29","body":"Hello Redditors,\n\nI am looking to sign up for the Discover IT card to take advantage of their double cash back promotion for the first twelve billing cycles. I will have several large purchases coming up and they all can wait until their Discover 5% category is active (Hello new gaming desktop and PS4). I already have three active credit cards though and would not want active card #4... Ideally I'd like to keep my total cards to three for peace of mind and simplicity's sake, but this does mean closing out a current card, and I am afraid of what that might do to my credit score.\n\nPast Accounts:\n\n2008-2011,  MasterCard - My first credit card while I was in college. It was stolen from my apartment in 2011 and once I cleared up all of the fraudulent charges (among them $500 to match.com, $1.06 to bed bath and beyond...really?) I opted to close out the account. Probably not the wisest thing to have done but this was before I knew anything about credit history and building credit.\n\nCurrent Accounts:\n\n2011 - Present, Amazon Rewards Visa - My oldest active card. Signed up and approved the day I ended my stolen card. Although I used this heavily in the past, I don't really ever use this card anymore as I favor my other two. This is the card I would cancel if I signed up for Discover IT. It has a good amount of Amazon rewards on it, so its final act of service would be to redeem those rewards and then call to cancel next billing cycle.\n\n2013 - Present, American Express Blue Cash Everyday - I use this when I get the special promotions from Amex, and when I would only get 1% from my other card below. It get's used fairly often, no complaints.\n\n2014 - Present, Sallie Mae Barclay's MasterCard - I use this one for all of my Gas/Grocery/Amazon purchases. It is my most heavily used card of the three.\n\nSo I guess what I am trying to figure out is if it would greatly hurt my credit score for an extended period of time if I were to close my oldest active account and open up a brand new account with Discover. I've never carried a balance and according to the FICO reports that come with my current card, my score is anywhere from 815 to 820 on any given month.\n\nIf both closing out an account and opening a new one would not be advised, how harmful would it be to just close out my Visa account and bring my active accounts down to two? I'd rather have two active cards over 4 active where one is not being used.\n\nThanks for the help!","name":"t3_3bsvfi","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-01 23:40:33","week":27}

{"id":"3bvg0c","author":"GoKone","body":"Hello all! This is a continuation of the story behind the ultra-comfortable men's boxer briefs startup. You might've seen a prior [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2v7fib/how_i_gathered_35000_emails_in_2_weeks/) on gathering e-mails for a product launch (more on that later). We recently launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1184319318/premium-boxer-briefs-ridiculous-comfort-at-a-fair) and have raised $30k in 16 days. Here's a personal write-up on how we reached this point, and what it took to get here.\n\n**Find your Product**\nThis is the point that's easiest to get to, and at the same, easiest to drop away from and back to your normal lives. I listened carefully to everyone around me for over a year, learning about their problems with brands, pricing, personal stuff, lifestyle issues, etc. I forgot to listen to myself until it came time to buy more boxer briefs. I looked online. My first choice was Amazon.com and found Calvin Klein underwear for $28. I said, ok, that's better than buying it at $31 plus tax on Nordstrom. I added 1 to my cart, and then proceeded to change the quantity to 7. Total was $196 with free prime shipping (yay for free shipping!). But heck, $200 on underwear? I might as well make my own! **ding!**\n\n**Think of a Sales Channel**\nI've been a massive fan of online retailing since its inception. Ordering from home and getting it a few days later seems like a viable alternative to driving through traffic. I looked at amazon fulfillment and found fulfillment prices there don't work well with items that cost less than $15. It is because of this that I decided to launch my own store online at http://comfortableboxers.com. But be careful, this decision has plenty of repercussions:\n\n* Designing the Website - if you can't do it yourself on Shopify, you'll run into a $5000 charge for a decent website. And even if you can do it yourself, making it look spiffy is a whole other deal. And knowing how it's built is important to understanding problems later on.\n* Optimizing the Website - you need fast load times! I used [jpegMini](http://www.jpegmini.com/) to optimize my images and Mac's Keynote and Adobe Photoshop to design other things. I had to do plenty of googling to find tips and tricks on image design. Everything you see on my website was crafted by me.\n* Connecting the Website to Fulfillment centers - API's, connectors, apps. - I use [Fulfillrite](http://fulfillrite.com) fulfillment. They have an app that connects through your Shopify store. It updates inventory, tracking numbers, and has a slew of great mapping features to offer your clients all the shipping options you want. They also have great pricing on a per order basis, low storage charges, and excellent shipping rates.\n* Connecting the Website to Accounting Platforms - API's and connectors - I use [Zapstitch](http://www.zapstitch.com) on Shopify to connect to Quickbooks online. You'll need some light accounting experience to get it right as you'll need to do some account mapping.\n* Marketing, SEO, &amp; Maintenance - If the above things break, you won't have time for this, which is why you have to get everything right before you launch.\n* The result: [ComfortableBoxers.com](http://comfortableboxers.com). A fully optimized, connected, and live e-commerce platform, so far with decent google rankings on key words. Try **comfortable men's boxer briefs** or just **comfortable boxers**. I'm still working on more key words.\n\nWith this came the decision to launch a Kickstarter project to launch to product beside the e-commerce platform. We want to really test the product and the market before we stock up. Besides, I need the money to do so. However, there's still spending to be done to get to this point.\n\n**Source your Product**\nSourcing is the most expensive portion of the process. Because you don't want to stock up on inventory that's not guaranteed to be sold, you'll want to partner with someone that will sit with you throughout the process. Most factories want quick orders and deliveries and then you'll never hear from them again. Others, however, care about what they deliver to you, and make sure you're ordering at a time when you can and are able to. Finding the right factory requires time, a bit of traveling, and some swift negotiating on a friendly manner. Look for a factory that cares about you, and I mean this in a business sense. The higher your chances of success, the higher their chances of a repeat order. I gathered a team of known associates in the textile industry to source the best possible factory for my boxer briefs. I ordered samples, trials, prototypes, tests, and then repeated until we reached our current version. This can get quite expensive, but if you're sure you're making a great product, you won't have a problem spending the dough. \n\n**Arrange Logistics**\nI pre-partnered with [Flexport](https://www.flexport.com/) for shipping logistics. I was lucky enough to be accepted into this startup. When the product is ready for shipment, they're ready to get these bad boys over to my [Fulfillrite](http://fulfillrite.com) fulfillment center in New Jersey. You'll want to arrange a Door to Door shipping service, meaning you won't have to deal with customs, BL's, documents, taxes, etc. You must follow strict receiving guidelines like labeling and tagging, otherwise you'll be charged extra for labeling at the fulfillment center. This is why you have to coordinate carefully with the factory to have them labeled correctly from the **source.**\n\n**Build a Kickstarter Project**\nYou must first design a script, have it reviewed, then shoot as much video as you can. Make sure you use specific keyword that match the audience, in particular the crowdfunding aspect behind it. You then record a voice over. You shoot and record, you build a film, tie the audio and video together, and add a nice background song that goes along with your script. This is best done by a novice filmmaker with some Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premier experience. If you're a perfectionist, it can get quite stressful. But I learned Final Cut Pro and did it all myself with the help of a experienced camera man on shoots. After that, you design your rewards scales and price them at below your retail price after the campaign, offering backers additional incentive to pledge. If you have any special items you can give away, make sure you do! As for the storyline, make sure it's neat, concise, and flows well. Charts and graphs are a plus!\n\n**Prepare PR**\nYou can't launch to crickets! I found this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/28z20d/my_crowdfunding_campaign_raised_550000_in_5_weeks/) to be extremely useful. Here are the ones I paid special attention to:\n\n* [Hacking Kickstarter: How to Raise $100,000 in 10 Days](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/)\n* [Hack Kickstarter - 6 Experts Reveal How They Crowdfunded $1mil](https://www.udemy.com/hackkickstarter/#/)\n* [The hackers guide to getting press](http://austenallred.com/user-acquisition/book/chapter/press/)\n* [Advanced Kickstarter linking strategies](http://www.gamesonthebrain.com/blog/advanced-kickstarter-linking-strategies)\n* [3 Simple ways to get PR for your startup](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2014/01/15/3-simple-ways-to-get-free-pr-for-your-startup/)\n* [How we helped raise $75,000 for an Indiegogo campaign](https://www.blonde20.com/blog/2014/01/09/how-we-helped-raise-75000-for-an-indiegogo-campaign-step-by-step/)\n* [Six steps to run cheap and successful Facebook advertising campaigns](http://www.dipoll.com/blog/2010/11/six-steps-to-run-cheap-and-successful-facebook-advertising-campaigns/)\n\nThe e-mail list I gathered in early January didn't work too well, as most of my signups were women looking for coupons. About 80% of total signups were women from Canada. It got a little out of control, so I started a new referral campaign using [Kickofflabs](http://www.kickofflabs.com) and gathered 2000 signups, 80% U.S. males. I used the same methods as before, but this time I set-up e-mail validation confirmation and avoided any superfluous rewards.\n\nWe then placed a small manufacturing order to ensure our quality control methods were sound and partnered with another sourcing expert to supervise the manufacturing. All of this because, as a sacred rule of business, it's best to find problems during and not after manufacturing. We used these items as samples for bloggers and influencers to review. \n\n**Launch**\nGetting to this point took 12 months since the idea was born, and 6 months since the last prototype was built. It takes time and patience, something most people can't afford to have. But what if I told you that I did all this while on a full time job? I quit just last month to get the ball rolling on the PR. The samples that were sent to bloggers and influencers are currently being reviewed, and we're expecting some great outlets to feature us later this week. \n\nAs for Kickstarter, you'll need to have your project pre-approved by their staff to make sure it meets their guidelines. The moment I clicked launch, I fixed up all the URL forwarding with the project URL, notified the influencers, and sent out [e-mails](http://imgur.com/32fuIRW) to the Mailchimp lists, friends, and family, and this is where we are. Here are [some screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/a46qV)\n\n**Coverage**\nWe have received non-sponsored coverage from some great outlets including [ValetMag.com](http://www.valetmag.com/style/profiles-features/2015/start-it-up-comfortable-boxers-co-062615.php), [VouchMag.com](http://www.vouchmag.com/2015/06/comfortable-boxer-co-looks-to-redefine-the-boxer-brief/), [GearCulture.com](http://www.gearculture.com/goods/modal-boxer-briefs/), [TrendHunter.com](http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/comfortable-boxers), [FashInvest.com](http://www.fashinvest.com/crowdfunding-superstar-of-the-week-the-comfortable-boxers-co/), [DailyXY.com](http://dailyxy.com/article/review-comfortable-boxers-co/) and [CulturalDispatch.com](http://culturaldispatch.com/post/122771538886/the-comfortable-boxers-co-ive-never-really-give). We're working on more this week! The moment we receive interest from a publication, we place an order with 100% off through our own website, our fulfillment center receives the orders and dispatches them the same day.\n\n**Linking and SEO**\nAnother important thing to note is linking. You can either link directly to the campaign and ask the publications to switch the link to your own website later on for SEO purposes, or you can prepare a forwarding link for each publication that will automatically forward to the campaign. You want your domain out there! Take advantage of the coverage.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the process, the product, the apps and services i've used, feel free to ask. I'd be more than glad to help out.

{"id":"3bzg3m","author":"Cyrusk4","body":"Today I was reading the \"Is Tai Lopez a scammer?\" thread on this subreddit. This was the cherry on top of a slow buildup of realizations after having been entrenched in Internet marketing for years.\n\nIf you have to use the \"laws of persuasion\", the \"laws of seduction\" or any other \"laws\" or \"rules\" (no matter how factual or relevant they are) to push your business, it is manipulation. Plain and simple.\n\nThis includes marketing truisms: scarcity, social proof, the law of reciprocity. I'll give some leniency to the latter. Giving away things for free and allowing natural returns to generate from it is a backbone of business, especially on the Internet. However, doing it in such a way as to cleverly manipulate people into spending X amount on you in return... is manipulation. \n\nHere's the thing: humans adapt and evolve FAST, like bacteria on a petri dish. When people feel that someone is using the laws of persuasion on them, they get turned off, and they don't affiliate with you. \n\n\"Hurry now! Offer ends on x x\" may be a good banner ad, but it's not a good way to represent your entire business. You can't always be running out of time or else you seem like a manipulator. Which you are.\n\nNow here's the crux of my point: manipulators are often trying to pretend to be the talented. They feel they are not talented, so they can try to persuade people into thinking they are. \n\nSome time back I got into the Kindle marketing world. Anyone else here who's gone into that is familiar with marketers who produce sometimes 5-10 books daily, outsourced to India, which are 20 pages at most. They are littered with 30, 40 or 50 five-star reviews, also outsourced, to trick and persuade people into clicking purchase. Also, the cover designers are trained to use the statistically most click-generating fonts to further push people to buy. \n\nMany of these books get refunded immediately. Some try to leave 1 star reviews, but they are drowned out by the chorus of fake reviewers. However, enough people don't feel like bothering to find the refund button on Amazon that they earn a profit.\n\nWhen I got into publishing, I took a course by one of these arch marketers. There was a passage in this guy's program that was very popular:\n\n\"Writers don't make money. Marketers make money. Don't be a writer, be a marketer.\"\n\nThis really got people motivated. \n\nNow, I want to discuss how this spam book business model is doing. Experimentally, I have a couple of dozen books like this I put out to the Kindle jungle. \n\nThey collectively earn me maybe $5.00 a month. They're dead.\n\nNow, Amazon just changed their Kindle Unlimited program. People now get paid per page read (a very small amount, like 1/2 cent per page). What this means is that these low-quality Kindle book mills are nearly finished. You can make a living doing it, but you have to be constantly releasing NEW crap titles, every month or week, to keep treading water. Not a great job.\n\nBut marketers make money, writers don't, right? So at least these people are making SOME money, compared to real authors who are eating ramen noodles every night.\n\nWell, I have some news for you.\n\nThe highest paid people I know who are in self-publishing are authors. They are good marketers, too. But, they are WRITERS with TALENT.\n\nI know a guy who makes $20,000 a month from his mystery novels. \n\nHe doesn't brag about it, he doesn't try to use the \"laws of persuasion\" on people to keep people buying, he doesn't have to put \"HURRY! Buy now at 2.99 before the price GOES BACK UP\" on the beginning of his book's descriptions, and he has not a single YouTube commercial advertising his books.\n\nHis trick? They're good fucking books. One of them, as we speak, is being made into a movie. \n\nAnd he's not the only one. All the highest paid writers on Kindle write real things. The marketers however, are the ones full of talk and bravado, and never delivering on it.\n\nSo this experience shows, to me, the greater landscape of business as a whole, online and offline. Customers are smart, and they do not reward Internet marketing anymore. They reward talent. \n\nI've come to find i'm very good at writing fiction. I am now working on an 80,000 word fantasy adventure novel. (it's up to 40,000 words). I'll combine it with what I know about book publishing from my time in marketing, but the main point is to make it really good. \n\nYou do need to know how to market, but if you are thinking about buying some course about persuading people, or most dreadfully--you are trying to make money by telling other people how to make money, by teaching these same recycled concepts and marketing truisms--you are behind the times. Talent is rewarded as the ULTIMATE marketing tool. ","name":"t3_3bzg3m","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-03 13:51:46","week":27}

Plus I've done a few things on other sites but nothing substantial. So around $1000.\n\n\n**What I've bought:**\n\n[Kindle Fire 6](http://imgur.com/RPU2Alh) - $99 - Originally to play Hearthstone on. Ended up not playing too much Hearthstone on it but instead watching Netflix/Twitch or browsing the internet.\n   \n\n[Kindle Fire 7](http://imgur.com/ZoYWBne) - $79 - Bought this for my mother for her birthday. It's better than the one I have and it was cheaper because it had a 1 day sale. She absolutely loves it. Uses it everyday.\n\n\n[Xbox One](http://imgur.com/Gv3Fx4a) - $349 - Halo 5 coming out soon. Need I say more?\n\n[Monitor and Play and Charge kit](http://imgur.com/bteg72T) - $213 - I was playing my Xbox one on a big screen with huge response delay. It sucked for FPS's like Halo. So I got this and it's amazing. One of the best gaming monitors for consoles. Also a play and charge kit because I was tired of buying batteries.\n\n\nI've also bought little things like a Hearthstone expansion for $25, Halo: ODST for $5, expansion for BF4 $5(?), and some other random crap. I currently have $115 in online debit cards, $23 on Amazon, and $65 on InstaGC I can cash out at anytime. Waiting for the big Xbox one sale that's happening in a few days and the huge Amazon 20th anniversary sale happening on July 12th.","name":"t3_3c1zbb","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-04 02:44:11","week":27}

If not, I challenge you to make that a life priority, because whatever that age is, you’re going to need a healthy retirement savings to achieve it.\n\nIf you don’t know where you’re going, then how are you ever going to get there?\n\nI’ll tell you right now that whatever age you want it to be, it’s within reach, as long as you make the correct life choices to get there.\n\nI ask a lot of people this question, and I quite frequently get answers in the 50s, which is awesome!\n\nBut when I ask those same people how they’re going to do it, I usually hear back something to the tune of “I haven’t figured that out yet,” or “it’ll work out.”\n\nNo… it won’t. Not unless you get serious and do something about it.\n\nThis is something you have to get intentional with. It’s not going to happen on it’s own and it’s not going to happen by saving what is left over.\n\nIsn’t it interesting that there is such a difference between what people say they want, and what their behavior shows?\n\nSimply sitting back and hoping that everything will work out isn’t a plan. It’s a strategy for failure.\n\nEven if you don’t know exactly when you’re going to retire, or exactly how much money you’ll need to do it, you can still get started now until you do figure that out.\n\nOne of the most popular ways to set up a retirement plan is to enroll in your employer 401k. Personally, my 401k is by far my largest investment account on my road to becoming a millionaire as well as retiring not too long after.\n\nWe’ve talked plenty about the massive benefits of a 401k. You can check out any of the posts below for more on that.\n\n* [The Incredible Wealth Creating Power of the 401k Quadruple Threat](https://academysuccess.com/401k-quadruple-threat/)\n* [Seven Awesome Things to Do With Your Extra Money Without Blowing It](https://academysuccess.com/seven-awesome-things-extra-money-without-spending/)\n* [The Only Three Money Principles You Need to Get Rich](https://academysuccess.com/three-money-principles-need-rich/)\n\nWhat I’d like to do now is help you eliminate some of the uncertainty you might have with your 401k so you can get started without worrying that you’re going to make a mistake.\n\nOne of the top reasons people don’t invest in their 401ks is because they just don’t understand them, or they have a huge lack of organized information, so they don’t know where to start.\n\nEven if you don’t have a 401k, I encourage you to read this. Odds are, if you’re a professional, you will have a 401k at some point in your life, or something very similar. These principles can be applied to any type of retirement plan.\n\nNow.. we’re going to work on lack of organized information problem right now.\n\n**Your Top 11 401k Questions, Answered**\n\n—\n\n**1.) What is the difference between a Traditional 401k and Roth 401k?**\n\nThis is often your very first barrier to enrolling in your 401k. It can be hard to make the decision to save money for the future if you don’t know what you’re investing in.\n\nThese designations – Traditional and Roth – mean nothing more than how your money is taxed.\n\nIn a Traditional 401k, your money is taxed AFTER you take it out. In the mean time, whatever you put in reduces your tax liability in the year you invest it.\n\nSo if you make $50,000 in a given year, and you invest $5,000 in your Traditional 401k, then you will only be taxed at a gross income level of $45,000 for that year.\n\nYou’ll pay tax on that $5,000 as you take it out at retirement.\n\nWith a Roth 401k, this is exactly the opposite. You pay tax at the time you invest and you owe no taxes on that amount when you decide to take it out. This doesn’t affect your current year tax liability because it has already been taxed when you receive it.\n\nThe earnings on both types are not taxed at all, which is why a 401k is so incredibly powerful – because this allows your money to grow tax free.\n\n**So, which should you choose?**\n\nThe answer is – it depends on your tax situation.\n\nYou can get more money into a Traditional 401k and often experience higher growth levels because you’re not getting taxed as you deposit it, but it is also taxed when you withdrawal it, so you’ll have to factor that in with your tax planning in retirement.\n\nIf you would prefer more predictable taxes, a Roth 401k will allow you to avoid taxes at the time of withdrawal. Basically, you’re betting your tax rates will be higher when you are older.\n\nTwo important notes here:\n\nIf you get an employer match on your 401k at all, this is taxed like a Traditional 401k deposit, so keep that in mind with what percentage of your 401k balance that is.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that this choice isn’t set in stone. You can always swap your choice if your tax situation changes. The money you put in at a certain designation will be taxed the same, but the rest after your switch will be taxed with your new choice.\n\n**2.) How much do I need to save?**\n\nSince you don’t have a crystal ball (if you do, I would like to borrow it), this is another choice that can really hang you up. How are you supposed to know what the future will bring and how much money you need for it?\n\nIt’s a tough question.\n\nThe good news is, there is an extremely simple principle-based answer to this situation. This involves initially setting up your 401k for the maximum benefit with the smallest investment on your part.\n\nSome might call this an MED of getting started with your 401k, or minimum effective dose.\n\nMost companies that offer a 401k also offer a 401k match. This is free money that acts as an incentive to participating in the retirement plan. Many companies also use this as a massive benefit to their employees.\n\nCheck with your company on what the maximum match is and what you have to deposit to get all of it, and then set your 401k to that percentage (you’ll want to deposit more eventually, but this will help get you started easily and logically).\n\n(Pro Tip: For the next step check out my Kindle Book, [Six Figure 401k – Five Steps to Starting Your 401k Off Right](http://www.amazon.com/Six-Figure-401k-Steps-Starting-ebook/dp/B00QVX1JUA), which is free on Amazon from July 1 – July 5, 2015, and less than the price of a nice lunch after that.)\n\nThis is usually is something like “we will match 100% of the first 5% you invest” – which basically means if you invest 5% of your gross income, your company will match that for free. They’ll just deposit that exact same amount into your account.\n\nThis usually ends up being several thousand dollars per year in most cases and can add up to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands over time with the compounding effects of money growth over time.\n\nIf you don’t deposit up to that level, you are quite literally forfeiting free money.\n\nAgain, this isn’t set in stone. You can always adjust this as your financial situation changes, so don’t nitpick over this decision. Just set it up and move on.\n\nIf your company does not offer a match, then 5% is a good place to start. If you’re worried about the impact it’ll make on your finances, well, how do you think you’ll feel when you have no money to retire?\n\nI can guarantee you it’ll be a lot worse to have no money when you want to quit working than it will be to have a couple hundred bucks a month less now when you have a steady income.\n\nTrust me here. You’ll adjust. And when your 401k balance and net worth is growing at four to five figures a year, you’ll be glad you did this sooner rather than later.\n\nMy 401k makes up a full 1/3 of my current net worth, and that will only grow over time.\n\n**3.) What happens to my money when I invest it?**\n\nI hear this fear a lot. Many people think that when they invest in a 401k, their money is just gone, and they might not be able to get it back if they choose to switch jobs.\n\nThis is completely false.\n\nAny money you invest in your 401k is in a bank account in your name, and your name only. It will not be lumped into a giant government retirement pool, or some union benefit pension fund that you may nor may not see.\n\nThe only part you have to wait on is your employer matches. These often have a vesting period of six months to a couple of years, which is completely sane. This is to protect companies from financial losses and help balance their cash flow.\n\nWhen you first deposit money into your 401k, it’s usually just cash until you set up your investments. Some companies will choose default investments for you, which – unless you work for Google or Apple – you’ll likely want to change because your company has no idea what your unique financial situation is.\n\nAfter you deposit money into your 401k, you’ll then decide what to invest it in.\n\n**4.) What should I invest in?**\n\nEach time you get paid, your money is auto-deposited from your paycheck into your 401k. This money is then invested in investments that you choose.\n\nI can’t tell you exactly what to invest in, because I don’t know what your 401k looks like, but I can help to give you some guidelines.\n\nAs always, invest at your own risk.\n\n**A few simple rules here are:**\n\nIf you’re 20-30, you’re probably safe with mostly “growth” type funds. The word “growth” will usually be in the name of the fund. These usually contain shares of many established, yet aggressive companies that have a lot of room to grow. They can be more risky, but they can often pay off big.\n\nIf you’re 30-40, you still want to grow your money quite a bit, but you also want to protect yourself from market selloffs. Take caution against putting everything into growth funds and check out investments that possibly mirror a certain sector, or those that mirror established companies with very large market caps. These would often have “large cap” or “mid cap” in the name.\n\nIf you’re 40-50, you’ll want to start investing a little bit more safely. Check out bond funds to hedge against losses that you may encounter with stock driven funds. You may also want to consider target-date funds at this point, which will help you set up to retire in a certain year, and adjust risk over time for you.\n\nIf you’re 50+, your retirement is hopefully coming soon. You don’t want your money to stop growing, but you don’t want to lose it either. You may want to consider moving a large portion of your assets to investments that are protected against losses, such as bond funds and other types of fixed income funds. This will all depend on how much you have saved, and what your withdrawal rate will be. If you can afford to be 100% safe at this point, then it’s a good idea to do so.\n\n**5.) When can I get my money?**\n\nAt age 59 1/2, you can begin to access the money in your 401k without taking an early-withdrawal penalty. There is also actually a little known exception to this rule that some call the “rule of 55.”\n\nThis allows you to access your money at age 55 from your most current employer, on the year you turn 55. You cannot, however, take distributions from a previous employer 401k. It gets complex, so I won’t go too far into this, but feel free to look more into that if you’re thinking about retiring earlier than age 59 1/2.\n\n**6.) What are these penalties I keep hearing about?**\n\nIf you want to access your money before these ages, you can technically access your money from your 401k at any time.\n\nThat said, since this is a tax-protected account and you put your money there for a reason (to retire someday) you will have to either pay a small penalty (usually 10%) plus taxes (if it’s not a Roth), or you can take a loan from your 401k balance of up to $50,000, or 50% of the balance of your 401k, whichever is smaller. These loans are usually fairly low interest.\n\nI would highly advise against this however, because once you start viewing your 401k as a bank account that you can access before you retire, the wheels can easily fall off and you’ll have no retirement money left. This is just simple psychology. If you don’t want to spend it, don’t touch it.\n\nI’ve seen this happen to people before and they end up broke when they want to retire. Don’t let this happen to you.\n\n**7.) What happens if I change jobs?**\n\nThis is a great question, because it happens often, especially in today’s world. Those of the Gen Y generation are expected to change jobs every 3-5 years.\n\nThe good news is, your 401k money is yours to keep. You can do what is called a “rollover” into an IRA that you manage. In some cases, you can even roll your old 401k into a 401k at your new job. It all depends on the rules of that employer.\n\nThere may be some small fees involved in this for the transactions, but they’re usually fairly minimal.\n\nEither way, you keep the vast majority of your money, which would not be the case with a pension fund or some other type of retirement plan that forces you to stay for a certain number of years before being eligible to access it.\n\nSomething to take note of is that you might lose a little bit of the money that isn’t vested yet. The employer match dollars we talked about earlier are usually on a delayed vesting schedule. You’ll want to check on this before you make your decision.\n\n**8.) How long do I need to save to retire?**\n\nThe longer you save and invest, the more you can take advantage of compounding interest. The simple answer to this question is “get started as early as possible.”\n\nTo be safe, you usually need about 25-30 years to build up enough to retire, depending on your portfolio performance. The longer, the better.\n\nFive years of compounding interest in a 401k can be the difference between a six figure balance and a seven figure balance, quite easily.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, play around with this 401k Calculator. You’ll notice by adjusting the “Age of Retirement” cell up and down between 50 and 60, that this makes a massive difference in your ending balance.\n\nThis isn’t because of how much you save over time. It’s because of how long your money has had to multiply upon itself.\n\n**9.) Should I max out my 401k?**\n\nLike I said earlier, the more you can save towards your retirement and still maintain your needs (needs, not wants), the more I believe you should put towards your retirement. We weren’t put on this planet to work our entire lives.\n\nThat said, it may not be the best strategy to max out your 401k first.\n\nThe reason is because once you deposit money into a 401k, it cannot be accessed without penalty, at least until you’re of age.\n\nHowever, if you deposit retirement money into a Roth IRA, you can access anything you deposit without a penalty, at any time.\n\nFor this reason, a lot of people will first make sure they’re taking maximum advantage of their employer match, then completely max out a Roth IRA ($5,500 at the time of this post), then put the remainder of what they want to save in a 401k.\n\nThis allows some flexibility and liquidity with these high dollar accounts if you need it.\n\nNow, should you put the maximum amount in both?\n\nYou can currently deposit up to $17,500 in a 401k annually. This is all going to depend on your income and relative spending. If you make $40,000 a year, it’s going to be nearly half of your income to max out your 401k completely.\n\nYou may want to think about splitting your investments between your maximum employer match and a Roth IRA. This will allow you some decent flexibility until you’re making more money.\n\nHowever if you make $80,000 – $100,000+, which a number of Academy Success readers do, you can easily max out a Roth IRA and have plenty leftover to max out a Traditional 401k.\n\nIf this sounds nuts, just remember this.\n\nYour retirement savings, or any savings for that matter, shouldn’t be what you have leftover at the end of each month. It should be very intentional. You should be saving first, and spending second.\n\nWhen making big financial decisions, your savings and retirement is a non-negotiable.\n\nOtherwise, made money has a nasty way of evaporating, and you’re very likely to have nothing left over at all.\n\n**10.) Why shouldn’t I just keep all of my money for now?**\n\nYes, people actually ask this question.\n\nMy gut tells me that you probably already don’t like working every single day of your life. If you ever want to escape this life, saving for retirement is a must.\n\nLike I said earlier, no one is going to do this for you.\n\n* Social security will not fund your retirement\n* You won’t get an inheritance large enough to retire on\n* And you sure as hell aren’t going to win the lottery\n* You need a plan\n\nIf you don’t want to be a super massive stressed out ball of chaos nearing your death bed when you’re ready to hang up the work clothes, then save now, my friend.\n\nOtherwise you may end up working until the day you die – and that’s an absolute reality for some people.\n\n**11.) How much money can I actually save?**\n\nHundreds of thousands, millions, even tens of millions.\n\nThe power of compound interest with a balance as large as your 401k is amazing, and this only gets better the earlier you get started.\n\nWhile you can technically only save $17,500 (+$5,500 with an IRA), that can end up turning into seven, or even eight figures by the time you are ready to hang it up.\n\nThese images represent one person starting at age 28, and investing until age 60, and the next person starting at age 23, and investing until age 65. This is a 10 year difference.\n\nIf you’re in your early 20s right now and you’re reading this, first – that’s awesome, and second – I envy you.\n\nThis is the power of time and compound interest.\n\nWith the same investment amounts, the person who starts in their late 20s and retires at 60 makes $3.1 million, while the person who starts in their early 20s and retires at 65 would make nearly 3x more – over $10 million\n\nThis all happens with routine and repeated deposits, and the power of money growth over time.\n\nAnd the best part is, once you adjust to your 401k investing lifestyle, you won’t even miss that money. It’ll just be a part of life and you’ll be racing towards retirement.\n\n[https://academysuccess.com/your-top-11-401k-questions-answered/](https://academysuccess.com/your-top-11-401k-questions-answered/)","name":"t3_3c3xvt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-04 17:16:19","week":27}

Basically you download apps from the app store/play store and you run them for a couple seconds and then receive points for doing so. Afterwards you can delete the apps and continue to get points. A $5 gift card for Apple is 2000 points and other gift cards are 1500. I recommend downloaded offers that are 25+ points, as the lower ones just aren't worth the time. It took my 2 days to get my first gift card, and over the course of 2 weeks I got my second $5 Amazon gift card. \n\nSo yeah.

You earn points if your tip gets on the \"Hot Tips\" chart, by sharing other people's tips on Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest/Tumblr/etc., and by checking in daily. \n\nThey don't offer a slew of giftcards, but so far you can cash out for the following: Amazon, Starbucks, Old Navy, Target, iTunes, GAP, Banana Republic, Sephora, and a 2 night all expenses paid trip to Vegas. The point conversion is as follows: 1,000 points = $10. My only issue with the payouts is that they don't offer different denominations. For example, you can only get a $10 Amazon GC or Starbucks Card, $20 Old Navy, $25 Target, etc. They don't offer different denominations for each store. \n\nI'd say that this app is certainly more geared towards females (as most of the tips have to do with beauty, hair, motivational quotes, DIY - again, think very Pinterest-y type tips.) \n\nI thought it was an interesting concept, as I enjoy using Pinterest (although I don't ever create any pins of my own.) \n\n[Non-referral](http://www.trusper.com/) | [Referral](http://app.trusper.com/a/101473545086829123?channel=friend_invite&amp;data=eyJ1aWQiOjU2MDIwNTEsImMiOiJmcmllbmRfaW52aXRlIn0)","name":"t3_3c6txx","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-07-05 13:53:23","week":27}

{"id":"3c74bn","author":"[deleted]","body":"I've sold on Amazon FBA for a year, somehow, with very little bad feedback or issues. I recently got a bad feedback for a mistake I made. I have less than 100 feedback, three neutrals, and one bad feedback currently. I've had nearly 3,000 orders that had no issue, my Perfect Order score is 98.5. Most concerning, before reading the email, I saw my rating go from \"Fair\" for a few moments back to \"Good\" after reading it.\n\n I unwisely attempted to have the feedback removed, but then contacted the customer with an apology(2 emails-first had typos) and asked them what could be done to remedy their issue. \nAfter this , another older feedback reversal was changed(one about receiving a bent up box from many months ago), and I later received this email about a condition complaint about an item. \n\nI've enjoyed being an Amazon seller, but I'm not so sure I can handle the \"walking on egg shells\" feeling, or that one mistake out of thousands of transactions, can create a feeding frenzy of negative reviews or people complaining to receive free items during the summer. The \"blood in the water\" feeling, and how some customers surface when this happens, leaves me feeling alone and hopeless. \n\nHave any of you decided that FBA wasn't for you? Have you ever dealt with this phenomenon of bad feedback spiraling on Amazon FBA? How did you get through it? \nThe email is below.\n\n----\n\nHello,\nWe received a buyer complaint about the condition or description of an item they received from you.\nYour listing is still active. However, we would like you to resolve this concern in order to avoid additional\ncomplaints.\n\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nReview your listing. Make sure the item you are selling:\n1. Exactly matches the product description shown on the detail page.\n2. Is listed accurately according to our Condition Guidelines.\n\nYou can edit your listings in the Inventory section of Seller Central\n\n\nWhat happens next:\n\nPlease remember that additional complaints about your listings may result in the removal of your\nAmazon selling privileges.\n\nLearn more:\n\nSellers should understand our policies regarding product condition and descriptions. To learn more\nabout these policies, search \"Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions\", \"Product Detail Page Rules\",\nand \"Condition Guidelines\" in Seller Central Help.\n\n----\nAfter getting the email, I archived the item. The item was new, but may have been beat up during shipping. I pulled some of the items that had been unlisted for pricing errors. At this point, I'm not so sure what other steps to take. I removed the response to the bad feedback I received that promised a \"full refund\", and believe the complaint above may have had something to do with that offer. \n\nI'm aware that there are feedback services, but I am afraid of \"awaking\" a sleeping dragon, especially since I just received a negative. My feedback percentages are very low, likely under 3 percent, vs. sales.\n\nDo feedback services actually help on Amazon? And does it depend on which type of item you sell?","name":"t3_3c74bn","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-05 16:22:17","week":27}
{"id":"3c7510","author":"HandCarvedSoftware","body":"I've been experimenting with eBay, Amazon MF and Amazon FBA over the last year and have learned a lot along the way.  I've now settled for online arbitrage into FBA as my prefered business model. Through some low volume experimental trading I've established that I can make a 20%-30% pre-tax return on investment.  Much less than claimed by some of the louder \"amazing flippers who have totally changed their lives\" but still viable.\n\nTaking these numbers my goal now is to aim for a £3,000 per month turnover so as to give me a return of £600 - £900.  Of course I can't expect that I just throw £3,000 into the pot each month and expect it to bounce back with added profit.  Some of that investment may sit with Amazon for many months before sale or liquidation.\n\nSo the burning question for me right now is at this level of trading what sort of stock value might I expect to see sat with Amazon before I see that steady £3,000 per month (allowing for seasonal variation)?  I realise that a lot will depend on what I'm selling (at the moment anything and everything but basically new electrical and kitchen items plus books).  Could anyone give me a feel for this?  If I need to tip say £20,000 into stock to get this type of turnover then honestly I may not bother so great to better understand what I'm getting into here.","name":"t3_3c7510","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-05 16:30:09","week":27}

{"id":"cso7gcu","author":"coolbern","body":"Capital flows is like water. It's not possible to dam the whole Amazon.  But it is possible to channel the flow, if you're not simpleminded in approaching the issue.  Greece needs some essentials from abroad, like pharmaceuticals.  But there is a lot of discretionary spending that must be reduced to what Greece can afford (i.e., = to what it earns from exports).  It can't afford to bleed capital.  But people need to be able to spend on international goods.  Who decides on what people can buy from abroad?  \"Committee of Transactions Approval/ State General Accounting Office\" is one way.  That certainly portends disaster. But there are ways to restrict capital flow that minimize bureaucracy. After allowing foreign exchange for essentials, a market mechanism could be employed to auction the remaining foreign exchange as permits.  The income generated from such auctions could be used to support basic income for all Greeks.

Too bad its a private company still. Best bet for a public company is Apple, but with Apples size (or Amazon or Google, two other players) the amount of new revenues found in \"set top boxes\" of the future...its just table scraps to them.\n\nThe reason the cable companies wont lead the technology forward is fairly simple. They are not good at producing good IP hardware/software. They know IP delivery is going to win, but they dont care because they own the physical infrastructure as well (Time Warner, ATT, Verizon, Comcast). So the \"set top box\" advancements will most likely come from outside the cable industry. And they are. Apple, Roku, Amazon, Google. Companies that are better with hardware, software or both.\n\nAnd if you notice in the article linked above, some of the investment in Roku actually come directly from the cable industry. They know they wont win when IP becomes the standard delivery for content (still years away, but the trend is continuing to pick up momentum), so they have invested early on in promising technology.\nLastly, a trend that will likely make all of this irrelevant. People no longer have to have a single, dedicated device for TV. Content viewing is spreading out over different industries. IP based set top boxes. Phones and tablets. Smart TVs. Game consoles. Computers. Hell, soon enough even watches and glasses. So the market for set top boxes is being invaded on many sides.\n\nAll of this also has a strong impact on content as well. No longer do you have to get all your content from a single cable company. With new IP based hardware, you can pick and choose what content you buy. So content is seeing similar expansion. More companies taking a piece of the pie.\n\n","name":"t1_cson1yc","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-01 15:19:56","week":27}

Even the poorest people I know have a $700 smart phone.\n\nI don't know if it's social pressure as much as there are far more shiny pieces of crap to buy now than at any other time in history. And, credit is available to everyone. \n\nI remember going shopping with my mom when I was a kid, probably in 1968 or so. We were an upper middle class family. We had gone to a [department store] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_&amp;_Straus), where my mom had a credit card. And by that I mean she had an A&amp;S card. Afterwards we went into another store and I remember my mom wanted to buy something, but didn't have enough cash. So the only way to buy it was to go home, get the cash, and come back. And by the time we had done that she decided eh, don't need it. That's unimaginable now. \n\nToday? You see something you have to have it RIGHT NOW. Impulse purchases, be they in brick and mortar stores or on Amazon, are what people do. And there's just so much stuff people can buy, things that didn't exist, regardless of your income, back when I was a kid. Even something as simple as sneakers for kids...you went to a store, you bought a pair, you wore them till you out grew them or they were destroyed. The concept of different sneakers for different sports would have made my parents laugh like crazy. Who would spend all that money on kids? \n\n\nIn general there was a sense that shopping was not entertainment. You shopped because you needed a thing, and you went and bought that thing, and you were done. You didn't buy five things because hey Target is cheap so why not. The whole \"I'm bored I'll go shopping\" thing didn't exist. Stores were all closed on Sunday, so you hung out with family, rather than going to a mall or wander a web site looking for crap that you don't need but looks interesting. \n\n","name":"t1_csoo3m6","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-01 15:55:57","week":27}

After doing a lot of research on here, and scanning eBay sold listings I picked up some board games for £1 each and knew that I could at least make a small profit. I'm still pricing with smaller margins than I could probably get so that I can move money and build up feedback. Am pricing about 20% lower than average sold listings for BIN and setting auctions at the lowest I'd be happy to accept. Working so far.\n\nI started a brand new eBay account for flipping which is why I'm pricing to build up my ratings.\n\nAdditionally (and I think others have been discussing this here recently) I've made sure that my packaging is perfect, and with personal touches. So for the more interesting and vintage items everything is wrapped in old fashioned brown paper and tied with twine with a hand written luggage tag thank you. I had most of this around the house to start with so no initial outlay...But while sourcing I'm also picking up items for Amazon trade in, then using those vouchers by my new packing materials basically for free.\n\nGood luck with it all, I'm having so much fun with it!","name":"t1_csp4ahq","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-01 22:45:44","week":27}

{"id":"csp6ef8","author":"rbobby","body":"&gt; \"in time\" to launch my app\n\nMeh... generally the pressure to launch is self inflicted. It really is much more about execution.\n\nWall of text incoming:\n\nYou'll likely want at least one \"full stack\" engineer. This is someone who knows JavaScript/css/html for the front end and \"something\" for the back end (server side).\n\nYou may also want to contract a designer type to set the look/feel of the application and perhaps work out the UX (user experience/user interaction). Good UX folks can be difficult to find (a great one will look at your wireframes and suggest different ways for the UI to work... a good/mediocre one will just go with your wireframes and provide good \"lipstick\".... a crap one will do neither well).\n\nOne thing you need to be careful of is \"scale\". You could pay to build the application to handle a facebook/google sized audience up front. This is gonna cost a lot (and need more than 1 engineer) and be of questionable value (the bits of the application that need \"adjustment\" to handle growth may not be obvious from the start). Plus... if the application doesn't turn out to be popular then any effort here is totally lost.\n\nFurther... in regards performance don't ever forget that big hardware can hide a lot of \"flaws\". A database engine being the bottleneck can be solved by buying a much bigger server (gigs and gigs of memory, lots of and lots of cores, really fast SSDs). This has the advantage of not require major code changes to implement and not requiring the hiring of more engineers. This can also be true for the webserver side of things... a big fat modern webserver can service an amazing number of users.\n\nAvailability is another area where things can get expensive... but you might not need it to start. Sure sites like facebook and netflix never go down... but it cost them a ton of money to implement this (both in hardware and in engineers).\n\nA pretty interesting example of a high performance website with good reliability and not much in way of servers (compared to facebook/google/netflix) is StackOverflow.com. If you google around you can find a bunch of blog articles about how they did it (using Microsoft's .NET platform and good quality Dell servers).\n\nI guess the key part of the above is you need to plan for how to handle success. If your app is consumer oriented it is fair to be concerned about \"network effects\" (i.e. the app goes viral). Handling viral growth is pretty difficult... but luckily this rarely happens. If your app is business oriented then you can control the sales/marketing process to slow down/speed up customer acquisition (i.e. if you're selling too much for your app/hardware to handle then slow down on your advertising/marketing/sales until you have put additional capacity/capabilities in place).\n\nYou will also need to decide whether to base the backend of your application around cloud providers. Amazon, Azure, ElasticSearch, Google all provide some amazing \"Infrastructure as a Service\". These come with the downside of vendor lock in (i.e. you can't just move from Amazon to Google or Azure to Amazon). But they do provide a ton of features that would be difficult and expensive to build yourself. They also come with potentially ugly costs when compared with using your own servers colocated (stackoverflow can increase capacity by leasing a server and dropping it into their colo, reddit can increase capacity by \"twirling knobs\"). Hard to say which is more cost effective... but going the cloud route can be challenging if you're pressed for cash and your app doesn't directly generate income. If your revenue model is based around selling advertising then the cloud might require significantly more cash upfront. If your revenue model is based on subscriptions/plans of some sort then the cloud can be looked at as \"cost of goods sold\" which lets you adjust prices if necessary.\n\nIn conclusion... it can be complicated depending on what you're actually doing. Getting some consulting time with someone who has depth of experience in similar situations who can review in detail what you're planning on building is probably the next best step. Or not... it really depends on how complicated/big/how much revenue is expected (e.g. a minor phone app is quite a different beast from a popular webapp from a facebook/netflix/google sized app). A cofounder who knows engineering might make a ton of sense.\n\nAnd very much lastly... this is why execution is more important than ideas. All of the above is difficult to get right and takes more abilities than what a single programmer who thinks they can build something \"over the weekend\" generally has (engineering, sales, marketing, planing, management, etc). Making sure anyone you hire/contract/consult is covered by a \"work for hire\" contract is generally more than enough protection.","name":"t1_csp6ef8","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-01 23:41:32","week":27}

And we did, but in doing so, we pissed off a lot of people that had a stake in the industry and didn't like the idea of us selling product online. Long story short, some vendors that we heavily invested in left us due to no fault of our own and it took our legs out before the race even started. \n\nSo, one of the things we really do now is fine tooth and comb the industry to understand the margins, the products and the competition.

At this rate, it will take me 3-4 months before I even break even, let alone make a profit. I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong or if this is normal. I've temporarily stopped sourcing books for this reason, but if this is normal I might as well continue and just accept that it'll take 5-6 months to get a decent profit out of any shipment.\nI've read various accounts online (including one that somewhat matched mine - took 3 months to sell 25% of inventory and break even), but I'd like to hear from you folks.\n\nEarly on I was sourcing books below 3,000,000. Then I narrowed it down to 1,000,000. Now I'm even more conservative.\n\nI do not have a seller account (sale volume doesn't seem to justify it). So I can't use repricing tools. Could it be that I need to adjust my prices and would it be worth getting a seller account + repricing if it means selling quickly (or at all)?\n\nMost of my books were bought at $1-2. Early on I was buying a bit pricier - up to $4-5/book. Average shipping using the Amazon UPS is about $1.50 per book. \n\nEdit: More info based on replies:\n\nI usually don't price a book below $10. If I buy a book for $1, it gets listed for $10. With shipping and eBay fees, this usually nets me only about $1 in profit. If people are selling FBA for that item for less than $10, I don't even purchase the book. Of course, I have books in the $30-40 range, for which I paid $1-3. \n\nI usually price on the lower end of existing (used) FBA prices for the item. \n\nSince I'm not paying $40/mo, I cannot win the Buy Box. At all. My question was more along the lines of: Is it worth shelling out $40/mo when I currently have only 150 books in inventory? Will my sales really pick up enough to counter the penalty of paying $40/mo?

(Note: this isn't recommended for packages with raw meat, but for baked goods, fruit, and even cooked items, you should be fine)  Bigger is always better than forcing something into a bag - if there's not empty room around the sides of whatever you're sealing, the machine can't get all the air out, and you'll end up with freezer burn.\n* Don't buy the name-brand bags or rolls. The off-brand ones (made for the FoodSaver-style system, as long as they have a textured side, you're fine) are often better (thicker), and work just as well. You can find 11\"x50' rolls for under $10 on sale, check the links to Amazon and Ebay in the thread above. Same for bags.\n\n* I've gotten to the point where I only buy meat on sale - even Manager's clearance, and if it's a good sale, I'll buy several portions.

{"id":"cspzb02","author":"granto","body":"By negotiated rates, I mean discounts from the vendors/distributors.\n\nReal life example: We were just looking at a drop ship distributor on the West coast as part of potentially buying out a company. They were doing major drop shipping on Amazon with over 1MM in sales per year. We looked at the distributor price sheet and they had product X for $19.99 wholesale (your cost). Amazon listed product X at $21.99. After factoring in Amazon's commission, we would actually be losing money if we bought from this supplier. So we knew that this business had a negotiated discount with the drop shipper. Based on their net profit, total revenue, we could figure out shipping + marketplace fees and walk backward to their actual margins and discount.\n\nSometimes I call it product price triangulation, but if you find one product, find the cheapest, middle and most expensive price, you should usually get an idea of what the cost of goods is for that product as well as margin. Say you find a blanket online for $40, $50 and $70. That tells me the $70 is selling at 100% markup so his COGS is likely $35. The $40 guy, assuming shipping costs are about $7, is at least buying for $33. The $50 guy we know is buying for at least $35 as well and if their shipping is $7 then the net is $8. \n\nSo, assuming the $70 seller is at 50% margin, we might make the assumption a value seller is operating at 15-20% margin and a volume seller is operating at 5-10% margin and go work it backward from here. \n\n\n","name":"t1_cspzb02","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-02 18:13:01","week":27}

{"id":"csq0q9a","author":"nitris","body":"I live by myself and it's pretty much always going to be expensive if you're renting a traditional property (not self sufficient, tiny homes etc), not being able to split my internet bill is the worst. \n\nBut there are a few things you can do to minimise the cost. I don't have TV subscription but do have slightly more expensive fibre Internet (a luxury I've allowed myself as its a small difference in price, it's the mandatory £15.99 line rental that contributes to the bulk of the cost, the fibre is only a few £ extra). It still costs me about £29 a month. I scoured the Internet (moneysavingexpert especially) for the best deals and found a decent introductory deal that got me it half price for 6 months or something. I compared all of the options and found which one saved the most money in the long run. Sharing or splitting the cost of netflix or similar is a good idea, if you split the cost with just one friend I'm sure you'd barely notice the expense each month, or perhaps a friend will lend you theirs for free (unfortunately it's me who is that friend in my case). \n\nThe upside of being on your own is you are in sole control of your consumption. I can be very frugal with the gas, electric and water that I use without worrying that my housemate is undoing all my efforts by leaving their electronics on all day/night, etc. However, I'm doubtful it will ever work out cheaper than if I could split a bigger bill with someone else. It doesn't help that my flat is not very efficient, so if you have the option for a better insulated property or more energy efficient appliances that may help. I use socket strips with individual power switches so I can have 8 things plugged in (such as for my TV, ps4, record player etc) but only use the energy for what's in use that moment. \n\nAs others have said, freezing food would help massively. I don't have a freezer which results in me spending a lot extra (currently hunting for a good deal or to swap my fridge for a small fridge-freezer). \n\nI also have taken to /r/Declutter and similar subreddits and am in the process of selling or donating - ruthlessly - anything that I believe I could live happily without. \n\nI have furnished my entire flat for very very little by reclaiming free or cheap furniture/appliances from gumtree, ebay, friends, free cycle or items that people have left for free on the curb side. I also find good deals on imperfect items at local furniture stores and saved money on delivery by just carrying it home myself. \n\nI basically minimise wherever possible. Don't wash clothes if they don't really need it or have barely been worn, get the most out of one laundry load and dry outside when the weather allows it. Go easy on things like washing up liquid, detergent, soap, etc or make your own where possible. If I need to quickly just wash one or two things I will do it in one sink-full of water by hand, no need to waste energy on the washer. I time my showers to 5 minutes and keep the temperature down (IIRC it's higher temperatures that are more expensive rather than the volume of water). These small things do add up. \n\nI bike absolutely everywhere (single speed, for even more saving on maintenance and initial cost). I believe if it's less than 20km and its physically possible (ie you don't need to carry impossibly large things daily), then you should bike it. It's good for your body, the planet and your wallet. It's probably my biggest money saver. \n\nI changed my diet radically and cut out sugar entirely (both real or artificial). Although healthy, whole, food does notoriously run more expensive, if you aren't eating food that is unnecessary for the sustenance of your body (junk food and snacks etc) then you are actually saving money in that respect by not buying things that you don't actually need to survive. Not only am I at my healthiest, fittest and leanest, my grocery shop is MUCH faster and actually cheaper. I stick to the outer ring of the supermarket (all the unnecessary crap is usually in the middle) and simply buy fresh fruit and veg (if possible, some of this would be frozen), raw nuts, oats, grains/lentils/legumes, milk and coffee. I personally am vegetarian so no meat, which may or may not be cheaper - I can't say since it's just how I've always lived. I imagine it doesn't make a difference. I make my own protein/energy granola bars (some ingredients I buy bulk from Amazon) and salads (along with 2 pieces of fruit) to eat for lunch at work. \n\nI realise these are all pretty general tips, not really specific for living by yourself, but I figured it might help to simply share my lifestyle! Sorry for the long winded comment. I'll try to condense it when I'm not on mobile..!\n\n","name":"t1_csq0q9a","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-02 18:50:42","week":27}

{"id":"csq2k6e","author":"idontknow394","body":"I'm sure I am telling you nothing new by saying that your problem is one of income generation so that begs the question: What skills do you have? What are you good at? If you are not being called into work for two solid weeks you have a lot of free time. \n\nMy recommendation based on this would be to devise a strategy to make any kind of income during that free time. One option for this is freelance work online (data entry, translation, design, programming, writing are just a few areas you could look into) which, depending on your skills and experience will pay next to nothing or a passable amount. Upwork is one portal that you could use for this, Amazon's MechanicalTurk is another. You can use local libraries to complete this work. They offer free WiFi if you have your own laptop or, if you do not, you can use their computers to do your work. On this note, I would also suggest signing up for a GoogleVoice account or something similar now to enable you to give people a number to reach you at should your phone get canceled due to failure to pay the bill. Another possibility, if you have an acceptable vehicle, would be to sign up for services like Uber/Lyft and drive for them in your downtime.\n\nIf you have no meaningful skillsto apply to freelance work or a car Uber/Lyft accept currently I'd suggest dividing your time 33/33/33. Spend one third doing grunt work online (data entry, proofreading, web research) to make some money at least so you can eat, another third to figure out what you'd like to learn more about / what you are good at and then go on YouTube and other such sites to look up tutorials related to that so you can build up your skills. Use the last third of your available time to pound the pavement looking for work at a non-POS employer who will actually give you reasonable hours. \n\nAll that said, I'm sorry you are in this shitty place right now and wish you the best of luck in getting out of it.\n","name":"t1_csq2k6e","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-02 19:38:05","week":27}

You need to look at eBay\\Amazon prices, and go from there.\n\nIn your examples, I'd stay far away from trying to flip them. Let's assume that the r9 390 GPU is going for $330 on eBay (it's not). eBay and Paypal are going to take a 15% cut of the final value. That leaves you with $280.50. It's going to cost at least $5 to $10 for shipping (and when making these types of estimates, let's go for the high one, to be safe). That leaves you with $270.50. Assuming you spent 8% sales tax when you purchased the item... you're already at negative $10.\n\nThe same math for the GTX 980ti (this time not accounting for your sales tax, because it's Craigslist) leaves you at a negative $7.50.\n\nYou need to look for more profit. You're in the right mindset, but do the math before making the purchase. Look at eBay completed listings. Look at Amazon and the item's sales rank. Read the newbie guide. Read the wiki. Read the daily newbie thread (and USE it!). \n\nWith printers, I'd be worried about shipping. Some printers are worth good money. Most of the time, the ones at garage sales are not.

{"id":"csqdg2y","author":"RatLogger","body":"Sorry for the wall of text but you asked...\n\nAs I mentioned previously, this area is rife with fraud. When you are just starting out on any platform you are most vulnerable. Scammers target newbies specifically. Keeping your exposure at a minimum is usually the best course.\n\nWhen you first start selling on eBay your PayPal funds will be escrowed for up to 21 days which means you don't have access to them even if they have paid. This time frame can be reduced by shipping quickly and getting feedback from a customer. This can be tough for somebody on a tight budget. You need to have a little bit of startup capital to get past this. I have been on eBay since 2003 but when I actually started selling for real, they escrowed my funds for 21 days. Luckily, I had the cash to cover my shipping costs etc.\n\nI sort of jokingly compare the various platforms with this analogy; eBay is like Kmart or a garage sale, Amazon is like Nordstrom's. The demographics of the buyers on each platform pretty much bare this out. I might also mention that eBay is in a state of flux right now. PayPal, which used to be owned by eBay is splitting off as their own company and eBay is losing that cash cow. There are a lot of rumors floating around about how things will go but the dust has not settled and nothing is confirmed. I've reduced my inventory on eBay considerably until the other shoe drops! LOL\n\nMy preferred platform is Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) which means that you have to acquire inventory and send it in to one of the Fulfillment centers that Amazon has all of the country. From that point on, you don't have to deal with it. Amazon warehouses, picks and packs and ships your products to the buyer and then handles any customer service issues.  For this service, they take a substantial commission but it is well worth it since they also hold much higher prices than you will ever see on eBay. The benefit is that you don't have to keep inventory on-site, deal with customer communications or do any shipping to individual buyers. All that stuff is a huge demand on your time if you sell a lot of product. Amazon also has the option to do what is called Merchant Fulfilled which means you list on Amazon but you keep the products with you and ship them when they sell. I do mostly FBA but occasionally do Merchant Fulfilled as well for various reasons.\n\nThe reason why Amazon can demand better prices is that they have the program called Amazon Prime which offers free two-day shipping to Prime members. There are literally millions and millions of Prime members that pay a $100 per year membership and have no problem paying premium prices for the excellent service they get from Amazon.\n\nThere are 2 levels for selling on Amazon. One is called \"Individual\" and individual sellers fee surcharge of $1 per sale on top of the other fees that Amazon charges to sell on their platform. The other level is called \"Professional\" and that carries a $40 per month charge when does away with the $1 and per transaction surcharge.  The bottom line is that if you sell more than 40 items per month, it makes sense to go the Professional route. Also, a Professional account has access to more services and categories where they can sell products. An individual account does not have access to some of the categories that Amazon offers.\n\nAmazon also has what are called \"Gated\" or restricted categories that one must qualifiy for in order to sell in them. You must have a Pro account in order to get ungated in these categories.\n\nThe TL;DNR version is that eBay is easier to sell on but the prices often suck. Amazon is much more complex and has a lot of rules and restrictions that one must follow but the prices are awesome.\n\nWhile you can make some amazing money doing this on the side or even full-time, you have to treat it as a legitimate business or you will get killed. Both eBay and Amazon are not shy about dropping the ban hammer if you fuck up. It's THEIR game and you play by THEIR rules.","name":"t1_csqdg2y","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-03 00:20:27","week":27}

{"id":"csqo9ix","author":"brinebold","body":"First, if you don't have any credit history, don't go out and apply for your dream card, you'll just get denied for things like the Sallie Mae rewards card (5% on gas stations, groceries, and bookstores: AKA Amazon), citi double cash (1% cash back on charge, 1% more when you make payments), etc and those credit applications will hurt your credit rating, causing you to get denied for cards you might have otherwise qualified for.\n\nSecond, *don't get an American Express card* to start with. Actually, don't ever get an amex card unless you already have a backup plan for whatever you were going to use it for. Amex is the only card processor that businesses are likely to just tell you 'no, we don't want your money that badly' because they charge significantly higher processing fees to the merchants. Visa/MC are pretty much accepted anywhere. Discover is *almost* as ubiquitous in the US but not internationally. Amex, on the other hand, is only supported at just over half the merchants that take Visa.\n\n**Your first priority for a starter card is figuring out if you qualify for something without an annual fee**. Read through those offers you get and ensure they don't have an annual fee before applying. Call the number on the paperwork to ask them about an annual fee too just in case you missed it. If anyone is bothering to send you offers, you have a good enough credit score that there will be at least one with no fee and they already know your credit rating so the stuff they're sending you is almost certainly stuff you can get if you apply for it.\n\nSelect two cards you want from the offers. You want 1 card with the lowest interest rate you can find in case you run into a problem and really need to buy something that you can't pay off for a couple months (car repairs, refrigerator broke, heater broke, etc, REAL EMERGENCIES). The other card should be the best rewards program you can find. YMMV with rewards programs but I prefer cashback cards. I would stay away from travel/miles cards unless you know what you're getting into, those programs have a lot of arcane rules for redemption only truly understood by the folks at /r/churn \n\nPut your low interest card on ice (figuratively) and just don't use it. Maybe keep it in your glove box in case you forget your wallet at home. Use your rewards card frequently but treat it like checks and be certain you have enough in your account to **pay it off every month as soon as you get your statement, do not carry a balance from month to month on a rewards card**. If you ever can't pay the full statement balance on your card, stop using your cards until your next $0 statement, you'll have to pay interest on anything you charge until you get your charges are completely paid off at the end of a statement.\n\nAfter about 5 years, apply for the rewards card you really want (http://www.nerdwallet.com/rewards-credit-cards is a pretty good place to go to compare cards) because your credit rating should qualify for it by now. If you are declined, use the opportunity to request a copy of your credit score and report and see if you can find the minimum rating is so you know how far away you are.\n\nMost people here don't need this advice but: If you ever find yourself carrying a balance regularly, put your cards on ice; literally. Take a deep piece of tupperware, fill it to 1/4 with water, freeze it, then put your cards in, fill to 80% with water, cap the lid on, then store in the freezer. If it's not worth defrosting/chipping away at the ice to get at the cards, you don't need it badly enough to use credit for it.","name":"t1_csqo9ix","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-03 06:12:04","week":27}

{"id":"csqxsfq","author":"nichesiteazon","body":"Amazon affiliate here who did $4,000 last month with about 2 total hours of work - \n\nhttps://twitter.com/nichesiteazon/status/616259541353762816\n\nFirst off your site actually looks pretty decent. Much nicer than any of my sites. \n\nHere's how I would break it down for you.\n\n*Niche selection/Keyword Research*. Your niche is waaaaaay too hard. Like, I would not even consider for one second even doing research into a niche like this, let alone setting up an entire site and spending any time on it. Why? Do a Google search for your top keyword, best smartwatch. \n\nHere are some of the names on see on Page 1: Tech Radar, PC Mag, Wearable, CNet, Android Central. You will NEVER outrank these websites on Google. And if you can't rank, you can't earn. This is the #1 reason why this site won't succeed. You just picked way too hard of a niche to enter.\n\nAlso, what are some of the other keywords you are targeting? How many local monthly searches do they get per month? When you type them into Google, which sites appear on Page 1? \n\nHere's the #1 criteria I use when I decide to enter a niche: when I enter the search phrase into Google, do I see any other niche review sites on Page 1? Usually I like to see at least 2-3. If I don't see any, then it's not a niche I will enter.\n\nLastly, regarding your niche, you realize that Amazon caps your commission rate for the Electronics category at 4%, right? Never do a niche site in the Electronics category.\n\n*Content*. Your content is not that good. $5 per article will do that. The good news is, when you pick a new niche and a new site (I would cut your losses with this site, btw), you can hire a writer and get decent reviews written for $8 per 500 word. That's what I pay my main writer now, before I was paying a little more than that.\n\nHere's the thing about \"content\" for affiliate sites: they have to be decent, but they don't have to be amazing. Because for most people visiting my sites, they don't even see 80% of the content; my goal when they hit my page is for them to click over to Amazon as quickly as possible. How can you get them to do that? Easy, put a pricing/comparison table of the top 10 products above the fold on your page; your visitors will see one they like, click over to Amazon, and boom -- your job is done. And they didn't even read more than 100 words of your content.\n\n*Link building*. I notice you are trying paid ads. I've never paid for traffic to any of my niche sites, so I can't really comment on their effectiveness, but going forward (and again, this advice is for your next site, not this current one), you're going to need a decent SEO strategy. Think of it this way: in order for you to make affiliate sales, you need people to get onto your website first; and in order to get people onto your website, you need to be on the 1st page of Google (preferably in the top 3); and to get onto the 1st page of Google, your'e going to need links. \n\nGuest posting can be a smart strategy if your niche allows for it; for example, if you were reviewing microwaves, I think you'd have a hard time finding guest posting opportunities. In that case, you'd have to start thinking of either buying links, or starting up your own mini-network.\n\nBut you are so far from this point I wouldn't even worry about it right now.\n\nFocus first on being able to find a much less competitive niche. When you think you've found it, identify 5-6 main keyword.\n\nThen, literally, type those exact keywords into Google. Who is appearing on Page 1? Are they ALL authority sites with big brands? Or are these a handful of other niche review sites? \n\nThat's where you should start next.\n\nGood luck.\n","name":"t1_csqxsfq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-03 14:33:54","week":27}

General info searches to learn more = \"whats a smart watch\" or \"smart watches\"\n\n2. People sort of know what they want but they want to learn more \"smart watch reviews\" or \"best smart watches 2015\"\n\n3. Then people who know what they want and need to be persuaded to pull the trigger \"moto x review\" \"should i buy the moto x?\" \"where should I buy the moto x\"\n\nWhen you are trying to decide what keywords to use (or in the future, which new market to get into), you want to pick the area that has the most long-tail keywords possible. If there are lots of those, it's generally a good indicator that the market is viable, or will be easy to get lots of eyeballs to your site.\n\nSo let's compare marketing #1 to #3.\n\nIt will be hard to have a killer landing page for someone Googling \"smart watches\". What about smart watches? Do you want to see them? Do you want video? Do you want to buy it? It's SO vague.\n\nNow let's look at \"should I buy the moto x\" or \"where should i buy the moto x\" as a keyword. If you can get that person to a specific landing page that page can say \"As of r X/2015 the Moto X is now $100 off. It is a killer deal for a killer price that is limited quantity so you should act now. The best place you should buy it is Amazon (this will be your affiliate link). They have a fast shipping and the best reliability around\". There is a MUCH greater chance that person is going to take action because you can target the content easily around their problem statement.\n\nFor your site (or any) you have to figure out EXACTLY who your customer is and what they want.

Just a few months ago I almost purchased one for mid five figures but the deal fell through. It had thousands of visitors each day, poor conversions (which could have easily been fixed), and overall looked AMAZING. What made this site successful? Keyword research! People spend 10 minutes with this and throw up their site then spend all their time trying to rank it. If this was reversed, spending a lot of time on the research, ranking is a lot easier.\n\nWith that being said, I am going to have to disagree that you will NEVER outrank authority sites like you mentioned above. Is it a lot harder? Hell yes. Is your time better spent elsewhere? Probably. BUT, the day you do manage to outrank them, sales will flow through at an incredible rate. I outranked webMD last year, that was pretty nice.\n\nAnd finally, the content. Yes, the content is pretty garbage but that is only a small piece of the entire puzzle. I have had sites with trash content do thousands a month and sites with perfect long in depth content make me absolutely nothing. You have to understand Google is not a personal and the core of their search is an algorithm. If you focus on users who are at the end of the buying cycle, you can make nice money. As you said, with these type of sites, visitors more often than not do not even make it past the first 100-200 words. With these type of sites, who cares, you want them to land on Amazon which will do a LOT better job at converting people than you will.\n\nAnyway, my 2 cents for the day.","name":"t1_csr9m2v","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-03 21:19:23","week":27}

{"id":"css26t7","author":"AJJ18","body":"A-z claim was resolved with the buyer. Here's my second appeal letter, \n \nDear Amazon Seller Performance Team, \n \nToday I'm contacting you in regards to my suspension of  selling privileges on Amazon.com.  \n \nMy selling privileges were suspended on, June 29th, that same day I made an appeal that was very rushed and put together in a panic of my account being suspended. That appeal was denied, and in good reason. \n \nSince then I gave myself time to think and evaluate my new reconstructed selling plan and realize where I made my mistakes and further more prevent them from happening in the future.  \n  \nSome of the recent customer orders under my seller account have been sent out as defective products. This is entirely to my fault for not throughly checking the condition and functionality of the product before shipping and listing the product. One of the orders in question would be order number, 109-xxxxxxx, an HP Printer. I did not throughly check the printer and test it before listing and shipping it. I also made the faulty mistake by not fully and safely packaging it correctly. Again, everything was at my fault, and could have been very well prevented if action was taken from my part. \n  \nWe are a low scale business, so we don't have very many orders, still even with a low customer base, the customer is always the number one priority. And if that means a hit to us, then it's a hit to us. We want to make all of our customers happy, and if we aren't throughly testing out our products before sending them out and listing them, then that's an issue that's needs instant attention and resolution to.  \n \nThere's a few things that led up to our product defect rate being so high, and with orders being sent out faulty products. Given the time I've taken to review our mistakes, this is the conclusion I've come to that lead up to these issues: order and product confusion, a messy inventory, and not throughly testing products before listing them.  \n \nI've developed a plan, and have already started to implement this plan that I have developed to fix and prevent further issues like this. \n \nOur very first step was cleaning up our warehouse and inventory, we started by taking everything off our shelves and sorting them by tested and non tested, and then by category. We then took the already tested products and did a re-test and thoroughly testing and checked the product and made sure it matched its existing listing or future listing. Now we do have products listed through FBA, so our plans for FBA are to request out inventory back, and do this same process for our FBA inventory. \n \nDoing this with our inventory will help two of our issues, order defects, the product can be properly listed and the customer knows exactly what product they're expected to get, and order confusion so the packer knows exactly what product they're shipping and exactly where to find it.  \n \nOur next step of the plan would be to contact any existing customer that received a product from us that we believed has not be tested properly or we believe has received an incorrect product and resolve those issues hand on.  \n \nOr final step of the plan would to be continuing doing this for any new inventory and product we get. Wether it be a $5 charger, or a $1,000 laptop. Every single product should get to the customer the way the customer was expecting the product, or even exceed their expectations.  \n \nWe hope you take the time to even consider us on our second appeal.  \n \nWe thank the Seller Performance Team for your time and dedication to helping Amazon sellers and customers become the great place Amazon is today! Thank you! ","name":"t1_css26t7","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-04 18:42:50","week":27}
{"id":"css2aga","author":"TheKid72","body":"I buy an restore items like that. Unless you really REALLY know this type of item, sell them on eBay as \"Parts / Restoraton\". Here's the deal on each....\n\n* Sony Cassette deck - most don't work due to non-replaceable belts. If working, $20 max working perfect. \n\n* Sony EQ - typically they do work, but must be audibly tested first. Has value only if it has standard RCA connections. $30 max working perfect. \n\n* Sony Timer - likely works, but make sure it has a polarized type outlet(s)\n\n* Sony CD player - don't expect it to work reliably. Laser likely needs cleaned.  Toss it. \n\n* Fisher (Sanyo) integrated amp - most valuable item, but they need service work to make them work right. High return rate item. Use extreme caution with this item. \n\n* Mystery (Panasonic?) Stereo w/8 track... test it completely first. Toss it. \n\n* KLH speakers - actually worth more parted out. Best to sell those on Craigslist intact. \n\n* HP printer - zilch value. \n\nLook at it this way, if you sell them as untested / parts/repair, you can bring in some money on eBay. If you sell them as \"used\" and the item does not work, you will pick up defects immediately that will leave you banned from eBay for life. Definitely not worth the Amazon risk. \n\nWhen I see flipper's videos on YouTube that deal with electronics, 99.9% of the time they don't have a clue as to what they are talking about and are just asking to be banned, if they haven't been already. \n\n\n\n","name":"t1_css2aga","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-04 18:46:18","week":27}

{"id":"cssmddu","author":"Tiberia99","body":"Yes, very worth it.  I've gotten over $1000 in bonuses, plus saved almost $500 in cash back, over the past year.  I've also gotten 10 new cards, and seen my credit score drop about 50 points.  I expect it to recover over the next few months.  (It mostly dropped because I went from one card to 10 cards very quickly, which killed my \"average account age.\"  Still above 720, so I'm OK.)\n\n/r/churning is the main subreddit for these kind of questions.\n\n&gt; I spend about 30% on bills, 30% on restaurants, 10% on gas, 30% on miscellaneous retail. I rarely travel so those expenses would be lumped in with misc retail.\n\nI'm going to assume you don't want to pay annual fees.  If you don't mind the fees, or don't mind calling the card companies to downgrade\\product change to no-AF cards when the fees hit, you can get much higher bonuses ($400 for the Capital One Venture and Chase Sapphire Preferred, for example.) \n\nI see you don't spend anything on groceries.  Normally I'd recommend the [Sallie Mae mastercard](https://www.salliemae.com/credit-cards/sallie-mae-card/default.aspx), but unless most of your misc retail is on Amazon.com, I don't think it's the best for you.\n\nIf you're on the East Coast, the TD Bank Easy (Cash) Rewards card has a $200 bonus, plus 5% on gas, groceries, dining, and utilities for the first 6 months.  (1% after that.) Great card to start out with.\n\nFor the gas and dining, I recommend the [Chase AARP](https://creditcards.chase.com/aarp/cardmember) card, which gives 3% back on gas and dining.  (You don't need to be an AARP member to get the card.)  This card used to have a [$100 sign-up bonus](http://www.aarpcreditcard.com/Default), not sure if it still does. You might still be able to get the bonus if you call Chase after being approved.\n\nAlternatively, you could get the [Sams Club](http://www.magnifymoney.com/cards/cashback/sams-club-master-card/) card.  5% on gas, 3% on dining.  But it has some serious cons.  See the link for details.\n\nFor the 30% you spend on Bills, I recommend the US Bank Cash+ which offers 5% on cellphones, plus one other category.  If you use [this link](https://www.usbank.com/splash/credit-cards/cash-plus/aff/index.html?PID=1225267&amp;referral=commissionjunction) you'll get a $100 bonus.  (Note: It's a referral link, but not mine.  I found it by googling.)\n\nOr the Chase Ink Cash or Amex Simply Cash, both of which offer 5% Cash back on cellphone bills.  Catch is that they're \"Business\" cards, and are harder to get approved for.  They also have sign-up bonuses.\n\nAlternatively, you can get the [Huntington Voice](https://www.myhnbrewards.com/learnmore.aspx?source=ccrwdlm) which lets you choose to get 3% on Utilities.\n\nFor the 30% on misc retail:  If you mostly spend on Amazon, get the aforementioned Sallie Mae card.  If it's mostly department stores, the Huntington Voice (if you're not using it for bills) or US Bank Cash+.  If your spending is all over the place, a straight 2% on everything card, such as the Fidelity Amex (which has a $50 bonus) or the Citi DoubleCash, would be best.  Alternatively, if you spend less than $10,000/yr on misc, you should get the Capital One Quicksilver, which offers 1.5% on everything, but has a $100 bonus and the cash back is much easier to redeem.\n\nIf you mostly spend a few specific stores (Target, Kohls, Macy's, etc), get the store card.  They'll offer you much better discounts (ex. Target Redcard is 5% off) than a general card.\n\nFinally, get the Chase Freedom.  The 5% rotating categories usually include gas, restaurants, and Amazon\\online retail, which fits your spending profile perfectly.  It has a $100 bonus (though you may be able to get $200 if you call them and\\or wait for that promo to come again in a few months.)\n\nAll of the above cards have no annual fee.  Keep in mind that Chase has been getting much stricter, so get your Chase cards before you get any others.  And you're not likely to be approved for more than 2 Chase cards.  US Bank can also be tricky.  On the other hand, BoA and Fidelity are really easy.\n\nEDIT:  The Boa Better Balance card is only worth it if you're gonna \"game\" their system.  See my [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3aci7s/best_cash_rewards_combo/csc2rqk) for how I've set it up.\n\nIf you're interested in that sort of thing, you could also generate another $240/yr with a combination of the Fidelity Amex and the Amex Prepaid Serve card.  Check out /r/churning for details.\n\nEDIT 2: If you're interested in more than just 2 or 3 new cards, these cards have sign-up bonuses: •$100: Amex Blue Cash and BBVA Compass NBA.  Since they're Amex cards, they'll also get \"Amex Offers\" which are basically special cash-back offers and coupons.  For example, I recently got $20 off Amazon and Sams Club purchases, and $15 off a Home Depot purchase.  (The Fidelity card can also get these offers.)  The BBVA card offers 5% back on *all* purchases at select times per year, while the Blue Cash has... well, it's pretty pedestrian, but still an OK card.  You should check if you're eligible for a much higher bonus (I've seen as high as $250) [here](http://www.doctorofcredit.com/view-personalized-credit-card-offers/#American_Express).","name":"t1_cssmddu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-05 07:58:55","week":27}

Emergency Savings Fund - So few are really prepared when financial emergencies hit, car problems, medical problems, home repairs, etc. So having an emergency savings fund, that is not your normal savings account with $3000 to 5000 is a must have.\n\nBecause in life shit will happen, if your not prepared for it, your gonna screw your life up.\n\nBut here's my power tip.\n\nAutomate it.\n\nWhat I did, myself, was find a high rate online savings account, not sure how many there still are atm. I used IngDirect which was bought by CapitolOne360.\n\nAnyhow, one of the benefits of this online savings account, was the ability to automatically withdraw money from any of my other accounts every month.\n\nSo even if it's just 10 to 100 dollars each month, over time, you can easily build up an emergency savings fund.\n\n2. Automate as much bill paying as possible. This is a tricky one, for some of my bills, I send in a generic amount, and usually covers my expenses, but you can also screw yourself up, by not keeping an eye on your bills. So easy to lose control, or banks have glitches, and end up with bills not paid on time.\n\n3. Control Your Costs/Spending - Even if your rich or not rich, learning how to spend your money wisely on those things you truly value, and spending frugally on things that you don't value, can really save you a lot of money in the long haul.\n\nIf you spend so much each month, leaving yourself very little room for any problems that come up, your gonna screw yourself over.\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to be 100% frugal, but realizing you can prioritize your spending in your life.\n\nWhat things are really worth your time and money, and what things are frivolous and should be more controlling.\n\n4. Investing - Investing is like gambling, you better know what your risking, and realize you can lose what your trying to invest. So do not blindly assume that just because other people are making money by investing, that it is going to be that way with you.\n\n5. Spending your time.\n\nWe all have so many decades and years to our lives, so how are you spending your time?\n\nAre you doing what will bring value to your life and others, or waiting for miracles to save your life, that may never come?\n\nWhat's on your bucket list, or wish list of things you want to do with your life? What are you waiting for?\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_cssmzbu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-05 08:34:03","week":27}

Some people don't like listing used on Amazon because some people don't read the seller notes. Like it doesn't have the instructions. Then they get mad and want a return. Which you will have to take. \n\nDepending on which models of guitars you have they will more than likely sell before you have to worry about storage fees. They also sell faster than on eBay in my experience. Just check all the fees and see what works better for you. \n\nHere's my personal tip on GTC. Use 30 days. After 30 days you get hit with another listing fee. If an item hang sold in that time then you are reminded to reevaluate it. Does the title need tweaking or maybe price adjusted. Plus you will show up in search higher when people sort by ending soonest. Since GTC never ends they might never see you item. \n\nAs far as auctions go I use them when I am uncertain or a price point. Like if I feel it's rare or could start a bidding war. The other time is when I just want it gone. ","name":"t1_cst184b","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-05 20:52:18","week":27}

Are these, then, really not sales but something else happening that causes the rank to go up?\n\nIf you look at the used price history, it didn't drop below $96.

{"id":"3bg4d6","author":"creditcardaddict666","body":"Hi guys,\n\nMy name is CreditCardAddict666 and I am a creditaholic. This, sadly, is my story.\n\nI got my first piece of plastic at 18 and went fucking nuts with it. I canceled it after paying it down and didn't get another card until 22, a few years ago. I still have that, a Discover It, as well as a Chase Freedom, Chase IHG Rewards Card, and Chase Sapphire Preferred. My addiction isn't as bad as it used to be. I'm not overspending to the point where they're maxed out, but definitely beginning to make financial choices based on rewards and points rather than logic. I now have two cards with an annual fee that outweighs the amount of awards I'll probably get and I want to get rid of those, maintaining only my two no-fee cards for credit history's sake and leaving the Freedom in a safe at home, as it has my largest CL (7K) and reserving it for large purchases. With only the \"It\" in my wallet with its low $2.25k CL, I think I can restrain myself from going overboard on points/awards-driven spending.\n\nSo what's the best way to get rid of two annual fee cards? I was thinking about downgrading those to Slates/Amazons/other Freedoms as they hit their fee point, but that'll involve me remembering when I opened them for a year and hitting the customer service line just in time for that. I really want them out of sight, out of mind. Is it worth it to cancel if I don't plan on applying for any loans for another year or so? \n\nAdditionally, I have 3 bank accounts. I want to consolidate these to one. Most of my money is in my PNC account, though my Schwab account has the best benefits and has most of my invested assets linked to it. I'd need to call and open a savings account with them.\n\nI also have an account with the local credit union and they suck horribly, so they're definitely getting closed.\n\nAny other tips for consolidating my finances into more manageable and less tempting bits?

{"id":"3bgemr","author":"Chateau-Renaud","body":"A few weeks ago I saw /u/betapunch describing his business, [Baltimore in a Box](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2i1esf/just_launched_an_online_business_and_have_just/), and fell in love with the idea. It seemed so cool and simple and applicable to a city near me, so I decided to try it.  \n\nI have very little experience and thought this would be fun and useful practice for me, so here's how I went about doing it for my city, Rochester, New York in a way that I felt to be simple and efficient.\n\nI first took as much from /u/betapunch as I could by using some of the same wording and layouts on his site, www.baltimoreinabox.com. I saw that he used Squarespace, so I did too. It was my first time using them after I was already comfortable using Wordpress, so there was a tiny learning curve. I bought my domain name from Godaddy for one year for $1.12. If you have the Honey extension for chrome, you can usually have it insert great coupons into Godaddy's checkout page for deals like that.  \n\nSince I didn't know too much about my business, I didn't want to lock into Squarespace for a year unless it was successful, so I bought the cheapest plan on a month-to-month basis. Using a 10% coupon from Honey, I got it for $10.80, making my total $11.92.\n\nOver the course of yesterday evening and this morning, I worked on my site, www.RochesterBox.com taking as much of the good stuff that I could from Baltimore in a Box. Here's my dilemma, though: I could have walked into the local Wegmans (our big store) and searched out what was unique to our area. But I'm a college student living in LA. So, I enlisted my sister to buy for and pack any orders that I may receive as she still lives at home. As such, I only have a few items on my site and hope friends will suggest more.  \n\nSo how does this only cost $11.92 total? Well, until I receive an order, that's all it will cost me. Once I receive an order, the customer is notified that packages ship out on Mondays, giving me a few days lead time. I can use that time to buy the items in my Amazon cart (boxes, tape) and have them sent home to my sister who will then pack the boxes with items from Wegmans. \n\nWhere do I intend this to go from here? I know Rochester has somewhat of a cult following due to its unique foods and high amount of people who have moved away but still wear Rochester as their badge of honor. I intend to reach out to a few people who I think would like this product, maybe advertise on Facebook, and learn about operating an internet business.\n\nI really want to thank /u/betapunch for his contributions, as I truly could not have done it without him and his work. I also used a post I saw here a few weeks ago that details how to make a [webpage that converts fantastically](https://i.imgur.com/dItxHiC.jpg) as a basis for my website. Being able to own and operate an online business excites and motivates me. When I work on projects like me, I lose myself into them and forget to eat/sleep. \n\nI hope if anyone is thinking of starting something like this, they'll get some motivation from how easy it can be to set up. I invite your criticisms, stories of similar businesses, questions or anything relevant. I do apologize if my writing is broken or hard to understand, I know that it is one of my weaknesses. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n","name":"t3_3bgemr","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-29 02:15:01","week":27}

I leave them on Pop Quiz or TV when I need to run them passively and switch the Live when I am able to babysit. I earn anywhere from 5K to 7K a day.

They pay out every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nIn 30 days I earned 192,127 as of 8:45 AM EST. I will probably get  it over 200K by the end of today.

{"id":"3bilv7","author":"tassyguy","body":"Hi there everyone!\n\nSo I'm applying for my first credit card ever (yay becoming adult!) and I thought I'd ask y'all for your opinion on which card to get. So right now I don't really buy from too much of a variety of stores, and I only have a debit card with my bank Simple and soon Bank of America (ATM reasons and the fact they're not a digital-only bank and I need an actual checkbook). The stores I really buy from are:\n\n* Amazon.com (I have a Prime membership, buy most of my stuff there, plus my area has Prime Now)\n* Apple, or anything sold on apple.com (I work for them, plus I use their products for developing and the jobs I do plus portfolio building)\n* Adobe (Creative Cloud subscription, I use this on a daily basis)\n* Squarespace (website hosting for my portfolio)\n* Starbucks/Teavana (tea/drinks, mainly Teavana tough)\n* Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo (video games(I swear I'm not an addict) and certain Microsoft products like Windows and Visual Studio)\n* Kroger/Publix (groceries)\n* New York Times (news)\n* Some Condé Nast magazines such as Wired and Vogue\n* Delta Airlines (I live in Atlanta, Atlanta is a hub for them)\n* Etsy (for certain gifts and personal stuff)\n* Gap/Old Navy/American Eagle/ASOS (clothes)\n* Spotify/Apple Music/Netflix/Hulu/HBO Now (entertainment)\n* T-Mobile (phone bill)\n* Restaurants/movie theaters/Ticketmaster/Groupon (for social event stuff)\n* Target (there's one right by my apartment, use for certain items, sometimes groceries)\n\nThis may seem like a lot but I don't shop at all these stores every week/month. For example I only shop for clothes maybe once every 3 months most frequent, Spotify and such once a month, Delta maybe once or twice a year (although depending on how my Apple jobs changes that might change), Apple once a month for when I actually need something from their store (like an Apple Watch, I actually was required by Apple to get one for my job), Etsy only during birthdays/special events, etc. I spend a lot less than people would assume, and I save at least half of my paycheck in the bank for emergencies. I only spend weekly on groceries and gas for my car.\n\nNow with Apple I can get a Barclaycard through them for APR financing on my first Apple product I get within 30 days (helps with the amount of Apple stuff I buy, plus this card would only be used on Apple.com because of my job). I have applied for a DiscoverIT card since that is apparently a really good student card with low rates, and with Amazon they have a store card that looks tempting since I buy from them so much. I don't really care if a card extends my warranty for the items I buy (as usually my items either have a really good warranty or I need to void the warranty for development purposes), I'm more concerned about building up a good credit history and getting more points for the stuff I already buy.\n\nNow for any of you whom are concerned that I will be spending too much and going into debt (which I really do appreciate your concern, shows me y'all wanna help make sure I don't screw myself over), it's important for y'all to know my income is to the level that I can afford to have a higher credit limit (I work 2 jobs and Apple pays very generously for pay and certain benefits I can't list due to my NDA) and even as a college student I make around the lower-to-mid 5 digit income. My only real requirement for these cards if anything is they work with Apple Pay, which as of iOS 9 Discover cards will be added as compatible cards in addition to the other 3 major card providers, so almost all cards will work with it.\n\nThe only reason I really want another card on top of Discover is for places that don't take Discover (there's a lot of places near me that don't take them) or if they have a better points program for what I shop for (such as MasterCard, Visa, and maybe Amex if it doesn't have an annual fee that is ridiculously high). Both my debit cards are Visa, but I want to be in a situation where if I'm somewhere that doesn't accept Discover and my debit account is dry I won't be SOL. If any of y'all have any personal recommendations for good cards it would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nAlso sorry for making this a long post, I just want to give you guys as much info as possible so I get the best recommendation. I really do appreciate your time to answer this.","name":"t3_3bilv7","subreddit":"CRedit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qph1","created_utc":"2015-06-29 17:05:09","week":27}

{"id":"3bj1z9","author":"trpnblies7","body":"I've only ever had one credit card for the past ten years through CitiBank, which is currently the ThankYou Preferred card. I pay in full every month and I've never missed or been late on a payment. However, the rewards program just doesn't seem that good anymore because the only worthwhile options are gift cards, but there are very few I'm actually interested in. (They used to offer Amazon gift cards, but now they just have a points system on Amazon where every dollar I spend equals one point, but each point only equals about $0.80 on Amazon, which is a ripoff). So here are some things I'm wondering:\n\n1. Should I upgrade my card to a different Citi card? The only one that seems good to me is the double cash back card. I figure 2% cash back is better than the 1% in points I currently get through the ThankYou program. Obviously I would make sure that my card history and number stay the same since it's my first and only credit card account.\n2. Would I be better off no longer using my current card (keeping the account open, of course) and getting a new one with a better rewards program? If so, how would this affect my credit score since I've only ever had the one card? Last I checked, my credit is in the mid- to high-700s. If this is the better idea, anyone have some card recommendations? My card spend is usually between $600-$1,000 a month (I pretty much put everything I can on it and rarely use cash).","name":"t3_3bj1z9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-29 19:06:56","week":27}

We purchased a ledger book from the stationary store for a few dollars. Our monthly budget is on the first page, and each month we add the relevant amount to the expense which has its own page. (Power, water, groceries, entertainment, Internet/cellphone, christmas presents, car expenses). We note the deductions as we pay the bills. We also have a monthly cash allowance each, which we cover our individual personal expenses. If we impulse buy something, or need something unexpected, we put the receipt in the front of the book, and later work out which page(s) to deduct it from to stay in budget\n&gt;\n&gt; We've found our paper system works better than any app I've tried. its easy to read and manage. It suits us.\n\nI've been fortunate to continually increase my income, but I don't feel like our savings has reflected the income increases.

{"id":"3bktla","author":"TheeRhapsodist","body":"Hey everyone,\n\nFirstly, I apologize if this is the wrong place for posting and talking about affiliate sites. Using an affiliate network (Amazon) was just my choice of monetization. It fit the idea much better than others, like display ads.\n\nA bit over a year ago, I had an idea that sparked from my college friends looking for laptops and asking me for recommendations. Those conversations made me realize lots of people have no clue about the difference between components and how they affect the user experience. I slowly developed this site to clarify those differences, with hopes that someone could understand the internals of a laptop at a simple glance. I’ve seen some sites doing something with rankings, but few seem to use as much data as I have here, maybe for the sake of automation.\n\n[www.TheLaptopSearch.com](http://www.TheLaptopSearch.com)\n\nThe thing is I made the site with no real intention to profit at first.

{"id":"3bli17","author":"gypsy113","body":"Hey all, I hope this is the right subreddit for this. I have a question about pending transactions: On 6/23 I attempted to purchase a laptop on Amazon from a third party vendor through amazon marketplace. The next day, before it had even shipped, I received a note from the seller saying they had cancelled my order. (They oversold it. #classic3rdpartyvendor) However, the charge of $1,300 still appeared as pending in my bank account.  I didn't think much of it and assumed it would drop off in a day or two.\n\nAfter several days, it did not, so I contacted both Amazon and my bank to try and clear this up. I received a settlement verification code from Amazon, and I was told the bank would be able to use this code to locate the transaction, see that it had been cancelled, and take away the pending charge.\n\nAfter 4 hours on the phone, talking to 5 different employees of varying competency, I was finally told that the bank was absolutely powerless as the sum was over $1,000. They told me I just had to wait for it to post, and hopefully it would drop off, and if it didn't I could dispute it. I tried explaining that I now had a multitude of emails from amazon confirming that this order had indeed been cancelled, but they told me it was no use. I had to wait.\n\nIn the meantime, this $1,300 in my account is frozen, and my ledger reads that it's not there. They told me to wait until Wednesday 7/01 to see if anything changes, and if it hasn't to call them back.\n\nDoes this sound right? It seems odd that the bank is \"powerless\" to take away this pending charge, especially since I have multiple correspondences from Amazon saying it is cancelled. This whole situation has been incredibly aggravating, and I'm almost tempted to switch banks from all of the shitty service and mixed answers I've been given. Am I victim of shitty customer service, or just too impatient to wait 7-9 days to have access to $1,300 of my money?\n\nTL;DR: Ordered $1,300 laptop from amazon, order was cancelled, bank refuses to remove pending charge and keeps telling me to wait for it to fall off, despite having evidence of the charge being cancelled.","name":"t3_3bli17","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-06-30 06:46:14","week":27}

{"id":"3blqgl","author":"day1patch","body":"Hi everyone,\n\nI haven't seen any post here about using the Amazon partnernet here, but I believe that it is a great way to earn beer money or even substantial money. Here is how it works: Everyone can get into the program, then you create links to advertise Amazon products and whenever someone clicks on one of your links a cookie gets installed on their system for thirty days and if they buyANY products (not just the advertise product) you get a share of five percent. I myself run a forum where I have a \"support us\" link in my signature, but you can post the link on a blog, answer to forum posts with a link to a relevant product or even use YouTube. The last one is a very clever thing I saw a while ago where a guy would go to music videos by artist X, create a link to the CD on Amazon and then post comments \"if you are a real fan you should go ahead and buy Artist X\"s CD\", I thought that was pretty clever. Anyway, no matter how you do it, this can become quite profitable because you only need a few cookies spread around and get lucky enough to find someone that buys a lot on Amazon to generate decent beer money. The forum I run has a little over hundred members at the moment, but I still make around a hundred dollars every month, which hours into maintaining the forum and a connected internet page.\n\nEDIT: Here is another good idea. Get active on forums about your hobby, check if they allow links in signatures and make a \"this is my gear / setup\" link where you link to some products. Imagine doing that on a forum for hobby photographers and selling one of [these](http://www.amazon.de/Canon-SLR-Digitalkamera-Megapixel-HDR-Modus-Zoomobjektiv/dp/B008576WAW/ref=sr_1_3?s=ce-de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435650093&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=spiegelreflexkamera) (non affiliate link lol :) )","name":"t3_3blqgl","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-06-30 08:18:45","week":27}

It's like a daily Christmas. \n\nThis idea has been revolving in my head the past few days since the trend hit this subreddit within the past 2 weeks. So far we have some pretty good lists, but the sites they list are very broad and general review sites and lack things like product testing programs from individual companies.\n\nFor PC/tech oriented brands's product testing programs for example, I've already gotten a really nice multi-USB charging hub from Arctic Cooling and an excellent audio extension cable from KabelDirekt.

{"id":"3bmel7","author":"[deleted]","body":"I woke up yesterday morning to a notification saying my selling privileges have been suspended for 90 days. Obviously not the best way to wake up, shortly after burning the hell out of my eyes with my contact solution, lol. But anyways, I've only had my account for a month or so, maybe a little more, and I don't sell much, I've only had 65 orders. Well one of my customers the day before yesterday said that a printer I shipped them was defective and made loud noises, etc. there was nothing wrong with the printer but I was pretty mad because I had paid $30 to ship that thing accords country, but I just accepted the return anyways. And that's when I woke up the next morning being suspended for a high product defect rate of 5%, which again I don't sell a lot of stuff so that one order made it go that high.  \n \nWithout putting any thought at all I wrote an appeal (I know stupid of me.) and explained how I don't sell a lot and it was just one order. They emailed me back saying I need to provide them a step by step plan on how to get my defect rate lower. So here's what I said back,  \n \n&gt;My plan of action to prevent future defected products from shipping are to check each product, both new and used, thoroughly before listing. We would also need to recheck and confirm the condition of the product before we send it off to the customer.I would also make sure to have a organized inventory to avoid sending out the incorrect items to buyers.Thank you for letting me appeal again.  \n \nNot much but I figured it was a reasonable explanation and would work. Apparently not, I got another email back saying this, \n \n &gt;Hello from Amazon. \n\nWe appreciate the information you have provided. However, a review of your account indicates \n\n1. You have listed against detail pages that do not exactly match your items. \nAs stated in our policies, sellers must list the exact same item, in the same format, as the item represented on the detail page.

We will then review your plan and determine whether to reinstate your selling privileges.  \n \nWhich number 1 is new in there, and I didn't even know. And I don't even know what product it is. I'm really freaking out here because I have $600 in my account and really needed that money. I've been selling on an individual account for about 3 years and have never had issues, switch to full account and bam, issues everywhere. Can anyone please help me out here? What should I include in my appeal? does it need to be longer? Any other information I should include?

{"id":"3bntbd","author":"RaptureReed","body":"I received a performance notification from Amazon yesterday telling me that my account was under review due to concerns about a possible counterfeit item in my inventory. It was a $10 plastic popsicle mold tray that I bought from two local stores, hadn't even sold one yet. Amazon asked me to provide the name, address, phone number, and website of my “supplier”, as well as photographed copies of my relevant receipts or invoices from the last 180 days.\n\nHaving read a bunch of other sellers’ stories about being in the same situation, I knew that Amazon typically wants to see *invoices* from a distributor, not receipts from a retail store. Obviously I couldn’t provide that, so I provided what I had: the store details, a picture of my receipts, an emphatic apology, and vow to make the situation right.\n\nAfter freaking out all afternoon, I eventually accepted that I stood no chance and my best bet was to draft a well-written appeal letter once they suspended me.\n\nTo my utter surprise, I woke up today to a follow-up message from Amazon saying that after reviewing the information I provided, they determined that I could not offer these items for sale and the listings had been removed. No mention of a suspension. They just left me with a warning that “additional restrictions or complaints about your listings may result in the removal of your Amazon selling privileges.”\n\nSo what did I learn from this: \n\n1. You need to, at the very least, have a receipt for each item you sell on Amazon. Today I removed every one of my FBA items that was purchased at a thrift store or yard sale. I’m lucky that a retail store receipt was sufficient to absolve me. A thrift store receipt probably wouldn’t be so lucky, and I can only imagine that a complete lack of a receipt is a death sentence.\n\n2. A receipt from an eBay or Amazon purchase probably won’t suffice either. “I bought it from some dude online” is not a good defense.\n\n3. You can be suspended from Amazon suddenly for an honest mistake or for no good reason at all. I suggest that everyone read the stories out there of people who were making tons of money on FBA and then suddenly lost all of their business due to a suspension. Sometimes it’s because the seller unknowingly sold a counterfeit item, sometimes it’s for a mysterious reason beyond the seller’s control. This experience was a big wake-up call for me.\n\nAs far as I know, the popsicle molds I sent in were not counterfeit. My best guess as to why they were flagged by Amazon is that they have an extremely good sales rank (below #50), causing Amazon to be more cautious about counterfeits flooding in.\n\nFrom now on I’m going to be much more careful with what I send in to FBA. I’m even considering using it strictly for items that I can buy wholesale from a reputable distributor, since that seems to be what Amazon wants. This is a huge bummer since my original plan was to do the majority of my business through FBA and retail arbitrage, but that seems very risky now.

I have a gas dryer, gas water heater, and gas stove, so I'm not using electricity for those. My fridge and AC are brand new, so very efficient. In my opinion it's just worth it.

{"id":"cslyn69","author":"bomaine","body":"Like you, I have been inspired by the Baltimore case study, and have started a variation.  I haven't done a post here about it yet, but am planning to soon.  But I have been working on it for a couple months, and shipping boxes for over a month, so I have a couple suggestions/things for you to think about.\n\nYou are selling a 3-item box for $20 with free shipping.  At that price you will not make any money, given the products you are shipping.  Credit costs will take $0.58 cents from every sale.  Then there are the packaging costs.  You will have to pay for a box, tape, and since you are shipping glass you will need bubble wrap and packing filler, too.  \n\nYour soda is going to weigh 1.5 lbs, and the smallest size of the barbecue sauce I saw for sale on Amazon was 19oz, and I don't know if that includes the bottle.  With those 2 items in a box, you are over 3lbs.  Shipping can be very expensive, especially when the guy next to you in your LA dorm orders a box.    A 3+ pound box going to California can cost you over $16 in shipping.  I would suggest having your sister pack you a box of your heaviest options and shipping it to you in LA, to get a handle on the costs.\n\nWhat are your product costs?  It seems from first look your items are going to be particularly cheap.  When I search Wegman's online for a Rochester store, the barbecue sauce is $2.99.  A 3-pack of those cameras on Amazon is $25, giving you a unit cost of $8.33.  If someone orders just those 2 items and you are left with less than $9 to cover shipping, packaging, and credit costs.  You will lose money.\n\nThe only way a box business like this works is if you have fairly cheap &amp; light items that evoke an emotional appeal with your target audience.  You can grab a Kodak disposable at any WalMart in the US - no one is going to put them in a novelty box at a premium.  Food items are good if they are local and not available anywhere else.  But even then, you have to have something that will travel well.  If you put a loaf of Wegman's bread in a box and ship it for 3-4 days in a hot truck you will find that the recipient is not going to be pleased.\n\nI don't want to be a naysayer - I obviously think the model works because I am copying it.  But you have to really think out all the costs in advance, and also make sure you have items that people will actually pay to ship to someone, so that you can make some money and the recipients will be happy when the box arrives.","name":"t1_cslyn69","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-29 03:45:01","week":27}

Its mostly a slow and steady wins the race via frugality and investing strategy. \n\nPersonal finance book - I read personal finance for dummies. It wasn't perfect, but gave me some food for thought and understanding a lot of what's out there and what to think about. Not all the advice was perfect but it was good enough. Some people recommend Dave Ramsey's total money makeover but afaik that's geared more towards debt and savings related issues. \n\nThe bogleheads guide to investing - the smart way to invest. It goes over a lot of different scenarios and how to invest. Key points are tax advantages and diversity. \n\nIn terms of news to pay attention to, I would pretty much ignore the news. \n\nAccounts to open: savings, joint savings, checking, joint checking, credit card with good rewards (I use two: a 2% on everything cash back card with a 5% gas/groceries/Amazon card), 401k with matching if your employer offers it (their hr dept. will know). Otherwise just a Roth IRA at vanguard will do if they don't do employer matching. Make sure to not ignore the Ira or 401k. It is a hassle to set up and learn the absolute basics to long term investing. However compound interest is staggering. Glance at the chart on this page and see how important it is to start investing early: www.darwinsfinance.com/start-investing-today-amazing/\n\nFor taking into account SO finances. I would be conscious of them, but not completely intermingle them yet. Try to talk out long term savings goals together (vacations, household purchases). If she has high interest debt and you're pretty serious, consider just lending the money, with the idea if you break up you'll probably never get that money back. If you can't lend it directly, you can cover some of her expenses until she gets a job. That way she won't have as many loans. This kind of thing is highly dependent on just how serious you are. I was pretty sure I was going to marry my current wife, so I just lent her all the living expense money and rent until she could land a reasonable job and we got married. After we got married I just cancelled the debt. That was an \"investment\" to avoid having her (and probable future us) having to pay high interest loans and credit cards to maintain the lifestyle I wanted with a full time job while she made little to no money. \n\nPF is an extremely important life skill to enjoy a comfortable life. You can become a millionaire on a meager salary or be broke on a very high salary. I'd strongly recommend reading books, sticking to budgets, and investing as best as you can.

The big hurdle for them right now is rolling out the technology across thousands of stores and hiring the staff to deal with it. My 8 years in management taught me one thing about large retailers and that is they hate spending money on payroll. They will let the store fall apart, as long as it does not cost anymore payroll dollars. I just think 10 years from now their websites will operate a lot differently, and that is probably where they will attempt to sell some of their more expensive clearance merchandise. I also know a lot of them are looking at the LED shelf pricing that automatically updates, but it is too expensive at the moment.

{"id":"csmjv9i","author":"[deleted]","body":"The LED pricing I just mentioned, and sending all clearance items back to their warehouse would solve a lot of it. Before I quit my job, the retailer I worked with was already sending a lot of discontinued items back to the warehouse, instead of putting them on clearance. Most of those items ended up being sent to a liquidator. \nThe LED price signs would also make a huge difference. Lets say Target adopts LED price signs at all of their locations. These signs update through a wireless connection, instead of having to physically change the price with a price gun or replace a shelf label, so if they notice a certain Lego set is flying off the shelf at all their locations, all they will have to do is raise the price in the computer instead of going through the hassle of manually pricing each item. If they caught wind of people purchasing that item to resell on Amazon, they could just raise the price to match the Amazon price. I am not saying the opportunity is going to completely vanish, I just think in the years ahead the large retailers will be able to reduce the ease of retail arbitrage.

{"id":"csmm4de","author":"witoldc","body":"At its core, you are an intermediary between a traffic source and an affiliate product/service.  You can advertise on any website and sell whatever you want.  Heck, you can do a media buy in the New York Times printed edition for god knows how much money.  It's a media buy.  You're still trying to drive enough sales to make it worth it.\n\nMore practically, you can post an ad on reddit and point it to some product on Amazon.  The difference between reddit ad cost and your Amazon commission is your profit.  Your job is to find such a great product, target it so well, and create such an enticing title/byline that people click.  If you manage to be in the positive - a hard task in itself - you scale up.  There's been a few people who posted their experiences doing exactly this.  (You will have to search for these threads.)  This is a fairly easy entry point because Reddit ads are cheap and you can play around and learn fundamentals.  Some people made some money doing this.\n\nIn reality, for most people who actually go to big traffic sources like FB/Twitter/etc, they're reaching the dredges of the Internet to break even, trying to sell shady shit and hoping that their ads get approved despite being deceptive and spammy.  At least the guys I know who tried it had a hell of a time braking even on anything that didn't make them feel like the're spammers wasting their lives.  Obviously, with tons and tons of effort and many hours invested and thousands of tests and experimenting, people do make money.  Is that person going to be you?  Not if you listen to the Bullshit the OP is selling.  If you're really interested, track down the older threads of people doing this on Reddit. (A bunch made money, a bunch didn't lose much.)  It doesn't scale well, but you will get the idea and you can proceed as you please: find a place where you can buy traffic, point to some product you think that traffic is good for.  Sounds easy but it's not.","name":"t1_csmm4de","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-06-29 20:04:46","week":27}

Several months ago, as a compromise, we made the daily newbie thread. If you read every question in there, for the last few days, you'll probably have plenty to get started on. You're also welcome to post these questions there.\n\nThere is also the wiki and the newbie guide that almost nobody reads, but there's some really good info there too! \n\nAs such, I will be deleting this thread.\n\nHowever, since I'm already here, and I'm already drunk, the answers to your questions, in order:\n\n1) I don't, but you should.\n\n2) Yes, there are IRS guidelines for this readily available on the Internet. The write-off rate for 2015 is 57.5 cents per mile.\n\n3) I record my cash expenses so that I can write them off as expense. It is required to record your business expenses and to keep those records for 6 years if your business' expenses are more than 25% of your gross income (they probably will be)\n\n4) We have members that make 6 figures profit a year, we have members that make $20 a week for beer money. I make about $1,000 per month, working about 1 hour a day, skipping some days. It's a part time gig for me. If you use the search function there are mountains of threads about this exact topic. \n\n5) I'd estimate that about 10% of the active users are full-time flippers, but we haven't had any super comprehensive surveys. There are also threads about this. I work in IT, working 8am to 5pm.\n\n6) My advice would be to research like crazy, then dive right in. If you weren't able to find the answers to any of your previous questions by searching this sub or Google, I'd seriously hone up on my research skills if I were you. If you didn't try Google or the Search function, I'd start to take a serious look at whether or not you're willing to do the monotonous work involved to make flipping worth it. Tons of people come and go here because they do not have the hustle that it takes to actually make real money. The shopping is the fun part. It's treasure hunting. We all like finding some amazing. The research before, during, and after... the testing, cleaning, and photographing... the listing, answering questions, and fielding offers... the storing, packing, and shipping... the post-sale customer support, the returns, the hours on the phone with eBay and Amazon seller support, the managing of defects, and the overall maitenance of a seller account... that's all the hard stuff. The stuff that can't be boiled down to a list of 'hot tips' or 'BOLOs'. That shit is just pure hustle. \n\nIf you're not discouraged yet, you might have in you to make a few bucks doing this. I started like you started.... just flipping things here and there in my preteens and teenage years. It started as a way to buy the cool shoes by parents wouldn't buy me. Then in college is was a way to fund partying. Then after college I decided to take it more seriously and pay off my $26,000 in student loans. Just this year I bought a car, in cash, using only my eBay profits. It's do-able.

{"id":"csnif6p","author":"nerdwad","body":"Just search for \"foodsaver bags\" on eBay - there are multiple sellers.  Depends on what you want - you can get individual bags or rolls of various sizes, including some as thick as 4.5 &amp; 5 mil (see seller \"foodsealerking2011\", for example).  Standard Foodsaver bags are 3 mil, but their heavy-duty Gamesaver bags are 4 mil on the smooth side.  The nice thing about the bundle packs of pre-cut bags is that it makes freezing single-serve meats a lot easier.  For example, I'll get boneless, skinless chicken breast on sale every other week at my grocery store, then freeze the breasts individually (after trimming any leftover cartilage off).  That way I can just toss one in my sous vide setup when I get home from work &amp; have dinner ready very easily.\n\nI have a deep freezer (check Craigslist for used chest or upright models, I got mine for like fifty bucks, score!) that I store vacuum-sealed foods in.  Meats are great with sous vide &amp; allows you to buy in bulk.  Also handy for when guests come over, like if family drops by &amp; you want to make an easy dinner...you can store meats for years in vacuum-packs in the freezer.  I do the same with veggies, although I typically buy the 5-pound frozen bags at the savings club stores &amp; then use an electric food steamer (around $30 on Amazon, as easy to use as sous vide).  Or if you have a farm share (CSA), you can vac-seal your own veggies fresh, but I get better pricing &amp; consistent quality on bulk frozen purchases.  So throw the meat in the sous vide bin &amp; the veggies in the steamer, voila - dinner!\n\nOne more tip, try to find used FoodSavers (if you don't already own one), like the old white ones.

{"id":"csnmvet","author":"BeatArmy99","body":"&gt; You would hesitate to say that about any money losing enterprise, like Amazon?\n\nIt's obvious that investors are treating Uber *exactly* as they treat Amazon.  You don't have to be a genius to see it.  \n\nWhat's lost in this analogy is that for every Amazon, there are thousands of money-losing startups that just fizzle away.  From an investor's perspective examining the landscape of investible equity securities, I can tell you that the number of XOMs and GOOGs exceed the number of AMZNs by a fairly large margin.  \n\n&gt;It doesn't matter if they are losing money over whatever period of time, as long as they intend to gain satisfactory return on their investment\n\nI'm going to file this under \"obvious observations.\"  *Of course* they are pitching profitability at some point.  Your comment seems to imply that there are companies out there who are in business solely to destroy wealth, with absolutely no prospect of ever creating any, who have investors that are totally fine with it.  If I accidentally missed one of those companies, please just let me know.  \n\n&gt;Especially when it is noted that the negative income is the result of increased operational costs, not decreased revenue.\n\nI've noted this elsewhere:  I get it.  I'm a CFA charterholder and I manage a fairly large portfolio of equity and fixed income securities.  People (myself included) get that the bet here is that the rate of revenue growth outpaces the growth in expenses which - mathematically - will generally result in a profit at some point down the road.  What is clear and is not at all in dispute right now is that right now, that is not happening and - as far as we're concerned - there's no indication as to when it will.","name":"t1_csnmvet","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-06-30 17:54:19","week":27}

{"id":"csnnfrs","author":"ModernDemagogue","body":"If I were in Uber, I'd be more concerned about the regulatory blowback they're facing. Amazon didn't have nearly those kinds of hurdles, and needed to simply build out infrastructure. Google didn't become a \"thing\" until the DMCA was in place, even though it had been around for a couple years. No one wanted to risk financing it until the legal framework was in place.\n\nWithout autonomous vehicles, Uber's service is dependent upon having the most cars in an area, and this isn't really a moat which can be as easily defended under regulation as Google's Search or Facebook's Social Graph. The 30% cut they're taking now is untenable if all their doing is linking customers with drivers. They shouldn't be taking more than an Ebay, or a credit card processor really.\n\nThe big question is then, how much of Uber's data did Google get access to with their investment— that's likely the real long term value; understanding consumer behavior and being able to anticipate it, but then that torpedoes their claims for elastic pricing models.\n\nRegardless, things don't look so rosy for them right now. Once the EU starts issuing International Warrants and attempting to extradite everyone involved, I think people will start getting sadder.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a buyer of these bonds. The 8% annual yield for seven years, plus an 11.5% discount on conversion, tells me there's still significant risk premium, they're not as confident as a company raising at $50 billion should be, and they really need the money.","name":"t1_csnnfrs","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-06-30 18:09:34","week":27}

Can I create a new product page with this?  Or should I list on the current one and explain my high price?  There's eBay too but these tend to go for less there.\n\n2) Shipping - would it be OK to just cut out two big pieces of scrap cardboard and tape them together with the book in between, or is there some rule against this?

{"id":"csnvnct","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"Story time:\nI was a dumbass a bought a broken PS4 off of Amazon (for $120, for personal use, not for reselling). I know you're not supposed to sell broken stuff on Amazon, but it looked like such a great deal. It said \"Doesn't accept discs, missing hdmi, includes power cord and console only\". I figured I could definitely fix the disc drive... and I thought he meant \"missing HDMI cable\", and I have tons of those. Turns out that the entire HDMI port had been ripped from the console. Now I'm pricing out the local talent on how much this is going to cost me to get fixed. I've gotten estimates of $49 and $75 from two different basement dwelling repair people (i.e., I feel like they're not real businesses, but they have good reviews and references from the local game shop), and the only actual professional game shop in the area quote me $179. If he can't fix it, he'd only charge me $40 for his time.\n\nNow, I know I could technically return it and be fine, but I don't want to be that douchebag. I knew what I was getting into, and this is a brand new seller. I think I'm going to look into the $49 guy, and see if he can fix it. If that works, I'll still have come out on top here.\n\nMoral of the story... don't trust shitty descriptions. Stay tuned next week for a followup on whether or not I was actually able to get it fixed.","name":"t1_csnvnct","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-06-30 21:31:51","week":27}
{"id":"csnvqqi","author":"SarahFremont","body":"I would say my answer would depend on whether you're starting with funding.  These are the steps we handle for our clients, but obviously our clients are generally buying larger quantities.  For someone starting out buying a few units at a time, you probably don't have the volume to spread out the fixed costs like customs clearance, etc, and it might make more sense to work on selling small quantities on Amazon, ebay, etc and put your profits into savings for a year until you can make a volume buy from China.  The hidden steps are the ones that blow the margins when ordering small quantities from China (is China export clearance included in the price from the factory? are there pallet or chassis charges at the US port or between port and destination? has the factory done the paperwork correctly so your customs broker can complete your US customs paperwork?).

Record something new, post it on youtube, and sell it. Be a street performer, play for change.  Gig at birthday parties.  I did this myself.  \n\n* Rate and review products online.  Some companies pay for this service.\n\n* Build a webpage or mobile app.  Could be anything.  \n\n* Babysit.  You know how, you have kids.  Bonus if you have your own kids with you at the time, win-win.\n\n* Home care aide for the sick or elderly - pick your own hours if you work for a service.  \n\n* Delivery - A 60+ year old man delivered my pizza the other day.
