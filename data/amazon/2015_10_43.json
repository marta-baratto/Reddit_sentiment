{"id":"3pj9d5","author":"GoKone","body":"I am a one-man company with a series of partners that take the form of established businesses and tools as well as partners in sourcing and manufacturering. When I say WE, I mean the company and the collective work that my partners and I build to make something like this possible. But for all intents and purposes, I run the whole company myself and haven’t paid myself a single cent just yet. Absolutely all sales revenue and profits are being re-invested into everything you'll see here.\n\nYou might have read my launch story [here](http://comfortableboxers.com/blogs/blog/40048257-raising-over-142k-on-kickstarter). I’ve since made significant strides and invested heavily in the next phase for the company. To ensure survival and growth, we’ve focused on improving the company structure, developing new products, and clearing up our message to our customers. I’ve just launched a new collection on [Kickstarter](http://comfortableboxers.com/kickstarter) and we’re going big! Here’s what it took to get to this point and what we’re doing next:\n\n**LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS**\nWe received feedback the moment we delivered our first collection to our Kickstarter backers. Backers from Kickstarter will not hold back on providing feedback. This makes it the absolute perfect platform to test your product. Despite the amazing reviews, we only paid attention to those willing to provide us with negative feedback. We first solved their issue if it involved anything related to logistics, and then noted every single complaint in regards to the product. A few of the issues and feedback reported were:\n\n* Defective item received\n* Shipment took too long\n* There is no fly\n* We want more colors\n* Get rid of the tag\n\nParallel to the management of e-commerce store over at comfortableboxers.com, we immediately began work on improving the product. But also important is the work that went into organizing the company, so first let me go over a few things:\n\n**IMPROVE THE COMPANY STRUCTURE**\nWe’re all about automating. If you read the E-myth, a book I recommended on the last post, you’ll see a clear message: if you don’t organize yourself from the beginning, your company is set for an early death by indigestion. We made sure we had our information organized. We also made sure every tool we implemented talked to each other. This is called API connections, and for it to work, the same data has to be present in all SaaS platforms. We still felt we could do better, so we began work on a company restructuring:\n\n**GET RID OF THE FAT**\nWhen working on a startup, you’ll receive pitches from hundreds of small business tools promising to solve your everyday needs. Test before you dive in! Unfortunately, our initial test with our PR Agency proved that a $4,000 a month service for e-mail pitching to blogs was completely useless. We spent over $12,000 on this and regret every single penny. They’re trained to keep you renewing every month, and by the time you decide to opt out, the contract states that you have to give a 30 days notice. Big lesson here! You can do the work yourself and use tools like [PressFriendly](http://pressfriendly.com) or manually research every relevant blog and reach out to them via e-mail. Cold-pitching is hard, but when you’re passionate about your product, they’ll react. You should also get rid of any services that just don’t work. If you really want to add more functionality to your site, test, test, test!\n\n**FIND NEW TOOLS**\nWe tested out multiple tools with one goal in mind: have all our systems talk to each other automatically. After all the sales process is completed and your products are shipped, you want all of this information to hit your accounting system. Manual work, if any, involves about 30 minutes of accounting every 5 days, which involves matching bank deposits with the invoices created. I used the following tools:\n\n* [Pipemonk](http://pipemonk.com) - Shopify and Quickbooks integrator\n* [Flexport](http://flexport.com) - Freight Shipping and Logistics\n* [Receiptful](http://receiptful.com) Gorgeous receipts and upsells as well as marketing automation. [Here’s an example.](http://i.imgur.com/P7aS3MV.jpg)\n* [Intercom](http://intercom.io) The best chat program i’ve dealt with. I get notifications on my phone too. I tried a few others but I hated their interface.\n* [Riskified](http://riskified.com) - A fraudulent order insurance program!t If they don't approve an order, don't ship it.\n* [Sales Motivator](http://boldcommerce.com/bold-shopify-apps/sales-motivator/sales-motivator-shopify-app) a little banner that counts the cart quantities and motivates them to add more by offering free shipping, etc.\n* [Privy](http://privy.com) - Beautiful pop-up newsletter signups that pushes info to:\n* [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) - We all know this\n\n**AUTOMATE &amp; BUILD A LOGISTICS POWERHOUSE**\nYou can see the entire workflow [HERE.](http://i.imgur.com/RTItbqh.jpg) Everything is set-up beautifully and completely automated, except for the manual matching of invoices to bank deposits I mentioned. You’ll need some accounting expertise and an accountant at the end of the month to make sure everything is in line as well as do the reconciliation and reporting. I do this with [Fourlane.](http://fourlane.com) I’ve never met them, and that's fine because we do everything online!\n\n**RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOP YOUR PRODUCTS**\nWhile you’re doing all of this, research, research, and do more research. Based on what you have and the feedback you receive, take a look at what’s in the market. Buy your competitor’s products, try them on, see what features they have, see where they’re lacking. Don’t be afraid to plug in any feature you think might work. THERE IS NO INDUSTRY STANDARD. Innovation is all about plugging in your ideas and making them work. For instance, we had an itching problem during our fifth prototype due to a reinforced stitching method that’s standard in premium brands, so we borrowed a more fluffy stitching method reserved for premium winter clothing. You can see the explanation [here.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1184319318/ultra-comfortable-mens-underwear-at-a-fair-price/posts/1381224) No other underwear in the market is doing this! We also:\n\n* Built a horizontal fly. The innovation is in the fabric molds and the position of both flaps. The overlap of the upper and lower flap make a horizontal access point with an easy grab. So although the access comes from above, the fly itself is horizontal. This is harder to make but solves the 'maze' that is the regular fly!\n* Covered the waistband in the softest textile available with a wrap-around! Used our awesome stitching to make it work.\n* Improved fabric durability by increasing it’s weight by 20%. It’s not much given how light it already is, but the difference in durability is inmense.\n* Removed the tag (obviously an improvement)\n\nWe covered every single aspect possible. You might think there’s not much going on behind a pair of underwear, but each detail counts. We’re talking about your loved ones and the first item you put on every day!\n\n**CONTROL FOR QUALITY**\nQuality control is of upmost importance if you want your customers to have confidence in your product. They’re already taking a leap of faith with only a video and a kickstarter project page. You better follow through with a quality product! For our first run, we had about 2% defective units reported, items which we immediately replaced without a hiccup.\n\nTo control for quality for our second product run, we once-again flew to Shanghai and advised our sourcing partners to ramp up quality control time during manufacturing. We also signed a long-term agreement, essentially opening up our very own sourcing office in Asia. A big part of our research and development budget goes into shipping between the Shanghai office and Austin. We usually test about 10% of randomly picked batches to find an acceptable rate of defective units. We’ve lowered the 2% acceptable rate down to a 1% ceiling to cut down on claims. The extra expense will be worth the customer happiness in the long run! \n\n**TAKE THE LEAP**\nWe decided to launch our second collection on Kickstarter as a means of ramping up a large manufacturing order and building a large customer base. Once they receive their items, they’ll usually order more if they’re happy with them. But first, to build the Kickstarter campaign, I got the latest prototypes we worked on, had them photographed using the best model I could find, and built a video myself using Apple’s FINAL CUT PRO. I hired a teacher to teach me advanced editing on the software which totaled to about $200 worth of lessons. [The results](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1184319318/ultra-comfortable-mens-underwear-at-a-fair-price) are pretty good! Once the campaign is funded, we'll be placing the manufacturing order alongside the new products and adding a good 100% more items for sales on the website.\n\n**MARGINS MATTER**\nWatch your margins! You have to take the following into account when pricing your items:\n\n* Product Cost\n* Shipping\n* Duties\n* Warehousing\n* Packaging\n* Handling fee\n* Shipping Fee\n* Exchanges\n* Marketing budget\n* Operating expenses including all the tools mentioned\n\nYou can see why our closest competitor would charge $38 a pair (yes, we’ve leaped over Calvin Klein with a vastly superior product) as they have to cover a huge conglomerate, retail space, and celebrity budgets.\n\n**ALWAYS SMILE**\nRespond to every single e-mail. Get involved. Wish them a happy day. Use emoji! Customers love being personal. [Here’s](http://i.imgur.com/uJtcfja.jpg) an interaction I had with a customer not too long ago. Always be polite, and if they crack a joke, follow up! Just make sure they’re willing to take the joke first. But most importantly, make them feel special. There's one simple reason for this: THEY ARE SPECIAL. They are your life and best marketers out there.\n\n**CUSTOMER SERVICE**\nRemember the defective units comment above? We replaced them by requesting a picture of the defect. Customers will happily oblige! You don’t want to make them do extra work by taking a trip to the USPS store to have a defective item replaced. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT FRAUD. If it happens, it’ll have to be a very elaborate scheme. Besides, you’ll have information on every shipment you’ve sent to the customer, including order numbers, replacements, etc on the Fulfillrite dashboard. Also, when a customer is unhappy with his product, offer to send him another size for free. If he likes it, have him send over the rest and you can ship out the rest of the items once you have a tracking number. Forget about the expense. Focus on the customer!\n\n**PLAN**\nWe’re already building new complementary products, including women’s underwear and a few surprises for men. We feel that we need to open up to the other 50% of customers in the world, as well as a certain sex appeal to the brand. We believe in the message we’re selling and we can’t wait to have them online and ready to ship this March! I won’t disclose the exact products just yet ;) What I CAN say is that we’re really pushing the use of this beautiful textile called MODAL. We’re also considering opening up our very first mall kiosk in Austin to test direct retail. This would require completely new packaging and increased costs, things we’re going to have to absorb if we want to keep pricing competitive. The idea is to have people buy an item in-store and then order more online! Your own website if your very best friend. After this, re-sellers and other websites will come to you.\n\n**ANTICIPATE**\nIf we reach a certain threshold on Kickstarter, we’re already considering a new automation platform in the form of the NETSUITE ERP or CHANNEL ADVISOR. These are very expensive platforms but they’ll work with very complex logistics operations like multi-warehousing, smart order routing depending on country, multi-channel selling like Amazon &amp; Ebay, and even more automation. We’re also anticipating the hiring of the first marketing manager to handle ads creation, analytics, optimization, and social media connections. This would be my first employee ever! Because we’re diving into other products as well, we’ll need to consider rebranding.\n\n**FINAL WORDS OF ADVICE** create a wonderful product, organize yourself, automate, and always listen to your customers. Moreover, learn new software! Appreciate the aesthetics of a beautifully designed website and you’ll become your very own designer.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask! I’d be happy to answer.\n\n-Mike, Founder\n\n___________\n \n**Additions From Comments:**\n\n**Initial Investment** included a TON of mistakes. Cutting them out, though, you can get up and running with prototypes, a video, some stock for press samples, and all these platforms running together with about $10k. If you really want a quality product you'll need to fly to the factory and visit your partners. After that, there's heavy investment involved but you'll be using your Kickstarter proceeds.\n\n**My Background** is everywhere, really, and this is the beauty of it. I studied Economics at the University of Chicago, worked as sales manager for a company in Costa Rica, then Procurement &amp; Supply Chain Director at another, then SAP ERP project manager for my latest. So, I have finance, sales, sourcing, and systems integrations covered. Bear in mind, I don't know any programming but I understand the basics of how html works, what an API does, and the importance of clean information. I learned accounting along the way and design has always been my passion, although I use Apple's Keynote for most of my work, as well as Photoshop &amp; JPEGmini for final optimization. As for e-commerce, it'a watch and learn kind of process. My favorite website ever is this one: http://casper.com. Pay close attention to the message and their call to actions!\n\n**Post Kickstarter Sales** You'll have a ton of backers buying more of your product. What you want to have ready a 'Share and get $10' system which we'll have up and running by December. Apart from this, we get amazing organic traffic from Google with our key words comfortable boxers and it's variations, as well as paid advertising which we're still working on optimizing.","name":"t3_3pj9d5","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-20 21:46:09","week":43}

Today I'm the 8th or 9th largest holder. (Your relative % of network fluctuates a lot with Hyper, if for example you forget to stake one month)\n\nI think it's worth checking out at this point and not because I own some of it.\n\nI've gone back and forth with the creator and he's the Allspark as far as I can tell. He has a family and has limited his interactions with the coin lately, hiring support staff to answer questions and professionals to keep the site maintained. He seems concerned about the implications of having created \"the next bitcoin\" and can't say I blame him, people in crypto can be unkind to new ideas. Why not let the code speak for itself? That's worked before.\n\nThe \"problem\" with bitcoin that emerged years into the project was that they couldn't ship hardware to mine it fast enough. Counterintuitive regulations crept in, mining hardware manufacturers were often poorly funded or total scams, with the stupendous rise in hash rate actually serving to create a strange anti-incentive to developing any kind of competitive, safe market of trustworthy manufacturers for mining hardware.\n\nThis is why 21 stepped in and why some of the early bitcoiners lined up the cash and influence to make that a go. Hardware had to be taken to the next level.\n\nBut it will be years before 21 has anything good that consumers will want to buy in stores and on Amazon. And that's a big barrier to entry. AOL CD-ROMs used to be free, not hundreds of dollars.\n\nHyperfuture stumbled across the idea that you can reduce new miner barrier to entry to zero by using Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work - the normal wallet client also mines coins, and it doesn't fry your components the way a Proof of Work client will on a regular consumer desktop after a while continuous mining. \n\nThe idea being network effect will happen faster when there's no barrier to entry. Obsessed with network effect he or they also targeted the online gaming community, writing some nice (but crude) code to allow for micro betting on individual matches, and boosting coin use through game servers around the world paying out Hyper when people win (CounterStrike Global Offensive, Assetto Corsa, some MMos I don't care about)\n\nIt seems like the alt market has been floundering lately and it should not be that way. Hyper can take us far and based on the chart ytd, it will.\n\nray","name":"t3_3ppqjd","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","created_utc":"2015-10-22 03:31:45","week":43}

But you and I are blindsided by customers who leave us every day.\n\nAccording to [a Global Consumer Pulse Study by Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/t20150523T052453__w__/gr-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Strategy_3/Accenture-Global-Consumer-Pulse-Research-Study-2013-Key-Findings.pdf):\n\n* 90% of customers are frustrated when they are put on hold too long.\n* 91% of customers get frustrated because they have to contact a company repeatedly for the same problem\n* 89% of customers are frustrated when they have to repeat their problem over and over to multiple representatives as they move through your support chain.\n\nYikes.\n\nJust the other day, I “left” Bank of America in less than a month as a new customer. \n\nIn short, I had to verify purchases I made on Amazon for two purchases, the 2nd call taking over 25 minutes answering asinine questions like, “What’s the cross street of your previous address?” (as if there’s only one…).\n\nKeeping customers happy doesn’t seem like a “sexy” marketing strategy.\n\nIt’s hard to really measure the lifetime value of a customer. And sometimes it’s easier to believe they’ll be with us for a lifetime. \n\nThe numbers behind customer retention helped give me a better frame of reference though:\n\nAccording to the [Harvard Business School](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/1590), increasing customer retention rates by 5 percent increases profits by 25 percent to 95 percent.\n\n**So how can you help keep your customers and clients happy?**\n\nHere are some helpful guides and articles on customer retention:\n\n[**Everything You Need To Know To Boost Customer Retention**](http://wheniwork.com/blog/customer-retention/) \n\nMarketing is all about getting new eyeballs on your site, and new feet in the door, right? \n\nExcept gaining new customers is expensive.

{"id":"3psl11","author":"buddythebear","body":"I've been thinking about the explosion of subscription box services. A lot of people on this sub run their own box services so I'd love to hear your insight and why you think I'm wrong. \n\nHere are my main points:\n\n**1) The market is oversaturated with subscription box services.**\n\nThe barrier for entry into the subscription box game is pretty low. If you can build a website, do a little marketing, have some grasp of logistics and can source bulk items from Alibaba, you're set. While subscription box services can get hyper niche, there is still an insane amount of competition and at this point I can't think of many box services that don't have at least a couple direct competitors. The services that are going to win out are the ones that can scale rapidly and effectively manage the logistics of the operation. \n\nI'm really surprised Amazon hasn't stepped into the game yet—they have the logistical ability, can source almost any consumer product imaginable, and could seriously undercut every other box service. Not to mention they have an absolute treasure trove of customer data that would allow them to easily curate monthly selections for any niche. \n\n**2) It's hard to retain customers.**\n\nI imagine many subscriptions are gifts. Once their subscription is up, it's going to be difficult to convince someone to pay for something they were getting for free, especially once the novelty has worn off. The box services are typically a luxury expense—it's going to be one of the first things someone cuts out of their budget if they need to save money. So I'm hesitant of any business model that will need to keep finding new customers instead of being able to retain old ones.  \n\nI'd love if anyone who has a box service could speak about how well they retain customers. \n\n**3) Very rarely are subscription box services a good deal for customers, and they're wising up to that.**\n\nDollar Shave Club is probably an exception to this, but for the most part every single box service I've seen is a total rip off. The biggest offender I've seen is [Graze](https://www.graze.com/us), which charges $12 per box a week and contains eight sample size portions of trail mix type snacks (which judging from the ones I had aren't particularly good IMO). If you need snacks you can spend that $48 a month at a grocery store that has a bulk department and get the same exact shit and a lot more of it. \n\n**4) Box services rarely solve a problem for the customer.**\n\nFor the most part, these box services are total novelties. While the novelty factor isn't necessarily a bad thing, it can wear off. So many box services try to market themselves as something that will make an aspect of your life easier. As if I can't just go to Amazon and order exactly what I want when I need it! \n\nDollar Shave Club is also an exception to this—it solved the problem men face of having to buy an overpriced commodity on a regular basis by providing a cheap, quality alternative. \n\n\n**5) Shipping costs are highly volatile and a major factor in overhead costs.**\n\nSelf explanatory. Pulling this straight out of my ass, but I imagine shipping costs can account for as much as half of a box service's overhead costs. I know there are a lot of options out there for businesses to lock in shipping rates if they have a lot of volume, but it's still an expense that will likely become even more costly as time goes on.\n\n**What I'm not arguing:**\n\n* That there is no successful, sustainable box service. The best box services from a business model perspective are the ones that can act as a powerful marketing tool for the products in the box. Birch Box is great at this—they're not really making money from the box service itself, they're making money from the sales of full-size products on their website. \n\n* That there aren't any niches where it works well. I'm curious which services are the exceptions to what I've outlined above.\n\n* That it's a fad. I think the concept is here to stay, but it's still a bubble waiting to burst. \n\n \n","name":"t3_3psl11","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-22 18:56:22","week":43}

Our company is [Xangar](www.xangar.com) and we created and manufactured a closet organization product. It's a product for organization junkies that spaces and organizes your clothes hangers to perfection in less than 10 minutes.  \n\nWe have funding so I can do what's necessary but of course I'm trying to spend money wisely. This is the short version of my marketing plan:\n\nThe channels I'm utilizing are Facebook Page and Facebook ads, blogger connections, and Amazon. \n\n* Sell on Amazon, fulfill by Amazon\n\n* Get biggest audience possible by using Facebook page as the medium\n\n* Get Facebook audience primarily by Facebook ads \n\n* Engage with audience by focusing the page 80% on organization \"hacks\" and articles that I will post that are really targeting towards \"organization junkies.\"\n\n* Also build audience by teaming up with bloggers and conducting product giveaways and advertising (I'm already talking to about 5 big organization bloggers about doing these sorts of things)\n\n* The closer we get to launch, the more I will post to audience informing them of our launch and product details\n\n* The goal will be to obtain an audience of 8,000 people between Facebook and email list \n\n* On launch day (or 1-2 days prior to launch) we inform our audience and do our best to incentivize them to purchase (perhaps by using scarcity by saying only x available at first...) \n\n* Each member of the company (there are 5) to get 15 family/friends to order product on Amazon on the first day of launch AND review the product. This will give us a huge boost in Amazon and Amazon will promote our product. \n\n* Use Amazon 'pay per click' advertising to get more sales and reviews\n\nThis is my plan to build as much momentum as possible and sell out of our first batch as fast as possible. From this point, we will max out these channels and then start exploring new ones.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any ideas or feedback?

{"id":"3pt88b","author":"GCXmods","body":"Hey everyone,\n\nSo in case you haven't seen us mention just how bad modmail is [over](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/3mhc50/psa_scam_alert_help_us_by_reporting_shady_accounts/cvf2azr) and [*over*](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/3mhc50/psa_scam_alert_help_us_by_reporting_shady_accounts/cvg4eo9) and [**over**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/3mhc50/psa_scam_alert_help_us_by_reporting_shady_accounts/cvg5dog) and [***over***](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/3mhc50/psa_scam_alert_help_us_by_reporting_shady_accounts/cvf4o1e) and [OVER](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/3mhc50/psa_scam_alert_help_us_by_reporting_shady_accounts/cvg4ctq) and [***OVER***](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/3mhc50/psa_scam_alert_help_us_by_reporting_shady_accounts/cvhrpj8) again...well, now you have :)\n\nIt's bad. It's extremely disorganized, we can't delete old messages, there is no way to search for anything, and despite our efforts, the best way to handle it (and really, the only way to handle it) is to keep up with it. For some perspective, we were recently talking with one of the mods of /r/beermoney who said they get a few (under 10) messages a day. We get multiple dozens of messages in a day, sometimes over 100 on busy days. They have 97,000 subscribers, and GCX has 5,700. Different communities with different needs for modmail of course, but still, that shows how above average GCX is in terms of modmail :P\n\nWe're working on ways to better automate some of the policies we have in place (read: get stuff done faster/have bots handle more), but for now, catching up on the modmail is our job. We know it's essential to the how this community operates that we keep up with it (heck, with members' suggestions, we *designed* the community so that it would operate that way), and we do our best. We're catching up on older messages now, but we need some help from the community. Here's what you can do.\n\n#Announcements\n\n##Bump your original message. Don't make a new thread.\n\nGo to your reddit inbox right now and click messages. [(Or, just use this link to your personal reddit inbox.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/) See how your messages are sorted by each thread, and all have their own unique subject line, kind of like email? That's exactly how modmail works, but there are thousands of messages. reddit sorts messages by bumping up the thread with the most recent *reply* to the top, regardless of when that *thread* was started. So, you can take a conversation that was started, say, 2 months ago, reply to it, and boom, it's at the top of your messages, regardless of other conversations you have going on - and it's at the top of the other person's list too!\n\n*Do that for modmail with us.* Don't create a new thread, just reply to your old one. If you create a new thread, that new thread is what's at the top of our modmail, and it just buries your original message - the one with all of the important information - lower and lower. Go to [your sent messages (linked here, if you prefer)](https://www.reddit.com/message/sent/), and reply to the modmail message that you sent us that has all of the important information, even if you haven't heard back from us in a while.\n\n**If you have a message that we have not yet replied to (and it is not covered in the FAQ below), bump it up by simply replying to THAT message, in THAT thread.** Do not message us a new thread saying \"hey still waiting on a response from my other thread.\" Seriously, we get messages exactly like that. We don't want to leave anyone hanging, but we just have no idea what you're talking about without context. Just keep it in one thread. You'll get a faster response. You can keep bumping it as much as you want, *as long as you keep bumping the same thread*. You can literally say the word \"bump\" and nothing else - if it's all in one thread, we'll see it. If you keep making new threads, you're just burying the one that matters.\n\nWe have gone back about a month in the modmail for /r/giftcardexchange and answered or addressed as many messages as we could. If you still have an outstanding modmail message that needs a response from us, just bump it up.\n\n##GCXRep Requests\n\nNow that this post is up and we have given instructions for bumping GCX modmail messages, we will go through GCXRep Profile requests. We have been focusing on the GCX modmail instead of the GCXRep modmail because the GCX modmail deals with rule violations, scam reports, and other highly important information. Don't get us wrong, all modmail is important, but we have limited time, and GCX had to take priority. But now, we will be going through the requests. Expect yours to be handled soon, and if it isn't, **bump it up!**\n\n##Flair Requests\n\nWe have a flair system that is centralized on Google Drive sheets, which is great because, you know, screw reddit modmail, but for me personally (this is /u/bg_20, in case you couldn't tell by my signature wall of text style of mod post), I can't always access Google Drive depending on where I am. I was recently traveling for work for about a month and in my downtime I couldn't get to Google Drive from my work computer. But, now that I'm back and I can access Google Drive, I can also contribute to the rest of the mods who are going through flair requests. *We're working on them, we promise.*\n\n___\n\n#Frequently Asked Questions...that don't need to be asked in modmail\n\nWe have a section in our **[wiki for messaging the mods linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/messaging_the_mods)** about **[what not to message us about](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/messaging_the_mods#wiki_things_you_should_not_message_about)**. Just to have it up on this mod post, here is the list of questions.\n\n* Why your posts and comments keep getting removed. \n\n* Being allowed to post or comment on the sub before your account is 14 days old. \n\n* Why you were banned for having a trading alt (Rule 2) **(We get this one way too much.)**\n\n* Questions about how a site like PayPal, Amazon, or any other gift card/money transferring site works. (Not that we don't want to help, but they can help you better than we can.)\n\n___\n\n#TL;DR\n\n* Modmail sucks.\n\n* Bump your old messages. Don't create new threads for the same topic.\n\n* GCXRep requests are up next on the agenda.\n\n* GCX Flair requests will be handled soon.\n\n* Read and follow the sidebar and you won't get banned, but if you do, read the wiki for messaging the mods before you message us.\n\n* No really, modmail sucks.\n\n* We love you guys.\n\n___\n\nIf you have any questions or comments you can leave a comment here on this post, or send us a private modmail message.\n\nThanks for reading, and keep trading safely. \n\n~Your GCX Mod Team","name":"t3_3pt88b","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2015-10-22 21:29:49","week":43}

We live in and work out of a house that’s in my name.  B also owns a house which he rents out. Neither of us has any other debt besides our mortgages.

I have a 401K from an old employer that has about $25,000 in it and hasn’t been performing very well lately.  I’d like to move that somewhere where we can make contributions. We both pay into Social Security, though I didn’t while I had the govt job (hence, the pension). Neither one of us is saving for retirement right now, and we know we should be.  Combined, we have about $11,000 in savings accounts for an emergency fund.  We’d like to have $50,000 in emergency fund savings. We file our personal taxes separately.  We don’t have kids.  The company pays for our cell phones.\n\nIncome: \n\nA: $4297.77/month net\n\nB: $2718.43/month net\n\nSo we have about $7000/month to work with.  \n\nRental income: \n\nB was getting $600/month in rent. House is currently vacant b/c we just did a ton of work on it.  Looking for a renter now and expect we can get somewhere between $800-900/month for it. We shall see.\n\n\nExpenses:\n\nA mortgage: $1680/month at 3.72% with a balance of $234,499.02. Will be paid off in April 2043 if we don’t make any extra payments. 30 year mortgage. House is worth $400K.  No prepayment penalty.\n\nB mortgage: $750/month at 3.00% with a balance of $58,133.00.  15 year mortgage.  House is worth $90K. Will be paid off in May 2028 if we don’t make any extra payments. No prepayment penalty.\n\nFood: We spend about $1000/month, but that includes Costco purchases, so not all of that is food. $100/month of that is alcohol. We like to cook, and we have dinner parties often.  We order from lots of restaurants.  \n\nElectricity &amp; Gas: 250/month\n\nWater &amp; Sewer: 20/month\n\nInternet: 30/month \n\nEntertainment: 71/month (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Audible). No cable.  \n\nHealth insurance: We go through the marketplace because the group plan we could get through our company was worse than if we just got individual policies.  Not really sure what’s a better idea.  We have high deductibles, but most everything is covered.  We will need to choose new plans in the next couple months. How much should we be spending on health insurance?\n\nMy health insurance: $260/month\n\nHis health insurance $252/month\n\nTravel: We each have cars that are paid off.  2001 Honda Civic that, over the past few years, has needed about $1400 of work/maintenance a year. It’s in fine shape.  2009 Toyota Corolla.  $40/month for Honda insurance.  $100/month for the Toyota. We spend about $100/month in gas for the cars and maybe $30/month on public transportation/parking/taxis/Uber. \n\nHome &amp; Office cleaning: 150/month\n\nThat’s a total of $4633/month in regular expenses, leaving $2367.  \n\nWe spent $12,000 over the last 4 months in improvements to his rental house and property.  All paid out of pocket.  This will be deductible at tax time.\n\nWe have an extra bedroom in the house we live in that we could easily rent through AirBnB.  We would, however, need to apply for and be issued a license to do so.  That license costs $500/year.\n\nIf we lose a big client or one of us can’t work for some reason, we’d be screwed.  We’d like to guard against that.  \n\nEventually, we’d like to move out of the city we live in and either sell the house there or rent it out.  Currently, we could get about $2200/month in rent for that house.  If we move in 12 years, the other house will be paid off, and we could live there without a mortgage.  Our jobs allow us to work from anywhere.  \n\nHow and when can we retire? What changes could/should we make? How do we find out how to set up a 401K through our company? Are there better retirement savings options? What if we get married? How will that affect our financial situation?\n\nOther than that, I guess we’re just looking for any advice we can get. \n","name":"t3_3ptgad","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-22 22:23:37","week":43}

{"id":"3puxm8","author":"howardkeelporn","body":"I am a recipient of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation's Scholarship, which is a last dollar academic scholarship and also receive a living stipend determined by my college from JKCF. It is unlike many other scholarships and is the most generous in the US as they will pay up to 40k per school year for your undergraduate education. Last dollar scholarships cover cover all necessary student fees not including laundry, sorority dues, etc. as well as room and board and whatever else needs to be payed. We are not allowed to do federal work studies as it would take time away from our studies. \n\nThis fall their payment was $12,516, $2,175 of which was a living stipend for me to cover books, supplies, transportation, the occasional pizza, a blazer for an interview, really whatever we may need. At the end of this calendar year I will have $2,075 left over because I bought all my books used on Amazon and didn't keep receipts of school supplies. The IRS declares that my unused living stipend is taxable. I also work at an ice cream stand over the summer and my gross income was $1,085.70. I am claimed as a dependant on my mother's tax forms. I think I can use 1040EZ as I am unmarried. **Is any of the rest of my scholarship taxable given that it went towards student fees and room and board?** I can't find any relevant information in Publication 970.\n\nI will continue working at the stand this summer, probably earning $2k gross, as I currently do not know how to drive and therefore cannot take positions in other towns. I do not have any savings, college is 4.5hrs from home, and I live at home happily. I'm currently going home on cheap amtrak tickets costing $350 total this school year. I plan on doing internships the summers following this one, paid or unpaid as I can apply for $10k once as a college scholar for living expenses for an unpaid internship. I am a history major and would like to intern at the smithsonian, colonial Williamsburg, wherever will take me. **Is it more cost effective to stave off buying a car until after college, continue going to college via Amtrak, and applying for internships in major cities where I could get to work using public transport?**\n\nThanks in advance for your help!","name":"t3_3puxm8","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-23 04:58:15","week":43}

My girlfriend drives me to the grocery store once a week. (Yeah, she's pretty great.)\n\nI am looking to purchase a used vehicle, hopefully before January, as I will probably need one to perform research at a more remote location. I want to pay cash, but I cringe at the thought of dipping into my savings. I've looked around a bit, and I think I can get a used Camry/Civic in decent condition for $3-5K. I've never paid for my own car insurance and I have no idea how much that costs.\n\nI don't know anything about car repair/maintenance other than changing tires and checking fluid levels, but I'm more than willing to learn.\n\nMy post-tax income (from teaching undergraduate classes) is roughly $1300/mo. I have around $7k in a savings account.\n\nHere is an approximate breakdown of my spending last month:\n\n* Rent: 350\n* Grocery: 300\n* Internet/Utilities: 60\n* Savings: 120\n* Phone: 40 (no contract)\n* Restaurant: 110\n* Misc spending: 110 (mostly Amazon)\n\nGroceries, restaurants, and misc. spending all fluctuate somewhat from month to month, especially groceries. (Last month, steak went on sale at my grocery store, so I bought like $90 worth and stocked up my freezer.) My misc spending fluctuates between 100-200.\n\nI have no student loans or credit card debt. My school tuition is completely paid through my graduate program.\n\nAs stated above, I deposit $120/month into savings. If I have extra money at the end of the month, I usually deposit it into my savings account (this happens occasionally, maybe an extra $100 every other month on average.)\n\nSo, can I afford a car?

Not a guarantee.\n\nWhat would you guys suggest is the best route to take? Should I take some of the leftover money for Nov, Dec, Jan, and apply it against my CC debts? That will reduce my payments and prevent more interest from accumulating. If so, should I partially pay down some, or completely pay off one or two? If not, should I spread the extra income over the months that will have less available since I am unsure of my job and what will happen after December.

{"id":"3q79ce","author":"CleverBeast","body":"Hi /r/entrepreneur, I'm a med student trying to create an ebook business from my blogging platform. Since I recently published [The Super Student's Guide to Presentations](http://thestudentpower.com/thesuperstudentsguidetopresentations), this is a post meant to help (or at least reach out to) other budding writerpreneurs out there. It's an abridged version of the[ original post on Quora](https://exnihilo.quora.com/Writing-a-Book-as-a-Student-from-Napkin-Scribbles-to-Amazon).\n\n# Writing? Shouldn't you be studying instead?\n\nWell, you could replace \"writing\" by X, because those words are frequently heard by all medical students. The difficulty of the academic challenges posed to us makes it a bit unrealistic to develop any other projects outside of our main occupation.\n\nUnrealistic? That's my cue. **I'll write an eBook and publish it someday.**\n\nThat was what crossed my mind about a year ago, in the Autumn of 2014. I had already started to experiment with blogging on my website The Student Power, so my author platform was partially built.\n\nThe original idea was to start a line of books (hopefully I'd write several) that would help students develop important skills which are not well-developed in school or college. **Public speaking and Presentations seemed like the obvious choice:** (1) I love the topics, (2) I started as a terrible presenter and worked my way up, (3) I have considerable experience for my age (tutored younger students for competitions), (4) I was awarded several times in science fairs, business competitions and conferences. [This was my stand at the Intel ISEF in 2014.](http://i.imgur.com/CosdZYg.jpg)\n\n# Let's Scribble Those Napkins\n\nActually, I keep an \"idea\" notebook where I scribble my ideas and prototypes for stuff that I'd like to create one day. [Napkins are too unreliable and notebooks are slightly more elegant.](http://i.imgur.com/LbY50V1.jpg)\n\nIn terms of structure, I considered defining one concrete topic for a presentation and documenting the whole process - that would be the book. That would be the 100% practical approach, but would probably leave out a lot of content too. I decided against it. Eventually, I would cover the process instead - from idea to the final product. Better yet, from idea to applause (has a ring to it, doesn't it?).\n\nIn the very beginning, my plans looked like this:\n\n* **3 main phases of the project:** Writing &amp; Editing, Editorial Design, Publishing &amp; Marketing\n* **Timing:** manuscript done by March 2015, cover and interior design done by May 2015, publish in June 2015 (just before exam period)\n* **Outline:** Overview -&gt; Planning -&gt; Research &amp; Resources -&gt; Content Creation -&gt; Rehearsal &amp; Fine-Tuning -&gt; Speaking\n\nEverything went pretty much according to plan, except Timing. I completely misjudged how much time and work this project would take, but more on that later.\n\n# Putting it down on 0s and 1s (and then paper)\n\nWriting has always been something I've enjoyed. I never wrote fiction, so perhaps that's the reason why I seldom get writer's block. I outline exactly what I want to say and just type way until I'm happy with it. Even if it sucks, I'll have time to edit later.\n\nInitially, I aimed to get about 30,000 words (after editing). I reached that goal after adding the Case Studies at the end of the book. It's perfect - **long enough to be a considered a book, yet not burdensome to the reader.**\n\n**Scrivener was my typewriter of choice,** Word has nothing on it. It's one of those products you can see was designed having specific people in mind - authors. Without a doubt, my favorite feature were the Project Goals; Scrivener allows you to set word number goals for your document and for each writing session. It kept me motivated and productive.\n\nI quickly realized that it's not easy to write technical non-fiction when you have classes, internships, gym, friends and family going on (all at the same time). It's not just the writing, you have to find the time to:\n\n1. Plan what you're going to write: outline each chapter, find your voice, keep it consistent page after page\n1. Research content and facts: get examples from past presentations, search stuff on Google, read some On Writing Well or Elements of Style for inspiration\n1. Actually do the writing: get hundreds or thousands of words on the screen telling the reader the message you're conveying\n1. Solve small problems like grammar or spelling mistakes [bigger problems like wrong facts, structural inconsistencies and others will be edited later on]\n\nSo how did I do it? It's all about the **double Ds: Discipline and Diligence**. I set out to write 500-1000 words everyday no matter what. If I kept that rhythm, I'd be done in 30-60 days, which is pretty good. I wrote on Quora about this technique before, I call it Daily Quota (a small, attainable goal that you work on every day, piling up into something bigger).\n\nI only failed about two or three times and it happened because I got floored with work at the hospital or at home. The day after, I always tried to compensate by working overtime (2000 words, instead of just 1000).\n\nOverall, this strategy worked well and **I got the manuscript done in about 2,5 months.** In March 2015, I was ready to edit the whole thing. [I preferred to print the manuscript and do it the old-fashioned way.](http://i.imgur.com/4ZdRW34.jpg)\n\n**Editing is as awesome as it is essential for the quality of the final product.** It's the difference between chicken shit and chicken soup. When the manuscript is done, it's a bit overwhelming to think that work has just begun. It's worth it, though.\n\nWith most of the writing complete, it was time to move to the fun (but hard) part, editorial design.\n\n# We'll Fix It in Post\n\nOne of the main \"selling points\" of the book, something that could make it stand out from the crowd, were the attractive visuals I had in mind. Walls of text weren't good enough for the message I was conveying, I needed to prove that you can and you should communicate visually.\n\nDesigning the book was the phase that permitted simple diagrams like the one jotted on my notebook to become finished material for the book. [The layout looks something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/FiagV1f.jpg)\n\nOf course, [I used Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign](http://i.imgur.com/xf9ZQKv.jpg) (all CS6) to put everything together. Big shout out to Adobe for making the incredible software that they do. [no, I wasn't bribed to write this]\n\nThe design part of the project caught me off guard. In the past, I've done some image editing for my blog and even created an infographic - that all takes a bit of time, but nothing out of the ordinary. My original plans, however, were completed shattered: I took almost 5 months to get everything done (as opposed to the 2 months I had envisioned).\n\n# Now Let's Get It Out There\n\nGoing from those guys who say \"Yeah, I'm writing a book on... \" to being one of those gentlemen who say \"Yes, I wrote a book on... \" is incredibly satisfying. [I joined the latter in late September 2015.](http://i.imgur.com/JRXfJ9s.jpg) Immediately after getting my PDF exported, I:\n\n* Ran out of my room\n* Went down the stairs of my building\n* Got outside\n* Found the Valkyries waiting for me on top of their steeds\n* Followed them to the skies in search of the mythical kingdom of Asgard\n\nIn all seriousness though, I worked even harder to get it (self-published). I built a landing page and also published it on Amazon Kindle and I intend to get it ready for CreateSpace too.\n\n# Lessons Learned\n\n* **Writing books is fun.** I loved the whole experience. Books are special objects. There is a Jewish proverb that goes like \"If you drop a jar of gold and a few books, pick up the books first.\" Being the author of a book and seeing it gaining shape before your eyes is awesome.\n* **I takes a lot of time.** Yes, more than you're expecting. That's not a reason to give up, though. My advice is to plan conservatively, expect to spend months or years writing your next bestseller.\n* **Ask for feedback along the way.** I believe that becoming a hermit just to write your book is a mistake. Write the first chapter, send it to trusted advisers and ask them what they think.\n* **Editing is essential.** Keep that red pen in arms reach, you'll need it. We can't expect to get things right at the first try. There are always sentences to be shortened and redundancies to be eliminated.\n* **Don't listen to the naysayers.** People will tell you that it's impossible, whether you're medical student or not. It's definitely possible, you just have to keep at it, day after day.\n\nThe last lesson is that writing is addictive. There's still a lot of work to do as far as marketing is concerned, yet I'm already thinking about the topic of the sequel. See you then (hopefully)!","name":"t3_3q79ce","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-25 23:09:15","week":43}

{"id":"cw4q5jl","author":"jparod","body":"In the fall of 2013 I had just returned from living overseas - and had noticed dozens of products that I thought I could sell for a lot more in the states. None of them actually turned out to be good products, but it got me interested in importing and I started reading up on it. I spent hours flipping through eBay/Amazon listings looking for something to sell, when I was supposed to be looking for a job. We were pretty cash strapped at the time (recent grads, living at my parents' house) so it took a little work even convincing my girlfriend to let me spend $100 on our first product - a kind of string. I imagined the business one day supporting us, but at the beginning my goal was just to pay my gf's student loan payments (roughly $5/day).\n\nI think I made $40 in profit off the first samples. Then used that money to buy some more. I invested 100% of our profits for the next 6 months. The business was kind of up and down at first. Started in September and after a few failed products, didn't find a good second product until April. I once got it up to about $30/day in January but that fell off. Hit my big break in June that year when I invested $750 (most of our profit at that time) in a new product. Ended up turning that into about $2000 over the next couple of weeks. That really was a turning point because it convinced my girlfriend to get on board (after she got over being mad at me for spending all that money without telling here. whoops.) Over the next few months we found a couple new products, but nothing great. However, with my gf's marketing skills (that she taught herself) we were able to increase profits in Fall 2014 and started making more than I was at my (admittedly low paying) job. I negotiated a deal with my boss where I got paid the same for four days, instead of five, to have some time to work on the business. Over the winter, we would work 9-5 at our real jobs, come home and work a few more hours on the business. It started paying off when we found a new niche and rose to the top in an existing one. Had a really good spring and quit our jobs in June. We have about 50 SKU's at this point, mostly in two niches. We also sell through our own ecommerce store. All of our operations are online at this point.\n\nIt's an up and down business, and it's hard keeping everything in inventory without ordering too much. Right now it supports us but we're trying to build it into an even bigger asset over the next year. No idea where we're headed but we've had a lot more success in the last couple of months finding new products and private labeling others. We've kind of taken pride in this being a bootstrapped business. After our initial investment, I think we only invested another $1000 of our own savings a year down the road when we had a lot in inventory and needed to keep one of our big products in stock. It's definitely possible (and safer) to start with almost nothing and scale it up. Takes time (And it gets really old waiting on suppliers), but if you stick with it and look at enough potential products, without throwing away too much on a bad investment, you'll eventually find something good.","name":"t1_cw4q5jl","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-19 04:25:13","week":43}

UPS often requires a signature and despite having UPS My Choice, they won't release them with an authorized release on my shipments.

Or the shipments go to the Shipping Center (for no reason that anyone at UPS can explain to me) that's 40 minutes away from me in another city and in that case, I usually wait there for an hour or more while a \"runner\" gets the package from one warehouse to the customer service desk. Even if I ship to my office, which is a secure building, they won't show up until after 6. USPS will deliver to my office during business hours. As someone who frequently makes purchases on Amazon, it's always a hassle for me to have UPS ship my packages. Obviously, this isn't the case everywhere.

They evaluate products and can tell which outdoor paint will last longest, for example, and it may not be the expensive one. \n\nI never buy a new car and would not buy a used car without using CR to inform me with their systematic evaluation when the car was new, user satisfaction and repair record for each brand/year. Look at their charts for cars and you can easily tell which years to avoid and which years were bad ones (also telling you *why* it was a bad year). \n\nCR did a 10 years later re-test of a Prius with 200,000 miles and found the battery and drive system only slightly less efficient than when it was new! OK, just one car, but still.... It is not easy to find a late model used Prius, because people love them, hold on to them, and the Prius does not lose value - so you may as well buy a new one! Isn't that interesting?\n\nI do not like to have sales people or marketing departments take advantage of me. CR is an antidote to ignorance. People who say that it is useless may not be making any purchases worth investigating, but if you want quality and don't want to waste money, I say, get CR. I keep the past issues for the year, and make mental notes of what I may need to buy in the future. I do also look at Amazon ratings, but I carefully read each rating to see if they know what they are talking about and understand how to rate. \n\nThe only item that I take with a grain of salt in CR is computers, because they do not distinguish among operating systems and lump all computers into the same framework, which does not work for me. It oversimplifies issues and makes comparisons of apples to oranges, so to speak.\n\nThey library may work if no back issues are missing.

I chose the option to pick up from the store so I could have it same day.  Received an email about 20 minutes later saying the item was ready for pick up.

I wait in line for about 10 minutes, and finally present the receipt to one of the cashier's.  She looked confused, and had no clue what it was.  She then proceeded to ask several other people until FINALLY someone said, it should be in the \"cage\".  They walk over to the cage and spend a good five minutes trying to find the item.  At which point, some other genius says, OH, this is an AV item, you need to go to the BACK counter in the AV department.  I said, oh, ok, great.  They told me FRONT COUNTER!. So, I proceed to take the long trek back to the AV department thinking this should be a snap.  Pickup my item and leave, right?  NOPE!  So, I present the receipt to one of the guys, and confusion ensues.  After consulting with about five other genius, the one guys says, OH we just need to pick it up from the shelve.  I was like, HUH?  They told me it was READY FOR PICKUP FROM THE FRONT COUNTER!!.  So, I ask the guy where it is, he says, I'll go pick it up for you, I said, no really, I can do it.  The guy insisted on picking it up.  I discover why he insisted on doing this later on.  Apparently these guys work on commission.  Thought it was strange since I had ordered online and didn't ask or need for anyone's assistance.  But nevertheless, I let him pick it up and hand it to me.  So, I proceed to walk out of the store, thinking I was done, right?  I mean, I had already paid for it.  The guy says I need to follow him over to his computer to \"do something.\" By this time, it was already about 20 minutes into what should have been a 5 minute task, but I was like, oh, ok, sure.  So, we're standing there and he's starting to fumble around with the computer, not really understanding what he's trying to do.  He's growing increasingly agitated.  Then he says, well, since you already paid for it, I'm not sure how I'm going to get my commission, all while looking at me for some sympathy.  At this point, I could've easily been a real dick and said, well, it's not my fault your process is so F'd up!  But, I chose to me nice, and suggested that he call over his supervisor.  He didn't want to do that for some reason.  After about five more minutes of messing around with the computer, I guess he figured out how to game it so he could get his $5 commission.  \n\nSo, 40 minutes later I walk out with the item.

If it's high, you're doing something amazingly well or the market reach isn't as large as it should be. 100 people and 55 of those buy the thing? Awesome! But now what about the others that never saw the thing?\n\n**Where are the clicks going?** If they're to a website, use google analytics to track their behavior from page to page. Are they sticking to the frontpage and bouncing? Which page is the exit? Review the exit/bounce pages. People tend to get lost or uninterested really quickly, especially on mobile. 95% of all my ads ever pushed were seen on mobile.\n\nThere are parts of a website that will cause people to exit. Confusing portions, too many menus (also known as option overload), or even the cart checkout. Amazon and other big players remove the top menu bar when people are checking out. Why? So they can't go anywhere else. One direction - to the payment option. No more browsing, just buy the thing! Landing pages rarely have top menu bars for the same reason. \"Submit email here to...\" and nothing else. One very simple option. All the on-the-fence folk will either do the thing or bail; they won't browse around before getting bored and leaving.\n\nThe audience may also be the type to browse but never buy. Online windows shoppers I guess we can call them. I like these people but they won't pull in revenue.\n\nTypical conversion rates for email are 2-5%. Don't worry, that's natural! You'll funnel people through the typical marketing channels (acquisition, activation, retention, referral, revenue) and keep 5% through each. Sounds crazy but consider how many of us know about Best Buy, signed up for their email, open every email, and then follow through with buying what the email says to buy. 1.4% is a bit low though.\n\nTrack their behavior. Excellent job with the demographic targeting, now lets move on to behavior targeting and find the people who will also buy your brand!\n\nUnrelated note: If your brand is new-new and this is your first year, it's natural to run in the red. Even restaurants do that for the first 3+ years just to recoup startup costs, inventory, initial rent, and all that jazz.

{"id":"cw5joxs","author":"CripzyChiken","body":"First off - I'd base the budget off of 4 weeks, not 4.3 then use the extra paychecks to bolster savings or debt repayment - getting rid of those will help bring your budget down to surviving off of 4 weeks. You have a lot of debt and the history of a bankruptcy tells me there was issues in the past.  Plus you have nothing set aside for savings - meaning another big problem isn't too far away.\n\nNext - you have no 'fun' budget - stuff like going out to eat, going on a weekend get away, buying food at a kid's game/dance/etc.  So that is a money sink that you aren't even tracking.  This is another sign that there is no flex in your budget and another issue is possible.\n\nElectric - the $400+/month tells me there is room to save.  Do you have a programmable thermostat? turn lights off?  Replaced old light bulbs with led or cfls?  Use your windows (so open them if the weather outside is nice rather than turning the AC).\n\nHome entertainment - so you are paying nearly $200/month between directTV, internet and nextflix.  Can you drop TV and add in something else like Hulu or AmazonPrime to make up for it.  That's over $100/month savings.\n\nFood/lunches - you are over $1800/month on food and such.  Seems like you need to focus a lot more on Sams/Costco to get that well above $220/month and drop the $1300+ by even more.  With a family of 7 + pets, that should be your biggest food bill, not a normal grocery store.\n\nCar #2/$16k+ loan.  honestly, this is a huge problem.  You have a huge car with a huge car loan.  I'd look into selling this and buying a similar car that's a few years older.  That will drop your monthly payments and insurance (older cars are cheaper to insure).  \n\nGas - same as others have touched on - how the hell are you driving that much each month?  Why isn't the oldest kid pitching in for his/her car costs.  I get the oldest is probably driving the younger ones around a bit, but I'd limit it to 1 personal trip a week until they start contributing (1 trip is to 'pay' them for hauling the others around).\n\nInsurance - seems high, so it would be worth it to rerun your numbers at a couple of different places to see if you are overpaying.\n\nCC Debt - so even after a bankruptcy you still have debt which means you have no idea how to spend money properly.  If it was me - freeze the credit card in a large block of ice and stop using it.  Go to a cash based system until you can get your spending under control.\n\n","name":"t1_cw5joxs","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-19 22:19:38","week":43}

{"id":"cw5n9zi","author":"cookingboy","body":"EDIT: Before I go into details, here are some interesting numbers: \n\nYoY Revenue growth for most recent quarter:\n\nFB: 38%.\n\nAMZN: 19%\n\nGOOGL: 11%\n\nIBM: -13%\n\nHPQ:-9%\n\nAAPL: + 32%\n\nGuess which group is AAPL's P/E close to? Yep, it's lower than IBM's and is about the same as HP's. Even though it's growing at the same/higher rate as those \"growth stars\" it's being priced as if it's dying.\n\nWARNING: This will be long.\n\nSo this is how I see it. Financially speaking I think it's undebatable that Apple is one of the most, if not THE most healthy company in the world when it comes to profit/revenue growth and cash reserve. I think during their holiday seasons last year they literally made more profit than the amount U.S. Mint printed in cash during the same 3 months.\n\nHowever, a lot of nay-sayers say Apple's dominance is overly relying on iPhone. They see iPhone as a singular consumer product that has low barrier of entry/competitive advantage and one day another company will just magically come up with something better and takes over the market. Or maybe one day a new product category (VR, flying cars, robots, whatever) will suddenly be the \"next big thing\" and Apple will fail to compete.\n\nAs a tech professional who works in Silicon Valley, those point of views are uneducated at best, and misleading at worst. iPhone is the representation of something larger. It's the RESULT of Apple's entire infrastructure/absurdly wide competitive moat. This infrastructure contains the following:\n\n1. Engineering talent: In the tech world talent is key. Apple is able to compete on this front while only spending a small fraction of their budget on R&amp;D. They have some of the best engineering teams working in semi-conductor, material science, manufacturing, software engineering, etc. They are not currently the best in EVERYTHING, however please refer to point 5 to see why this doesn't matter in the long run.\n\n2. Manufacturing expertise: Apple employs some of the best people in consumer manufacturing today. Take the Apple Watch for example, they were able to apply [high end finish techniques] (http://atomicdelights.com/blog/a-glimpse-at-how-the-apple-watch-is-made) that's reserved for Swiss luxury pieces on a cheap watch that only costs $500. This is the reason why no competitors can match them, not because they don't care, but simply because they can't do the same at the same cost. This applies to whatever products they will make in the future as well. If they can consistently provide higher quality product at same/less price, then they will remain attractive to consumers. \n\n3. Supply chain: Due to economy of scale, Apple has unprecedented power and influence in the world of consumer products supply chain. This goes from raw material acquisition to manufacturing to packaging to shipping/delivery to customer support.\n\n4. Platform and branding: Apple leverages the entire Mac/iOS ecosystem to push their unique value proposition. Due to the relatively closed nature of such ecosystem, for good or bad, consumers will not view Apple's service as \"commodity\". When it comes to branding, I don't know of any other tech company that successfully associated themselves as a luxury brand, and Apple's brand value is actively growing as well. \n\n5. Apple is fantastic, but obviously not 100% perfect in the above 4 points. Facebook/Google has better tech talent in large scale web services, Tesla has better engineers for electric cars, Samsung/TSMC holds the manufacturing bottleneck of Apple's silicon, and there is always the risk of a new startup coming with cool tech that Apple does not have. This, however, is where the $200,000,000,000+ cash reserve Apple has comes into play. We live in the world of capitalism, and one key to solve problems in such system is through use of capital. Apple has a metric shit ton of such capital. [Startup acquisitions](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/16/apple-acquires-mapsense/), [ludicrous compensation packages for top engineers](http://www.autoblog.com/2015/02/07/elon-musk-apple-hiring-tesla-workers/), [supply chain investments](http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/apple-japan-display-investment/), [polish brand image](http://qz.com/523805/apple-will-sponsor-the-met-gala-the-fashion-industrys-biggest-party-of-the-year/) are just SOME of the example on how Apple can wield this amount of resource. \n\nObviously the risk is not zero, a bad/incompetent management team can still ruin the company in the long run, after all the human factor is the key. This where investors have to make a \"gut\" call, and ask themselves whether they see Apple's management team as being more/less/equally competent than other companies' exec team. I'm personally impressed by how well the team held together after Steve Job's death.\n\nThe above are my personal analysis as a long holder of Apple ever since the beginning of 2009.

After I tried to buy something I noticed the card was getting rejected. When I called Chase they told me that my card had been closed because I never gave them the requiered verification. Confused I just payed my balanced and left it like that (super busy weeks for me so I had no time to be on the phone). After some digging, it seems they sent me some kind of social security verification letter twice but my dad got it because it was address to my name without the JR on it; since he has a Chase card he taught it was for him but he called Chase and they told him it was a mistake on their part. \n\nSo here we are, two months later. Should I try to get the card again but now with my \"real\" name without JR? I have a new address but I'm scared that trying again will somehow alert a system or something lol","name":"t1_cw5pjal","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-20 00:53:04","week":43}

{"id":"cw65gqr","author":"TerranBarron","body":"I agree with everything you're saying about AAPL as a company. You're right, they do have top engineering talent, their supply chain is unmatched, they're the only legitimate luxury tech brand, and their cash reserves provide a powerful defense against threats. Yet, none of these things make it a good investment unless you think these things aren't getting priced in. \n\nAAPL would be a horrible stock to buy if it had a $10 trillion market cap. YAHOO would be a great stock if it had a $5 million market cap. A great company doesn't necessarily mean a great stock (which I'm sure you already know). \n\n\n\nA great example of this was the stock correction around 2012. \n\nPre 2012, the stock was getting priced as if AAPL was going to own the entire phone market. But in 2012, it started to become clear that Android was a real threat and AAPL was not going to have a monopoly in the phone market. In fact, it wasn't even clear that AAPL was going to have a monopoly in the high end phone market. Hence, there was a massive correction in the stock price from ~$700 down to ~$400. Fast forward to 2015, and it's clear that the analysts were right to reprice AAPL since iOS did NOT become the Windows of the mobile world. It was, however, able to successfully retain the high end phone market hence the steady rebound. This 2010 correction is easily understood if you look at the iOS and android growth rates during this period. \n\n&gt;That's what people have been saying since like 2010, yet Apple has still been growing iPhone at 30%-40% YoY basis. \n\nThis is not true. There is a very clear slowdown in the iPhone growth rate. The data is all right here. Growth is still there, but don't muddle the data by saying growth hasn't slowed. Looking at Q409 to Q414, we have the following growth rates:\n90%-&gt;84%-&gt;134%-&gt;28%-&gt;6%-&gt;57%. It's not clear at all if AAPL will average back to your quoted \"30%-40%\". \n\nhttp://www.asymco.com/2015/02/09/apples-growth-scorecard-4/\n\n\n \n&gt;The cold, hard truth is that Apple's growth HAS not slowed down yet, and the market is pricing it as if it's actually shrinking.\n\nIt is true that In recent years AAPL has slowed down less than Android high end phones, Android tablets, and PCs, but the market is absolutely not pricing it as if it's shrinking. When the stock drops when AAPL reports record breaking earnings, that doesn't mean the market is saying its shrinking. It's just saying that it thinks AAPL should be growing faster to justify its price. Perhaps a small difference, but I think it's an important point to make. \n\n\n\n\n&gt;If you are looking at a company that can grow income by 10-40x, would you invest in Facebook? Google? Amazon? Microsoft? Twitter? None of those companies have the growth of Apple yet they are valued at 2x to 10x as much P/E. \n\nI don't understand what you mean here. FB and AMZN have absolutely destroyed AAPL in terms of revenue growth. Obviously, Amazon runs at 0 profit and FB is just beginning to explore income strategies. But if you're confused with the P/E difference, it's simply because they're currently priced at 0 profit, but everyone think that with their huge revenue growth rates, they should eventually figure out way a to earn a significant profit. Are they riskier stocks? Yes? But that does not mean their P/E is unjustified. \n\n\n&gt;If you expect AAPL to 40x their income, then you must be expecting GOOGL to 120X their income...\n\nThe 40x number was obviously hypothetical, but the reason that GOOG can be expected to maximize a higher/faster profit than AAPL is simply because you have to question the growth rates of search/internet (GOOG) vs high no smartphones (AAPL). On a first order, this explains the P/E difference between GOOG and AAPL. \n\n\n\n\n&gt;Even AAPL has 0% growth for the next 10 years, it will have as much cash as their current market cap, so as an investor you'd be getting the rest of their asset for free.\n\nYes... But that doesn't make it a good investment. That just makes it a safe investment. \n\n\nNonetheless, I do think AAPL is a good investment, but not just for the reasons you mention. Yes, it's a good we'll run, well oiled company. But is its business good? I say it is. Obviously you need to start with the iPhone. High end smartphone growth continues to grow and Android/iOS rates seem to be favoring iOS in mature markets like the US. There are also signs of this happening in the UK and Sotuh Korea. The biggest weak point of the phone is obviously that it's market share is limited to ~12-20% of the top of the market. That's good for profits but it does leave AAPL vulnerable due to market share attacks. The iPhone upgrade plan and recent deals in India seem like reasonable strategies, but unlikely to make any real dent. Ultimately, it remains to be seen if one year old iPhones can compete with new midrange Android phones in the middle end markets. I see no way for AAPL to compete in the lower end market (sub $100 phones). \n\nRegarding tablets and PCs, I think AAPL is well positioned to react to whatever the market morphs to in the coming years. This question is obviously whether or not laptops evolve to be Surface-like or if software becomes iOS-like. This question is much more complex than it may appear at first as \"work\" is vastly different between students, receptionist, field workers, programmers, writers, drafters etc. I don't have a clear picture here. But I'm optimistic that AAPL will be able to react as needed as it has both software solutions (iOS and macOS) and I'm assuming it's hardware expertise will allow it to quickly adapt if needed.\n\nRegarding wearables, I think AAPL continues to be in a strong position. As you/I mention, it's the only company with a strong luxury brand, and I suspect that will only become more valuable if wearable are to become a significant market. Their seemingly untouchable control of the high end phone market make any new luxury entry (watches, cars, etc) highly valuable (assuming a market can be supported). \n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cw65gqr","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-20 09:04:59","week":43}

Amazon throw out free Prime extensions like confetti on behalf of drivers who say they attempted delivery but never turned up, or put your parcel in the garbage as \"left in a safe place\", never to be seen again.\n\nThe self-employed courier service under various brands is very big business in the UK now, a huge proportion of retailers use them and they're not unpopular on the consumer side either because they're so much cheaper for parcel transport. While the big names may have their problems, it's nothing compared to the bargain basement services, up to and including making national news because the couriers are so poorly paid, etc.\n\nYodel is one of the most famously bad services, they almost single-handedly power /r/britishproblems.

Also, you should buy an OBD reader from Amazon or where ever for $30 so you can check the codes if your car throws a check engine light. \n\nI also drive a lot for work but not nearly as consistent in number of miles. I also get the IRS rate and the smallest check I ever received from work was about $300 and the largest was just under $1300. Most are around 700-800. I spend maybe $200 on gas, of course depending on how much I drive and this includes my personal driving too.\n\nI would say that unless you are driving something super crazy like a Porsche, you are going to make money on your work set-up. Especially if you do your own maintenance.\n\nOn first glance I have a horrible 'car' for this type of work as it's a 2003 Dodge Ram **van** 2500 with &gt;240k miles. However, the beast runs on natural gas which costs less money than gasoline. So if you live/work near CNG stations, then I totally recommend this option (but probably not the Dodge Ram). Honda makes a CNG Civic and I hope to replace mine with a used CNG Civic sometime soon. I would 100% go used car for your purposes, especially one for which you don't have to take out a loan.\n\nSince you're planning on grad school, presumably in the next few years, you don't want to be stuck with a car payment when you're in school full-time. \n\nI've been doing this job for about a year and I've only been without a working vehicle for a couple of days.

{"id":"cw78a3h","author":"never_noob","body":"Dear science I hope that's a paper trade and not an actual account...  Or is someone actually writing a 1% butterfly call spread. On Amazon. At earnings time?\n\nAt any rate, the negative means you are \"short\" that option meaning you sold the option contract that someone else bought.  In essence, you \"owe\" those four contracts, hence the negative. It indicates that you need to buy 4 of those contracts to close the position and bring it to zero.  You will see this reflected as a negative market value next to short options (even when you have an unrealized gain), which represents your cost to buy back the option from the buyer[1].  In other words, if you sell an option for a $100 premium, and the next day the stock has moved such that the option you sold is now only worth $50, the market value of that position will be -$50 even though your unrealized gain on the trade is +$50.  This is because it will cost you $50 to close out the trade and essentially make good on your short obligation.  \n\nWith those two long call options (the 595 call and the 605 call), you were the buyer, so the person from whom you bought those will have the \"negative\" in their account, indicating that they are short on the other side.  If you are the seller, you collect a premium up front and time decay (theta) works in your favor.  If you are the buyer, you pay a premium, and time decay works against you. \n\nSince AMZN isn't trading anywhere near the range of that butterfly spread, all of those options are going to expire worthless, unless amazon shoots up to exactly 600 +/-5 in the next 3 days and stays there moving into expiration. \n\nMake sense?\n\nI'm assuming this was a demo/paper trade of some kind?

{"id":"cw7dmuw","author":"Lord_dokodo","body":"The catch with mTurk is that it is designed with certification requirements for many tasks.  When you initially open up the homepage for mTurk, you'll see many different tasks with all sorts of payouts.  But many of the very high paying surveys/tasks require some sort of certification, many which are granted based on the answer to one or two very random questions or are granted after fulfilling certain requirements like 1000 tasks completed or a certain success rate.  \n\nIt takes a while to get situated in mTurk.  You have to complete all sorts of certification tests so mTurk can verify that a somewhat intelligent person is completing their tasks, rather than some crack addict looking for a few quick and easy bucks.  The worthwhile certifications pretty much require an extensive history with mTurk, such as the Master Certification, which requires a certain success rate + a lot of completed tasks.\n\nThe other trick is that most of these surveys are often low paying or quite long.  Therefore, the goal is to complete as many as possible, while focusing on the ones that pay the most for your time.  A survey could pay out $10 but if it takes 2 hours, you really only made $5 an hour, and it's entirely possible to make more through mTurk.  /r/HITSWorthTurkingFor is a sub where users link efficient tasks that give good payouts for the average time required to complete it.  Browse there if you plan on actually trying to make some serious pocket change through mTurk.\n\nThere are many menial tasks, mostly to do with data entry, that are not worth it at all, despite any bonuses that might be promised or whatnot.  Often times, you will find one that is very hard to read or a receipt with 1000 items on it that have to all be transcribed into thousands of other text boxes.  Screw those, it's a waste of time.  Only consider doing those if they are VERY easy, since each task is a free point added to your number of tasks completed.\n\nBe sure to pay attention to the tasks you are doing.  Often times, they will have some sort of quality control to make sure that people aren't just pressing buttons randomly to get the payout quickly.  Memory tests (asking you to recall something specific about a story or question before moving on to make sure you read it), attention checks (\"answer all of the above if you are paying attention.\"), etc.  It's up to you whether or not you want to answer these questions legitimately, though do remember that these people paid Amazon for responses and the least you could do is put forth an honest effort.  Especially considering many of these are surveys/questionnaires/other forms of public data that will be used in the future. \n\nThe other importance of maintaining a good track record is that many surveys/tasks will require a certain success rate/pass rate.  It's usually hard to get your work rejected unless you clearly did not read instructions and fail to answer memory/attention checks.  But, nonetheless, you want to make sure it stays above 80%, no matter what.  99% is ideal and many of the very well paying surveys/tasks require 99% pass rate.  Keep this number up and if you need to raise it, do a few quick and easy tasks to raise the average.","name":"t1_cw7dmuw","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-10-21 09:01:53","week":43}

{"id":"cw7tv2d","author":"arindale","body":"You have a lot of hurdles in front of you. Here is a brief and not complete list of the things you will need to do.\n\n1) Register a US C-corp (yes, there are other legal entities but 95% of foreigners end up getting a C-corp. Delaware is generally the easiest. You would also need to pay $75-$150 / yr for a Delaware registered agent who lives in Delaware as a regulatory requirement. I used https://www.delawareregisteredagent.com/ but you can always google for any provider. The whole process takes a couple weeks.\n\n2) Once the corp is set up and you have the incorporation documents, you can get an EIN. As an international company, you have to fax it in. While the website says you can call them to get it right away, I was unable to do so and have been told that fax is the only way. https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/How-to-Apply-for-an-EIN\nThe process for me took 2 weeks. \n\n3) Once you have the EIN, you can start importing goods to the US. You will have to pay customs &amp; tariffs on your chairs, but I don't know how much that will end up being. I assume you have also found a fulfilment company to sell through. If not, I recommend shipwire.com although most fulfilment companies have some level of integration with 3rd parties like Shopify and Amazon.\n\n4) At the end of the year, you will have to pay taxes on the income produced by your US legal entity. If you are registered in Delaware (no state tax), you will not have to pay any taxes based on the value of the chairs you have. From a US perspective, this is completely within the lines of tax law and not at all tax evasion. I cannot however comment on the tax status of Hong Kong. \n\nDisclaimer: I am a Canadian CPA, and the above is a very general outline of what I personally do to sell in the US. Consult a legal professional and accounting professional before you actually do any of the above.

I drive a compact and got a trailer hitch and cheap Harbor Freight trailer to haul light yet bulky items from the hardware store. Or be prepared to trade with a friend with a pickup.\n\nConsider properties that are just outside the city limits of a decent sized town. You can drive to groceries and Family Dollar easy, but still get freedom to do what you want with your land.\n\nIn-town houses will have rural property values along with city water and sewer. If you want a large garden or other small farm aspects, maybe set up a gun range, town is wrong for you.\n\nFor bigger ticket items, Amazon Prime has saved me tons of money when it's 20 miles round trip to WalMart and double that for Target.\n\nIf you've grown up in a suburban environment, be prepared for the cultural differences in having working-class neighbors. You won't get as much professional courtesy. That said, be a helpful neighbor and work out your differences early and it generally works out well.

That is, consider regulatory burdens. As a straight merger, I'm not sure because I assume it's friendly. If it were eg Amazon BO of eBay, one could argue Amazon has such market share already the regulator would disallow and it would fall through.

{"id":"cw86j07","author":"DorsalMorsel","body":"This is an age old question for speculators in the market.  Its kind of like trying to figure out an algorithm for predicting March Madness.  I would start by comparing some key ratios (we used to call this a DuPont analysis) of the two companies.  From here you want to pick a position.  Are similar companies good matches and provide economies of scale post M&amp;A, or do opposites attract?  AOL and TimeWarner merged.  How well did that work out?  HP bought Compaq.  How did that go?  Should a debt heavy company be acquired by a surging cash cow?  Should two debt heavy companies merge so that they can sell off the redundancies?  What is the impact to bottom line if a competitor is bought out?  How direct was that competition?\n\nAfter you have that position logically explained, you should go past the financial spreadsheets and discuss what synergy between potential suitors would have with the evaluated stock.  For example, if eBay is bought by Amazon, it might be worth X.  eBay and Amazon, however, are pretty similar in their operation and eBay lives in a realm that Amazon isn't that interested in.  Amazon wants to move into more upscale fashion and cosmetic sales, whereas eBay must scrap by in the secondary and gray market.  Financially you might make a good case for the merger, but strategically there needs to be a way to run the numbers showing this is simply a bad idea.  Now say for example a company that has lots of seized/confiscated assets needs that exact platform to get rid of their stuff as quickly as possible.  Say a bank? Or an insurance company?  eBay would be attractive for them, and should they acquire eBay, now maybe the price is potentially 1.2X \n\nHow also to account for the culture at each company.  Will they clash?  Say Amazon (A gritty, Lord-of-the-Flies environment) were to acquire UPS (a union dominated and slow footed operation much like, say, Boeing).  How does that go?  Does it go well?  Not likely.\n\nAs an excel spreadsheet exercise, this is a pretty fun endeavor, but don't forget to factor in the strategic ramifications between any 2 pairings.... this is where companies often fail spectacularly.  Make any assumptions you want, and back them up with some kind of a ratio or multiplier that impacts the stock valuation.  What is a similar culture worth?  How much does a dissimilar culture degrade the price?  What is the Goodwill of the name of the acquired company worth?  Will the buying company remove the name as a brand (Think Bon Marche and Macy's) or continue to use it (Think IBM ThinkPad).  Take all those little multipliers and do a sensitivity analysis in Excel.  Watch what factors you seem to be over-weighting or under-weighting and tweak them.\n\nAlso, research the Radio Shack bankruptcy.  Who bought the pieces parts, and why?  What did they eventually do with the pieces parts?\n","name":"t1_cw86j07","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2015-10-22 00:36:02","week":43}

If you don't like surveys of any type in general, you can disregard this.\n\nOne good survey site available to people of all ages is [Surveysavvy](https://www.surveysavvy.com/?m=6766539&amp;c=120) | [Non-ref](https://www.surveysavvy.com/). If you get disqualified, it's towards the very beginning of a survey. The surveys from this site are infrequent but usually high paying, and you cashout by check. No minimum payout.\n\nNext up is [Prolific Academic](https://prolificacademic.co.uk/rp?ref=7A0WQ8VC) | [Non-ref](https://www.prolific.ac/). Their surveys tend to be a bit different, but you're never disqualified from a survey. If you don't make a good attempt towards completing a survey properly, however, you will not be paid for it, but that shouldn't be a problem if you try. The site is available to anyone with a Facebook, I believe. I get a couple of surveys per week, ranging from 30 cents to a $3 value (Though the site is based in the UK so everything is in £). To cashout, you need a Paypal, but any teen can get a student account with permission from a parent. £5 is needed to cashout.\n\nLastly is [Xtrender](http://xtrender.com), a site that's made for teens specifically. They payout with $5 Amazon GCs. Surveys are somewhat rare and inconsistent, but high value and you get a full reward if you get disqualified. I think this site is US only?\n\nHope this helps. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: /u/electr0lyte has mentioned that you must be 18 years old to use Prolific Academic.

I've never sold anything on Ebay before, but have an ~15-year-old acct with 30 feedback, all positive.\n\nOn a whim, during E3 this year, I pre-ordered the collector's edition of Fallout 4 for the PC through Amazon.  Well, it sold out in about a day and is highly sought after. I've seen them sell for over $250, if you include shipping costs. It will cost me about $140 shipped, and I can have change the address to have it directly shipped to the buyer if I sell it before November 10th.\n\nI'm REALLY looking forward to Fallout 4, but if I can sell the collector's edition for a good price, I can get both the regular edition of the game AND a new gfx card, which I could really use.  I know next to nothing about selling on Ebay though.  \n\nWhat's a good time to start/end the auction?  It seems as though ppl will continue bidding well over the 'buy it now' price of other sales if they start bidding low and early.  Weird.  I could REALLY use an unexpected infusion of extra cash - it's been a rough year.  Any help/suggestions welcome.\n\nEDIT: Meh, I figured this would be too \"newbie\" for this place.

Also, I'd imagine that his/her parents wouldn't want to pay taxes on the money he/she made and if they didn't, they could get into legal trouble for that. As a final note on that, most of the surveys on mturk are for research and it's hugely looked down upon to lie about your demographics (if he isn't actually 18+ and uses his parent's accounts, he is lying about his demographics because mturk studies are exclusively for people 18 and older) and doing so would screw the researcher's data so it's a bit of a dick move. \n\nMy advice to OP: for now, just do swagbucks and perk and all that good stuff that you CAN do and wait it out.

That in itself is enough for me to have a candid talk with the person responsible.\n\nYou will not get a refund for the goods - certainly here in the uk.

Sometimes you get a copy on the back of del notes or invoices but if you don't get a copy, you are still agreeing to their conditions - one of which is almost certainly to do with returning non faulty goods..\n\nIf the supplier was important to me - I would do the following\n\n1 - Call up the highest contact you have at the company or the person directly responsible for your account. Having some figures to hand such as your spend with the company and growth can be persuasive. Ask why they are doing it and can they stop because it is killing their retailers\n\n2 - ask politely for a % of the invoice back to allow you to sell on your goods - try to return them if you don't think you can shift them\n\n3 - focus advertising this product in different marketplaces at rrp - some people stick to one place ie the ebayers may not see the Amazon listings of your manufacturer etc. Maybe do a clearance sale but still make margin on the products..\n\n4 - look around for a better calibre of wholesaler for your products - ones who don't fancy fucking up business for a their customers\n\nHope this helps a bit!!\n\n","name":"t1_cw97d0h","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-22 21:36:56","week":43}

I worked on a show in a very early version of their Creator / Partner incubator program in 2009-11 and there was a *lot* of talk about changing the perception of YouTube to associate the brand with premium content. \n\nBack then they just wanted to be able to sell higher value ads against the higher value content, but the problem they framed is the same one they're facing now. \n\nI think I was part of three separate \"waves\" of cash injections they made to try to reorganize and focus that effort, none of which were successful (apparently).\n\nThe one thing they were never willing to consider was actually paying to produce a \"real\" show at real industry rates - they were always adamant about letting tech, sales, or advertisers drive the boat, which has worked out for them generally, but their refusal to directly hire and fund creatives has prevented them from making the cultural leap Netflix and Amazon (and to a lesser extent Hulu / Vimeo) have. \n\nI'm not even sure that's a bad thing, looking back at it - they have something unique and *different* with YouTube.

They're much more comfortable taking a back seat and skimming from the crowd, building tools, fiddling with the ad buy mix, etc. Not sure why they think people should give them the benefit of the doubt when they've shown no sign of delivering on that promise of \"premium content.\" \n\nAt its heart YouTube is an ad sales platform.

{"id":"cwad6ju","author":"redcards","body":"Is it time for another AMZN discussion already? The least I can do is relieve some of the pressure from /u/TheRealAntacular \n\n*rolls up sleeves*\n\nFirst, a note on free cash flow. AMZN generated $5.4bn in \"FCF\" TTM, and at the same time net cash on the balance sheet is +$2.bn. The company doesn't pay dividends, nor do the buyback stock (sharecount is +3% YoY), so where is all the *free* cash going if not to the balance sheet or back to debt/shareholders?\n\nRight back out of the Company's (Bezos'?) wallet to fund capital leases. The Company does loosely account for this though, and they've provided an adj. FCF number of $670m. However, once we factor in $2b TTM SBC, and the financing in the amount of $1.3bn/year, we can assume AMZN is actually generating negative FCF on a $28bn invested capital base and $290bn market cap. \n\nI know this board as a hard on for talking about AMZN's P&amp;L, and I am going to spend sometime talking about that, but before we do we have to understand the nature of their capital and financial leases. \n\nToday, AMZN has just under $3bn in capital &amp; financial leases for 2016 on their balance sheet. However, we need to break that number down to determine what % can be capitalized as with server/storage leasing and buildings/land for the rest of the Company's operations. The difference matters because servers and storage leases can be capitalized at 3x or 4x, while buildings and land are higher at 7x or 8x. \n\nSo as recent as 2010, forward lease commitments were $450m. We can assume that this was mostly all non-AWS, and if we double that, given the revenue growth from 2010-2015 at the retail business, we can back out about $1bn in leases for land/buildings and capitalize it at 8x. The other $2bn of leases we'll capitalize at 3x because servers burn out quickly (regardless of what some \"computer experts\" on here will argue). So combined, the debt from leasing that AMZN is carrying is about $14bn. Plus $8bn in financial debt = $22bn in debt. Contrast that against $3bn in net ST assets and $12bn in equity. \n\nOk, now that we've figured that out we can talk about the P&amp;L as we'll be referencing our invested capital base in that discussion. \n\nSpecifically, lets talk about AWS. Quarterly margins were 25%, but lets back out some SBC expense, and even with that you get 15-20% margins which *are not bad*. This argument is not that AWS is doing a bad job at generating profit. However, consider the capital base necessary to generate those margins - $20bn in net PPE - which is *massive*. AAPL, which is in manufacturing and does 2x more revenue than AMZN, only has $21bn in PPE. Okay, so lets consider something more \"utility\" like such as Con-Ed (NYSE: ED). ED is on track to generate $13bn revenue and $2.5bn EBIT, 18% margins, with $29bn PPE - sounds a lot like AWS numbers, no? However, ED is only $19bn market cap. Obviously AMZN is growing much faster than ED, so lets consider another example using the largest US utility by market cap - Duke Energy, (NYSE: DUK), $50bn market cap. DUK generates $25bn revenue and $5.5bn in EBIT, about 20-25% margins. Keep in mind, this is with $72bn PPE. The take away here is that *$72bn PPE is A LOT of capital!*. If AWS were to grow into their $100bn+ valuation, they would need to scale their capital base more efficiently or else **AWS is going to have to get a $150bn PPE** at some point. Which could be very interesting considering the largest PPE balance in the US is BRK with $140bn. \n\nOk, so the conclusion. This is not an argument that AWS is not growing its cash flow and profit. This is an argument that AWS's capital base is growing just as quick, probably faster, and not scaling anywhere near the levels most tech companies scale at under those capital inputs. AMZN's invested capital dynamic is more like a utility and less like a tech company. \n\nBut you won't hear anyone on the Street talking about this. They either think its completely irrelevant, or its because capital is practically free right now. Oh well, the ride never ends.\n","name":"t1_cwad6ju","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-23 21:05:32","week":43}

{"id":"cwaelu9","author":"TheRealAntacular","body":"The fuck are you talking about FCF, P&amp;L, and operating leases for?? This company literally RUNS the internet. They have drones! DRONEZ~!\n\n&gt; Specifically, lets talk about AWS. Quarterly margins were 25%, but lets back out some SBC expense, and even with that you get 15-20% margins which are not bad. This argument is not that AWS is doing a bad job at generating profit. However, consider the capital base necessary to generate those margins - $20bn in net PPE - which is massive. AAPL, which is in manufacturing and does 2x more revenue than AMZN, only has $21bn in PPE. Okay, so lets consider something more \"utility\" like such as Con-Ed (NYSE: ED). ED is on track to generate $13bn revenue and $2.5bn EBIT, 18% margins, with $29bn PPE - sounds a lot like AWS numbers, no? However, ED is only $19bn market cap. Obviously AMZN is growing much faster than ED, so lets consider another example using the largest US utility by market cap - Duke Energy, (NYSE: DUK), $50bn market cap. DUK generates $25bn revenue and $5.5bn in EBIT, about 20-25% margins. Keep in mind, this is with $72bn PPE. The take away here is that $72bn PPE is A LOT of capital!. If AWS were to grow into their $100bn+ valuation, they would need to scale their capital base more efficiently or else AWS is going to have to get a $150bn PPE at some point. Which could be very interesting considering the largest PPE balance in the US is BRK with $140bn. \n\nNo one's going to get this. You're going to eat downvotes for dinner.

It's great that your company has taken over SLU, and that your pockets continue to get deeper and deeper, but holy shit, are you are your company *every* going to contribute to your local community or society at large? Every major company in the Seattle area have fucking massive chartable giving and volunteering programs, but both Amazon, despite having such a large presence, and Jeff Bezos, both have next to zero involvement in the community or any charities. Stop being such a stingy prick Bezos and be a decent human for once.\n\nEdit: Two address a few points..\n\nAmazon Smile is a fucking joke, honestly, what is it .5%? That's pathetic.\n\nWhy do I care? Because it's pathetic that you accumulate *that* much wealth and contribute essentially zero to society. Any respectable company will at least contribute to their local society in which they live in some fashion, whether it be funding a cause, sponsoring a race, volunteering, etc. It's just what good companies do. And most billionaires realize that they have an incredible ability to help others, see Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, etc. and all the money they have given to charitable causes. I'm not saying people should give away their money freely, but they should give in some fashion, which Bezos doesn't do at all, it's plain despicable.\n\nTo the guy who said I berated Bezos for his wealth, learn to read, please. His *company's* contributions are great, his personal contributions though, fucking zero. It's disgusting to see someone with that much money not give a single fuck about anything or anybody else.\n\nIt's funny the stigma Amazon employees, or Amholes as they're called here in Seattle, have because of how shitty of a company Amazon really is.

{"id":"cwahrmc","author":"Yivoe","body":"It has more to do with accounting then it does with any individual process in the company.\n\nOne real example I can give (I think the company was HP):  the CEO had just been replaced and the company had a very substantial amount of goodwill on their balance sheet.  Goodwill is (simply put) the premium you paid in the acquisition of another company.  \n\n[A quick example of that is buying coca cola.  Their physical assets may only be worth 1 million, but their brand and name recognition is worth billions, so you would pay billions for the company, but a majority of it would most likely be recorded as goodwill].\n\nSo, HP acquired a company and has a *lot* of goodwill.  A new CEO steps up and says \"we are going to get rid of this goodwill immediately\".  Changes their goodwill from Being hundreds of millions to zero.  This is a loss of an asset, and doesn't look good on a balance sheet.  But the reason he did this on his first day was because goodwill will eventually be worth less and less until it is at zero, so eventually in this CEO's career he would lose those hundreds of millions.  By getting rid of them in the first day he was able to blame previous management for overvaluing assets and set a lower bar for the company to start at, which restored the faith in the company by customers.  (\"Wow this CEO is really cleaning up over there!  This place is on the right track!\")\n\nGoodwill is strange in that it is worth basically any amount, as long as you can justify that amount (but it can never go up, only down or stay the same).\n\nAnyways, the point I'm trying to make is that there are a lot of numbers in a financial statement that can be adjusted at a whim (as long as *any* reasonable explanation can be given to their auditor for it).\n\nAnd, especially with companies like Amazon (primarily digital), there are lot of accounting standards that are not clearly defined and some rules that are being created as they go along.\n\nMoral of the story;  don't take the numbers they give you at face value.","name":"t1_cwahrmc","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-23 23:03:23","week":43}

{"id":"cwahwrv","author":"WindHero","body":"It's not that simple. Most investment are not expensed when they are made, only when they are used - meaning that it doesn't affect profit. If Amazon buys a delivery truck, the cost of that truck doesn't go in the profit calculation right away. Only when you use it and when it generates revenues, then you put the depreciation of the truck in your expenses. Profit it a measure of value added. If you make a huge profit and reinvest it in your business you still make a huge profit regardless of whether it is reinvested or not.\n\nThe situation of Amazon in my view is that they accept to sell stuff for essentially no profit margin in order to gain market share and eventually raise prices or lower costs to make money (assuming that doesn't chase away customers).","name":"t1_cwahwrv","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-23 23:07:22","week":43}

{"id":"cwaroy8","author":"Wild_Space","body":"Ill do my best.\n\nSo publically traded companies like Amazon release earnings every quarter. That means, they tell the world how much money they made over the last quarter. Wall Street will try to predict how much money. Companies will also issue guidance, which means they'll offer up their own estimate.\n\nAn earnings beat is when the profit annouced is greater than the general consensus. So for example, let's say Wall Street thinks that Amazon is going to make $1 per share and it ends up making $1.2, then that's an earnings beat. If it only made $0.90 for example, then that would be an earnings miss. An earnings surprise can go either way.\n\nWhat I meant by my post is that Amazon is notorous for not making a profit. They dump all their earnings back into infrastructure supposedly. (Im far from knowledgeable about Amazon.) What that means is, all they have to do to manufacture an earnings beat is just hold back on reinvesting some profit for a quarter. \n\nI probably cant explain it much better than that, but just realize that profits are an accounting construct. Theyre fiction. All accounting numbers are. Which isnt to say theyre useless. Far from it. It's to say that every number on the financial statements each have their own little story behind them, and it's up to you to determine how believable that story is.\n\nI personally dont believe Amazon's numbers, so I dont put much faith in their earnings.

Now let's play ball for a second; do you really think my pointing out that even if Uber for example capture massively unreasonable portions of the overall taxi market and widens their margins their value still isn't justified somehow means I am blind to reinvestment?  Are you going to just make vague comparisons with no actual analysis?  Did you perhaps wander beyond the basic speculation of Internet amateurs and find that a guy such as myself, who is admittedly not as good at analysis as others on this board, can rip the basics of your proposition apart? \n\n&gt;I'm not saying I believe these companies are necessarily worth their valuations\n\nYet you're here telling me there's no ovevaluations?  You gotta pick a side here broseph. \n\n&gt; -- I'm saying I understand how people with access to the actual financials could come to that conclusions. How could I (or you!) possibly know what uber is really worth. We can't. \n\nCalculate an exact valuation? No, and that's fine.  Look at total revenues and market values for taxis and make a rough estimate that comes in 1/4 Lowe in the most optimistic scenario?  Yeah, not that hard. \n\n&gt;And saying it's absolutely anything would prove the person claiming it to be a fool...hint, that's you.\n\nWell now this is where we need to work on your comprehension again.  I posted some basic evidence that even in the most optimistic view it couldn't be worth what it's valued at.  You're now extrapolating that to me assinning an exact value.  I'd love for you to show me where that happened.\n\nLet me make this simple for you, you seem like a simple sort of dude.  Let's say Sally opens a lemonade stand.  People just fuckin love her lemonade so she hires on your mother, we'll car her Mercedes, to squeeze some lemons and open a second stand.  Now Sally and Mercedes have had some excellent growth and 2015q2(it is summer after all) prodits are $142.  That's pretty good.  It's all because they have an app that tells clients when their lemonade stand is open.  Now this is going to really fuck with all of the other lemonade stands in the neighborhood which had combined profit of $1500.  So Dan, mercades' baby daddy decided to invest some money in their lemonade stand because the app is disruptive!  He invests $500,000 for a 25% stake?  Was this a good idea?  No.  Because while. Their lemonade stand may very well grow to take a massive amount of market share from other lemonade stands it will not ever be worth far more than the entire fucking lemonade market of the entire neighborhood.  Now I hope this simple analogy helps you to understand the basic idea of why Uber can't possibly live up to its valuation.. By extension I also hope you may realize you haven't considered nearly enough variables to go speaking with authority on these subjects. \n\n","name":"t1_cwavjox","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-24 06:24:31","week":43}
{"id":"cwavllj","author":"thinkinguncritically","body":"Unfortunately, it usually takes a little legwork, but there are a couple of shortcuts that often work. \n\n1) Non-leveraged ETFs that follow a sector or an exchange often have far less IV than the components of the sector/exchange. Now, if an exchange/sector has a catalyst or individual stock that will likely lead that sector up or down, that's often a great way to go (like what we saw with the QQQs). \n\n2) Second-derivative/tangentially related plays often have a fraction of the IV of the original catalyst. For example, during the Chinese market crash, ASHR had HUGE IV, but FXI, which doesn't track the Shanghai Composite, but is rather more closely aligned with the Hang Seng exchange in Hong Kong, had a fraction of ASHR's IV. Well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if the Composite is going to plummet, FXI isn't going to fare too well either. \n\n3) Dow components/large-caps often have tiny IVs going into earnings, but they don't usually move enough to justify OTM options. However, there are a couple of stocks that are likely to be more volatile post earnings than their IV suggests they'll be. For example, YUM often moves a lot after earnings, but the options aren't priced like a momentum stock like AMZN or TSLA.

What this means is that although Amazon is reinvesting all their cash into the business if they simply stopped doing this and changed nothing else they would still not earn much or any money.

I'd recommend buying it so you can re-read it at your leisure on your own schedule.\n\n\nFor the record, yes, it's possible to have &gt;$1M in net assets by age 30.  Yes, you can do it through business or technology.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.  There are other avenues, but it sounds like you're not interested in trying out for the NBA (joking!  :).\n\n\nIs it hard?  Yes.  Is the probability of success high?  No.  But not as low you might think.  Basically, it all comes down to risk vs. reward, and finding the right trade-off for you.\n\n\nOne realistic path with a good balance is that you need to work extra hard, at least 2x as hard as your peers, maybe more.  Unless you're especially driven, or can get a lucky break just out of high school, go to and finish college.  Finish in 3 years.  Possible, but really hard, this means summer school, and entering with as many credits as possible- you get credits either through getting \"5\" on your AP exams, take as many as possible, and also take as many community college courses as you can before entering University, provided that they transfer in.\n\n\nSo timeline, graduate high school age 18, graduate college age 21, go into profession which pays &gt;$65k at start, work hard to get noticed, push salary up by job-hopping every 2-3 years, so pay goes $65k-&gt;$80k-&gt;$95k-&gt;$110k by the time you're 30.  \n\n\nLive frugally the entire time, like you're still in college, and bank at least 50% of salary.  So from 21-&gt;30, assuming the above salary increase timeline, and a bull market or two, you will have roughly $0.6-1M in net assets by the end of year 30.  \n\n\nYou know what really helps?  Get married to a spouse with the same goal in mind, and willingness to save and live frugally while earning a big salary.  If you can double income while keeping expenses similar, the two of you can put even more into investments.\n\n\nYou know what really hurts?  Get divorced.\n\n\nStretching the timeline out to age 35 makes the $1M figure a bit easier to achieve, and a $1.5M figure a little more likely.  At one point or another, over on /r/financialindependence, someone asked \"what age were you when you first topped $1m net assets\", and for most people it was between late 30's and late 40's.  A handful sooner, a fair number later.  Doing it by 30, is possible, but difficult.\n\n\nGood luck.\n","name":"t1_cwbdcic","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-24 20:22:48","week":43}

{"id":"cwbgeo1","author":"TheRealAntacular","body":"It's the exact opposite: Working capital (Non-cash CA - CL) increases are a drain on cashflow, and decreases are an inflow. If CL and other non-cash W.C. remains constant, but inventory goes up, that's a flow of cash out of the firm (since it had to pay for the inventory), and working capital increases. Conversely, if non-cash CA remains constant, but, say, accounts payable (or any other CL) increases, working capital decreases, and cash flows into the firm (as it can put off paying its vendors).\n\nDeferred revenue is a current liability, which means if everything else was held constant, but deferred revenue kept growing, working capital would be decreasing. However, despite AMZNs DR continued growth, their cash conversion cycle (which measures how long it takes to collect payments) has been steadily increasing over the past several years. Which means something else (either increasing current assets or a decrease in other current liabilities as a proportion of working capital) is off-setting the cashflow gains that the DR should be adding to. \n\nAnd a very quick look indicates the sharp decrease in payables is a significant factor with this.","name":"t1_cwbgeo1","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-24 21:55:30","week":43}

If you compare it to the Sallie Mae card (5% back on groceries for the first $250 per month, no fee) which is 5% back on $3k groceries per year, then in order for the Blue Cash Preferred amex to be worth it for you your annual grocery spending should be at least $3k + $X, where X is $80 (BCP annual fee) - $3,000 x (6% - 5%) = $X x 6%, or $50 = $X x 6%, or $X = $50 / 6% = $833.  So if you spend at least $3,833 on groceries, the BCP might be worth it even with annual fee.  \n\nOr you can take the less headache inducing route, just get a reward card or two for your main expenses (I have the Sallie Mae card for Groceries / Gas / Amazon purchases, and the Barclaycard Arrival+ for 2.2% back on all other purchases).  The only reason I have the Barclaycard is the no foreign transaction fee plus high rewards percentage; if I spent most of my time in the US I would probably get the [Citi 2% rewards card instead](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-cash-back-credit-cards/). \n\nEDIT:  I just went to check and it looks like the Sallie Mae Barclaycard is no longer offered to new customers... damn.","name":"t1_cwc6qsd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-25 15:44:14","week":43}

{"id":"cwc7tks","author":"12809394327274","body":"First, what funds did she invest in?  We can't know if they're good or bad unless we can look them up.\n\nSecond, most financial advisers, especially ones that operate on commission, do not have your best interest at heart.  The crappier the funds they sell you, the more money they make.  [Go here, click on \"featured funds - morningstar ratings - 4 &amp; 5 star funds](https://www.franklintempleton.com/funds).  Then click on any of them.  Most (all?) have a \"Max Initial Sales Charge\" or a front-end load, in more common terms, of 4-6%.  Their expense ratios seem to fluctuate between 0.6% and 2.0% based on the type of investment.  Around 1% ish fees are in line with the market fees for most funds, but are still very high.\n\nThis point number 2 means that your GF, the second she bought the funds with her $20k, paid the adviser a commission of about $1,000; so your GF lost about $1k up front.  Front end loads are not acceptable, ever; though they are not illegal.  She should be pissed.  Now, she will keep paying fees of probably 1.2% on average.\n\nThird, let's assume the adviser put your GF into funds that are reasonably diversified, even if the expense ratios are high.  Let's assume 7% annual returns on the investments.  That means that after 1 year, about 1.2% / 7.0% = 17.1% of all gains that the funds earn go to pay the managers, transaction fees, etc., and your GF retains 82.9% of the gains.  [Vanguard shows you the impact of fees over a longer time horizon](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost).  Over 5 years, it will cost your GF 20.2% of her gains, over 10 years 22.9%, over 25 years 31.6%, and over 50 years 46.5%.  So, by the time retirement hits and she's in early retirement, she will have given up about half of 'her' gains to the fund management and to expenses incurred by the fund.\n\nNow - if you believe that Franklin Templeton has amazing investment prowess, and that they will outperform index funds in general by more than the expenses plus front end load, then that's perfectly acceptable.  However if you think that their performance is likely to be either in line with, or below, market returns, then it's not acceptable.  Morningstar is great for looking at historical performance relative to benchmarks.  [This fund for example is benchmarked against the S&amp;P 500 fund, and has barely, if at all, outperformed.  It's about in line](http://www.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/FRDPX/quote.html), before fees.  [This one has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for a little while](http://www.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/FKARX/quote.html).  \n\nThe tricky thing is this - it's very easy to show funds that outperform the S&amp;P 500.  Let's say I'm a fund manager.  I start 5 new funds.  One is invested 100% in Amazon, one 100% in Apple, one 100% in Blackberry, one 100% in IBM, one 100% in Dell.  What do you think the odds are that I will have at least one of those outperform the S&amp;P 500 by a lot?  My guess, pretty high.  I would expect that the average return will be bad if invested in all 5 funds, but at least 1 will probably do well.  The others die out, now I'm a hero because I have 1 fund that doubled the S&amp;P 500 return. \n\nThe general consensus on this sub is that it is highly unlikely that you can outperform the market at large, consistently, over a long period of time.  How many Warren Buffett investors do we have?  Not many.  What are the odds that Franklin Templeton funds will be the next Berkshire Hathaway?  Probably low.  \n\nPoint is this.  Fees and expenses are forever.  Returns are not guaranteed.  You're locking in a high cost, and a variable return that is not certain, or even likely, or even remotely likely, to beat the market at large over a long period of time.  That's why we tend to advocate index investing with low cost funds, as per our Wiki.  \n\nMy advice to you and the GF - sell, cut your losses, move it all to Vanguard.  If you don't want to think about your investing choices then choose one of the Target Retirement funds.  Heck, I would still use them too, if I didn't need to balance across crappy 401(k) selections where I can only get cheap equity funds, and balance out bond funds in my IRA.  \n\nAs far as moving money, the fact that the 'analyst' wouldn't quantify the cost, but rather just scare her with fees and taxes, is BS.  \n\nIf the 'load' on the funds she bought is a front end load, then she has already paid the fee.  If it's a back end load, then she will pay when she sells the funds.  That cost is unavoidable.  Regarding taxes, if the funds have gone up in value, she will have to pay short term capital gains tax (ordinary income tax) on the gains if she sells within a year, or pay long-term capital gains tax if she sells after a year.  If she has a lot of gains, I vote maybe hold out until either the market dips so she can sell at a loss and then move the money to Vanguard, or to wait for the year to pass.  If the funds are in an IRA at Edward Jones, then you might want to call vanguard and have them do a trustee to trustee rollover, to avoid the chance that you have to pay fees and penalties and taxes for withdrawing an IRA early. \n\nWhatever you do, don't put more money in.\n\nBest of luck, and sorry that your instinct was right.","name":"t1_cwc7tks","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-25 16:19:52","week":43}

{"id":"cwcl86c","author":"Humblesalesman","body":"Reading through this, you seem to think that your key differentiator is that you can spend more than others. This is a dangerous mentality. Trust me on this, there are many MANY players on amazon that will be able to outspend you. $100k does not go as far as you think.\n\nI am in a fortunate enough position that I can allocate large amounts of capital to projects. Unfortunately, so are my competitors. In the projects where I have succeeded it has never been my ability to outspend but rather provide a better product/service.\n\nYou are late to the party. It appears you have done little to no research expensive products/how they are received on Amazon and your only value add is being able to spend money that is not yours.  I hope I am wrong, but this just reeks of a train wreck waiting to happen.\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cwcl86c","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-25 21:53:51","week":43}
{"id":"cwclo7a","author":"bcg14","body":"The only app that I have been able to make money that quick has been with CashPirate. The minimum payout is $2.50 to PayPal and all you need to do is download apps and open them. You accumulate coins for each app and after a few hours, you should have enough to redeem the $2.50 PayPal reward (2500 coins) If you want to get a head start, signup under my referral using RQUXKJ as the referral code and you get 500 coins as a bonus.\n\nAnother good option is App Trailers even though sometimes it acts up or limits the amount of points you can get in a day. You watch trailers for apps or download apps for points. You can cash out to PayPal after 500 points = 50 cents and Amazon after 1000 points= $1. My username on apptrailers is ittakesbelu. If you try it, I'd appreciate if you mention my username during signup so you can be my referral.","name":"t1_cwclo7a","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-10-25 22:05:09","week":43}
{"id":"cwclxdb","author":"JeffFBA","body":"Well that is a great offer from your uncle. That puts you in a great position to be able to start a successful business through FBA. However just because you have the finances to be successful does not mean you have the skill set necessary to find success. So I would be extremely careful. \n\nRight now it seems like you are pretty new to FBA because the points you posted don't show a deep understanding of the model. \n\n1. Regardless of the purchase price of the item, you need to gauge demand and profitability. So just because guides are geared towards cheaper items doesn't mean expensive items will be better. But you will have a harder time finding high demand. I would advise using your capital to gain advantage using economies of scale, not buying the most expensive stuff. \n\n2. I wouldn't recommend a launch service. Ads only get you so far and they aren't super expensive. 100k won't give you a ton of advantage here. Even a few hundred dollar budget gets you pretty far. \n\n3. Do some research into the role packaging plays with FBA. I think you will be surprised. Also spending more on photography won't get you anywhere. Many FBAers are savvy and learn how to use PS/gimp to edit pictures themselves. So paying someone a bunch of money doesn't give you advantage, it just means you don't have to learn a skill. \n\nBut please before you spend that kind of money, really know what you are doing. Or find someone who does. I can personally say having a mentor can be the difference of thousands and thousands of dollars. Best of luck though. I love Amazon and it has helped me a ton. So I'm not saying don't do it. I'm just saying make sure you do it right. ","name":"t1_cwclxdb","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-25 22:11:32","week":43}
{"id":"cwcn1pk","author":"oroboros74","body":"I have been using a chinaphone for a year now. Doogee Dg310 Voyager2. It cost about $80, shipped free via Amazon. The camera is probably the worse thing about it, and if you're a little gutsy you'll find roms and rooting tutorials online. \n\nI had initially bought it because my old smartphone had died, and I was waiting to do something like what you want to do, on a monthly plan.
