{"id":"42saci","author":"ellisandwhispa","body":"The Short: Selling services to Home Depot customers and not being a Home Depot employee.  \n\n\n\nThe Long:\nI went to an interview today for a company (which will remain unknown) who said they are a \"marketing agency,\" because I have been looking for a job in marketing. \n\nI noticed that it is a very odd office space. Calm, but odd. There is the receptionist and there is one other guy in the office. The \"leader of the pack\" and we will call him \"Bob\"...for now. \n\nThe first thing I noticed when I sat down was that I didn't hear anybody else. I said to myself \"where are all the employees?\" I started to feel like I was in for a rude awakening. Thinking to myself, \"maybe this is some kind of weird adult production company...\" \n\nBob comes in, introduces himself and we walk into his office. It is kind of bare, but professional. Bob goes on with the typical interview questions, but then steers the conversation from an Account Management position to \"Brand Ambassador.\" \n\nMy skin became tight. My left foot started to tap, my eye started to twitch. Life seemed to slow down and I went from being a nervous wreck to professional badass. \n\nI refused the position and thanked them for their time. I have been looking to find out more about this \"opportunity,\" but can't find a single thing about \"Home Depot Brand Ambassadors\" which leads me to believe that this might be a subcontractor or product line within Home Depot and they allow this to happen. \n\nIf any one has any information on what this is and how I can learn about it, please let me know. Now...for Bob's pitch.\n\nB: \"Well Chris. Our marketing team focuses on direct marketing. You know Home Depot Chris?\"\n\nME: \"Yes\"\n\nB: \"We are partners with Home Depot, and... do you know their stock is $130 dollars?\"\n\nME: \"No. (Thinking to myself ok, so this is where the value proposition is happening. He's talking to a sales guy).\n\nB: \"Yes. $130 more then Apple. Home Depot is the worlds 2nd largest retailer to Walmart.\"\n\n(Immediately red flags are going off in my head. So I come from a job in the e-commerce space and we know who the big players are. Yes HD is big but this is a load of crap he is positioning to me. Apple is the largest company in the world, by far, and  this is your pitch? To tell me one price is bigger then the other yet Apple by far has more shares, revenue, etc? Home Depot is NOT the world's 2nd largest retailer. They are the worlds like biggest home improvement retailer. Did this guy ever hear of Amazon, Costco? HD is like #9-10 on the \"total\" list).\n\nB: \"HD is too big to offer their customers services.\"\n\n(Really? How so? Wouldn't they want to penetrate every way they can?)\n\nB: \"They are \"contracted\" with our company, for us to go into HD and inform the customers about these services.\"\n\nME: \"So this is a sales position? I am not interested in business development\"\n\nB: \"No. You are simply talking with the person. To see if they are interested.\"\n\nME: \"So this is sales. Sounds like selling to me...\"\n\nB: \"I don't look at it that way.\" \n\n(Yeah, obviously not)\n\nB: \"It's having a conversation with someone. You ask them if they would like window, roofing services provided by HD. They don't have to go anywhere they are already in the store.

The survey wanted to know your number of stays for business and leisure for the last year, and then it gave you options to rank what you would like to see in the Gold Passport program as rewards.\n\n\nTo me anyway the most interesting by far was the option to \"Get one Gold Passport point per dollar spent on Amazon as a Prime member.\"  There were several other options on there, but they specifically asked about earning points with Amazon as a Prime member again later.  Just a few questions and they seemed to be feeling this option out.  I personally think it would be the best perk I can think of to add to the Hyatt GP program, there are not a ton of good options to earn with Amazon so if they team up it would be interesting to me for sure.\n\nOther options listed as I remember them were:\n\n$25 Hyatt gift card after every Hyatt stay.\n$25 Amazon gift card after every Hyatt stay.\nFree Amazon Fire TV to use while in hotel.\n$50 food and drink credit to use in the hotel for every stay.\n2000 Points for every Hyatt stay.\n\nI believe there were a couple others, but I neglected to take screenshots, sorry.

Please remember this is just my opinion, this is NOT a YOLO play its just a way to collect some cash on the earnings of a very high dollar, very liquid stock with high options volume.\n\n1. Do not trade until after 3pm tomorrow.  AMZN is very volatile  (down $13 today) - if you don't see where it's going to settle going into earnings the ranges you set your options play at will be totally fucked\n\n2. I'm playing an iron condor.  Why?  Because while there's a ton of money in other strategies, options market is pricing in a 15% move to either direction and because uncovered strategies like strangles are extremely expensive to trade on margin.  You're better off with a large number of covered contracts than a few uncovered contracts in terms of max probability\n\n3.  IF we had to trade right now (again don't trade right now) I would personally trade a 490/495/680/685 IC for this Friday\n\nThis protects you 15% to either side\n\nWhy not wider wings?

They took x-rays, diagnosed me with loose ligaments in my thumbs (I have a double joint in both thumbs that means I'm basically hyper-extending my thumb all the time and the ligaments are wearing out far faster than they should for my age), and gave me a brace for each hand to wear for a couple hours at a time when they get really bad.\n\nNow, I haven't gotten the actual doctor's bill yet (which is why I haven't called the doctor yet), but I received my Explanation of Benefits from my insurance company, which notes that the deductible applies to medical supplies, so the braces aren't covered. That's fine, I wasn't thinking about it, no big deal. But the doctor's office is charging the insurance company $139 EACH for the braces! Even after the discount, I am now on the hook for $83.73 for each brace. I looked them up online and I can buy the same braces new from Amazon or Wal-Mart for $30-40!\n\nI can afford to pay what I owe on the braces, but I sure don't want to. Needless to say, if I'd realized, I would have just written down the brand and bought them myself. Is it worth protesting the bill when I receive it?

{"id":"432s96","author":"Nutshell38","body":"**What is it?**\n\n**Topcashback** ([Referral](http://www.topcashback.com/ref/Ironfool) / [non-referral](http://www.topcashback.com)) is a very simple site that earns you a percentage cash back when you shop at popular online retailers through their site. Yes you do need to make purchases to earn, but if you do what I do and only buy things that you would have anyway, it's free money. They're partnered with thousands of retailers including popular ones like Amazon, Best Buy, Old Navy and Target as well as many others. In addition to cash back, you can also find coupon codes which will give you instant savings. I buy my dog's food from petco.com. When I visit Petco via Topcashback I get 8% cash back. 8% of my mastiff's food bill is a nice chunk of change! If you don't like Topcashback there's EBates.com, Swagbucks and even Perk as well as many others. Deals vary from day-to-day and site-to-site so you may want to check http://www.cashbackholic.com to compare different sites. Just make sure you're using SOME cashback site if you shop online. \n\n**How does it work?**\n\nBefore you buy anything online, first visit topcashback.com. Search for the particular retailer to see if there any current deals. Then just click through to the retailer's site and shop like normal. After you make your purchase, the retailer will report the sale to Topcashback. The transaction should show as pending in your Topcashback account (may take up to a week). It may stay pending for quite some time after that as some retailers take longer than others to pay the commission. That's really the biggest issue with cashback sites, the wait can sometimes be excruciating! \n\n**Payment**\n\nOnce your earnings have reached payable status you can request a payout via Paypal, Amazon, American Express prepaid card or ACH. All my payouts have been via Paypal and they pay within a couple days and even the same day on a few occasions. If you request an Amazon giftcard they'll give you an extra 2.5%. [Payment Proof](http://i.imgur.com/pbCIdj9.jpg)\n\n**What's this about referrals?**\n\nNormally topcashback gives you $10 per referral. But they're running a promotion right now that increases the bonus to $20.16 until February 10th. The catch is that your referral will need to earn at least $10 cash back to qualify. So like in my example above, if you referred me, I would need to spend at least $125 at Petco (8% of 125 is 10) for you to get the $20.16. To be honest, most of your referrals won't make it, but just getting a few is totally worth it. They do have a \"nudge\" feature that let's you send a reminder to everyone that you've referred. You can use it once a week, but it's up to you to decide how annoying you want to be! The other downside is that you don't get credit until they do. As I mentioned above, the process can take a while. \n\n**Tips for using cashback websites:**\n\n* Don't fall into the trap of buying things you don't need. If you just buy what you would have anyway, it's all beermoney.\n* Make sure you're actually making a net savings. If you can find an item for 15% cheaper, but without any cashback, don't buy it from the other site just because it gives 6% cashback.\n* Many of you probably have Amazon gift cards from other beermoney ventures. You can still get cashback when you use your gift card balance. However, there are usually limited categories available for Amazon.\n* Sometimes using a promo code that you got somewhere else can invalidate your cashback. I've had mixed results with this. Sometimes I can sneak it in, other times not. It's up to you to risk it. \n* Before you visit a cashback site: clear your cookies, make sure you're allowing new cookies and disable any ad blockers.\n* After you've clicked through to a retailer from the cashback website, don't open that retailer in another browser tab or window. It may overwrite the original cookie and hurt your chances of getting credit. If you have to leave and come back later, make sure you clear your cookies and start over.\n* Save any email receipts. Take a screenshot of the order confirmation page. If there's ever a problem with tracking your purchase, it helps to have as much proof as possible. \n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nJust got [this](http://i.imgur.com/JuRijiM.jpg) in my email. They are giving out an extra $5 when you make a qualifying cash back purchase through them. I'm not sure if this is for everyone or just existing users. This deal lasts until February 5th.

{"id":"436n8s","author":"kevinstonge","body":"I mean, I know you'll downvote the shit out of this post because i'm just being a little bitch ... but ... the whole point of investing is to make money.  I've been watching my portfolio drop for months and everybody is saying that this drop will last for all of 2016 and beyond. They say that the market may never go up a single day ever again for all time. That someday, stocks will be like rotten pieces of macaroni strewn around the streets of the worst ghettos in the world. Nobody will want to buy them. So why should I weather the storm and be the last one to realize that the world's economy has come to it's end. We're just a few years away from blowjobs being the primary currency.\n\nHow can the market ever go back up when every dollar in existence is owed as debt ten trillion times over? For every dollar in existence, there exists ten trillion dollars worth of debt. That dollar is worth negative ten trillion dollars. So one share of AMZN is actually worth negative 600 trillion dollars. By owning more than one share of amazon you owe the global economy quadrillions of dollars. You can't bitch when the share price drops to $0.001, becuase that just means you now only owe the global economy one billion dollars per share of Amazon that you hold.\n\nAmazon is worth absolutely fuck all as a company because they don't make any money whatsoever. Everything you've ever bought on Amazon was just pushed from point A to point B by a little $5 robot thingy, that's all Amazon does, it pushes boxes from one pile to another. They are worth less than a single carpenter ant because they provide the exact same service, they just move things from one place to another. How much would you pay for a carpenter ant? $0.001 sounds much more reasonable than $700!\n\nYou think the market is rigged? I didn't think so when it was going up, oh those brief few months of euphoria when I first started investing, everything was going up. But I missed the bull run. I got on the train at the last stop before the apocalypse. Once I got on, it started slowing down, and I thought I could weather the dips, but it kept slowing down, and now it's going downhill fast. Is it rigged? Did \"they\" know that I got on? I think they might have known. I think \"they\" can see how many investors are \"smart money\" versus \"dumb money\" and as soon as a certain percentage of dumb money jumps onto the train, the smart money all jumps out, grabs their profit, watches the dumb money slowly jump out, then when the very last dumb money investor finally gives up all hope and sells... smart money jumps back on the train. Is it rigged? I still don't really think so, but I think it's possible that it's a little bit rigged.\n\nSo what's my point? My point is, I'm just a couple more -$1k days away from selling everything. I want you to talk me out of it!","name":"t3_436n8s","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-29 02:59:36","week":4}

{"id":"436q3n","author":"hamburgerz","body":"Hi, I wanted to share my recent experience with visiting a Chiropractor and then deciding to instead treat my back pain myself, spending only $120. Wondering if anyone else would like to share any additional tricks that have worked for them, and hope this post might help someone else.\n\nMy situation: Work full-time career and a graduate student; so hunched over working and reading all day long. Top of my neck, shoulders, and spine would ache or get sharp pains all the time. Chiropractor diagnosed my spine with 38 degree curve. \n\nI purchased:\n(1) 36\" foam roller from Amazon - $18, also spotted them for $10 at Ross afterwards\n(2) Lacrosse or \"massage therapy\" balls from Amazon - $6 each\n(1) Used inversion table from OfferUp (basically same thing as Craigslist) - $90\n\nWhat to do:\nUse the foam roller on the floor to slowly roll on your back muscles. Do the same with my lacrosse balls for the crevices the foam roller cannot reach. You can even use two lacrosse balls next to each other to roll up and down your spine. Hang upside down on the inversion table for 10-15 minutes. Order doesn't matter. \nFor me, this provides instant relief that will last for days. Although I may not be fixing my spine curve, I have found a way to feel like a functioning human again without spending thousands of dollars a year. \n\n\nFor anyone curious why I chose not to pay for continued chiropractic care, feel free to read this last part.\n\n I've been through this a couple of times before where the Chiropractor tries to sell you their weekly plan of coming in multiple times a week that costs hundreds of dollars monthly, even with good health insurance. 4 months ago, my back was hurting so bad where I couldn't even work out anymore, so I wanted to try to work something out with a Chiropractor again. My boyfriend also went to this one at the same time, but we received separate, private consultations. The doctor told us the EXACT same things when he diagnosed us. He said that we both have one leg shorter than the other, this problem looks like it has been present for 10 years, we have nearly the same degree of spinal curve, and it's the reason for our migraines (we never said we had migraines). He also told me that his treatment could cure being pre-diabetic (which I am, it runs in my family; I eat healthy and I'm in relatively good shape). I mean who am I to say he's wrong; I'm not a med student, but this combined with another pushy sales pitch was enough to make me write off believing the care would be worth the money. I understand it could be healthier for me to visit 4 times a week, but I'm sure that could also apply to many other things we should be paying for monthly to be healthier too. \n","name":"t3_436q3n","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-29 03:18:52","week":4}

{"id":"43b54s","author":"Breaking-Glass","body":"I've never made a rant post before, but this guy the last two days has been grating my nerves from his audacity. \n\nLast April on Amazon I sold a Rockband Guitar. When the buyer got it, they immediately opened a return request. Ok, whatever, but their claim was \"this was packaged terribly and broken upon arrival\" I package guitar controllers with bubble-wrap and styrofoam and telescope priority boxes around, none of that \"college flipper\" bs in my packaging. Instead of approving the request, I immediately messaged him saying:\n\n&gt;I'm sorry your item arrived damaged. I would be happy to refund you. Could you send pictures of the damaged item and packaging?\n\nThen, nothing. No message, no A to Z, no communication of any kind. I'm thinking I scared off a scammer, and newbish me was never sure if it was okay to close the request since he didn't respond. Well, fast forward nine months to yesterday, and I receive this message:\n\n&gt;Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;We've been contacted by a customer regarding the order identified below.\n&gt;\n&gt;--------------------\n&gt;Order#: [Redacted]\n&gt;Item: PlayStation 3 Rock Band Wireless Guitar \n&gt;Reason: Item Does Not Meet Customer Expectations\n&gt;\n&gt;Details: Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;The item has arrived, but it was not as expected. He wants to return it. PLease contact him and send a return label as soon as possible. Thank you!\n&gt;\n&gt;Lucy\n&gt;-------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;To respond to this customer, please reply to this e-mail or visit your seller account at the following link: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/communication-manager/inbox.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;Customer Service Department\n&gt;Amazon.com\n&gt;http://www.amazon.com\n\nNeedless to say I get upset, in my haste, panic, and anger, I approve the return request. I'm still not sure if this was the right move, but what's done is done. I will learn from it if it was a mistake. I also message him the following, offering a partial refund upon return do to age and nature of the request. I was trying to be nice, maybe that was mistake too, idk yet.\n\n&gt;I have reviewed your return. The request was sent 9 months ago. You stated \"this was packaged terribly and broken upon arrival\". In response I requested a picture of the packaging. This was to gain evidence to submit an insurance claim with the carrier. Unfortunately, since you are following up on this request after 9 months, I cannot offer you a full refund. Because of the nature of the request, I'm still willing to offer you a partial refund upon the return of the item. You will be responsible for the cost of return shipping and a restocking fee may be applied upon inspection of the item. Please be advised, you must ship the item within 5 business days. Please message me with tracking information or provide the tracking information through Amazon's return portal. After 5 business days, I will close the return request and consider the matter closed.\n\nI'm hoping he'll ignore me like last time, but no such luck.\n\n&gt;I am happy to ship it back but I will not be responsible for shipping cost back to you as it was obvious to tell that this was not the fault of the carrier. Please provide a shipping label and I will return the item in the exact condition that you sent it in and I expect a full refund.\nYou have 5 business days to reply. \n\nSnarky, entitled mother fucker is my first thought. My second thought, how the fuck can he send it back in the same condition if it's broken? I know he's trying to imply that I sent it to him broken in the first place or something like that. This time I forced myself to calm down before responding, and bit my tongue on the inconsistency.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry we were not able to resolve this issue at the time it happened. Please understand because it has been 9 months since the transaction took place I cannot offer you a full refund. I am offering you a partial refund out of courtesy. If you would like to proceed let me know by shipping the item to the return address provided on the returns page and uploading a tracking number. Thank you for your quick response.\n\nYeah I get snarky, but I'm doing him a favor by offering him any money back at this point.\n\nThis morning I receive another message from him.\n\n\t\n&gt;I am not satisfied with this resolution. The product shipped to me was in NO WAY what was described nor was it even close to in working condition. The main reason I can validate that it was not on the carrier is because this was packaged without and padding and with 2 completely random boxes that someone had used duct tape to put together. Between me paying for shipping the product back to you and you only giving me a \"partial refund\" I will end up with yet ANOTHER net-loss. Therefore I will have to escalate this in some fashion. \n\nSo now, I'm done dealing with him. I marked the message as no response needed. I think I'm good as far as an A to Z. It's been over 90 days, over 30 days since the latest estimated delivery date, and he didn't respond to my request for more information. [Source](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=201436470) and [Source](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200783790)\n\nWorst comes to worse, I'll present my case to Amazon professionally and as effectively as I can. I've never had an A to Z, so I'm not sure about the process, but if I lose I won't be loosing anything. I don't use FBA, sell little on Amazon, and have nothing on there that I can't move to ebay.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant everybody.","name":"t3_43b54s","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-29 23:07:07","week":4}

{"id":"43bfcg","author":"dowhatisaynotwhatido","body":"Some background:\n\nI'm working on my first niche site -- I'm at the very beginning stages and so far only have my domain name and hosting sorted out. The general plan is to set up a WordPress site where I have around 20-30 detailed product reviews for two or three related types of products. In addition, I play to have a few informational pages providing readers with some setup advice, general info on these types of products, and other food-for-thought. I plan to monetize the site by providing affiliate links to the products on Amazon.\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n* It will likely take a couple weeks to write all of the content, as I plan on providing detailed reviews -- from an SEO perspective, is it better to publish the site as I go, or wait until I have all of my content complete and THEN publish? Another concern is that I do not want to scare away my first visitors because of a lack of content. Thoughts?\n* My plan is to have one drop down for each product type and the products that are reviewed underlying the drop down. I would also have one page for each product type that compared the basic attributes of all products in a grid. This would place each product review on its own page. However, I've heard that for SEO it can be good to put all products on one page because it helps with keyword density, but I've also heard that having more pages linked to each other can help with \"domain authority\" and also allow for more specific page titles, which grants me the ability to target additional, long-tail product-specific keywords. Which way to steer here?\n* Is it worth also running AdSense? Or should I be concerned about ads scaring users away, which might affect the viability of having success with affiliate marketing through Amazon?\n* Do you think it would be worth having a blog on the main page where I post lists, funny videos, anecdotes, and similar which are related to my niche? Since I would like this site to become relatively \"passive\" income at some point, would my search ranking be heavily affected if after a few months I stopped blogging? Would I be better off taking that hit than never having blogged in the first place? Would I be better served using that time to create additional Niche sites?\n\nAny insight is appreciated.\n\nCheers!","name":"t3_43bfcg","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-30 00:10:54","week":4}

{"id":"43c79g","author":"SampleEasy","body":"Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a second year entrepreneurship student in Toronto. One common theme that I have been noticing across different classes is that we're not really being taught about complete business plans unless you take a specific optional course. What we have been focusing on is the Business Model Canvas: (here's a video one of my profs has used) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s\n\nSo why not the business plan? Well, uncertainty. The business model canvas more accurately describes everything you need to know about operations. A business plan, however is way too specific when planning a business. You put in your plan that you plan on charging $10, but what if through A/B testing you discover that $8 works better? Now you have to re-write the business plan to factor that you'll make $8/user instead of $10, but have more users and need more resources? \n\nFor some info about how big companies are using A/B testing, here you go: http://www.wired.com/2012/04/ff_abtesting/\n\nIn an online/electronic environment, nearly every company is using some form of it. Sometimes it's just the color of the \"buy now\" button, but sometimes it's the price of the product or how many months are free for a trial. According to prof, Amazon has so many users that they can run 90 A/B tests every day to improve their website. \n\nAnyway back on topic, in another course we're doing a free online video series that we have to watch weekly. You guys might like it as well since it teaches the concept of the business model canvas much better than I do: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ep245/l-48743167/m-48750057 . So far I have found this to be really informative and I think a lot of people here can benefit from it as well.\n\nAnyway, it would be a lot of work for me to teach you guys everything I'm learning, but since I see people mentions business plans a lot on this sub, I thought I would share this. Maybe I'll help out with more small lessons like this if there seems to be interest in the post. I'll try to throw in any free resources (like the course above) that can help you as well.

{"id":"43ccfj","author":"2m3m","body":"One year ago I applied for a shitty secured credit card at my bank, with the goal of building credit. I just closed it out this week and transferred it to an unsecured card with a much higher limit. In this time I've also had taken on a car lease that I will still continue to pay, and fully resolved a case of identity theft/credit fraud. I recently got a statement from my bank after closing the card, and it stated that I have a 721 credit score.\n\nFrankly I didn't have much say in the new, unsecured card, so I'm not crazy about the benefits/rewards. I plan to keep it in my file cabinet for now. That said, should I look into opening a card that \"works\" for me (with airline miles/cash-back/etc.)? or open up some new cards at stores I frequent (Target, Amazon, etc.)?\n\nMy main objection is that I am very comfortable now.

You would think it would be the same across platforms but it isn't.\n\nPrime has no where near the content Netflix has but instant video has advantages of offering more services and content for purchase. You can now subscribe to Starz and Showtime through Instant Video. Pretty crazy. I've also noticed that Netflix has really downgraded on movies while prime is upping it's ante in that category. Overall Netflix has overwhelmingly more content and higher quality however Amazon has a bigger variety and selection if you're willing to pay for a movie or rental... many of which can cost more than a monthly subscription to Netflix itself.

That being said its about to get more expensive for the consumer.\n\nI only view through my PC and just plug it into my TV when I want to watch. The prime platform is the worst on the web. Netflix is moving more towards content creation and so far they have the advantage on that. At the end of the day I would guess that it'll boil down to a competition between Apple and Amazon, and depending on your preference you'll just subscribe to what you want through whichever service you prefer.

{"id":"czbek7x","author":"Donnie-Azoff","body":"Completely agree with your first paragraph and agree that omni-channeling is an important future component of retail, but bricks and mortar stores are not being displaced. Companies like TJX and ROST continue to dominate AMZN with 17.30% and 20% EPS growth respectively over the past 5 years. These companies real estate locations are a crucial part of their strategy as they control regional intersections with massively growing traffic counts in major MSA's across the US. Population growth will cause the price of CRE to continue to rise over the long run, and land has a fixed supply and is a true \"scarce\" good. Also - AMZN will not be able to replace the idea of a grocery store. The perishable/spoilage factor of food makes e-grocery shopping a logistical nightmare. I work in the shopping center development/acquisition space, and we have seen cap-rates for grocery anchored and strong credit big box retailer anchored centers continue to compress. \n\nFrom Q4 '14 to Q3 '15, total e-commerce sales were $329.5B, or ~7% of total retail sales ($4.68T). Yes e-commerce's share of this total is growing, but let's keep things in perspective. Americans will continue to view bricks and mortar shopping as a form of entertainment which cannot be entirely displaced by e-commerce. Also - many of these retailers have long-standing immensely valuable buying platforms with certain brands. I have found that TJX consistently beats AMZN on price for many items - both online and in store. They do this while actually making money.    \n \nI too am long WMT, but more as a defensive yield play against a future unemployment rise (my opinion). I do also think they will make strides in the e-commerce space - they certainly have the R&amp;D budget capacity to do so. WMT also has a gigantic liquidation value as the market value of their real estate holdings is far in excess of book value.

{"id":"czbkrrr","author":"Uncle_Erik","body":"The sodium is killer in ramen.\n\nYou need to learn to cook.  Ramen is the lame excuse of cooking.  It isn't particularly good for you *and you could eat so much better.*\n\nBeans, rice, potatoes, cabbage, other seasonal vegetables, bread, stew, so many things are cheap, delicious and good for you.  You have to cook in bulk one or two times a week.\n\nLearn how to make a no-knead loaf of bread.  Google will pull up many recipes.  Or go to a thrift store and buy a bread machine.  I paid $22 for a very nice one that bakes perfect loaves.\n\nBuy a food mill (~$30) and use it to make your own tomato sauce for pasta dishes.  You can make large amounts and refrigerate or freeze it.  Sauce is easy and about ten times better than what you get in most restaurants.  Buy a little pasta cutting machine for $20 and make your own.  Again, *so* much better than what's out there.\n\nBeans and rice can be bland, but it's really easy to make them delicious.  I cook rice with some milk, water, salt, sugar, onions, and garlic.  It is wonderful and dead cheap.  It also refrigerates well for a week or so.  Make a big batch and pair it with lunch every day.\n\nHave you ever made gnocchi?  It is dead simple and cooks in a few minutes.  Look it up.  Make a big batch, refrigerate, then cook the raw gnocchi just before you want it.\n\nLearn to make a Mulligan stew.  Mulligan came from late 19th century hobo camps.  There isn't really a recipe - everyone threw in what they had.  The beauty is that nearly everything works together.  Buy meat and vegetables on special.  A good base is made from stock (you can make stock from bones, leftovers and trimmings - ask your butcher for those) which can be made in advance and frozen.  Potatoes, rice, beans, carrots, and cabbage are a good start.  Add whatever else you can find cheap.  A big pot will last you a week.\n\nPair the Mulligan with a no-knead loaf of bread and you will be happy.  I promise.  You will look forward to stew with fresh bread as a favorite meal.  You can serve stew and fresh bread to others and they will love it, too.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.  Buying staples and cooking from scratch is the way to go.  You can keep a handle on the cost and it will be really good for you.  Plus other people will enjoy your cooking, I promise.  If you make gnocchi with fresh tomato sauce for a date, it will be a big hit.  Your friends and family will love it, too.\n\nOne last tip: I bake a few times a week.  I've come to love two kinds of flour, which also happen to be inexpensive.  My favorite white/all purpose flour is Hudson Cream Flour.  I buy it at BigLots, where it is $1 for two pounds.  Yesterday, BigLots had a 20% off sale, so I bought four pounds for $1.60.  This will last me around three months.  I buy Hungarian High Altitude whole wheat flour at Wal-Mart.  It is around $3.50 for five pounds.  I've bought very expensive whole wheat flour, but I *love* this stuff.  Easily my favorite and it's cheap.  Also, don't buy yeast at the supermarket, it is ridiculously expensive.  You can buy yeast at good prices at Sam's Club, Smart &amp; Final and on Amazon.  Aim to spend no more than around $7 on a pound of yeast.\n\nOh, and these flours make wonderful pancakes, too.  Better than a restaurant and pancakes are so easy.  You can also turn those no-knead loaves into stunningly good French toast.  And so much more.\n\nTL;DR: Start cooking.  Now.\n","name":"t1_czbkrrr","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-25 20:45:00","week":4}

{"id":"czbo0ih","author":"ramjam31","body":"I looked through the wiki and couldn't find quite the answer I was looking for. I need a card that I can use for business expenses and get reimbursed for them. I currently have a CSP, Amex BCP and an AA Aviator Red card. I used to use my CSP for work related travel and meals, BCP for fuel etc but it made doing expense reports more difficult (looking at 2 statements, trying to determine which purchase at Amazon was personal vs. business when updating Mint transactions) and made it difficult for my wife to look at the bill and know what we actually owe. Some of this I'm sure could be avoided if I did it differently but it comes down to I need 1 card for work. I have points on my Aviator Red card but haven't had a chance to use them yet but lately I switched to just using that card for work but I know I'm missing out on points. I also just need to reduce the number of cards I pay fees on so I'm thinking of downgrading the AA red to the free version. I'm leaning towards getting a Chase Ink card for the UR transfers but I need a bit more help. I do most of the purchasing for office supplies, fuel, general store purchases etc so I think I can earn some good rewards that way. All expenses get reimbursed so it can just be a charge card since the balance will be paid in full each month and I need probably 15-20k in credit limit available. Is that card the best option for me? I basically need something that has diverse rewards so that when I take a customer to lunch or buy gas or book a flight/hotel/rental or buy supplies from Staples and Uline, I can put it all on one card.

Plus my credit union has cash back bonuses and the other perks you mentioned for my debit card.\n\nAs far as the car issue goes, I kinda agree with you there.  For the last fifteen years I've been putting in a \"car payment\" into a simple index fund, about $400-500 a month.

Pull em and sell em, you've just made your money back on both desktops. $20-30/ea for the DP motherboards, $10-20/ea for the power supplies. Front bezels get cracked, clips break, scratched and banged up, and you can turn them over for $15-20/ea to system builders or people who just want to replace theirs. Heat sinks can go for $10-15/ea, fan and shroud assemblies depend what others are listed. Some Precisions come with Perc cards you can flip for $15-20 if they're 5's with live batteries. On that note, if they still have drives and are in raid then that's an easy flip on a lot of 2-3 identical drives. If they're in the little blue Dell drive caddys, take them out and sell the cads separately. The Quadros and FireGL GPUs are still worth a few bucks.

Post up links to your book, following the submission guidelines, and see how it goes. \n\nActually, this is an open invite to everyone, if you want to read some great books written by other redditors for free, join us at /r/reviewcircle. All you have to do is read a book, and review it afterward. \n\nThink carefully about pricing. Too low and you won't get a great return, too high and no one will buy it. (psst, check my blog).\n\nTwitter is a very good way to promote, and fairly simple. See what relevant hashtags are going about, and get involved, posting links to your website. \n\nTop tip: If your book is published through Amazon (maybe exclusively through KDP Select) be sure to push potential readers to your book site, then link to Amazon from there... using an affiliate link. Even if they don't buy your book you might still make some cash from them. \n\nStart promoting now, two weeks is not a long time. Launch the site and collect email addresses so that when your book is available you should already have a list of interested people to send a purchase link to. Early performance helps with visibility in Amazon.\n\n\nIf you want any advice with regard to book design/formatting/marketing etc, give me a shout, I'd be more than happy to help.

Do your best to minimize what you spend. \n\nFind items on Craigslist. A glider and a crib are two big items that can be a lot less if you get them used. Thrift stores are also great places for clothes. The little one is going to outgrow things quickly. No need to have nothing but designer outfits. Or even shoes until they're older.\n\nMake sure you aren't getting a recalled crib. And, FYI, car seats expire. And it's recommended you never buy a used one since you don't know if it's been in an accident. Put those big items on  your baby registry.\n\nLook for coupons and deals. [Target](https://www-secure.target.com/gift-registry/baby-registry) gives coupons and some samples when you sign up for a registry. [Amazon family](http://www.amazon.com/gp/mom/signup) has some great deals, especially on things like diapers. \n\nThink about breast feeding and cloth diapers. Those decisions can save money.

If you're relying on paid traffic, your ROI would have to be positive to cover your media cost, and sale of your product too, which is quite risky. It would be profitable if you have a product that you can sell for $1k+ but your CPC's are in the single dollar amounts, and your conversion rates are good.\n\nHowever with most e-commerce and physical products, this isnt the case, Not with Adwords anyway.\n\nmy advise is you run with the following (in no specific order)\n\n* Google PLA's (shopping campaigns)\n* Bing PLA's (shopping campaigns)\n* Amazon PPC/Sponsored ads\n* Instagram PPC.

This seems like a pedantic question but i've had a client ask me why they have no conversions, but they never asked me to implement the conversion pixel.\n\n\nSecondly- There's a few things you can do:\n\n\n* Keywords - Make sure you're only paying for keywords which are the most relevant to your product. if you're selling diamond jewellery, make sure that you negative match everything else diamond that you DONT sell. For instance if you sell diamond earrings, necklaces and rings, you should have those as exact keywords, rather than 'diamond jewellery' as that can be anything. (a brooch for example, headband, bracelet.)\n\n\n* There's other things you can do, an enticing adcopy for instance, with a solid call to action. So something like 20% off your order is quite good with consumers, and a call to action like \"Order now\" is pretty good. Something that will persuade the consumer to do something.\n\n\n* In terms of other things you can do, you can also look at dayparting and GA to help you establish how you can maximise the investment you put into Adwords.\n\n\n* Look at Day parting to see when most of your traffic/conversions occur. If it happens at 4pm - 6 pm, you can set your adwords campaigns to only trigger at that time.\n\n\n* Look at locations as well to see which countries/towns drive the most conversions. When you establish that, make sure you only target those areas.\n\n\nThere's quite a lot more to this as your question of \"what more can i do\" is quite broad, but those are some examples specific to your question.

{"id":"czcrorl","author":"posterofagirl","body":"I was in a similar situation to you. I liked to shop online, I also developed a shopping habit to get me out of the house. I was bored. I had earned a treat. I was good at justification.\n\nSome things that helped me:\n-small internet purchases. I would go on Amazon and order something small ($5) when I felt the compulsion to go clothes shopping or spend money on bigger purchases. This didn't address my spending problem, but it helped me better identify when and why I was doing it. It also minimized my spending. I went from casually dropping 20-30$ at a minimum to 5-10$ as a maximum. \n\nThis made me feel good about the fact that I could reduce spending. It really got me in the spirit of things. It made cutting the little purchases out a lot easier for me. This doesn't work for everyone, my friend at the time was trying something similar, she ended up by buying a higher quantity of lower priced items.\n\n-purchase from a list. I would keep a running list of things I needed. Impulse buy time? Better get that Saran Wrap or toilet paper.\n\nNot only that but it gets you thinking about what you really need.\n\n- overspending on groceries - OMG I could write a novel about that. Once I was curbing my impulse buying, I transferred some of it to grocery shopping. You can always justify food, because it's a necessity.\n\nNow if you're anything like me, I liked to go shopping because it got me out of the house. Pair this up with your grocery shopping.  Plan a days worth of meals before you go. Know you're not going to feel like cooking later? Slow cooker a meal. Pick something easy to prepare - frozen pizza or something. Give yourself a break from the work day and get what you want for dinner, breakfast, and lunch.\n\nAlready have the groceries you need on hand? Get out and head to a coffee shop- get some drip coffee or something cheap if you have to purchase something. Never go shopping hungry. Ever.  Stick to the list of items you need for the immediate future.\n\nI was going to the grocery store every other day easily. Then every few days, and now I go about twice  every two weeks.\n\n- talking with my husband about who was doing what with tomorrow's meals. Who was responsible for what.\n- going to the store with him. I wanted to show him I could be responsible (this helped if I was feeling especially binge-y)\n- want to buy something now? Like right now? Bookmark it. Open it in in a day. More than likely you won't feel the same way.\n\nOver shopping is still something I deal with.

I don't think you'll find more than 1.05% unless you're doing a jumbo savings account. \n\nYou can also apply for a rewards checking account. They offer way better rates than most MMAs, but they also require more work. For example, on depositaccounts.com, Consumer Credit Union offers an account with 5.09% APY. \n\nYou'll usually have to have direct deposit, electronic statements, bill pay, and ACH transfers, and so many debit card transactions per month. I reload my Amazon account through small amounts. Some financial institutions require a minimum amount per transaction. \n\nHowever, these reward checking accounts have a limit to their high rates before it drops to typical savings rates.\n\nIf you have good credit and the discipline, look at the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card. It offers $625 in travel rewards if you spend $4,000 within the 1st 3 months of signing up. The $95 annual fee is waived the first year, and you can easily downgrade as the 1st year closes. \n\nI never used it, but the Mango prepaid debit card offers 6% up to a $5,000 limit if you direct deposit $500 per month. You earn 2% if you don't meet the direct deposit requirements. It costs $3 per month or $36 annually. The card is issued by Sunrise Banks N.A., St. Paul, MN 55103, Member FDIC. Personally, if I were to use this card, I wouldn't use it as a debit card but really keep it somewhere safe while my account earns interest. \n\nSupposedly, you can do an ACH transfer of $500 from your bank to get the 6% rate. \n\nhttp://thefinancebuff.com/mango-prepaid-card-6-apy-savings-account-a-hidden-gem.html\n\n**EDIT: Just a habit**\n\nHave you considered a CD ladder? With a CD ladder, you begin by opening up several CDs at different maturity lengths. Longer maturity lengths typically offer better rates. \n\nFor example, you open up a CD for 1 year, another for 2, and another for 3. As the first one matures, you reopen it as a 3 year CD and do the same for second and third when they mature. \n\nIn this manner, you'll get the rates of a 3 year CD but will have the length of a 1 year CD. Of course, you can modify the ladder as you see fit or need it. \n\nhttps://www.ally.com/bank/cd-ladder/\n\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/building-perfect-cd-ladder/","name":"t1_czcu4mm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-26 19:51:53","week":4}

But if you never really use Amazon (spend $0/month) and monthly spending is just $80/month for Uber, then you aren't going to save any money - in fact, you will probably spend more money with the giftcards, if for example you get a $20 giftcard and buy something off Amazon that was $23.

{"id":"czd0rqp","author":"_Pragmatic_idealist","body":"Firstly, unfortunately, your watchlist is almost completely useless. Without getting into past performance not indicating future results, for the last 3 years we have been in one long bull market. You would have made a seemingly great return investing in almost anything. It just so happens that the tech industry has gone up more than most. You would need a much longer timeline to get anything meaningful out of it.\n\nSecondly, one of the reasons to invest in smaller companies is that they are supposedly more risky, and therefore may give greater reward. A large  (bluechip) company may provide relatively low risk returns, the tradeoff being less overall return.\n\nThirdly, I would suggest ignoring trying to time the market. By the time you hear about Apple's new iPhone, it would already be factored into the price. Furthermore, for your Amazon comment, I strongly believe that 'newbies' should ignore technical indicators altogether. They offer no value to beginners, and I suspect they offer very little value to professionals also.\n\nLastly, to end on a more positive note, you have the right idea that investing in a diversified portfolio of companies with a proven track record, can be a very good investment choice, and for many it probably is the right one. Then, depending on your age and risk profile, one might want to add in some small cap stocks, foreign market stocks, bonds, or even REITS (although most people have enough real estate exposure through their house/mortgage).\n\nHope I answered your questions.\n","name":"t1_czd0rqp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-26 22:18:23","week":4}

{"id":"czd29xl","author":"YeKurkumYe","body":"Don't worry about it. It's fine. To give some example as my own purchasing behavior as a consumer; there is a product that I regularly buy from Amazon. The seller I would prefer to buy from is in China because his/her total price including shipping is $2.99. The same product with identical packaging is also sold from a US seller for about $10 through FBA. The one from China takes up to a month to arrive, whereas FBA delivers to my door step in two days. Guess what? I've bought from both sellers depending on how fast I needed it. Considering I usually forget to reorder until I run out, the US based FBA seller has gotten more of my business because I don't want to wait a month. Your customers factor in the convenience to pricing. Plus, they most likely know the local prices for the product purchased.\n\nBtw, I think your kindness of thought is not a personality flaw incompatible for business! It makes you a good person.

{"id":"czd46l7","author":"Morticanda","body":"It's funny you say this because when I got hired at this job I also got hired at a call center. Now here's the real ass kicker. The job had the same benefits, higher pay, more hours, and better vacation hours. I passed my background check and drug test. The only reason I even applied here was because I wasn't being given a start date for three months after. Right as I got hired to Comcast, Amazon gave me a start date.\n\nWhy didn't I pick Comcast you say? It was 30 miles away and I don't have a car. Ubers were $40 each way around. There wasn't a reliable bus that would get me there before my schedule and there wasn't a bus that ran after the shift ended. I was willing to bike there every morning if it meant having that job but at the time it just seemed better to cut my losses and work towards getting a used car by working with Amazon. \n\nIt was harder to save money because my roommates would eat all of the food when I bought it all. I paid for everything in that apartment and now I feel like a jackass.\n\nBelieve me, I am applying everywhere. I've gotten one call back in 2 months and this was while I was working where I did. It was from a call center and they denied me for an interview after I passed their assessment.\n\nI've applied to every single Subway, McDonald's, Burger King and Taco Bell in my area plus other fast food restaurants. I've applied to every grocery store in a 15 mile radius and not one has called. This is a familiar experience with the people in my area.

(A little under)\n\nAnd well  market research - yes and no. I knew it was something I wanted to buy but couldn't - so that was basically all the research I did - Ahh - nobody else seems to be doing this the way I would - plus the risk was soo small, so why not just try. I did MUCH more research for the book, about 3 months of solid research before I started. \n\nWhat really spurred me on in the early days was seeing the caliber of customer I was getting. I was seeing .harvard.edu's - I sold to a Neurology department in Mexico (freaking awesome) - I started getting Doctors and PHD students buying from me.

{"id":"czdcxoz","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"With deals like these, you need to get the items in FAST or sit on them for a long time.  You might never even get the original margins that you see when the deals come up, often a lot of those are things that are rapidly falling in price at regular retail, or they are refurbs or open box or other crap.  Not that I haven't done a bit of flipping off SlickDeals or daily deal sites, but it's something you have to be prepared for, I'm pretty sure that you'll hardly ever run into something that's a gold mine on one of the daily deals or slickdeals, unless it's an extremely limited deal, or you can attach some other benefits to it as well.\n\nOne example of all of this together, there was a black friday item that was selling for $3.50, posted on SlickDeals.  I grabbed 30x of it, attached a coupon for a discount off the current purchase, as well as a coupon that would give me credit towards a future purchase.  What I basically ended up with was 30x of this item, that I paid $85 for, got $110 in future purchase credit for.  I dropped them *immediately* to UPS to get into FBA.  I sold 6 of them for a $1 profit each after Amazon fees, and have been sitting on the rest since, because other people did similar things, and have stockpiled hundreds of them in FBA, and now the prices are so low that it will actually cost me more to sell them than it will to sit on them.\n\nThen, I used my $110 credit to buy other stuff.  So, I effectively made $25 on the purchase, and $6 on the sales.  If not for the $25 profit on the front line, I'd basically have eaten them.  \n","name":"t1_czdcxoz","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-27 03:16:22","week":4}
{"id":"czdd9t9","author":"dragontamer5788","body":"&gt; Why is this a bad idea? Genuine question.\n\nIts not. This is called investing into \"Blue Chip Stocks\". The only problem with your issue is AAPL and AMZN are both tech-sector stocks. A good blue-chip strategy is to spread your risks across the biggest companies in all sectors of the economy.\n\nYou buy Berkshire Hathaway (Insurance, Real Estate, Manufacturing), Walmart (Retail), McDonalds (Food), Pacific Lumber Company (logging / milling), Dow (Chemicals), AAPL, AMZN, and more.\n\nAny **single** sector may implode, but the chances of all sectors of the economy getting screwed up is slim to none.\n\nThere are even funds out there that simply buy the top 500 companies of the US (Vanguard's VFINX is very popular around here, I personally like SPY for various reasons as well). So you can simply buy ALL of the top 500 traded companies with a single purchase.\n\nAnd VFINX is the most popular mutual fund in this forum / subreddit. You'll see virtually everyone recommending this strategy. In any case, a fund (like VFINX or SPY) is an excellent starting point for building up the baseline of a strategy like this, and you can always buy other companies individually for more specific situations.","name":"t1_czdd9t9","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-27 03:25:10","week":4}

{"id":"czded31","author":"outofsync42","body":"I'm relatively new to options as well but what I've learned that works best for me is make plays for longer periods of time. IE where do I think a stock will be in 6 months and why instead of where do I think it will be next week. This allows me to make a trade on my rational thoughts rather than my emotions which I find that when making short term trades I can't control my emotions. So In my case I think AMZN will be $300 in 6 months... I have a very solid reason in my mind for this (though many will disagree with me and I wont get into here) but I'm fairly confident it will happen... So first I'm going to look for puts that are 6 months out for that price... Then rationalize that what I am expecting is more than likely a best case scenario... in this case $300 is my best case scenario... So I picked puts that are higher than that because I am probably overestimating due to emotions again. So puts at $400 are reasonable considering my original best case was $300. Then I just buy the AMZN July $400 puts at a premium I like and wait... with in 3 months from now I can re-evaluate as theta (the extrinsic loss per day as you get near your expiration date) wont have deteriorated to much by then. In any-case lets say I'm right and AMZN hits $400 between now and July (the sooner the better).. based on what I've learned its best to sell your puts when they are near your target because you will capture the most extrinsic value of theta still remaining on the premium. You should google more about options strategies but after getting a lot of help on this sub from other people (mostly in the form of shit talking but still valuable if you can read though the noise) this is the method I'm working right now.

I replied to u/MooUan earlier and to this thread as I've been I'm out the house replying from my phone. I apologise as I've been busy this morning, multi-tasking whilst typing, and sorry for giving such a vague response.\nNow, to clear up why the price seems expensive, which I can totally understand.\n\nThere are countless places online you can buy and source cheap tools from. Yes, you can get tools for much less than the £29.95 that I'm charging for the box. However, I've ordered from Alibaba and shoppers on eBay in the past and received poor quality items, which is why I aren't including such tools in my kit.\n\nI want the kit to be an all-in-one, no hassle box that lets anybody get started as a phone flipper. I source the items from here in the UK, not from a wholesaler, although eventually, if the boxes take off, I'll certainly consider trying to get quality items from an overseas wholesaler.\n\nAs I've mentioned in a number of comments, I advise people against buying cheap parts off eBay or even sometimes Amazon, as it often costs more in time and money in the long run.\n\nI would never normally consider giving a public breakdown of my costs but I think it's fair here. It costs me over £20 for the tools in the box, £2.80 to ship and £2.00 for the box and the bubble wrap, parcel paper and tissue paper inside the box. After PP/CC charges, I can make around £2-£3 per box.\n\nObviously, I could source cheaper items and charge a lower price for the box, but that's not my philosophy.\n\nI use kits kits, [here](http://www.iparts-4u.co.uk/mobile-phone-tools/Smartphone-Repair-Kit) and [here](http://www.iparts-4u.co.uk/mobile-phone-tools/Premium-30-piece-precision-mobile-phone-tool-kit), as well as throwing a few spare pieces in in case parts get worn, which happens quite a lot with newcomers.\n\nThe image I've been using for the product image was the only one I could get that looks half decent, and the items customers receive are of much higher quality. I've got a good friend with a 'proper' camera who is taking some new product images for me and they'll be ready by the weekend.\n\nIn all honesty, I posted my original post expecting to get 4 or 5 upvotes at best and was overwhelmed by the response, and I didn't think I'd have any interest in the box yet, which is why I didn't give it too much consideration.\n\nI hope this has cleared it up and I would be super grateful if you could upvote this reply to the top or include it in the original post.","name":"t1_czdqj6e","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-01-27 12:50:54","week":4}

{"id":"czdw14l","author":"superkarapants","body":"It really is an individual thing, how much a baby costs you.\n\nThe things nobody can escape:\nA car seat\nA crib/sleeping arrangement\nDiapers\nWipes\nBaby toiletries\n\nThe things most people need:\nSome toys\nStroller\nBottles\nDaycare\n\nI have two kids, they will be five and one shortly.  If you're looking to keep costs low, you can find tons of advice online. But here are the obvious ones...\n\nBuy used things, except a car seat. For safety reasons, don't buy a used car seat. But, safety wise there is no difference in a $50 versus $300 car seat. If you want to save money, spend on a car seat that will last for the longest (high weight and high limits), not what has the most features or prettiest.\n\nIf someone plans to stay home, don't plan to work. Babies have a knack for knowing when you're busy, and choosing that moment to poop on everything. Or they wake up five or six times a night, leaving you to be a zombie all day. Or they have days like I'm having today, where she got up two hours early and won't nap because her mouth hurts due to her first tooth. She will not let me put her down for a second, which is making the preschooler pissed.  You will need help if you plan to work. But, if you don't have the mentality (I don't), you may want to work just to break even on daycare. My dad used to net about $20 a month after daycare fees. But hey, he didn't have to stay home with three kids under five, so he did it.\n\nIf you can, breast feed. Not everyone can/wants to, etc. No dig on formula moms here. But I spent $170 on a pump, $20 on bottles and she's been fed for the better part of a year. You'll spend that much in two months on formula, and that's if your baby doesn't need any special kinds. My preschooler had a milk protein allergy, and his formula was about $300 a month until we found out our insurance covered it.\n\nLook into Amazon prime diaper subscriptions. I pay about $20 a month for 250 diapers which is less than half the in store cost and a bit more than we actually use. Cloth diapers are technically cheaper over time, but you have to wash them, daycares tend to be on the iffy to no way side of them, and you have a huge up front cost. So it goes back to you deciding what's best.\n\nMost things for babies you don't need. You don't need tons of toys, babies will just find whatever looks cool to play with. Mine is currently in a remote/phone phase. You don't need a swing or bouncer or anything. Babies like to sleep a ton at first, and once they wake up more they will want to move around the house. Sure, they can make life easier sometimes, but you could buy used if you really really want one. Clothes are often given as gifts, and you can also buy used. Babies grow out of clothes before they have time to ruin them, which also brings up the fact that you really don't need many of them in each size. \n\nIt will all come down to what you decide to do, but between diapers, wipes, Vaseline, baby soap, lotion and her medicine, we spend about $45-60 a month on her. Maybe. Some months it's just the diapers, and on those months I buy ahead like new sippy cups for when she bangs these ones around too much. Or buy a new baby proofing item, like a gate, for when she decides the stairs are interesting. \n\nAlso, luckily, many things are one time costs that you can buy used and save a ton on.\n\nAnyway, my overall point is that babies cost as much as you want them to cost. You control what you buy, they don't need most of the stuff, and you can always choose whether to go top of the line, middle, used etc. There is generally a big start up cost, but baby showers can help with that (don't depend on it, though). Month to month, the biggest thing will be daycare. Anything else is easy peasy.","name":"t1_czdw14l","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-27 16:19:47","week":4}
{"id":"czdwa0c","author":"isobee","body":"Let me give you a more detailed answer on the industry fund \"issue\" as I see it.  \n\nThere's this concept of sector risk.  For example, take the oil industry.  New fracking techniques have greatly increased the supply of oil and reduced the cost per barrel drastically.  While this hurts oil &amp; gas companies, a more broadly diversified portfolio wouldn't be greatly impacted (and perhaps benefit from the lower cost of oil).  For another example, Media &amp; Entertainment is being heavily impacted by large companies that are moving into that sector (Amazon instant video, Apple) which wouldn't likely be captured in a sector specific fund given that this is outside their core business.  You would capture these gains as part of a broader portfolio.  Finally, think of new entrants that are privately held but take large pieces of a given industry.  Uber for transportation, AirBnB for resorts and hotels. These typically heavily impact a specific sector, and having a diverse sector portfolio would lessen greatly the impact of one of these.","name":"t1_czdwa0c","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-27 16:26:27","week":4}

It's a single sector so you're ignoring healthcare, blue chips, REIT, industrials, the works. Stick to something like VTSMX and add a small tilt to sectors as you see fit.\n\nEdit: Esports is arguably dominated by Blizz, Valve and Riot at the moment, only one of which is publicly traded and you didn't specifically mention it. Oculus is unlikely to have any appreciable impact on Facebook's bottom line relative to their other profit sources at the start and I argue that it's already priced into the stock value. I think any Esports correlation with Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia or Amazon is tenuous at best and ignores their vast majority of their regular business.","name":"t1_cze7dz5","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-27 20:42:05","week":4}

Its because AMZN is a consumer discretionary (retail) company. They are not an online marketing social hub. They don't drive revenue from clicks and views from laid off people that don't show up in the labor force with nothing better to do than surf Facebook all day. They drive it from actual sales and that is why I'm so bearish on them right now.  The economy is contracting both in the US and around the world. Unemployment may be 5.1% as they claim but the participation rate is lower than the 70's. Someone is lying. The proof of which is easy to see. Companies are announcing large layoffs. Middle class (people with discretionary funds) are disappearing. Retail and consumer spending are in fact crashing. Transports have collapsed meaning nothing is shipping. If nothing is shipping then sales have to be in decline as retailers are attempting to cycle through excess inventory. When retailers don't buy more inventory its because sales are declining. My call might be early because if it isn't this earnings it will most certainly be next but based on transports and retail already crashing I believe AMZN will show signs of weakness this earnings season and their PE is going to take a massive hit.","name":"t1_czeecax","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-01-27 23:17:05","week":4}

Troll Craigslist looking for people who have recently moved and are giving their moving boxes away. As a last resort you can buy them. Wal-Mart has Duck Brand boxes for pretty cheap.

I can go to Aldi's or my local grocer (Wegmans) and get these items for a LOT cheaper and I don't have to wait.\n\nI think I would only buy food/toiletries on Amazon regularly if I lived in the middle of freaking nowhere and I was 40+ min from grocery stores or something. It makes sense for people in those types of situations. ","name":"t1_czf2xhr","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-28 14:41:11","week":4}

Liquidity in the form of large bid/ask spreads is likely to be an issue.\n\nIf a person \"knew\" exactly time and price, it is easy enough to figure it out using a spreadsheet or what-if tools on some sites. For a novice, I suggest keeping it simple. Perhaps buy the 540 puts, sell the 530 puts.

{"id":"czfa0mj","author":"jm1982","body":"I do agree it's a hustle , just like any business. \nI had thought and still think it would be cool to do flipping full time, the thing is consistency. It's awesome to be able to find items that you can make big returns on..but if it takes 2 or 3 months but if you need that money for bills today or this month that's a problem. \n\nJust like with any business if you are using all the profits for living expenses , then you can't  reinvest back in the business and grow the business. \n\nRealistically you need a pretty big inventory to do flipping full time. Thousands of items most likely. \nSpace is an issue..but less so with Amazon FBA of course. \nI think having to rent a warehouse or storage space for all the inventory is a good problem to have and a cost of doing business if you can grow to that level.\n\nIf flipping to you is side income, what are you doing with the side income? Do you use that for 'fun money' or is it going back into building your flipping business. \n\nIf you aren't going to bootstrap (reinvest profits to grow business)..then the other way to grow is to borrow money. Which obviously has a bigger risk. But on the other hand there is risk with everything in life. \n\nI think also like everything it's easier said than done.\nI can theoretically say \"I can go out and spend all day buying products and spend all night processing them to send to Amazon or list on eBAY and then wake up again and do it again\"...but when it comes down to it..it is hard work or a hustle as you said.\n\nJust like with any business , scale is important. There are thousands of thrift stores or retail stores or auctions,etc  in the U.S right now that have items you can flip for profit..but how many will you go to before you get burned out?\n\nOf course this is where people start hiring employees to do a lot of the grunt work and focus more on other parts of the business...again something like FBA seems like a good alternative.\nFBA is expensive...but would hiring someone to do all your shipping out and renting out a storage space or warehouse be cheaper?\n\nI can also see why people want to get into private label and buying in wholesale if they really want to scale up a business which is quite different from the flipping of a variety of items that most of us do here. \nI'm also not convinced that private label is as sure a thing as a lot of people make it sound...a lot of those people also seem to be selling courses. \n\nI think ideally a good way to go would be to building up an inventory or flipping business around a more consistent source of income ..likely a full time job...being as frugal as possible and reinvest as much as possible into your flipping business.  Once you reach a certain amount of profit per month that meets or exceeds what you are making at your job then the question of quitting becomes easier. \n\n\n\n","name":"t1_czfa0mj","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-28 17:56:07","week":4}

My best RA buys have been special overstock sales that were limited in scope and area, where for example a particular national chain had a local sale just in my area, for an item that they were exceptionally deeply stocked on, got it 50% off the retail, plus a coupon that was available nationally on the same item dropped me to about 60% off the original retail.. so I ended up with a bunch of this one specific item that was $80 retail, and $90 on Amazon.. got them for right around $30, and made right around $40 per box.  That doesn't happen very often.\n\nI'm extremely selective on RA buys, and will generally only purchase something that has at least a 50% gross margin (ie, i'll make back in profit very close to or more than what I paid for it, assuming that about a third of the sale ends up in costs).  I have gone against that rule in a few cases, where the pure dollar amount was worth it, only because I knew the items were hot and would sell and most likely stay sold.  \n\nMy overall gross margin on items sold is around 60%, which is a big combination of items that i sold for around about 40-50% margins, and other typically smaller items with multiple 1000's of percentage margin.\n\nOther people have different philosophies on what's good to sell, I do it like I did when I ran a small-ish retail store.\n","name":"t1_czfam55","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-28 18:10:09","week":4}

{"id":"czfjgg4","author":"real_mark","body":"&gt;Maybe I'm wrong but to buy a shirt from Cafe press, don't customers have to do it through the Cafe Press website?\n\nI'm not 100% sure (it seems any api they used to have is depreciated), but there would be nothing preventing you from listing the products on your page and programming something to submit an automatic order to cafe press once someone buys that product on your page.\n\n&gt;Also I have a website that I want to sell merch on, so I was more wondering if there's a company that does this.\nYou also might want to look into local solutions. There are a ton of people who work local to any metro area that might be interested in collaborating with you on this. The biggest problem, even with local guys, is that usually you need a minimum order of 50 shirts or more to keep costs down. This is WHY cafe press is so expensive. Their infrastructure is unique to being able to print on demand.\n\nThe most cost effective solution is to buy in bulk, and market merch like crazy. And unless you are a band or a designer or artist, honestly, I'd stay away from making/selling T-shirts unless you plan to give them away as promotional material or hold on to the 50-100 shirts you do make for a couple of years. It's a super saturated market. Who buys T-shirts? Fans and Tourists. That's about it unless you are attached to a major designer like Boss or Armani. So build your fanbase first, then you'll have a market to sell to. Or make something a tourist would want to keep as a souvenir. Or if you are a clothing designer, take the plunge and market and sell hard to your niche. Getting a website up won't compete with the back of a truck or events marketing.\n\nIt's difficult to give good advice without knowing what you want to sell and for what market.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'd like to add that you are thinking about the business in the right way, though. You know what it takes to think of a business solution, even if you haven't ironed this one out yet. You have identified a problem in the market and you are trying to think of a solution for it. So good on you for this. I suspect eventually you'll find something and you'll be very successful at it. It's a VERY tough market, so as I said earlier, if you can find a solution to beat turnaround times and cost, then you've got a golden opportunity here. My guess is that you'd need to have a super huge up front investment with thin margins. There is a big barrier through cost of entry on clothing and logistics. But that hasn't stopped people before. It didn't stop Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and he did it (He had similar logistical and margin problems as your solution).","name":"t1_czfjgg4","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-28 21:32:17","week":4}

{"id":"czfpur9","author":"melodromaticTuna","body":"This would be my suggestion. And others may disagree or have better options. I completely understand the doing anything to save your pet. My mom is like that, and growing up we had chickens, horses, dogs, cats, birds you name it. And our fair share of vet bills.\n\nWhat type of quick/emergency loan thingy did you take out? These can often be designed to take advantage of people who are in trouble, and end up doing you more harm than good. Whats your monthly income and expenses roughly? \n \n\nAlso, you should not stress about a credit card. It is actually very important to use a credit card to establish credit and credit scores. It makes your life easier in the long run, because if you ever want to buy a car or house, you have a history of good credit, and can negotiate better interest rates. Trust me, life is much better with a high credit score, and you save yourself a fortune in interest rates. \n\nHowever, you definitely need to be disciplined with a credit card. Don't think that you can start going HamWild with it. I only use my credit cards if Im fairly confident I can pay off whatever i'm buying THAT MONTH. Otherwise, It means that i probably have no business buying that thing. \n\nAlways pay off your minimum balance each month, and if your like my father, who HATES being in debt, you pay off the full balance every single month. His credit score is amazing, and credit card companies monthly send him offers for $20,000-$40,000 lines of credit at amazing rates. They WANT to give him this money because they know they have a very good chance of getting it back, and promptly!\n \nSo, lets consider you can use a new card to pay off this emergency loan, and you end up being approved by a bank for a $1000 line of credit.\n\nPay off what you can within the interest free period of your current loan. Try and get that paid off, because that would be fantastic to pay no interest obviously. Near the end of the six months, try and apply for a separate $1000 limit card.This is usually the entry level credit line, and you can probably find a student deal, or even an Amazon card with good rates or something.  If you have some money in the bank and are employed, it should be no problem. Whats your monthly income and expenses roughly? \n \n\nUse that card to pay off the balance on the vet bill. ALWAYS be sure to pay the minimum balance on your new card each month, and contribute more if you have the room in your budget. Maybe its 10-20 dollars one month, and 100 the next or something. That way the interest rate becomes more manageable and it wont negatively effect your credit score. If your diligent about it, it can end up being a boost to your credit score.\n\n DO NOT use the new card for loads of new expenses and such. But, like i said near the top, it can be very beneficial to establish credit. Don't be afraid of credit cards if you can be self disciplined and diligent. They are not inherently bad, unless abused by people who don't understand what they are getting into, or unable to live within their means.","name":"t1_czfpur9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-29 00:03:15","week":4}

{"id":"czfrlga","author":"CaffeinatedProphet","body":"I haven't done this yet, but isn't that exactly what Amazon fulfillment does for you? It costs more but they stock your product and when an order is made, they pack and ship it for you. \n\nA few years ago, I had a storefront that used Magento. I got my product from overseas, separated it all into individual sizes, packed them all up and sent them to a warehouse on the east coast that acted much like Amazon does now. Every night I'd send the warehouse my list of orders and they would ship them out for me. \n\nThis will eat up some of your margin but its working towards automation and that is the key in my opinion. Once you have a good streamlined process, automate as much of it as you can. Even if it does eat up some margin you are also spending a lot less time on it which gives you more time to work on growing the company or exploring other ventures.

{"id":"czfv0w1","author":"RatATatDat","body":"On a butterfly at earnings you're going to see a lot of inaccurate pricing at random times because the options are very close to the money on volatile earnings.  So another tip would be that you need to start watching at like 3pm even though you're not going to trade until close to close so you have a sense of what kind of credit you should be receiving because your platform might show random spikes. Remember this is a three leg option for a small credit so if the stock is moving around a lot and someone trades one of the three legs for an odd price the contract will spike to an odd price\n\nI trade 350 contracts at 50 cents credit.  I could have gotten more trading a little earlier (I traded at like 3:58) but I got scared by how much AMZN had been moving and the fact it only moved 6% on last earnings. If there was some sudden move in the stock at the last minute and then this was the one earnings call with relatively small movement I could have been fucked, so only got 50 cents each even though all afternoon they were trading at probably 80 cents each.

{"id":"czfvjdh","author":"RatATatDat","body":"That's definitely a view of the world and you can make more money that way but you can also lose more money that way - I personally trade earnings to not miss out on the opportunity.  They only happen once every three months so I'd rather do my absolute best to profit and leave money on the table.\n\nTake AMZN for example.  It ran up 9% and $52 just today. Even if you had traded for earnings yesterday your ranges would be totally fucked.  Maybe it would work out ok because it traded way up and then happened to miss and trade down but what if it had beat?  What if you had traded a strangle with 15% cushion to either side yesterday (which is very fair for AMZN) and it ran up 9% today and then 10% on earnings?  You're fucked.  (of course recognizing that a 9% run today reduces chances of a 10% run on earnings).  \n\nIn this case thought definitely don't trade Chipotle early - in my opinion - it's just this unicorn, these are not like any other earnings, and it's a high dollar stock.  There was a run up in it a couple weeks ago where it moved all up and down through the $400s for a few days.

I like management does not succumb to Wall Street pressures to change their intention. This is a perfect long term growth stock. You have management that is committed in using their resources to grow. I believe in Jeff Bezos' vision that there are still improvements in the efficiency of their main business model. If you are an Amazon (non-prime) customer, you probably have noticed how ridiculous the shipping times are these days (At least in US and Canada).\n\nI also really like that he does not engage in financial engineering to prop up his stock. He knows his revenues are quite high and will be using them for his long term growth expenses. One can make the argument that he should take advantage of the credit rating and current term structure of interest rates to borrow in order to funnel more profits to shareholders, but honestly, fuck that. That's short term investment banker thinking. \n\nDespite the price and volatility of the stock, I am still bullish on the company.

Trading at $190-200 a share; negative EPS, still at least a few years from real profitability. I think they're a good short (and have thought so since they were $230+/sh) but carrying a short position till the market becomes rational will probably cost a fortune, and indeed, the old saying is 'the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent'. So instead I can buy 1-yr puts for $40/sh or 2-yrs for ~$50. Cheaper as I move OTM but then I need a bigger (or sooner) swing in share price to be profitable.\n\nAll of that said, I think this strategy works a lot better with a company like $TSLA because their business model is still forming hence there is a lot of downside potential, while AMZN is more established so the downside is smaller (although pricing in different growth expectations from the market means both of those can be tossed out the window)","name":"t1_czgkw34","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-01-29 18:24:50","week":4}

Delta also tells the expected change in the contract if the underlying instrument moves $1.\n\nExample: XYZ stock is trading at $20. The front-month option at-the-money call has a delta of .52. This tells us that (1) the probability of XYZ being at or above $20 at expiration is 52% and (2) that if XYZ stock goes to $21, the option will go up by .52 for an expected profit of $52.\n\nSo, in this instance I pulled up the option menu for AMZN in July and looked at the delta for the $520 put.

These apps give you passive income in exchange for displaying ads on your lockscreen. Personally, I've had the best luck with [Slidejoy](https://getslidejoy.com/r/nPXKq?id=1) | [Non-ref](https://getslidejoy.com). I make a solid $2 per month, and the app is very light on battery usage. You can cashout with paypal or from a selection of gift cards including Amazon, Starbucks, Ebay, and many others. However, you can only cashout with money you collected the previous month (i.e. if in January you earn $2, the $2 are only available to be redeemed in February). You can cashout in increments of $2.\n\nWhile I don't personally use it, some other people recommend [Adme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.adme), another lockscreen app, over Slidejoy. I don't know much about it, but you can look it up in this sub if you want to learn more.\n\nEDIT: Adme may not be available in Canada.\n\n[Appdown](https://apd.me/uXmAw) | [Non-ref](https://appdown.me/) (or you can use my ref code uXmAw, if you'd like) is the app I use to download apps for money. It's pretty simple, you download the app and they list apps for you to download in exchange for a reward. The rewards range from 2 cents to 60 cents per download. They also have a really good referral system that pays you half of what you referrals make (So thanks!). You can cashout in increments of $2. Their rewards list lists a bunch of gift cards that are available to cashout with, but they're sold out most of the time, so expect that you can only cashout with Paypal. If you do choose to use Appdown, make sure you read their Pending Rewards page to ensure that you have the best chance of getting credited for the apps you install. Not all apps are going to credit you, but the majority certainly do. Also, I found that the high-paying apps have as high of a likelihood to actually pay you as the lower ones, so don't be afraid of those.\n\nSome other people also seem to recommend [Cashpirate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ayet.cashpirate&amp;hl=en) over any other download apps apps. I haven't used it myself, so I can't personally vouch for it, but you might want to look it up on this sub if you're interested.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: Because I can't format things like I want of whatever reason","name":"t1_czh7x6a","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-01-30 04:36:26","week":4}

{"id":"czhe02u","author":"VixenVlogs","body":"ecommerce and sales tax is a legal grey zone.  It's a broken system because a sale takes place at the location of the buyer, not the seller.  This system was created way before the internet, so it's not ideal.\n\nHuge websites like Amazon have to create sales tax accounts and file returns with all 50 states.  But small websites can't really do that.  Imagine a small business filing 50 sales tax returns every single month?  It's absurd.  The concept itself is out of date.\n\nSo here's the fix:  If you are in CA, you would create a sales tax account with CA and only charge sales tax to CA customers.  This might only be 1% of your business.  Keep things simple and put everything under your local county rate.  All \"out of state\" transactions would not have any sales tax at all.  They can be considered \"exempt for sales tax\".  To illustrate this example:  you've probably bought something on the internet that didn't charge you sales tax.  In that situation, you were an \"out of state\" customer.\n\nSo theoretically, in order to get \"caught\", each individual state would have to magically know you exist.  They would have to somehow magically prove that you made a sale in their state, which is impossible.  Then they would have to magically figure out where you are located, what your business name is, and find out your mailing address so they can send you some sort of letter.  At that point, they would \"audit\" you to make sure you're doing things right.  Most of this is impossible because websites tend to be ethereal businesses that lack a brick and mortar element.  Additionally, it would not be cost effective on their end to do all this research and follow all these steps.  In the end, CA will focus on CA businesses and other states will do the same. \n\n\nHopefully that handles your question.  Good luck,\n\n-Vix\n\n","name":"t1_czhe02u","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-01-30 09:03:31","week":4}

{"id":"czhk2fp","author":"auburnjohn","body":"&gt;If every driver started driving electric cars, what do you think would happen to the US power grid? It would be overloaded and crash.  \n  \nNot so. It's not going to happen overnight that everyone starts drives electric cars. Power companies will be able to adapt over time if electric cars become a large part of the cars on the road. The vast majority of EV charging takes place at night when the grid demand is at it's lowest.  Even now the grid is capable of handling millions of EVs: http://cleantechnica.com/2014/02/03/grid-capacity-electric-vehicles-actually-problem-studies-find/  \n\n&gt;Furthermore, for people who do drive electric cars because they are good for the environment, where does that electricity come from? Oh wait, coal.  \n\nI know this is frequently parroted as a criticism of EVs, but it's grossly overstated. Coal currently makes up only 34% of the US grid, down from 50% just 10 years ago. As the grid gets cleaner, so do existing EVs. Even \"coal powered\" EVs have a life-cyle emissions equivalent to a 29 mpg car. For anything other than coal, EVs are overwhelmingly cleaner. Natural Gas is equivalent to a 58 mpg car emissions-wise. Nuclear is equivalent to a 2300 mpg car. Hydro a 5100 mpg car. Source: http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf   \n\nAll that said, I wouldn't touch TSLA at it's current valuation, and I agree the comparison to AMZN is laughable. I think TSLA will succeed long term, but there's a lot of insane optimism built into it's current price. 100% EVs have a ways to go, but I do think plug-in hybrids are going to take the car market by storm over the next 5 years. The large auto manufacturers are much better placed than Tesla to take advantage of that.

The PE ratio would be (200/(10,000/100) = (200/100) = 2\n\nGiven current trends that company would be considered undervalued.  The shares should be about two or three times higher ($600 to $800).  Now, if each of those hundred shares was worth $50,000 you'd have a similar situation to Amazon.\n\nHere's another way to think about it.  The PE ratio determines how long it will take to make your money back from dividends if the company used 100% of their profits on dividends.  In the example above, it would take 2 years.\n\n**In Amazon's case it would take over 500 years to make your money back, and that's assuming ALL of Amazon's profits went straight to shareholder's pockets.**\n\nNow Amazon tends to reinvest heavily, so their Net Profit is much lower than what you'd expect.

The money they earn can either be invested in company growth, increasing the value of my shares, or being paid out as dividends. No matter what they choose to do with the money I should benefit in one way or another.\n\nThis makes the PE ratio a sort of estimate on how much you can expect back for your initial investment (if the stock keeps selling at the same PE ratio). If I buy $500 worth of Amazon stock, with a PE ratio of 500 I would expect to make about $1 a year in increased company value and/or dividends. Of course that's no guarantee at all since both stock value and company earnings fluctuates.

With investors like Google, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Goldman Sachs behind it, Uber is a perfect example of a company whose global expansion has been facilitated by the inability of governments to tax profits made by hi-tech and financial giants.\n\n&gt;To put it bluntly: the reason why Uber has so much cash is because, well, governments no longer do. Instead, this money is parked in the offshore accounts of Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms. Look at Apple, which has recently announced that it sits on $200bn of potentially taxable overseas cash, or Facebook, which has just posted record profits of $3.69bn for 2015.\n\nThat's a giant leap. The writer is implying that if taxes on corporations were higher, there wouldn't be investment in these businesses? i'm not sure what the point is.  \nFirstly, there would definitely still be some investment, even if governments taxed corps at a higher rate, albeit probably less than there is now.  \nAlso, isn't this kind of the point of lower taxes?

{"id":"czigovc","author":"W1ZZ4RD","body":"Amazon associates is great but there are SO MANY different affiliate programs out there. You can really decide to push anything you want. I would personally stay away from a strictly informational site. I have been there done that. After a quarter million words of content, I decided to consider the site a failure and it sits there earning 1 dollar a day ha.\n\nLontail pro is absolute and utter shit and you should never build a site starting with that tool. Second of all, the example keywords you gave are just plain bad. If you wanted to buy oil, do you google \"oil\"? I certainly think not. Instead, you may google \"best hair oil for men\" or \"Scented oils for women reviews\" or something along those lines. These are the keywords that are going to bring a lot of sales and are called buyers keywords because the person searching them has the intent of purchasing a product. They just need pushed in the right direction.\n\nFor competition, you need to check and the search results in an incognito window and actually READ what the sites are displaying? Are the articles short? Do they leave the reader wanting more? Have they stuffed the page with keywords and not writing natural? Then you need to look at how many links and referring domains they have. The less the easier it is going to be. Are they using PBNs? Are there forums ranking on the first page? (this is usually an easy keyword if there are). There are a ton of factors to consider. If I was you, nail down a niche topic, find buyers keywords, and just start writing!\n\nAgain, no tool is going to display everything. You need to test the market and see what works. I have pages that bring in hundreds of visitors a month that are ranked for keywords that the keyword tool shows gets no searches a month. You have to think like a user and think about what they would type in to answer the questions they are searching for. Of course, writing content on things that you KNOW people are searching for is always a better place to start in my opinion. \n\nIf you want to sell your own product that is certainly viable. But common man, step 1: START, step 2: worry about fulfillment after you have users to actually sell to. Once you get to that point, you can certainly look into it and I can tell you it is lucrative once you are on that step.\n\nExpired domains can be great, but only if they are brandable to your niche. Who cares if oil dispensers gets 10k searches a month, that is not a very good keyword if you want to get into affiliate marketing. Also, info domains are meh as well. If you are brand new to this, I would pick out a brand new domain that you can turn into a brand. Remember, your URL is the name of your business and what people are going to see FIRST. This is going to make an impression with them. \n\nYes you can sell your product on Amazon as well as your site. If you actually do have a product, and it is not oil (oil products are generally considered hazmat with amazon and this means you will not be able to use their fulfillment centers), you can sell with them as well. It would actually probably be faster revenue than starting a niche site, but I would suggest at least STARTING something.\n\nFinally, the competition you are seeing in the keyword tool from Google has absolutely nothing to do with competition in the SERPS. Remember, the adwords tool is there for advertisers. This is to display how competitive that term is with advertisers and give you a general idea of how many people are bidding for that term. This is not related to ranking in the search engine at all.\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_czigovc","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-31 11:05:57","week":4}

{"id":"cziufva","author":"im14andwutisthis","body":"I have two recommendations for you.\n\nLockscreen apps are an easy way to make some cash. These apps give you passive income in exchange for displaying ads on your lockscreen. Personally, I've had the best luck with [Slidejoy](https://getslidejoy.com/r/nPXKq?id=1) | [Non-ref](https://getslidejoy.com/). I make a solid $2 per month, and the app is very light on battery usage. You can cashout with paypal or from a selection of gift cards including Amazon, Starbucks, Ebay, and many others. However, you can only cashout with money you collected the previous month (i.e. if in January you earn $2, the $2 are only available to be redeemed in February). You can cashout in increments of $2.\n\nWhile I don't personally use it, some other people recommend [Adme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.adme), another lockscreen app, over Slidejoy. I don't know much about it, but you can look it up in this sub if you want to learn more.\n\n[Cashpirate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ayet.cashpirate&amp;hl=en) (use my ref code IZBHNO at sign up for a bonus for both of us) is the app I use to download apps for money. It's pretty simple, you download the app and they have lists of apps for you to download in exchange for a reward. The rewards average about 8 cents per download, in my experience. You can cashout in increments of about $2.5 for Paypal, Amazon in some countries, and a small selection of other things. If you do choose to use Cashpirate, make sure you follow the instructions next to the app to get full credit. Note that not all apps are going to credit you, but the majority certainly do.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: I'm getting downvoted for this.

{"id":"cziv4w5","author":"shortpcx","body":"if you sell a strangle you better hope to fuck it expires worthless. lets say you sell a naked goog strangle at 650/900 now it is very unlikely that it will move past either strikes, it will happen 1 out of 100 times. When this happens you will get absolutely ass fucked  (feb5 650/900 looks like it will generate roughly 200$ per strangle sold). Now if you are only selling 1 strangle and it does move ITM, youll lose (cover) a relative amount to movement past the strike you sold which wont really be a big loss, but when you start doing 10-100+ contracts thats when it gets crazy. remember the guy who sold short butterflies for amzn earnings? he profited 8k off of something like a 4.5 million dollar position. if somehow amazon did not move he would have had a colossal loss. the likely hood of that happening is exponentially low, but it is still completely probable and when it happens your stomach will fall to the floor and you will have successfully blown up your account by making a \"sure thing\" type of play","name":"t1_cziv4w5","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2016-01-31 20:54:26","week":4}
