I drop it off at a UPS store next to my house. Well I noticed that Amazon never received it so I called Amazon support. They tell me UPS has it and to contact them. I go to the UPS store and they say the driver picks everything up everyday. The package in question is a telescope in a 3' by 3' box and weighs 13 lbs. These guys are honest and I believe them when they say the driver picked it up that day. However, there's no scan for pickup from the location. I'm guessing the driver missed scanning it when he picked it up to take it to the warehouse. I then called UPS's 800 number and, after some explaining, the operator says that since there was no scan, it's the UPS stores responsibility and to talk to them. My next step is to visit the warehouse personally. Do I have any other options? What do I do if the warehouse says they don't have it? I'm out ~$250. Can I get that back somehow? HELP!\n\nTLDR; Lost package. UPS store says it's UPS's fault, Amazon says it's UPS's fault, UPS says it's the stores fault, but I just want the package back!

We were looking to work on a side project on top of our jobs\/law school and we settled for something fun and low-risk. We settled upon a creating a party game because it was something that didn't seem like work and we wanted to create something for our first major project. We had a semi-successful campaign in that we raised slightly more than what we asked, but didn't blow up like other Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/weekendwarriors\/intervention-a-party-game-for-everyones-worst-habi\n\nAfter the campaign, people started asking us questions about our experiences, so we decided to post a detailed explanation on our blog. The post mainly focuses on what we learned about Kickstarter and setting up for the campaign rather than actually making the product. The post may be obvious to crowdfunding veterans, but for anyone interested in running a campaign, we hope that this will helpful.\n\nThe entire post is copied below, but you can also read it on our [blog here.](http:\/\/playintervention.tumblr.com\/)\n----------\nIf you\u2019re reading this, chances are that you already know how powerful and awesome Kickstarter can be. We\u2019ve all heard about Potato Salad, The Coolest Cooler, etc. Unfortunately, Kickstarter is not magic and you don\u2019t just create a project and come out of it $100,000 richer in a few weeks. We did a lot of research and, with this post, we\u2019d like to give back to the community by sharing it with you.\n\n\nFor those that don\u2019t know, we created Intervention: A Party Game for Everyone\u2019s Worst Habits. We asked for $15,000 to fund our first production run and ultimately raised $16,645 during our 30-day campaign. We did not blow up like many other projects (looking at you, potato salad!) but, in the end, we were happy with the results.\n\n\nEven before the Kickstarter, we knew we were going to be fighting an uphill battle as our research showed that the Kickstarter community is generally not into party games like they are into other strategy\/RPG games. The evidence is apparent \u2014 take a look at the current tabletop games and, more often than not, the most popular games will be of the strategy\/RPG variety and party games will be far and few between. In addition, there are huge communities of tabletop gamers out there (BoardGameGeek, \/r\/boardgames, etc), but, from what we\u2019ve seen, the interest in party games from these groups is somewhat low.\n\n\nWith that said, we knew that if we did enough work, research, and planning, we could still run a successful campaign. Here is our strategy and findings during our campaign.\n\n-------\n**Pre-Launch \/ Planning**\n\n*Video \/ Kickstarter Page*\n\nA video is a must. We asked a friend to do ours and paid him in beer\/football tickets. For our video, we wanted to keep it light and humorous, while showing how fun the game can be. We simply asked our friends to play the game while we filmed them. With the exception of the intro scenes, none of it was scripted. It\u2019s hard to go wrong if you keep the video under 3 minutes and make it interesting and genuine.\n\n\nFurther, the Kickstarter page should look professional. I know most of you aren\u2019t graphic designers, but don\u2019t fret. We started working on Intervention with no knowledge of graphic design programs whatsoever. As such, we hired a couple people to work on our designs and Kickstarter graphics. However, when the bills for graphics design started to add up, we had to figure out a way to conserve money. Through this thing called the internet, we were able to teach ourselves well enough to make the majority of our graphics. Take a few hours to learn Illustrator and go for it \u2014 it\u2019s not that hard to learn the basics and it will save you a lot of money (and hopefully make you more during your campaign).\n\n*Plan Ahead*\n\nReach out to other game designers in your genre (feel free to contact us) to get a feeling for what worked and what didn\u2019t. From talking with other game designers, we found running the campaign would be really hectic. Hearing this, we decided to plan ahead and create a 30 day plan that outlined everything we were going to do from updates to media launches to social media posts. Although things got shifted around as time went on, we highly recommend doing this.\n\n\n*Build an Audience*\n\nCreate a fan base as early as possible. No, not the type of fan base that will follow you around and ask for your autograph. We\u2019re talking about family, friends, co-workers, and anyone else that will want to know more about your Kickstarter. These are the people that you will get a majority of your backing from the first couple of days. Make sure you get them in the loop by launching your social media campaign as soon as possible.\n\n\nCreate your Facebook page, post statuses to tell your friends, start asking people to like the page, etc. By doing this in advance, you are creating an audience of potential backers and people who want to see your project succeed. Your friends can\u2019t read your mind. You need to tell them you are working on a project. We did this by telling everybody and inviting them to like us on social media so they can keep up with the project. Then when the project was live, we personally asked these people to back our project.\n\n\nYou need to get over the awkwardness of asking people for money. You will realize very early on in your campaign that people are lazy and have a tendency to put things off. Even though your friends may plan to pledge, if you are not active enough you may lose out on getting support from some of your network. Passively posting something on social media is not enough. \n\n\nCan you remember the last time you browsed your Facebook feed? Most people will look at your project, probably click \u201cLike\u201d, maybe even leave a comment, and then move on to the next thing. Want these people to actually back your page? Ask them to.\n\n-------\n**The Kickstarter**\n\nIn terms of logistics, we decided to launch on a Monday and end on a Wednesday, spanning 30 days. We wouldn\u2019t recommend doing more than 30 days\u2014you\u2019ll either get burnt out or fired from your day job for checking your Kickstarter too much. If we could go back, we would\u2019ve changed our launch date to Tuesday or Wednesday, as those were our best days for traffic.\n\n\nKickstarter provides somewhat limited statistics. However, John Coveyou over at Genius Games used a web scraper to closely monitor Kickstarter pledging over the course of a month. The data he analyzed backs up that Tuesday really is the biggest funding day, so choose a campaign that will span the most Tuesdays possible. We\u2019d recommend reading all of the Kickstarter Stats 101 articles he posted.\n\n\n*Reviews, Media, and Promotion*\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard the phrase, \u201cbuild it and they will come.\u201d Unfortunately, for 99% of Kickstarter projects, this is not the full truth. You need to drive traffic to your page since Kickstarter will reward those projects that are getting a lot of attention. In addition to utilizing our personal networks, our strategy was to reach out to game reviewers and get as many independent reviews as we could.\n\n\nWe also reached out to two of our alma mater\u2019s newspaper, the University of Washington Daily. We got lucky that one of the editors happened to love party games and was happy to write a piece on us. A few days into the Kickstarter, a local Seattle radio station also messaged us asking if we\u2019d like to come on and do an interview. Despite being really cool, the effects on our Kickstarter campaign are hard to gauge. Judging from the Kickstarter stats, it appears that only a few backers came from the newspaper article and we can\u2019t track stats from the radio interview. However, these media outlets and reviews certainly added invaluable credibility to our campaign.\n\n\nBottom line: Get some reviews anyway you can.\n\n-------\n**The Results**\n\nThe 30 days were extremely hectic. Here\u2019s what the project looked like:\n\n\n[1st and 2nd Image](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XVjPI)\n\n[Kicktraq](http:\/\/www.kicktraq.com\/projects\/weekendwarriors\/intervention-a-party-game-for-everyones-worst-habi\/#chart-daily)\n\n\nAs you can see, we started out very strong, slowed down, and picked back up towards the end. If you research some Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll see this is a common theme. The first few days consisted of a lot of our closest friends and family backing our project sprinkled in with a few Kickstarter regulars. As mentioned before, our first day of the campaign was a Monday and the results were less than we expected. Because everyone is busy catching up with work on Mondays, it was hard to get a hold of a lot of our friends and backers that we built through our social media campaign.\n\n\nNevertheless, things really picked up Tuesday and Wednesday, as more of our friends were able to find some time and get their pledges in. Our social media presence was really picking up at this point, as well, because a ton of our friends started sharing our project on their own timelines. We also started to get more exposure within the Kickstarter community.  Overall, we got off to a decent start and things seemed pretty optimistic.\n\n\n*The Mid-Project Lull*\n\nBrace yourselves, the mid-project lull is coming. Unfortunately, most projects we\u2019ve seen go through this awful period. This is when your project is no longer new and fresh and you\u2019ve started to exhaust your personal networks. Our best advice is to be aware that this happens to most projects. Still, it is imperative that you keep your foot on the pedal. Your goal here is to keep the excitement level up for the project. You can do this by looping your backers in with updates, staying strong with your social media campaign, and pulling out any tricks up your sleeve. For example we added a cool voting and suggestion app to our website during this time.\n\n\n*The Final Countdown*\n\nAs you can see, things picked up the last 7-10 days of the project. As we neared our goal, the rate of new backers increased. The 48 hour e-mail, which gets sent to all the people who \u201cstarred\u201d your project, also helped a bit. More than anything, the people who thought about pledging but hadn\u2019t yet finally caved in and decided to get in on the action. This occurred with most projects we studied. This is when you absolutely must follow up with those in your network who said they were going to pledge, but just haven\u2019t gotten around to it. Personally message everyone.\n\n\n*Cross-Promotion*\n\nWe did one cross promotion with another project, Moral Dilemma. We received a few backers the day they sent the update out, but never really saw a consistent rise from it. In the end, we had nothing to lose so it was worth doing it, and we met some cool fellow game designers in the process.\n\n\n*Canceled Pledges*\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get worried if backers are canceling pledges. We had six canceled pledges and messaged each person asking if there was anything we could do better. Two replied back saying it was too close to Christmas time and they blew their budget. Three of them canceled after the project was funded. Bottom line, just know that some people will cancel their pledges\u2014don\u2019t stress over things you can\u2019t control.\n\n-------\n**Kickstarter\u2019s \u201cAlgorithm\u201d and Staff Pick**\n\n\nMuch has been publicized about Kickstarter\u2019s algorithm and Staff Pick designation. We\u2019ll start out with the thing that no one knows anything about, the Staff Pick. By getting selected as a Staff Pick, you will be featured in Kickstarter\u2019s magic algorithm and thus more easily noticed. There\u2019s been mixed reviews about whether getting a Staff Pick actually really helps or not. We don\u2019t have a clue because we never got selected. We tried to do everything we could to get picked including e-mailing Kickstarter, tweeting at them, and asking questions. The best answer we got was, \u201cwe\u2019ll be sure to check it out soon!\u201d We also analyzed a lot of the other projects that got the Staff Pick and our consensus was, WTF? Don\u2019t stress about getting Staff Pick \u2013 it\u2019s out of your control and might as well be chosen by a octopus that swims around hitting its tentacles on random projects.\n\n\nNow for the fun part: Kickstarter\u2019s popular section. When people refer to the \u201calgorithm,\u201d they mean getting high up on Kickstarter\u2019s popular page. Why is this important? Think about the last time you went to browse Kickstarter because you wanted to see what was cool. You probably clicked \u201cPopular Projects\u201d because you naturally thought that the best stuff was the stuff getting the most attention. Long story short, projects that are hot get more attention and backers; lose steam early and risk get buried on the popular page.\n\n\nIf you went, \u201cOh crap,\u201d don\u2019t worry\u2014we got sort of buried and we did fine.  But let\u2019s focus on not getting buried, by of course studying a project that did get buried. As a quick disclaimer, this is all in the interest of education and we\u2019re not trying to insult anyone\u2019s project. \n\n\n[3rd and 4th Image](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XVjPI)\n\n[Kicktraq](http:\/\/www.kicktraq.com\/projects\/1677242759\/moral-dilemma\/#chart-daily)\n\n\nThis is the chart for Moral Dilemma. If you go to their Kickstarter page, it seemed like they checked off all the boxes. Moderate goal, good graphics, good video\u2014what went wrong? Look at day one\u2014they only had 12 backers and never got more. They got buried and never recovered. They ended up raising only $5,000 CAD and failed to reach their goal of $7,500 CAD. So, why are analyzing this? They relaunched their project four days later. Here is the second projects chart as of 12\/17\/2014.\n\n\n[5th and 6th Image](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XVjPI)\n\n[Kicktraq](http:\/\/www.kicktraq.com\/projects\/1677242759\/moral-dilemma-0\/#chart-daily)\n\n\nWhat happened here? This is the same project that failed to reach $7,500. Nothing really changed. The page is more or less the same. The game is the same. So what was the difference? Again, look at day one\u2014this time around they had 90 backers. The next day they had 93. Through two days, their average backers per day were 91.5 compared to 7 the last time.  They got on the first page of popular projects for games, and never left.\n\n\nHow did they do so? One reason was that the creator sent a project update to the failed Kickstarter\u2019s backers on the day the new one launched with an \u201cEarly Bird\u201d special to pledge early. That was sent to 130 backers who previously backed the project and I imagine a lot of them pledged again. Another reason was that they lowered their funding goal to $1,000 from $7,500 and therefore was funded very early on. We don\u2019t know for sure how much this helps, but we do know that Intervention started to climb up the popular project charts after we were funded (although this may coincide with our project ending).\n\n\nSo let\u2019s summarize what we learned from our observations of the magic \u201calgorithm.\u201d It appears that the amount of backers per day is the most important factor, but there are a lot of other factors including percent funded and time left until the end of the project. So if you want to succeed, do your best to start out fast as hell and don\u2019t look back. Get everyone you can to pledge the first few days, and that will give you the best chance to get recognized.\n\n\nRemember what I mentioned about your friends and family being the most important part. This is where they come in. They are your best asset\u2014the ones who will back your project no matter how bad (or good) it is.\n\n-------\n**Post-Kickstarter**\n\nOne area that is often overlooked is what happens after the Kickstarter. Once the project ends, all your backers get an e-mail saying the project was a success and they will be charged. Your Amazon payments account will then start showing successful charges. What isn\u2019t usually publicized is that a lot of payments often get denied because of old (inactive) credit cards saved on Amazon accounts.\n\n\nAbout 5% of our backers ended up being denied. Kickstarter sends out an e-mail every couple of days to remind people to update their info and we were able to recover most of the funds, but at the time of the writing, we\u2019re still out a couple hundred dollars.\n\n-------\n**TL;DR**\n\nA Summary: Top Lessons Learned\nCreate a fan base. This is the most important thing you can do. Your friends, family, and internet friends will be the ones who power your Kickstarter to success.\n\n\nPersonally ask your friends and family to back your project. Get over the awkwardness of asking for money. You need them, and you would do it for them (hopefully).\n\n\nPlanning for the Kickstarter is just as, if not more, important than running the Kickstarter. Don\u2019t skimp on the details and plan for the worst.\n\n\nGet as many people as possible to back your project on the first few days. Do not wait for them to do it in the middle of the project\u2014it may be too late.\n\n\nLet me know if there's something else you'd like to elaborate on or would like an additional blog post.

Let me know, and I'll remove it.\n\nThis isn't an article, per se, I ordered some financial analysis from his website a while back, and he sends out mass emails periodically, offering his analysis of the \"music trades\" market. I read it, and wanted some objective opinions on his analysis. If he's correct, then the relatively near future of both companies will be very interesting to watch.\n\nFrom the email:\n\n&gt;THE CURRENT OPERATIONS of retail leaders Guitar Center and Amazon.com call to mind the old adage, \"unsustainable trends cannot be sustained.\" Guitar Center carries a debt burden that, absent some extraordinary event, it won't be able to repay. (Given the stock market's current lack of enthusiasm for brick-and-mortar retailing, a successful GC IPO would be \"extraordinary.\") Amazon has a decent balance sheet but operates without making a real profit. You don't have to be a CPA to recognize that these financials are \"sub-optimal\" and will need to be addressed at some point. These unsustainable situations are worth pondering, because the fixes that both companies adopt could have a significant impact on the music industry.\n\n&gt;Guitar Center continues to struggle in the aftermath of an ill-fated 2007 private equity buyout, when Bain Capital bought the company for $2.1 billion, loading it up with $1.6 billion in debt. The leverage was based on projections that Guitar Center's revenues would rise to $3.0 billion from $2.0 billion, and that \"better management discipline\" would increase profits at an even faster rate. Unfortunately, events in the form of the 2008 financial crisis rudely intervened, causing sales to flatline and profitability to slip. Absent the $1.6 billion in debt, the retailer would have easily been able to manage through the slow growth period. However, with annual interest payments of $160 million that were slightly above cash flow, the company was in a precarious position.\n\n&gt;Last March, Ares Management gave Guitar Center a reprieve with a complex debt for equity swap that effectively cut its interest expense by about $70 million and left Ares with a 60% ownership stake. The original Bain investors saw their stake wiped out. Since then, Guitar Center's finances are no longer publicly available, but there are indications that despite the lower interest costs, all is not well. A CEO was sacked due to a 33% decline in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), bonds that were issued in March at $100 now trade at a deep discount--$83 for the five-year secured bond, and $64 for the ten-year unsecured--suggesting that investors are nervous. Topping it off, the new CEO has cut corporate staff. Collectively, this is not the kind of news that suggests that rapid growth is in the offing.\n\n&gt;Absent the leverage, Guitar Center is still a viable business--think of it as a nice house with an underwater mortgage. The oft-published obituaries on brick-and-mortar are premature, and Guitar Center in particular still boasts viable locations and an organization rich in talent. To realize the potential of these assets, we suspect another round of \"financial engineering\" will probably be necessary. No one knows for sure how this would play out. The best hope is that bond and equity holders take another write-down and the trade creditors--which include most industry suppliers--are paid in full. The details of any reorganization are uncertain, but here's one thing you can bank on: Ares Management and the bond holders are out to maximize the value of their investment and have no sentimental attachment to the music industry. If it's a choice between sustaining industry health by protecting trade creditors or squeezing out an extra 1%, there's no question which course they'll choose.\n\n&gt;Over a two-decade span, Amazon has grown at a torrid pace, has been hugely disruptive, has invested heavily in plants and equipment, and yet has never been really profitable. The company posted losses in two of the past five years, and in its best year had a bottom line equal to a measly 0.5% of sales. This hasn't fazed growth-infatuated investors, who have given the company a stratospheric valuation. At a current quotation of $371 a share, Amazon is worth 163 times earnings, and 16 times book value. Wal-Mart, by contrast, fetches a comparatively earthbound 15 times earnings and 3.5 times book value.\n\n&gt;So what does this mean for suppliers and retailers in the music industry? Amazon's lofty stock price allows it to acquire companies and pay employees in stock rather than cash. Being able to use currency you create yourself, rather than having to rely on Uncle Sam's greenbacks, is a great cost saver that contributes to Amazon's cash flow. Investor patience is not unlimited though, and at some point a rich valuation will have to be supported by reasonable profits. To achieve a more substantial bottom line, will Amazon have to raise prices, charge more for its Prime Service, or adjust its shipping charges? We have no particular insights, especially given that Amazon, for a large public company, reveals very little about its operations. However, maintaining a rich stock price while running a profitless operation is ultimately an unsustainable proposition. It doesn't take a lot of courage to predict that something's got to give.\n\n&gt;A financially impaired Guitar Center and Amazon charging high prices are unthinkable, and we're not forecasting either now. However, in 125 years of chronicling the music industry, our columns have been filled with \"unthinkable events.\" That American piano manufacturing, the mainstay of the industry for close to a century, would vanish? Impossible. That the accordion market, which once dwarfed the guitar business, would shrink to insignificance within a few years after Buddy Holly? Few thought it possible. That Chicago Musical Instruments Company, the industry's biggest and best-run company from 1950 through 1970, would be just a dimly remembered footnote? Once inconceivable. Considering the unthinkable can be a useful planning exercise. Try it sometime.","128":"My largest expense are groceries and Amazon.

I have decided to revive and pivot a few ventures I started a few years ago.  Anytime I feel like coming here to \"kill time\" I'm going to instead force myself to tackle 1 item that will get me closer to my goal.  After a few weeks my hope is that the accumulated progress on the \"next actionable item\" will have caused me to have tremendous positive forward momentum.  I plan on writing up monthly progress topics for everyone to join me in my journey - just not during lent obviously.\n\nBasic idea:  I have several domain names that I purchased during a \"flash of genius\" that I had in college in early 2000.  At the time I viewed the web as the new wild west and I thought I should stake a claim wherever I could so I ended up with like 37 domains.    Over time some of them weren't worth keeping so I let them die but I still have around 20 decent domains.  A few years ago I actually tried making a couple of them into businesses but they didn't get very far (read: I ran out of money before they ran out of potential).  So I've decided to jump start them again over the next few weeks - 3 of them to be exact.  One will be an attempt at an Amazon Affiliate site.  One of them will be a niche site focused on a narrow topic that I'm really passionate about - monetized by affiliate links (but not Amazon).  And the final one will be a pivot of an authority site I had tried to build (it was in conjunction with a physical and eCommerce shop that I was running) - it will shed the store component (for now) and see if I can build a smaller authority site that will monetize from affiliate links, Amazon affiliate, direct advertising sales, and email capture.  \n\nI'm obviously testing a few ideas here but I'm not limiting myself on time (except the trade off between Reddit and working on them).  I will limit to free\/super low cost on everything I do and then I'll write it up as a case study series.\n\nAre these ideas over-played at this point or do you think there is some viability left?  Would this be something that readers here might be interested in?  Do you have any suggestions as I get started?\n\nSee you guys in a few weeks for the first installment.

I immediately thought it would be interesting to try out as a marketing channel. I\u2019ve never done a giveaway. Although multiple hosting companies have offered to give free plans if I advertise their services; which didn\u2019t seem ethical given what we do.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned.\n\n**What to Give Away?**\n\nThe first question is what product would correlate well with the service I\u2019m offering ([web hosting reviews](http:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/webhosting\/compare)). I looked at web hosting books and that was about the only thing related on web hosting on Amazon. But they looked terrible and I wouldn\u2019t want one, so why would my audience? So I had to get creative. I decided the easiest thing for me would be flash drives, a very common promotional item. Maybe I could spin a message about backing up your data (I honestly don\u2019t think the product selection and message was that good). I think the more tailored the giveaway is to your company the better. If you can giveaway your own product that would be the best.\n\n\n**How Amazon Giveaway Works**\n\nBasically, you just browse around Amazon looking for a product that says\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/setup-amazon-giveaway.png\n\nThen you choose how you want to run it. There are currently two options. One gives away X items to the first N people who click. The second option gives away X items to the Nth person to click. I think you would be crazy to use option 1 and I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s even an option. So I will pretend everyone is selecting to giveaway an item for every Nth person.\n\nThe second setting is whether it\u2019s free or you a visitor to follow you on Twitter. I think a Twitter follow should be the default setting. Otherwise you get nothing for your giveaway beyond people looking at the landing page. You have no idea who they are and have no means to contact them again otherwise.\n\nThen you pay for the X items you are giving away (plus shipping).\n\nThe giveaway lasts for one week and you get a refund at the end of any unspent money.\n\n**The Marketing**\n\nHow you market your giveaway probably has the biggest impact on how well it does. There\u2019s also probably a correlation with the quality of the giveaway and the targeting of it towards the audience you\u2019re after.\n\nOur giveaway did the minimal marketing effort. It was posted on [our Facebook](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ReviewSignal) page once. I also posted it on Twitter with the [#AmazonGiveaway](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23amazongiveaway&amp;src=typd) hashtag a few times. It was also posted to Reddit [\/r\/AmazonGiveaways](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/amazongiveaways\/). I didn\u2019t use any targeted distribution for my audience, so it was the lowest common denominator of marketing.\n\nHowever, I got really lucky and @[Amazon retweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReviewSignal\/status\/566078231002877952) me.\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/AmazonReviewSignal.png\n\nWhich caused this:\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/amazonRTeffect.png\n\nAnd this:\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/amazonRTanalytics.png\n\nSo lots of followers, but definitely no conversions.\n\n \n\n**The Results**\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/reviewsignal-giveaway.png\n\nI configured my giveaway to be every 500 people wins and I was willing to give 20 of them away. I only gave away 3 and was refunded $244.76.\n\nAmazon also emailed me some basic analytics (which I can\u2019t find on the dashboard)\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/giveaway-analytics.png\n\nSo the net result was **I spent $40.24 to get 1854 followers**. Of which, **444 unfollowed** me within that week. I started with 357 followers, and now have 1767. So roughly **24% of the followers I bought were worthless** and I only really got 1410 real new followers. So the total **cost per new follower was 2.8 cents.**\n\nI was hoping to get in early on a new product and had to guess about a lot of things without anything to go on. Marketing basics still should apply if you\u2019re doing a giveaway. You need to market it towards your audience and giveaway something that they are most likely to care about. You also can\u2019t expect great results just by doing the bare minimum. I think I got lucky because Amazon retweeted me (which was one of the hopes of jumping in early, getting early press). But it\u2019s nothing to bank on.\n\nIf I were going to do it again, I would do it very differently. I wouldn\u2019t bother with #AmazonGiveaway hashtag and create a landing page specifically for the purpose. I would highlight what I am giving away and also highlight what Review Signal does. I would probably try to capture an email address before giving someone a link to the giveaway. It\u2019s more of a barrier, but also would hopefully filter people most interested in my giveaway (which hopefully would be very targeted towards my audience).\n\n**TL;DR Lessons:**\n\n* Choose a product relevant to your company\/business\n* Market the giveaway in places where your audience\/customers are (not just tweeting #AmazonGiveaway)\n* Capturing Twitter followers is a mediocre reward, you should probably build some type of landing page to convert more users before they get the link to the giveaway\n \n\n**For the curious, some more analytics screenshots are below**\n\nThe full analytics from the Tweet Amazon RT\u2019d.\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/amazonRTfullanalytics.png\n\nWhat the whole engagement\/analytics looked like over the period from Twitter Analytics:\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/reviewsignaltwitteranalytics.png\n\nAmazon VS normal tweets with #AmazonGiveaway hashtag\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/reviewsignaltwitteranalyticsamazontweet.png\n\nWhat a normal non-giveaway tweet looked like:\n\nhttp:\/\/reviewsignal.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/reviewsignaltwitteranalyticsnonamazon.png","152":"Decided to finally get around to cleaning out, reorganizing, and labeling the spice rack yesterday.  Trouble... I wanted an electronic label maker to put clear and consistent labels on the spice jars (and we've wanted a label maker for a while).\n\nI found the model I wanted.  It was $60 at Office Max (just around the corner from my house) but it was $38 on Amazon.  Similar savings for the label tape cartridges ($10 instead of $25).  \n\nI was torn... I had the time and inspiration to tackle the project so I didn't want to wait 2 days for prime shipping.  But I didn't want to spend what would be an extra $50 for the label maker and the two cartridges.  \n\nI checked the office max (office depot) web site and they confirmed that they will price match Amazon (as long its sold by Amazon directly and not a 3rd party seller).  Looks like lots of brick-and-mortar stores will do this (home depot, etc.)\n\nI have the Amazon app on my phone and it allows you to scan the barcode on a physical item and it will automatically look it up for you on amazon.  No need to search and hunt for it and no worries that you've accidentally looked up the wrong product. \n\nSo, especially with the amazon app, I think it's always worth scanning a barcode to see if you're getting the best price.   \n\n**tl;dr used the amazon app to facilitate price matching at office max.  saved about $50 and got it same day.**\n\nEdit: few people have asked about the app.  It's just called \"Amazon App\" (not kindle or amazon video).  When using it, there is a little maginfying glass icon or a search bar.  When you get to that there is an option for \"Voice\" or \"Scan It\".  The \"Scan It\" option will read barcodes.  :-)\n\nEdit2: This isn't limited to the Phone\/App method.  You can also bring a printout from Amazon or a flyer\/circular from another store advertising a price.  You can also bring in a photo on your phone or printed out that shows a better price for that exact item at another store.  The Amazon phone\/app method is just so damn easy that I mentioned it specifically.  If they want to verify it they can always look it up online or call the other store or whatnot.","153":"I tried to use profit bandit, but I do not have a pro merchant account yet.

Also, to cut off potential remarks, I keep utilization on all my CCs under 10%; I just tend to be greedy when it comes to optimizing rewards.","165":"Hey guys,\n\nAfter posting [this one](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/beermoney\/comments\/2we9qg\/ridiculously_easy_25_in_under_30_minutes_from\/) I've had a tremendous amount of PMs asking if I know of any additional apps or websites which pays for simply downloading a free app on your mobile device.\n\nI've been earning money via app downloads, surveys and other GPT ventures for over a year so I thought instead of PM'ing everyone back one-by-one I would just re-post with some additional sites for paid to download app sites\/apps.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n1. **FusionCash** - **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/fca.sh\/1n9ix)** or [non-ref](http:\/\/www.fusioncash.net\/) \n\nThis was posted in my original thread you can find all of the information [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/beermoney\/comments\/2we9qg\/ridiculously_easy_25_in_under_30_minutes_from\/).\n\n**Details:**\n\n- $5.00 signup bonus for new users\n- Get paid $0.50 per download and there is no limit to how much you can earn\n- There are approximately 10-20 apps each day and new ones are offered each day for you \n- Available for both iPhone and Android\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Only open to US and Canadian residents\n- Must be over 18 or have parental permission\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Payment is only made via Verified Paypal\n- Minimum of $25.00 per payout request ($15.00 of which is earned and not bonuses from referrals and such)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n2. **Appsdown**- **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/apd.me\/YrTfg) unique code is YrTfg during signup** or [non-ref](https:\/\/appdown.me\/) \n\n**Details:**\n\n- Available on both iPhone and Android\n- Approximately 30 apps to download when you first register\n- New\/different apps each day so be sure to check back every day for new apps\n- Pays from $0.05 - $1.00 per app downloaded\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Must be over 13 years old\n- Open worldwide!\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Payments are made as little as $2.00\n- Huge variety of payout options: Paypal, eBay, Amazon, restaurants, electronics, microsoft points, paid app downloads...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n3. **Featurepoints** - **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/featu.re\/5YASEH) unique code is 5YASEH during signup** or [non-ref](http:\/\/featurepoints.com\/web\/) \n\n**Details:**\n\n- 50 point bonus when signing up with a referral code (mine is 5YASEH) :D\n- Available on both iPhone and Android\n- Downloads and nice and simple app on your phone which shows all the available apps, rewards, info...\n- New\/different apps each day so be sure to check back every day for new apps\n- Pays from $0.05 - $1.50 per app downloaded\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Must be over 13 years old\n- Open worldwide!\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Tons of different reward options starting at only 200 points (one download) which is a paid app download!\n- Never have to pay for apps again\n- Also offers Paypal, Xbox, PSN, Amazon, restaurant cards, electronics, Steam and so on\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n**HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET CREDIT!**\nA lot of times I noticed I was not getting credit because I did not realize what was being done to actual credit me so here are some tips:\n\n- You must download and OPEN the app on ALL sites in order to get credit\n- Some sites require the users to keep the app open for ~30 seconds or finish the tutorials so read the requirements of each app!\n- Do not switch networks! Be sure that if you DOWNLOAD the app through Wi-Fi you stay on that Wi-Fi to open\/play the app.\n- Do not delete the app until you are credited! Some apps can take up to a day to credit as the confirmation needs to come from the game developer. Do not remove the app from your phone until you receive credit or else you run the risk of not getting credit for the game ever.\n- If downloading on multiple devices to gain double credit or use multiple sites: use a separate Apple or Android account (as well as gamecenter) so it can not link your two devices together.\n\n**Other possible ways to earn**\n\n- On sites like FusionCash that offers unlimited downloads per app some people have mentioned certain applications which allow you to download apps on PC which could potentially earn you double or triple (depending on devices and such)\n- It is possible on some sites like FusionCash to remove the app, use a new Apple\/Android account and redownload to get credit again. (This can technically be done an endless amount of times) But this runs the risk of possibly being banned so I do not encourage this.\n- Utilize your old devices you may have lying around the house and download all the apps from all the sites!\n\nI hope this information has helped out - please feel free to ask me any questions you might have!","166":"[H]Paypal [W] Amazon @ 85%","167":"Hey yall.

I\u2019m both a writer (I\u2019ve written three #1 NY Times Best Sellers) and an entrepreneur (I started and exited a publishing company that established the current model for many very successful authors, like Hugh Howey\u2019s deal with Simon &amp; Schuster).\n \nBecause of these two facts, I get some version of this question on a nearly daily basis, and I have a canned answer to quickly get out of these conversations.\n \nI tell people that sitting down to write is not an optional part of the book creation process\u2014in fact, it\u2019s the very point of the process\u2014and that they can\u2019t have something (a book) without doing the work necessary to create it (write it).\n \nI usually say it in a disdainful tone, sneering at the laziness of people who presume that books are something they can just \u201cget\u201d without having to do the hard work. I often throw in some version of the \u201ceveryone wants to be a star, but no one wants to do the work\u201d quote that Mark Cuban made famous.\n \n**Melissa Gonzalez, the entrepreneur who asked me the question, was different.**  And this was not just some dinner. This was an LDV Entrepreneur Dinner (LDV is an invite-only organization run by Evan Nisselson, that brings together successful entrepreneurs with the stated intent of helping each other).\n \nNonetheless, fully bathing in my writer\u2019s arrogance, I gave her my usual canned speech about \u201chard work\u201d and \u201cthe difficult process being part of the work.\u201d When she rolled her eyes at me, I wondered what I had said that was so bad.\n \nShe stopped me and reframed her question:\n \n**Melissa**\n&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re an entrepreneur, right?\u201d\n \n**Tucker**\n&gt;\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d\n \n**Melissa**\n&gt;\u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur too, and the most important thing I do is solve problems. Can you solve my problem, or just lecture me about hard work?\u201d\n \n**This was a straight up call out\u2026and she was exactly right.**\n \nI was not talking to some schmoe. This woman knew those lessons\u2014she\u2019d built her own successful business, in an extremely competitive field (retail). Here I was at dinner with 30+ entrepreneurs who are all more successful than me, and I was lecturing one of them about hard work, instead of thinking of a way to solve her problem.\n \n##I have seen the embarrassed amateur in the room, and he is me.\n \nI was too flustered to brainstorm a solution in the moment, so I told her that I would think about it, and get in touch.\n \nBecause I got called out\u2014and I was so clearly, embarrassingly wrong\u2014I ended up obsessing over her problem for weeks. Which of course got me nowhere. Finding ways to make the publishing process easy is doable, but all I kept coming back to was the fact that there was no way to write a book without putting in the time to write it. The writing is part of the process, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called WRITING a book.\n \nI eventually gave up on finding a solution, and a few days later\u2014after I\u2019d stopped thinking about it, of course\u2014the solution hit me, like a lightning strike:\n \n##Is writing really a necessary part of creating books? What if you eliminated writing from the book creation process, what would that look like?\n \nI started unpacking all of this in my head with a little one-man Socratic method:\n \n**Q. What is a book?**\n \nA. *A book is just a collection of thoughts that are expressed in words, and assembled in the form of a finite, defined text.*\n \n**Q. What purpose do books serve?**\n \n**A.** *Books\u2014especially non-fiction books\u2014exist to take a singular, contained idea out of the head of the author, and put it into the head of readers.*\n \n**Q. What part does writing play in this?**\n \n**A.** *Writing thoughts down in words and sentences is the process by which the ideas are put into books.*\n \n**Q. Are there other ways to get ideas into books?**\n \n**A.** *If books exist to transfer ideas from one head to another, AND writing is the way by which people commit their ideas to words to put into books\u2014is there another way to get those thoughts into a book, without writing? How would that happen? Of course there is\u2014talking!!*\n \n**Q. What if I eliminated writing in favor of talking?**\n \n**A.** *If I can find a way for her to talk about her ideas, instead of write her ideas down, could I then give her a finished book? Can Melissa just talk about her ideas instead of writing them down? Of course she can!*\n \n##I refined the idea in my head, and then called Melissa:\n \n**Tucker**\n&gt;\u201cWhat if I told you that I can take you from idea, to a professionally published, completely finished book for sale on Amazon and everywhere else, in about 12 hours of your time\u2014and all you have to do is talk.\u201d\n \n**Melissa**\n&gt;\u201cI\u2019d say that sounds great, and I want to do it.\u201d\n \nThe problem was that I didn\u2019t really have a precise process to do this and, quite honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure this was going to work. But like Melissa said, **this is what entrepreneurship is about: solving problems that give people what they want.**\n \nSo I connected Melissa with a former employee of mine, Zach Obront, and the three of us decided to collaborate on this project, to test it and see what would happen. Here\u2019s the basic step-by-step process we came up with:\n \n1. **Form a book outline:** Zach did a few phone calls with Melissa, helped her clarify her book idea and figure out exactly what she wanted to say in her book. From these conversations, he wrote an outline for the book.\n2. **Interview her for the content:** Zach then scheduled four two-hour calls with Melissa, where he \u201cinterviewed\u201d her, using the outline as a guide. He asked her questions until he got all of what she wanted to say, in her words, onto an audio recording.\n3. **Transcribe the recordings:** He used Speechpad to transcribe the recordings into a text.\n4. **\u201cTranslate\u201d the transcription to a book manuscript:** If you have ever seen a raw audio transcription, you know they are basically unreadable. So we took the transcription and had an editor \u201ctranslate\u201d it from spoken word to readable book prose. They basically took Melissa\u2019s spoken words and ideas, and made them flow as written sentences and paragraphs.\n5. **Did some content\/copy edits:** Melissa took some time to go over the content and make sure it reflected her thoughts and vision for the book. There was some back and forth getting the edits and voice right, since this was the first time doing this and we were still figuring out the process. And of course, we made sure it had no spelling or grammar errors.\n6. **Designed a cover:** Because Melissa has an amazing aesthetic, the cover had to look great. This was not a job for 99 Designs. We worked with a world class cover designer (Erin Tyler) to get Melissa a cool cover that looked great and she was proud of.\n7. **Did the rest of the professional publishing minutiae:** There are a million little things that make the difference between a professional book and a clearly self-published amateur book; internal layout, marketing, blurbs, copyright page, etc. We made sure all of this was perfect.\n8. **Published the book:** Her book, Pop-Up Paradigm, is now up for sale.\nOwnership: Also, we did the deal such that Melissa owns all the royalties and all the rights to her book. She paid for a service, so unlike with regular publishers, she gets all the credit and all the upside. It\u2019s her book, her credit, her money.\n \nStart to finish, the whole process took about 5 months. As we were working through this process, I told a few people I know about this idea, and all of them loved the idea, said I should do this as a company, and they wanted the same service.\n \n##Yeah, yeah, everyone *loves* every start-up idea until it comes time to pay right?\n \n**Except two of them bought packages. Like\u2026with real money\u2026during the call.**\n \nA few weeks later, I went on a podcast to talk about a whole different subject. During that podcast, I talked about this idea for 20 minutes, sort of by accident. Off of that single episode, we sold four more packages, which meant six packages sold before we even confirmed to ourselves that we would offer this as a service to customers.\n \n###When you are selling a product before you even formally offer it to customers, you\u2019re onto something. **That is pretty much the definition of product-market fit.**\n \nZach and I decided to call the company \u201c[Book In A Box](http:\/\/www.bookinabox.com)\u201d and officially started offering the services to customers in August 2014.\n \n###**In the next two months , we did more than 200k in revenue.**\n \nI had a different publishing services company, and some other side projects I was working on, and I have shelved all of that. Now we focus on Book In A Box full time.\n \nWhat\u2019s really cool, at least to me, is how excited I am about this company. Not just because it\u2019s making money.\n \nYes, money is great, but in this case the money is only the proof of what matters in a new start-up idea: **that you are creating real value for real people, by solving their real problems.**\n \nIt appears that Book In A Box does just that\u2014a lot of people really want a book, but they don\u2019t have the time, ability, or patience to do it the conventional way. We solve their problem.\n \nNot only do we solve their problem, we do it in way that is easier and cheaper than anything else they can do. Take ghostwriting for example. To hire a ghostwriter, you\u2019re going to pay at least 40k (and usually much more for a good one).\n \nYou have no guarantees of quality or process with them, and they don\u2019t do anything but help you write the book manuscript\u2014no publishing, no marketing, nothing.\n \nYou have to pay for that separately, from a different company. Our packages range from 15k to 25k\u2014and we do everything necessary to create a professionally published book, with no work from the author aside from talking.\n \nBut as great as this is, you know what my overwhelming emotion is right now, even more than being excited?\n \n##**I feel embarrassed.**\n \nI feel embarrassed because people have been asking the question \u201cHow do I get a book\u201d for almost a decade, and my answer that whole time has been some version of elitist sneering at their lack of work ethic.\n \n**I wasn\u2019t thinking like an entrepreneur, I was thinking like the type of person I always claim to hate\u2014the one who says the status quo is the only way, that you have to do it \u201cthe way it\u2019s always been done.\u201d**\n \nIt\u2019s really embarrassing, at least to me, that it took me this long to see what has been right in front of my face for years. The technology existed to do this from the first day I was asked that question, almost a decade ago, and I was too arrogant and fixed in my notions of what a \u201cwriter\u201d had to be in order to see it.\n \nBut I guess that\u2019s the benefit of being around the type of women and men you meet at the LDV dinners (or any good entrepreneurial event with good people)\u2014smart people help you see your own biases and weaknesses, so you can fix them.\n \n**And if you fix your own problem, chances are lots of other people have that same problem, and if you can fix their problem the same way you fixed yours, you provide real value to the world\u2026and that is the best place to start a business.**","215":"Hello, I posted a couple days ago but didn't respond quickly to peoples offers due to some computer problems.

The really slim margins that you get out of promoting Amazon mean that trying to do something like paid traffic is out of the question. Trying to do an online business and just relying on SEO and organic social media is difficult (not impossible, people do make it work)\n\nNote: I'm not saying the amazon affiliate program is bad or that you shouldn't do it. All I'm saying is if you want to get into affiliate marketing there are other programs that you should at least consider over amazon\n\n**Great Affiliate Marketing Programs:**\n\n* Aweber.com - email marketing autoresponder 33% commissions every month\n* Leadpages.net - landing page builder 33% commissions every month\n* Shopify affiliate program - up to $358 per referral and 20% of their monthly bill\n* Bluehost - web hosting affiliate program $65 per referral\n\n**The goldmine of affiliate marketing: Clickbank**\n\nNow the above things are mainly aimed at business owners, but what if you want to promote things to say people interested in fitness, weight loss, healthcare, dog training, cooking, knitting, gaming, videos etc.\n\nClickbank is basically the affiliate marketing platform which is home to all these. \n\nLet's take 3 of the above as examples:\n\n* Fitness\nHere is an example from Clickbank, www.adonisgoldenratio.com\/welcome.php you get 75% for every sale you refer ($45 product)\n* Video\nFor people interested in making videos, you could promote www.easywebinar.com which gives you 35% of every sale (average $141) or www.easyvideosuite.com which gives you 50% commissions and their average sale is $514!!\n* Gaming\nFor people who play Fifa you can promote them a software called www.futmillionaire.com which has an average sales value of $57 and you get 75% commissions\n\nThere's products and services in literally every niche that you can find to promote on Clickbank.\n\nI'm not saying to promote these specific things or necessarily to even promote from Clickbank (for example I prefer to promote only software that helps people, automates things etc. and provides a \"tangible\" value as in it will actually do something for them. Clickbank has A LOT of crap on it so you can't just choose to promote any random product you see on there)\n\nThe point I'm making is - do your research, look out for things other than Amazon and you could potentially make a lot more money because:\n\n* Commission rates are higher\n* You can afford to invest in marketing since you actually get paid more etc.\n\n**Biggest mistake that amazon affiliate marketers make**\n\nThis is actually the biggest mistake that all affiliate marketers make, not exclusive to Amazon. \nIf you are not building an email list, you're wasting your time.\nYou need to provide REAL VALUE to the traffic that comes to your audience and you need to capture them as leads.\nYou need to get them onto your email list!\n\nThe vast majority of people will NOT buy when they first land on your website, but if you can generate them as a lead (get their email by giving something in return eg. free trial, free ebook, book, video)\nyou can continue to email them to provide free content and to promote to them. That's how you continue to get people coming back to your site.\n\n==\n\nMuch longer than I intended to be and was a bit of a rambling rant I guess, but I hope some people find this helpful!","240":"I'm sure there are a lot of products not yet available on Amazon but is there any benefit to being the first person to offer certain products?\nThe products are available on 3 or 4 other websites and I'm pretty confident I could get a pretty sizable market share by selling through Amazon.\nWould Fulfilled By Amazon be the best way to execute it?

I carry no CC balances whatsoever. The only thing I charge to it is my 55 a month cell phone bill to get the free insurance and it is paid off in full. I have a total 3 CC's all with roughly 4,000 in Credit. Wf Platinum Card with cashback, Citicard w\/ cashback and Amazon card for amazon Points. I rent from my parents at a value price of 350 a month. The only real debt I carry is student loans ($32,000) which for now are only having minumums paid until my emergency fund reaches 8,000. (currently at 4600) After that its all going to student loans... My goal is to churn enough points to fly to china, indonesia and elsewhere to establish partnerships to start my own business here in the states w\/ manufacturing.  So i'd like to minimize the expenses and up the frequency that i'm traveling out there for work.  My current credit score is around 766-770.  My monthly expenditures are around 1200 to 1500 between bills and various other things. So, am I good candidate for churning?  My main concerns are:\n\n1. My Student loan balance\n2. Am I spending nearly enough every month to generate points\n3. Is my pay grade too low to churn\n\n\nI appreciate any advice you guys have to offer on how to accomplish these goals.

I've used the card at many other places (including Amex Serve loads) and have put about $1500 on the card so far total. Today, I went to a Winn-Dixie to try and purchase a $500 VGC, which the CSR had no trouble with. When I slid the card, it said \"not authorized.\" I tried again, same thing.\n\nSo I called Chase to tell them it was me making the purchases and that I would be attempting the purchase again. The CSR lifted the fraud alert. I used the card again for something else, then went to another Winn-Dixie and tried to buy a $500 VGC and also a $100 Amazon GC. Same shit, Not authorized. Instead of trying to swipe again I called Chase Fraud Services, went through the whole security check BS (he gave me a hard time about it being 605.95 instead of 505.95 the first time), but got the card cleared again. Now, I'm weary to even attempt this again. Has anyone else experienced this kind of problem @ Winn-Dixie\/anywhere else with their Chase card?

I started selling my product about less than a year ago and have had steady and continuous growth over the year. \n\nDecember of 2014 was great, and going into 2015 we have somewhat exploded and sales been out the door. On Amazon we average roughly $800-$1200 daily. \n\nAfter ALL fees, cost of goods sold (FBA fees, shipping fees etc..), my profit is roughly 50% of what is shown in the sales figures. So in the last 7 days I did $12k in sales, $6k is profit\/can go in my pocket. \n\nUp to this point, I haven't spent a dime on advertisement and relied pretty much on word-of-mouth, and if the sales projections hold I am expecting to do around $350k+ by the end of the year (not including new products I plan to introduce later this year).  \n\nThis is obviously making more money than my $60k per year job which I dread.\n\nMy question is, do you think it is time for me to leave my job and just focus on my business efforts?\n\nHow do you determine how much to pay yourself, and how much to reinvest back into the business?\n\nDo you guys think my business is doing well, or am I going crazy?","269":"[Rep](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2qxqhn\/umslarvox_gcx_rep_profile\/) Enough rep to be confirmed btw -poke- mods. =x \n\nIf you are confirmed or higher I will go first no problem.

I'm 25 and graduated in August, so my loan deferment period ends next month and I'm required to begin paying. Luckily, I'm gainfully employed and will be able to pay much more than the minimum monthly payment. \n\n1. FedLoan 1 - $10,460.11 - 6.16% interest\n2. FedLoan 2 - $10,704.77 - 5.16% interest\n3. FedLoan 3 - $11,286.17 - 5.16% interest\n\nTotal Loans: *$32,451.05*\n\nCurrently I'm a 1099 contractor on salary for $96,000 per year, or $8,000 per month. Based on this salary, I set aside $2,000 per month for estimated taxes, leaving me $6,000 monthly after taxes.\n\nMy bills are as follows:  \n* Rent - $1155  \n* Cable\/Internet - $110  \n* Gym - $40  \n* Power - $35  \n* Renter's Insurance - $10  \n\nTotal Bills: *$1,350.00* per month (I'm planning to move in June and my total bills should drop to roughly $750.00 per month. This is being taken into consideration).\n\nObviously I'll need money to eat and live on, so I set myself a very reasonable budget of $500 per week, or $2,000 per month. This will be for anything that needs to be paid for (food, clothes, travel, gas, anything). I walk to work and can walk home to eat for lunch, but I eat out for lunch a couple times per week. Dinner is usually cooked at home during the week, but I dine out on the weekends. \n\nThis gives:\n\n$8,000 (Monthly take home) -$2,000 (Taxes) =$6,000 (After taxes)\n\n$6,000 (After taxes) -$1,350 (Bills) =$4,650 (After bills)\n\n$4,650 (After bills) - $2,000 (Monthly allowance) = $2,650 (remaining)\n\nSo we can see how 2015 pans out:\n\n\n\nMonth | Liquid Cash for Loan Payoff | Month Ending Loan Balance\n-----|---------------|---------------\nMarch | $2,650 | FedLoan1 - $7,810.11\nApril | $2,650 | FedLoan1 - $5,160.11\nMay | $2,650 | FedLoan1 - $2,510.11\nJune | $3,050 | FedLoan1 - Paid Off \/ FedLoan2 - $10,164.88\nJuly | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - $6,914.88\nAugust | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - $3,664.88\nSeptember | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - $414.88\nOctober | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - Paid Off \/ FedLoan3 - $8,451.05\nNovember | $3,250 | FedLoan3 - $5,201.05\nDecember | $3,250 | $1,951.05\nJanuary '16 | $3,250 | FedLoan 3 - Paid Off\n \nIdeally this gives me a January 15th, 2016 pay-off date for my loans, which would be a huge accomplishment for me (then comes saving for a house..).\n\nMy biggest problem with spending money is shopping on Amazon and frivolously spending money at bars\/concerts when out drinking. I'm working to reign these habits in, as they only seem to have gotten worse the more money I bring home. I'm hoping that setting a budget with a well-defined goal will help, as this is the first time I've set a stringent budget (even though it's not strict in comparison to a lot of penny pinchers on here). My thoughts are that since I'm \"paying off\" instead of \"setting away\" money in a savings account that I'll get into the habit of considering my paychecks as already set aside, and not for spending.\n\nSorry for the long read! I appreciate any advice, thoughts, concerns, or additional considerations I should be taking. Please let me know anything I could be doing better\/differently. \n\nDisclaimer: I know that the interest will cause the loans to fluctuate and change the calculations, but it shouldn't be too significant in just one year. Also, I know there isn't noted additional savings (emergency, IRA, or otherwise) on here. I already have a 3 month emergency fund, and due to my family financial situation it isn't imperative that I'm contributing to a retirement fund (I have a small one from a previous company, but I'm just trying to kill these student loans).","272":"[WTB] $92 Amazon.CA (HAS TO BE CANADIAN) Giftcard [H] PayPal.","273":"I'm 27 with a base salary of $40,500 but I pick up overtime regularly which is about $7,000 extra per year. \n\nI started this job in March 2013 and I have $11,760 in my 401K plan so far.

I didnt want to write something like that as I think most of its bull shit or luck. I have never been known for my luck. In fact I once rolled the worst possible roll in a game of Risk 10 rolls in a row. The mathematical probability of getting hit by lighting or something like that. Anyways to the story.\n\nIn 2004 I was playing an excess amount of World of Warcraft and had a good time doing it. So much that I decided I wanted to pay for some gold. I found some website and started the conversation with the support guy who seemed friendly.  I payed for the service and asked him how much money he made. He told me not much and that sales were down. I decided that I would offer to make him a new website as I was getting better at websites and figured I had some free time. I expected nothing back from him, just was glad to help someone out. I dont think he believed I would do it but I did. I shower him what I made and he was impressed. He showed his boss and the guy didnt care. I received a message from the support guy saying that he would quite his job and buy computers and get a team of people going if I made him another website. I said sure and he followed through. \n\nIn the first month I made double my pay check. The second month more and after that more and more until Blizzards started to attack our business.  We were breaking the rules after all. I ended up giving all my money for a few years to my new business partner so he could live, as it wasnt a lot for me but was enough for him. \n\nA few years went by and he and I started to work on additional projects together. He had started to work with a wholesale site in Asia and learned about shipping, marketing,  and products. I made him another website and we started to sell products on Amazon. \n\nThe new business was great. He would have direct communication with the manufactures who would let him sell all their inventory and we could negotiate prices as he had already built relationships.  He also was skilled in quality control and customer service. \n\nWe started of selling about 5 to 10 products a day and in about 2 months time were up to 40 to 50. After about 4 months we were up to 100+. We started to look at gaining additional help and found a location to use for warehouse space. Any money I made I gave back to him so we could buy more inventory.  I didnt need the money as my main job supported me. Then all things went to hell. \n\nAmazon had a shipping error due to how we updated our shipping times. It changed it twice in one week which caused about 200 people tp not get their items on time. It caused our rating to drop and sales to also drop. Amazon also flagged a image of ours and wouldnt tell us what image it was of our 2000 plus products. They eventually suspended my account even after I wrote them, called them, and had numerous support tickets to get help. They just didnt care and I was left working as fast as I could to save our new business. \n\nI ended up finding the image. I fixed the issues with the shipping times. I refunded as many people as possible and expressed honesty with our customers, most didnt care and still gave us bad remarks even after full refunds. Our sales were back to 5 a day.\n\nI started to look into retail sales as I found that Amazon being my primary way of making money was not going to cut it. I asked my friends what they would want to sell. They had good ideas and I started up two additional businesses with them. One is doing well and the other is on hold due to the amount of time I have to invest now. Over time our Amazon account has grown up and we are now back to 60 to 100 sales a day. We are expanding into new markets and excited about the future. We grossed over 100k in sales last year and expect to double that conservatively this year. \n\nThe things I have learned about business is that even with little success its still satisfying.  Its not easy and every day is a battle. That its important to diversify your options and to now grow too fast that you fail, or to start up something that cost too much. To trust others a little bit and to get good business partners.\n\nI have loved business and making and selling products since I was 10 years old. I never will stop and one day I believe I will look back and say that I am not wealthy or successful because of my product or service, but because I learned from my mistakes, my mistakes were not large enough to kill me, and I have people I trust and love who are my business partners.  \n\nSo thats my short story and I wish you all good luck.\n\nSorry for grammer and spelling as im on my phone. \n\nTltr: trust, risk take, dont gve up, and ecpect to fail over and over again. \n\n**Edited for correct World of Warcraft date and some spelling errors.","293":"I'm looking to trade $42.50 paypal for a $50 gift card to Amazon US.

But assume that a bubble pops for a company like Amazon. The company becomes more prone to outside influence in the case of hostile takeover.

I believe that by optimizing each separate store for each niche it stands a better chance of being noticed. \n\nWhat you'll need to do is figure out how to streamline your back end and automate all your admin tasks so you can concentrate on customer service and marketing rather than product data. Otherwise you won't be able to stay on top of your stores once they launch.  ","336":"I would start by cleansing the list as mentioned below. You can use an email service like Aweber and upload your entire list there. Next email the entire list with a re-introduction. You'll get a bunch of defunct emails and opt-outs.\n\nNext sign up as an affiliate with Amazon and the start picking great products to promote on your list. Ideally you would write a blog post each week about each product and then email the list directing to the blog post.\n\nDM me if you have any questions.\n\n~Sean","337":"It depends on where you go. \n\nThe small border town closest to me has a liquidation store where clothes, household items, tools, and really random stuff can be found at a good discount. My mother in-law brings back name-brand clothes (example: Polo, Nike, Adidas) for prices like $2.99 for a t-shirt. Last week she 'almost' bought a stroller\/carseat system for $69. When I looked it up online it's $112 at WalMart. \n\nIn bigger cities they have other outlet\/markdown stores that also have fairly competitive prices for clothes. TJMaxx, Burlington Coat Factory, Marshalls, and Kohl's. You might even find an \"outlet\" mall - but know your prices before you go in there because some items in an outlet store are NOT a good deal.\n\nSometimes good deals can be found at regular stores (Target, WalMart etc.) but again: you need to know your prices.\n\nSome food items are cheaper in the US, like milk and meat, but personally I worry about US food standards so I don't bother.\n\nBooze is cheaper - at least here in NB. I think the provinces set tax rates on booze so YMMV. Here a bottle of whisky can cost double what it does just over the border. Oh, but you can't bring a lot of booze back at one time. \n\nGas is cheaper. We usually gas up at the nearest station to the border crossing. \n\nNow keep in mind that just because something is cheaper doesn't mean that you need it. My mother in-law is bad for buying too much stuff because she \"can't pass up a deal like that\". We ended up with six snowsuits for our growing toddler one year. We used maybe two? I get wrapped up in the shopping frenzy too sometimes, so I have to be extra diligent. Know what you need, know what it costs in Canada, shop with a budget. \n\nOh and personally I like shopping in the USA more for the selection than the prices. If I want something obscure I can usually find it on Amazon and have it shipped to a shop in my nearest border town then pick it up at my convenience for a few bucks a parcel. ","338":"I keep seeing that treehouse builder set at Walmart, price is at $20 now and going for $35 on Amazon, my worry is 10000 other people had the same idea and the FBA warehouse is flooded with these things. ","339":"I use a credit card with cashback to buy Amazon giftcards at safeway to get $1 off each gallon of gas (so $16 per tank) plus the cashback.\n\n","340":"If you shop on Amazon you should get Amazon gift certificates. they're worth more. ","341":"Never subscribed to one, but still open to it pending an item is selling like crazy. \n\nI've always had luck with sporting goods. Look for online coupons, codes, or simple sales. Def helps for the retail company to offer free shipping. It helps to keep a google docs spreadsheet and save their links. At first I had about 50+ items that expired before selling. After 1 failed sale, from not keeping my prices updated, you learn real fast after having to cancel an order. So keep an eye out for when those sales end, and with Amazon you can have it end on a specific date. \n\nI do dropshipping and know a few companies that will not put in the receipt. It doesn't hurt to make a phone call or enter in custom request while ordering. But once had a customer get mad at me after he found out where I got my item from. I didn't acknowledge his return request. It's not my main source but it's super easy. When I dropship I average about $30 per item. Usually it's $70, I sell it for $99, give a take a few. But to do that once a week, that's $120. But you have to front the money and usually wait until the 1st or 15th of every month to get your payback from Amazon. \n\nThere are many things that go wrong with dropshipping, but there are a few measures to protect yourself. But there are cons to every sales method or avenue. \n\nPersonally I don't believe in paying $200, and then *hoping* to sell it at a later date. I don't really want boxes of shit in my house, laying around and having to adjust prices weeks later on an item I realize won't sell. I consider myself an \"insecure seller\" because I won't commit to it unless I get a buyer first. \n\nOverall: confirm total price, know the end sale dates (or else you have a buyer but you don't have the same deal through store), be open to in-store only items in your area and then shipping yourself. ","342":"Go to Amazon Affiliates and sign up. When you email stuff, send it through your affiliate link. People love Amazon, you don't look spammy, and you make great commissions. ","343":"I used to do this, although there wasn't a Safeway gas station near me so I would only get $.20\/gallon at Chevron.\n\n1.

Use AmEx plus Safeway gas rewards to buy gas at Chevron ($.20 off per gallon, 3% cash back)\n3. Use Amazon gift cards to buy items in bulk via Subscribe and Save\n\nI earned roughly $25\/month in cash back from my card using that system.

I don't know how much I need to rack up the points like that though. I do it because I'm going to drink a can of soda a day anyway, so I may as well get rewarded for it. Also, things like YogurtLand, Subway, CVS type rewards too. It's free money.\n\nI love free stuff like shirts(more rags to clean up with!) and movie tickets. I am hooked on Amazon for shopping so that's why I use the points for that. I try my best not to go shopping and waiting in line.  Plus, presents in the mail every week.

Don't put much on it, but I shop at REI enough for it to be worth it.\n\nAside from the Arrival+, none of these have annual fees, all on autopay, so it doesn't take much to keep up with them.

Stopped using it for awhile and created a new account. On the new account listed like 4-5 items for sale to get back into it and within seconds of the auctions ending, eBay pulled all the listings and suspended my account and was told to get ahold of them. Called them and they explained to me they do this to all new sellers..doesn't make sense to me as a business to do that but ok..got irritated because of that and left a bad taste in my mouth. Later on I tried again to list different items that are hot right now and my listings wouldn't even show up on their page for hours and hours and when it finally did it was only one listing. Years ago it was a breeze to use, now it's like they don't even want me on there selling. \n\nAmazon compared to the eBay I experienced this time around is a breeze to use.

Prices would change super often on the items we bought (Amazon changes 2.5 million per day - qz.com\/157828\/). It seemed like we never could really get the best price, and we felt outmatched by stores that had millions of algorithms to dynamically adjust prices against us. We wanted to even the odds.\n\nWhat we figured out (and ultimately pushed us to start on the project) is that stores often guarantee that you will get the lowest prices. They even promise to price match. But it's mostly marketing on their end -- they don\u2019t follow through unless you work way too hard for it (check prices frequently, deal with claims\/customer service, etc. -- all huge deterrents). And so we wanted to build something that would do this work -- when you are owed money due to a low price guarantee, Paribus would automatically gets it for you.\n\nThe thinking behind a % portion model is that it matches our interests -- we don't get anything unless you do. The range we're considering makes sure that you get multiples of whatever the success portion we'd request would be (the significant majority of the savings should go to you, but we also want to earn enough to keep us going and building). We'll give a heads up well in advance of when we do start collecting a success portion, and you'll be able to opt out if you'd rather not continue past the early beta.\n\nHope that gives some helpful context.","423":"Thanks for the list.

Do this for any big purchases you need to make, including a new computer.","454":"Coinstar\/Amazon, every time. Amazon has so much variety and such good prices, it's as good as cash. Free merch and free shipping, it doesn't get better than that.","455":"I'm always looking for non-clearance items to add to my \"list\". Whenever I go to a particular big retail store, I actively look for their stock of three items, on top of clearance and whatever deals they have at the time. All of these items cost about $11 after tax. Two of them sell for $35, the other sells for $22 and comes in different colors. The first two are very fast sellers, and I restock the last one based off of if I need more inventory of a particular color. I sell through Amazon.  \n\nThe idea of this technique came from this article: http:\/\/blog.gmargin.com\/6k-3-days-sourcing-buying-selling-john-hancock-lego-set\/\n\n","456":"Exactly. I often view gift cards as \"hey, here's something that's less useful than cash\" but I *know* I will be buying from Amazon in the future and it can store my gift card total, so there is zero downside.","457":"Not every day, but I complete a lot of case studies and challenges on QuantiaMD.com - a site for clinicians.  They reward you with points redeemable for Amazon gift cards.  Over the last few years I've earned over $400!  The site is limited to medical professionals though, but a ton of us at the hospital do it - it is fun to work out some of the difficult cases!","458":"A few thoughts:\n\n* Sign up at Mint.com and start tracking all your expenses.  Every account, every penny.  Come tax time, you can deduct tons of healthcare expenses.  Split them out carefully - doctor office fees, co-pays, co-insurance, prescriptions, eyeglass, etc.  You can even deduct your healthcare *premiums*.  You can deduct the costs of birth, too.  If you spend enough, it will add up to more than a standard deduction, which will lower your taxable liabilities.  There are also child care credits ($1700 per kid for me this year).\n\n* Change his withholding.  Now that you will have a child, add a few deductions.  This will put more money in your pocket each month.  You should shoot to not owe taxes, but not get a refund, at the end of the year.  More cash now is what you need.  You can Google for withholding calculators that can help you determine what to change to.\n\n* Do you have a spare room in your house?  If so, rent it out!  You may be able to charge $500\/mo.  Boom, instant extra income.  We've been doing this for years and it's been fine.  PM me if you want more details.\n\n* Your husband may want to ADD funds to his 401k.  The reason is that it can lower his tax withholding, which can put him in a lower tax bracket, so your paychecks will stay nearly the same, but you will be saving more.  You need to do the math on this.\n\n* Drive in a more fuel efficient manner.  Simply put - when the light goes green, give your car as little gas as you can and start off slowly.  Let everyone else zoom off.  The more you press the pedal down, the more gas you use.  Starting your car rolling from a dead stop uses the most gas of any driving.  Therefore, if you can push the pedal down half as much as you usually do, you will use half as much gas starting up, and this can make a major difference on MPG.  I have a 25 year old truck with a 5.7L V8 motor, and I get 20mpg in town.  My buddy had a similar 7 year old truck (newer, more efficient motor) and he got 6mpg because he floored it at every green light.  Doing this may allow you to improve your MPG 5% to 50%, lowering your fuel costs.\n\n* When the kids get to solids, make it yourself.  Cook whatever it is, put it in the food processor and blend it up, then freeze individual portions in baby food portion freezer tray thingies ... Amazon has them.  Then microwave them individually to serve.  So easy and so cheap!\n\n* My last recommendation:  Buy the book Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.  Read it NOW, before the baby is born.  Then around 6 months you can start taking advantage of it.  At 6 months our on and daughter took to the schedule within, and were in bed at 5pm at night and slept until 7am in the morning, plus had two naps.  This book is a miracle.  If you don't read this, expect your kids to stay up until 10-11pm, and get up at 5am, and you'll be losing your mind.\n\nCongrats, and good luck.","459":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

There are also good books on Amazon that will familiarize you with the industry.\n\nYou should definitely know how the transportation industry runs, especially trucking. Learn the different types of loads such as TL (full truck load), LTL (less than truckload) and how they differ. Also familiarize yourself with different types of trailers and what kinds of loads they haul. We strictly run van trailers (most common), but there are reefers (refrigerated), flatbeds, etc.\n\nIt's also very important to know how much to pay for certain loads. Price varies on location, type of freight, weight, delivery timeframe, and much more. For example trucking companies will always want more money for freight that's heavy, time critical, and is going to a location where there isn't much freight coming out of. For example, we'd need more money taking freight from Chicago to Wyoming because we know that there isn't much going on in Wyoming and we'll need to travel empty for a longer distance in order to get something back. It's simple supply and demand, but unfortunately you won't know these kinds of things unless you're already in the industry. What we've done in the future is to ask multiple brokers what they're paying for certain lanes in order to get an approximate price range. Another nice thing about load boards is that you can see the amount of freight being posted and the amount of trucks available in certain areas. That will give you a good estimate of how much you'll need to pay a company to haul the freight.\n\nThe absolute best way to learn is to work for a smaller trucking company that does brokerage as a dispatcher. The experience and knowledge you'll gain there is unbeatable.","501":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

All TD Waterhouse US-soil based accounts share the same routing number, which is a BoA routing number, so I assume all TD Waterhouse accounts are managed or at least affiliated with BoA in some way or another.\n\nNowadays Amazon doesn't require US soil-based accounts but in the past they did so it was required to sell on Amazon and use their FBA services.\n\nAnother *huge* benefit is that you only need to maintain a low balance of a few hundred dollars to not incur any fees; our American friends have way less expensive everything, including business banking.","503":"If you are selling through an online site, buy your postage through eBay\/Amazon\/whatever site you are using.

The steps are quite simple.  If you make nearly 6 figures, then you are in a great place.  You can figure out on your own where\/how to invest.  You make enough to max your 401k, max contribution to a roth IRA, and to open a taxable investment account as well. You make more than enough to do this.  \n\nAs far as saving goes it's quite easy.  Figure out your monthly bills and debts.  Every monthly commitment you have.  Cable, internet, phone, food, rent, car payment, gas, electricity, etc... Every single payment needs to be examined and reduced.  You don't need cable, you can probably spend less on a phone, you can stop eating out and pack every day, you can drive less, you can lose the car payment and get a cheap reliable car.  \n\nOnce you examine every monthly commitment you have and drop some and pare the others down, then it's on to step 2.  You work hard for your money, you shouldn't let a single dollar of it go without a fight.  Morning coffee?  Nope.  Lunch out on Friday?  Nope.  Buy a couple things on Amazon?  Nope.  Every single purchase that you make needs to be considered.  Do you need it?  Probably not.  Some people suggest making a budget and tracking your transactions every day.  I say that you should instead just reduce your transactions every day.  It gets to a point where spending money on stupid things you really don't need becomes painful, and saving becomes wonderful.  With the amount you make it will add up quickly and debts will disappear as your retirement accounts and investment accounts grow.  \n\nDo these steps first before you even consider hiring a Certified Financial Planner.  Money is important, it buys you freedom.  You need to be willing to put a bit of work in on your own to learn saving and investing skills.  When you start making these changes you will realize that it would be silly to pay someone to help you save money.  Save the financial planner for big moments in your life, like can I afford a house and college for my kids, and if I can then when will I be able to retire with my savings rate,, etc...

I've had it for nearly 2 years now and it's helped settle insurance claims that could have cost thousands.\n- On the same note, a [DropCam subscription](https:\/\/www.dropcam.com\/) - technically it's less than 50 dollars *per month* but again - this has saved me and my neighbours SO much money. I've got one watching my parking lot from my window as well as one inside my apartment. Peace of mind.\n- I would also recommend a quality knife. One good chef's knife is all you really need (6 or 8 inch). Don't go for one of the ones you see at Target or Walmart for 20 dollars. Spend the money on it (50 bucks) and get something REAL. It's a bit over the budget for this thread, but I spent 80 bucks on a Global G2. I've had it for years now and it hasn't needed anything except for a periodic honing. Meanwhile, I've gone through 3 walmart knives in the same timespan. There are cheaper quality knives also - look at Solingen, Henckels, Zwilling, Victorinox, or anything else with a real German name on it. Don't buy a Japanese blade unless you know why you need a Japanese blade.\n- Nobody ever says this, but: house plants!

They don't use much electricity, you can refill the jugs at the grocery for like, 3 bucks, it tastes WAY better than tap water in my town, and I can have hot (170F) and cold water out of the same unit. It's perfect for making tea, soup, or just about anything I'm cooking that requires boiling water. It's not boiling out of the spigot, but it'll come to a boil WAY faster than cold tap water.

I work full-time in the internet marketing realm and have been writing online since 2006. I'm in the early stages of getting my first Amazon affiliate site up and running. So far I've selected my niche, completed the keyword research, purchased a domain\/hosting and setup Wordpress. Lots of work left to do.\n\nIt's my opinion that you CAN still build a niche Amazon affiliate site and make money. Want proof? Listen to [this podcast](http:\/\/www.nichepursuits.com\/podcast-57-claire-smith-makes-5-figures-month-niche-sites-no-link-building\/) from Jan., 2015 involving a lady named Claire who has built about 40 of these sites that currently make over $10,000 a month collectively. It's a very eye-opening podcast, and I'm modeling much of my process after her strategies.\n\n**The key is building a useful website with good unique content**. You can't just throw a bunch of products on the site without any unique content and expect to rank in Google. It's also critical that you spend a lot of time on keyword research. I used Claire's technique for doing mine, and I'm satisfied with the results. I just setup my domain\/hosting\/WP last week -- haven't even added content to the site yet -- and I'm already getting a trickle of traffic (not just bots). That's how I know I did a good job selecting my niche, finding great keywords and domain name.\n\nI'm not sure whether or not I'll utilize any WP plugins to speed up my site building. I don't plan on having dozens of products on my site -- maybe more like 5-10 -- so I'm not sure I'll need any advanced plugins. However, two that I'm considering are:\n\n* Easy Azon by Chris Guthrie\n* WooCommerce affiliate plugin available at CodeCanyon.net\n\nI'm also a little stuck on which WP theme to go with. There are several Amazon affiliate-ready themes out there, but I'm kinda leaning toward more of a \"non-affiliate-looking\" website -- something a little more basic and clean. I guess I could test both to see which works best.\n\nMy goal is to have 5 of these sites launched by the end of the year and to be making $1,500 per month combined. If I succeed, I'll continue building new sites and adding content to the existing ones -- this is a very scalable business.\n\nGive it a try and see how it goes for you. By the end of 2015, you could be earning a few hundred dollars per month of almost passive income per month.\n\nKeep us updated!

You won't make a lot the first months but, your google ranking will improve with time and it will become more profitable. This of course depends on how crowded is your niche.\n* new niches open every day. You should be able to find relevant one and jump on the opportunity.\n* if your niche is small the best strategy is to have many websites. This also dilute the impact of one site getting suddenly poorly ranked or facing great competition. It is quite quick to create a site with Wordpress so no problem on this side.\n* The main problem with my site is that there are few seller on Amazon and they have little stocks. Once a product runs out of stock they generally get some different ones and I have to include these new products (and remove the old ones).

Prices I saw were $85 to 100 for the screen. Ebay isn't my go-to, but thanks, there are way cheaper parts there that I need for my computer!\n\nMy truck is a 97 Ford Ranger. Number one problem is the front drivers side wheel bearing need immediate replacement. This can not wait much longer. This truck was in the north its entire existence and is horribly rusted out so that anytime I have a repair it ends up being a lot more than originally called for because bolts break, lines snap, rust has to be chiseled away and bolts torched out. So this repair likely won't be any different.\n\nOther than that, there is a small leak in the head gasket, just enough to constantly give a burning oil smell and even see smoke in the right light. But not enough that I have to add more oil between changes. The rust has gotten so bad, even after grinding it out, hitting it with rust inhibitor, priming and painting, it ate back through because the panels are all rusting from the inside out. Whatever, cosmetics right? Well, it's around the windshield now and disrupted the seal around the windshield so that when it rained hard I had a 1 inch puddle in my truck. Duct tape to the rescue (last few months). It's a lot of little things too. AC doesn't work anymore. The heat sucks. The temperature gauge will only randomly work once or twice a year and it seems to keep coolant from time to time. It has a ridiculous idling problem. Once it warms up\/driven a bit it goes away, but will die almost instantly after first firing up. The bed is getting pretty rusty underneath that the last time I stood in it I was a bit afraid it wasn't going to hold. The exhaust pipe rusted through, it's got new pipe adapters holding it together and some wire because the U clamps won't hold. It's a manual and the parking break line had to be cut because it seized a few years back, so parking on an incline gives me anxiety.\n\nAt best I've calculated it gets 14.5 mpg. I've had this truck for 11+ years. I've put a new clutch in, had the 4WD replaced, new tires recently. New brake lines a few months ago (had to, they rusted out and broke). New shocks, new differential gears, multiple rust inhibition\/removal attempts... and the usual regular consumables: battery changes, electrical fixes, EKG valve replaced, new spark plugs and lines, serpentine belt, lights, new tires...  I'm sure I've forgotten other things.\n\nLike I said, I've had the truck 11+ years. I'm kind of sentimental about it. It's a fun little truck. I love driving a manual (it's always fun being a girl driving a manual and guy friends don't know how, haha). It's got a V6 4.0L (biggest that will fit in a Ranger) so it's got a lot of power for a small truck. I've kept the miles low on it, just approaching 185k.\n\nSo that's the details on that.","543":"&gt;You cannot cherry-pick a single company (Apple) with a high degree of automation and pretend its all producers. This doesn't reflect reality.\n\nI didn't.  I said \"certain companies like Apple, or factory farms, or large clothing companies\".  I'm saying that the majority of consumer goods are produced by companies using a high amount of automation or overseas labor, and if demand were to pick up they would not need to hire a significant number of new employees to meet that demand.\n\nIf you want to provide counterexamples, please do.\n\n&gt;It makes no sense increased production will only occur in 100% automated industries (which don't actually exist) and therefore no hiring will take place.\n\nWhy not?  Most consumption goods are produced in highly automated factories or use overseas labor. Without a doubt, increased demand would result in some increased hiring in the US, but I highly doubt it would result in any significant hiring increase.  Sure, there are counterexamples, but I have yet to hear you provide any.  You can continue to make this claim, but until you back it up, I don't know why I should believe it.\n\n&gt;It is a much better assumption that production will be expanded, in part, by the hiring of additional workers. Why? Because this is what happens with every economic expansion everywhere in the world. It is happening in the United States as we speak. This isn't theoretical. You are positing something that simply doesn't happen.\n\nWhy is that a better assumption?  In the past, labor was a key component of production, but that is becoming less and less the case.  And in many of the industries where labor is a key component, a decent amount of the production has been moved overseas.  I'm waiting for you to give me specific examples where this increased demand is going to resort to a significant increase in employment.  I'm going through the things I spend money on, and I'm trying to think how much more I would have to buy for additional workers to be necessary.\n\nHell, even the retail sector will struggle due to competition from Amazon et al.  And wait until the transportation industry gets creamed by self driving cars.\n\nYou're living in the past.\n\n&gt;It makes no sense that currency will suddenly accumulate and then suddenly be spent, as change is gradual and neither wealth nor consumption is being taxed, income is.\n\nI'm actually having the same discussion elsewhere with your compatriot geerussel regarding the plausibility of a sudden shift from accumulation to spending.  \n\nWhich part doesn't make sense?  Certainly currency accumulates - I don't know how you could deny that.  As far as the sudden shift from accumulating to spending - it's almost like a bank run.  If the threat of taxation to stem inflation is on the table, then it makes sense to spend your money as quickly as possible before inflation (and thus taxation) becomes an issue.  It just comes down to game theory.  As long as everyone cooperates, everything is good, but when people start defecting, it goes bad quickly, as the sooner you defect the better.\n\nIf you won't tax consumption or wealth, how are you going to keep inflation under control?  Geerussel certainly seems to think that taxing wealth is on the table.\n\n&gt;It makes no sense that the only effects of injection will be the initial economic activity with no knock-on effects.\n\nWhat do you mean by this?  Even if there are knock on effects, they gradually diminish as the money cycles through the economy to the currency accumulators.\n\nLet's say there is a company that can make everything, and for every $100000 of increased demand, they have to hire a worker a pay them a salary of $50000.  So we give the people of the town $1000000 and they spend it all at ACME.  ACME has to hire 10 workers, and they pay each of those workers $50000.  Those workers then buy $500000 dollars worth of goods at ACME, so ACME can lay off 5 of those workers.  And then ACME pays out $250000 and lays off another two workers.  And so on, until ACME has accumulated the original $1000000 and all of the temporarily hired workers are laid off.\n\nObviously this is an example with a company that can make everything, so it doesn't perfectly reflect reality, but it illustrates the point I'm trying to make.  Currently, all of the money is going to currency accumulators, and those currency accumulators are not providing a significant number of jobs for the population.  Injecting more currency into the economy is not going to change that - all of that money will eventually make its way to the same currency accumulators.  It can go in a direct route, or it can take a longer route, but it will still get there, and once it does - all of those jobs that were created will be gone.\n\n&gt;It makes no sense that producers will agree to have all of their income confiscated and transferred to customers.\n\nThey will be very unhappy about that, there is no doubt.\n\n&gt;It makes no sense to assume a world with no mobility.\n\nWell, it does if you're trying to iron out some fundamental aspects of economics.  What does adding mobility into the equation change?  Are you talking about workers or companies?\n\n&gt;Mine has wealth more broadly shared, close to full employment, most people participating and able to have nice things. Yours is a static world with no innovation, no mobility, just simple wealth transfers and no change ever.\n\nMine is sustainable.\n\n&gt;None of what you are saying makes any sense. You are making up new economic effects that simply don't happen in real world.\n\nLike what?\n\n","544":"The Luxe Bidet MB110 which i bought off Amazon for about $30.

Otherwise, you're going to be spending a LOT of time on a business that relies on 100% SEO as its primary revenue source, building sites with essentially fluff content (that search engines, people, and social sites don't like and you always run the risk of being destroyed by the almighty Google).  Now, you can build interesting content when you're not interested in the subject matter, but it is BRUTALLY boring and will demotivate you.\n\nSo think about what you're interested in.  It should be between niche and general, so you're cutting into a market that's neither oversaturated, nor nonexistant.  Next, think about what products you can potentially sell, and how high the profit margin is on them.  Amazon isn't the only place you can set up an affiliate program with once you have some traffic (which is your first goal, don't even think about trashing up your pages with affiliate links until you have traffic, search engines and aggregators hate that).\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, it is certainly possible to make some money by starting an amazon affiliate website, but you're scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Everyone already overdid it, and ruined it for everyone else in terms of image, so you're doing something thousands of people have already beaten into the ground, and continue to do so, so you're going to be putting in a lot more work than people had to 10 years ago to make a lot less money.\n\nThe reality is that you're better off being ahead of the game, being the guy that discovers the next opportunity, or at least jumps on early.  Don't be the guy chasing the bandwagon that's a mile ahead to pick up the scraps left behind.  Sound difficult?  That's because it's one of the hardest things a business can accomplish.\n\nNote that you can also avoid the stigma of being an affiliate website, as well as have a much higher profit margin for most things, if you build\/sell your own product.","567":"I believe you can choose to use part of your Amazon Giftcard Balance, and also pay with a CC.

The 5 items are listed as follows:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**[Asus Notebook G60Vx](http:\/\/www.lapspecs.com\/detail\/asus+g60vx)**\n\nCondition: Used, Original Buyer. \n\nBattery Condition: Very Poor.\n\nSpecifications: Intel Core2 Duo-2.13Ghz, 4Gb RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260M, 320Gb HDD. Full specs in embedded link title including chipset and other installed Hardware.\n\nAs instructed i attempted to look through completed listings on ebay for what the item previously sold at: a price of $380 shows up 3x over the last 7 days. \n\n**Nintendo3DS Title: PokemonX**\n\nCondition: Opened w\/ Original Packaging, User Manuals, Promotions, and Gifts. \n\n**Gigaware Brand 4pin to 4pin 6Ft Firewire Cable w\/ 400Mbps Transfer**\n\nCondition: New. Unopened. \n\nFound at a garage sale for 50c. Impulse buy... couldn't help myself. \n\n**Wired XBox360 Controller**\n\nCondition: New. Never Used although missing Original Packaging. \n\nThe item was purchased new however upon arrival it was unable to be recognised with a PC. I received a replacement for free and was not obligated to return the original controller. After some testing i was able to discover the problem was the usb adapter not the controller itself. [The adapter looks like this.](http:\/\/www.dx.com\/p\/xbox-360-wired-controller-to-usb-adapter-cable-20cm-cable-29087#.VOT2F_nF_KM) Strangely though the controller works perfectly on an xbox 360. \n\n**Nintendo3DS Console: AquaBlue Model**\n\nCondition: Original Buyer. Used. Missing Original Packaging and User Manual.\n\nExternal Cosmetic damage is visible in the top corners of the device however both screens are in perfect condition with literally zero scratches or blemishes thanks to original plastic covering that can be removed.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother question i have is whether there is a guide out there that illustrates which service such as Amazon, Ebay, CL is best for selling certain types of items?","597":"My last several purchases from Amazon were USPS.

That is going to hurt retail sales that were already [pretty flat](http:\/\/www.ibisworld.com\/industry\/the-retail-market-for-musical-instruments.html).  Some stores make it on teaching lessons, doing service repair, handling rentals, and working with schools.  Trying to undercut online outlets receiving waves of imports would be tough.  Guitar Center owns Musician's Friend and is positioned online, but I think you need multiple revenue streams other than just floor sales to grow.  The company has acknowledged this, so maybe they can handle their large nut and hang on.  That much debt would suck, though.  As for Amazon, they have massive server farms and who truly knows what the hell they're up to?  They have a distribution structure that no other player in their space has except for Wal-Mart, yet they also have a back-end the size of Google's.  It is a crazy contraption that can be used for lots of interesting things so it is very difficult for the market to value, but the value is there.","606":"Thanks for the input! I was a little shocked by some of the things he was saying about the low margins of Amazon. It also kind of sounds like this is a time that sucks for new suppliers and manufacturers. For instance, if I wanted to put a new guitar effect pedal on the market as a manufacturer, it sounds like I would either have to throw in with GC and hope they can stay afloat and I can pull a decent margin from selling through them, or I can put my stuff on Amazon and try to sell through them. For Fender to start selling through their own website sounds like it could work, since they already have a well established brand, but for up-and-commers? I don't think they would stand much of a chance, putting up their own website and selling their own products that way I think would require a huge marketing campaign that ultimately may not pan out at all.","607":"So you're in the US and shipping to Canada?\n\n\n* Province = State (Ontario, Quebec, etc).\n\n\n* City = City\n\n\n* Postal Code = Zip Code, except it's 6 digit alpha\/numeric\n\nExample: Montr\u00e9al, QC H3G 1H6, Canada\n\n\nAs suggested already, just print the label via eBay\/Amazon and it will format the address correctly. You shouldn't be rewriting\/copying addresses on labels.\n","608":"Robert Reich is constantly cherry picking in his arguments to keep them to easily swallowed morsels for the public. He did this from start to finish in his movie Inequality for All.\n\n&gt;It was an era when many workers were \u201chappy\u201d to toil twelve-hour days in sweat shops for lack of any better alternative.\n\nAn era where individual productivity was lower and wanting to earn enough to not starve meant working that much.\n\n&gt;It was also a time of great wealth for a few and squalor for many. \n\nOr most of human history was squalor for many.\n\n&gt;Finally, after decades of labor strife and political tumult, the twentieth century brought an understanding that capitalism requires minimum standards of decency and fairness \u2013 workplace safety, a minimum wage, maximum hours (and time-and-a-half for overtime), and a ban on child labor.\n\nCapitalism worked fine before the 30s, and capitalism has worked fine in countries with lower standards for those things, including numerous countries without a minimum wage.\n\n&gt;We achieved that through antitrust laws that reduced the capacity of giant corporations to impose their will, and labor laws that allowed workers to organize and bargain collectively.\n\nUnions are often immune to anti-trust laws.\n\n&gt;By the 1950s, when 35 percent of private-sector workers belonged to a labor union, they were able to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions than employers would otherwise have been \u201chappy\u201d to provide.\n\nAnd most of the developed world's infrastructure had been decimated by WWII, meaning a huge comparative advantage for US production.\n\n&gt;The nation\u2019s biggest corporations and Wall Street banks are larger and more potent than ever.\n\nAnd were combined...by the legislators. It wasn't the free market bailing out banks or lending money to merge JP Morgan with Bear Stearns.\n\n&gt;And labor union membership has shrunk to less than 6 percent of the private-sector workforce.\n\nIt was merely 15% when all those protections he says were necessary were put in place in 1937-1938, meaning large scale unionization isn't necessary to achieve those things. Further, the composition of the industries in the US now compared to the 50s are fewer sectors that are prone to unionization such as manufacturing. The workforce is more fungible now, and that simply makes it harder to unionize.\n\n&gt;But by the middle of the twentieth century they were organized for the vast majority.\n\n35% isn't the vast majority. It's not even a majority.\n\n&gt;Yet since around 1980, even though the economy has doubled once again (the Great Recession notwithstanding), the wages most Americans have stagnated. And their benefits and working conditions have deteriorated.\n\nActually the *cost* of their benefits has gone up, and the portion of people's compensation that are benefits has gone up. Also worker safety is higher than before.\n\n&gt;That includes trade agreements protecting the intellectual property of large corporations and Wall Street\u2019s financial assets, but not American jobs and wages.\n\nProtectionism is in the long run economically bad. Imagine trade agreements heavily taxing cars to protect the jobs of horse trainers and buggy manufacturers, essentially.\n\n&gt;Bailouts of big Wall Street banks and their executives and shareholders when they can\u2019t pay what they owe, but not of homeowners who can\u2019t meet their mortgage payments.\n\nThis suggests that he thinks both should have been bailed out I imagine, when really neither should be(and those engaged in fraud should be punished accordingly, be it defrauding investors or defrauding creditors in claiming what their income was to secure such a loan).\n\n&gt;Bankruptcy protection for big corporations, allowing them  to shed their debts, including labor contracts. But no bankruptcy protection for college graduates over-burdened with student debts.\n\nThere's no collateral for student loans. Degrees aren't transferrable. \n\nAlso there's zero rationale that these two categories are comparable in the way he compares them. They present completely different risks and costs to the both the creditor and the debtor.\n\n&gt;Antitrust leniency toward a vast swathe of American industry \u2013 including Big Cable (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Time-Warner), Big Tech (Amazon, Google), Big Pharma, the largest Wall Street banks, and giant retailers (Walmart).\n\nUnions get more anti-trust leniency.\n\n&gt;But less tolerance toward labor unions \u2014 as workers trying to form unions are fired with impunity, and more states adopt so-called \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that undermine unions.\n\nRight to work laws simply don't let unions hold non-union workers and firms hostage. No one has a right to a job, including union workers.\n\n&gt;So what will be the galvanizing force for change this time?\n\nPolicy based on cherry picked data and appeals to emotion is my guess.","609":"Amazon is the easiest to set up, but you could theoretically ask any online business to become an affiliate. Whether they have set it up, or want to set it up, is another story.","610":"Amazon.com\/gc","611":"Capital One has 1.5% cash back on everything.\n\nThere's a Mastercard that gives you one percent every time you spend, and another percent when you pay it off.  The two percent back makes it better than Capital One.\n\nSallie Mae has a five percent back card for groceries and gas.\n\nAmazon has a five percent back card for Amazon purchases.  \n\nThose are the best deals, in my opinion.  There's also the Chase card that gives you a large chunk of cash back if you spend a lot upfront, like 20% back on a plane ticket or a high end laptop.  It's good to make four hundred dollars, then close it before the one year anniversary because there's a large annual fee.  For that, you have to be willing to take a slight credit hit when you open, and another when you close.  If you're not making a significant commitment like a car or home loan for the year, it's worth it for the hundreds of dollars.  Over time the slight credit hit will recover.","612":"Thanks for this info, I thought VINIX looked like a great fun after I did some comparison. I do work there so that's where the Amazon shares come from (part of matching my contributions).\n\nThe Roth IRA is actually all VFINX right now.\n\nSo should I only worry about the AMZN shares and re-balance according to your chart? Basically converting that $9k to VTSNX.","613":"I don't post much but saw that there hadn't yet been any replies.\n\nYou might want to start with looking at cards that you'll keep for a long duration, to boost your credit score on a long-term basis.  Therefore you'll want cards without annual fees.  If you don't travel and aren't interested in rewards, the two cards you might look at are the Amazon Rewards Card (from Chase that gives \"points\" when buying on Amazon and using points on Amazon that gives equivalent to 3% cash back) and the Fidelity American Express card (that gives 2% cash back directly to brokerage account at Fidelity).  You can look at \/r\/churning for info on various types of credit cards, but be careful as that subreddit basically trades credit score value for sign-on bonuses in rapid succession.  Still, that subreddit seems to have the most discussion of various cards available.\n\nKeep in mind that the range from 760 to 850 in credit score will give the lowest interest rates for housing, just as a general goal.  \n\nThe other thing I would suggest you do is request a credit increase from Chase for your current card that will lower your debt utilization ratio.  This is one of the factors for your credit score.  The process for getting an increase is you contact your credit card company (Chase) and present your income and say that you've been paying on time and the company will increase it.  With your salary you can probably have well over a $20,000 credit limit on the singular card, which will help that ratio.\n\nBest of luck!","614":"&gt;So should I only worry about the AMZN shares and re-balance according to your chart? Basically converting that $9k to VTSNX.\n\nI would re-balance your 401k a few times a year so that its holdings match my three-fund recommendation above. The typical advice here is to hold as little stock in the company that you work for as possible.","615":"&gt; Dont buy them? Find people who already own one and will allow you to use theirs for the review. Maybe offer some type of minor compensation to the product owner for its temporary use.\n\nOr just write reviews based on current reviews on Amazon and related sites","616":"Try them on locally, at least.

But we want to start something that has potential to grow.\n\nI don't plan on placing ads or anything to begin with. The YouTube channel is a great idea that I hadn't though about though. I've also heard of Amazon associate sales, would that be a fair route to take? Sending users to Amazon wouldn't be as in-your-face as a regular banner ad or something and we would still generate some profit. I think. ","618":"Amazon affiliate would work, but I would try to \"sell\" it via newsletter (eg. \"new releases this week...\" and include a link to your review). You probably get a better conversation rate of people that already subscribed to you. Including a \"buy on amazon\" in plain sight on your review page may aswell generates profit. But this all takes time, since only quality can seperate you from others.","619":"I would indeed sell the AMZN. I would put that money in the Target 2050 Retirement Trust . I wouldn't do a three fund portfolio and every year have to rebalance. I would just keep the 401k simple and easy. The target 2050 retirement trust has a diversified asset allocation, will rebalance automatically and will also adjust the asset allocation when you get close to retirement. I think the 0.18% per year expense ratio is OK, to me it would be worth the circa 0.1% more in expenses compared to maintaining a portfolio by yourself...","620":"Hey I know I'm late to the party but I just saw this and would love to get an Amazon gift card because I want to buy my boyfriend a game off his wishlist for his birthday but I'm low on cash.

And it was only a few years ago that they told Amazon they wanted a bundle of money for AWS because of a large portfolio of patents they \"may have.\"","625":"&gt; Let's focus on the crux of the argument.\n\nPlease!\n\n&gt;You believe that an increase in GDP doesn't usually lead to employment increases.\n\nNo!\n\nI believe that we are entering a unique time in history where labor is no longer an important factor of production.  There is far more automation and economies of scale today than there have ever been in the past, and labor is only going to get less and less important.  Obviously there will be some changes in employment, but not enough to justify MMT.  It's simply where we are at in society.  It is entirely possible that within five to ten years I could buy an iPad from Apple, have Apple produce it at a completely automated factory, ship it to an Amazon factory via automated trucking, have the Amazon warehouse automatically sort and then ship my iPad to me via drone.  Sure, that is one example out of the millions of things people consume, but it's where we're heading.\n\nAnd regardless, even if it does lead to an increase in employment, it isn't permanent.  I'll quote my ACME example from further up the thread:\n\n&gt;Let's say there is a company that can make everything, and for every $100000 of increased demand, they have to hire a worker a pay them a salary of $50000. So we give the people of the town $1000000 and they spend it all at ACME. ACME has to hire 10 workers, and they pay each of those workers $50000. Those workers then buy $500000 dollars worth of goods at ACME, so ACME can lay off 5 of those workers. And then ACME pays out $250000 and lays off another two workers. And so on, until ACME has accumulated the original $1000000 and all of the temporarily hired workers are laid off.\n\nThe money in the economy trickles up, as it has been for years, and any additional money you add into the economy will trickle up.  Here is another thought experiment - print $100000 and dye all of the bills red.  Distribute it to poor people somewhere, inner city, Appalachia, Indian Reserve, wherever.  Discounting those that saved the money originally, how many of those bills are still in that community?  How many have trickled up through the economy to find their way in some corporate bank account somewhere?\n\n&gt;The failings of your ideology to explain the real world has nothing to do with MMT.\n\nWell, I mean so far your entire defense of MMT has come down to \"historically, when GDP increases employment increases, therefore MMT is right\".  Not a great argument.\n ","626":"I see. I wonder if Amazon will add in other requirements to choose from in the future - I suppose requiring you to visit a landing page would be a bit spammy...","627":"I suppose the one redeeming factor is they are more likely to be real because this person would need an Amazon account and hook their twitter into it. Still a lot of eggs though (no profile picture - likely not active\/real accounts).\n\nIf you just wanted numbers for numbers sake, it's probably cheaper to go to fiverr and buy followers.","628":"If you got canned for \"inauthentic \/ prohibited listing\", the customer was under the belief that what you sold was obvious not the real deal. Bouncing back from that one is pretty rough. Take this over to the sellers forums on Amazon and see how the other folks would go about a reinstatement. Also, just do a quick search on it in the Sellers Forums. You'll find a gold mine of good information. Don't give up. I know Amazon can be strict, but it is a small price to pay for the massive audience of customers they bring to your doorstep.","629":"But they did tell you why; you sold a counterfeit item.

It seemed to me that the option was most available on things Amazon was selling (not third party) but I'm not 100% sure on that. I would think Amazon would encourage it on your own products (if you can do it, I would absolutely recommend it, great way to get people looking at your product).","635":"The last time I checked, Amazon is only 3% on Amazon purchases. But Amazon also has 2%  for drugstores and restaurants.\n\nThe Sallie Mae card, however, also has 5% on book stores, which includes regular Amazon purchases. Digital Amazon purchases aren't included. ","636":"Market it toward people who want to do Amazon private label. It's an up and coming huge  business opportunity. They always need reviews for there product, usually in exchange for free or heavily discounted product,","637":"&gt; The interest burden is going to be higher than their operating income per quarter. Quite dangerous sign. \n\nThey also keep adding more and more benefits to prime, to get more and more people spending more and more of their money on Amazon.com, they are making and shipping Echo units as fast as they can which lets people make shopping list and use prime music on something other than their phone\/tablet\/computer and will likely get more and more features (the software is cloud based, the hardware is essentially a terminal) which will likely be focussed around getting people to spend more money at Amazon. More and more people are buying fire tv and fire tv stick units (hell I have 2 fire tv's in the house myself and NEVER thought I'd rent movies again or buy digital copies, yet I'm finding myself renting and buying tv series and movies weekly because it's easier than getting up and going to the other room, finding a torrent and waiting 15-30 minutes).\n\nSure, they are stuck with a bunch of phones no one wants, and they quickly learned that not every product will be immediately adopted so they now are manufacturing new hardware in batches (like the Echo, it's been shipping since last year in waves, I've been on the list for a month and my ship date is sitll 2 and a half months off) so they learned their lesson there.\n\nThe FAA just made the first steps towards allowing commercial use of drones and Amazon was somewhat serious about drone deliver for small prime items although sure that's probably a few years out.\n\nEtc.

I told them this isn't the first time this has happened, and I've had 3-4 months for free due to my orders not coming in on time. \n\nI wrote a letter to customer service and asked for my seller privileges to be 100% healthy condition rather than give me another month for their prime product being delivered later than promised. \n\n3 days later, my seller account was active again.

I checked camel camel camel and it typically fell $20 less than its current price but had historically gone as low as $40 less. I emailed them asking if they knew when it would go down again and they just said they'd honor the lowest price. I couldn't believe it. The rep himself said it wasn't in their policy but I think they wanted to make me happy since I buy quite a bit on their site. \nAfter the price adjustment and some gift cards I had, I spent $20 on the set. ","647":"1. Use a price tracker to be notified when prices drop for an item you bought. I wrote my own [\\(pricezombie](http:\/\/www.pricezombie.com)) that you can use, but if someone has another that can track amazon, bestbuy, officemax, staples, etc, feel free to post.\n2. Use your credit card's price protection when you can. It's far superior to price matching at a store because the time period is much greater. e.g; [Discover's price drop protection](https:\/\/www.discover.com\/credit-cards\/member-benefits\/price-protection.html) is 90 days. I have a VISA card that has 120 days.\n3. I would recommend limiting your price matching at Amazon. I know a lot of people are really into it, but Amazon keeps tabs on what you cost them to service as a customer, and I'm wary over tempting fate. People can and do get banned from buying from Amazon if their computers calculate that you cost them more than they gain. If you are a regular user that sometimes does it, I doubt you'll run into problems. Back to my point #2, credit card price protection not only has longer refund periods, but also doesn't run the risk of you losing a store to buy from. \n4.

I asked politely if they knew when the price would go down again, mentioned the typical price and the historic low price and said that if it came down, I'd buy the item today. YMMV but they honored the historic low.\n\nI don't condone this since essentially I asked when the price would come down and they went the extra mile and just gave the best price. I appreciate what Amazon customer service does for its customers and don't wish to take advantage of it. I guess what I'm saying is, politely send them an email and see what they can do. Don't make demands and they may be able to make a deal. \n\nEdit: I should also mention that I absolutely did not expect for them to lower the price but was pleasantly surprised when they did. I legitimately just wanted to know if I could expect the price to go down or if I should buy now. I won't make this a habit but they've made me a very happy customer. ","654":"Wal-Mart sees the writing on the wall.  They've analyzed their business model, as well as that of the competition.  They're doing this now so they can lobby for higher minimum wages which will put more pressure on local mom and pops that invest in the local economy out of business, the same way that Amazon is now lobbying for an internet sales tax to squeeze their competition.

Even with my old plates from thrift shops, I haven't noticed any milkiness compared to the new white Corelle plates I bought on Amazon.","657":"Whenever you see these apps and everyone's using them. Just remember that the lady working at McDonald's makes hundreds of millions more money than Twitter did last year.\n\nDefinitely agree that we're in a valuation bubble on apps.  For an app to have billions of dollars of valuation I feel like it needs to:\n\n1. Have a huge consumer base (most of them have this)\n2. Have an actual plan to create revenue (most fail here)\n3. Have a product that is protected by patents or with a large barrier to entry or a significant changeover cost for the user, that prevents thousands of others from immediately creating the exact same product.\n\nSo failing at #2 you have companies like Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, Instagram, etc etc.\n\nFailing at #3 you have companies like Uber, AirBnB, etc. They're generating lots of revenue and have good plans, but for them to be a player in this market 25 years from now, they're going to be competing against all the major chains who are just waiting to see what happens. Hertz and Enterprise and Yellow Cab are going to start Uber like services once the legalities are worked out. Hilton and Hotels.com will have AirBNB apps. They already have large user bases, so they can be a direct competitor without really expending much infrastructure (a college kid with extra time on his hands can create an iPhone app).\n\nCompare that to a company like Amazon.  Amazon will be around for 20-30 years because every book and movie I buy is tied into their infrastructure. There are thousands of places for me to buy digital media, but if I pick someone besides Amazon it is at an inconvenience for me. So I have an attachment to their infrastructure for some time.\n\nEven Facebook is light on this (remember MySpace?), an app like Uber or Lyft or Snapchat, people will switch whenever it's more convenient, so to assume they'll be around in a decade is gambling IMO.","658":"Walmart won't price match with Amazon :(","659":"That doesn't make sense. For product not as described, they ban you from listing that item, no a perma bad from selling. Something was sold that was either not legit or the customer was under the belief that it wasn't the real deal. You can appeal most of these if you have all your information together. They'll request an action plan and such, but it's not worth giving up on 1\/4 of your income.

They would have to be actively spying on me via the smartphone app.  I suppose it could happen, but I doubt that it is.  \n\nThe price match does not impact Amazon's profit margin.

It was actually Office Max's profit margin that was reduced.  This means that Office Max has less operating income to work with and yet their costs were unchanged.  As a result, Office Max has slightly less cash to work with in trying to compete with Amazon.\n\nJust my thoughts... but I don't see price matching as bad for anyone.  Office Max got a sale that they would not have otherwise made.  Amazon is out nothing except the electricity to power the servers during my search.

If they fail to understand their internal policies and honor something they should not, then it's on them (assuming it's an honest mistake on your part; you should never try to defraud a store.)  \n\nAmazon Marketplace would be the best example.

Basically my job is taking the products we sell [around 7k different ones] and create a spreadsheet with all the data that a third party retailer like Amazon, Home Depot, Lowes, or another company would use to fill in the information and content fields of the products sold on the website.

They can be purchased with BB cards, and they can be used to buy anything on amazon.\n\nThe reason I say that is because the redemption reward on BB gift cards is better than on Amazon gift cards, and Amazon gift cards are more useful than BB (amazon has better prices).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the points to directly purchase from amazon, but the redemption value is less. You can also sell the gift cards.\n\nThe gift cards you can purchase with your points make fantastic christmas presents as well. Granted, you're sitting on 3,000$ worth of gift card value in points.

It sounds like one of your issues is possibly a rule that your landlord says you can't run a business out of your apartment.  I currently live in a situation like that, but I do it anyway.  However, I did talk to my landlord, and their main concern was basically security and liability.  They don't want a bunch of strangers constantly coming in and out, especially ones who might get hurt and sue them or have an insurance company come after them.  My landlord was completely fine with me selling on ebay and Amazon because I'm the only one going in and out of my house, and if I get hurt, that's on me, and my insurance takes care of it.  My inventory is also my problem liability wise.  There's no extra traffic, no bunches of people wanting parking or taking up all the overflow parking spaces, etc.  My advice on that point alone would be to just talk to the landlord.\n\nAs far as verifying income as a self-employed person, that is usually done through copies of tax returns.  It can be a pain in the butt sometimes for a self-employed person to qualify for loans, etc., at times.  Generally, a bank will want to see you at the same \"job\" for two years, or at least in the same field.  So for example, to qualify for a mortgage as a reseller, you need to have been doing it for at least two years and be able to back up your income claims with tax returns.  Double-edged sword there--for tax purposes, you want as many deductions as you can get to make your income lower to pay less in taxes, but then your income looks lower, so you can't qualify for as much in loans.  Also, if you were say a bus driver for the past 10 years and this year started a business as an ebayer, but you wanted a loan for something, most banks will tell you to pound sand.  Not happening until you've been an ebayer for two years.  Same thing would happen if you were a bus driver and then became an optician.  No loan until you've been in the new field for two years.\n\nAs far as the tax man, there's no need to be scared of that.  Just make sure you track everything and keep receipts, and most of all, talk to a CPA.  Not only can they do your taxes, but they can also help you plan for taxes, and that can really have a huge impact on your personal bottom line!  It can truly be life changing to help you with finances, and they are worth every penny.  Besides, the CPA fees are tax deductible!\n\nStarting right away, well....that's going to depend on a few things.  Are you already an established ebayer?  If not, ebay imposes selling limits and category limits for new accounts, and this absolutely will affect your sales.  Despite blog posts and YouTube videos out there, you will NOT be able to sell thousands in your first three months.  Doesn't even matter what you're selling.  You won't be able to sell over a certain dollar amount, and certain categories will be restricted, some severely.  For example, a new seller might only be able to sell one computer at $300 or less per month when starting out (I'm making up numbers there--they imposed selling limits long after I started, so I didn't have the n00b restrictions).  \n\nIf at all possible, you'll want to build ebay up, and you'll have to do it sort of slowly, before you quit your other job.  If that's not an option, and you don't have a job at all, you will have to look at other avenues of selling like Craigslist, Amazon, Etsy, Facebook, etc. before you can just go balls to the wall on ebay if that's where you ultimately want to stay.  However, most resellers I know sell on multiple platforms.  ","772":"I think I briefly mentioned hosting giveaways. The problem I have with it is that I would be choosing a hosting company to give away. It might send the wrong message based on what I do (web hosting reviews). I don't want to appear biased in any way or blanket endorsing a company. Rankings change, companies change, I want my brand to be associated with honest reviews. Giving away a specific company's hosting feels against that.\n\nI'm sure based on my position I could get a dozen companies offering me free hosting to giveaway because I'd be implicitly promoting their brand -- and therein lies the problem.

If hedge funds and big money stops believing that tacit promise, their shares prices will reflect that. I wonder of Bezos will be treated like a rockstar if AMZN is no longer being valued as a growth company.\n\nTo answer your question, IMHO, the correct answer is that Amazon can continue to bleed money as long as its shareholders don't feel the company is shirking its fiduciary duty to make them money. AMZN could plough all its earnings back into growing the business and issue debt to finance even more growth for ever as long as there isn't a shareholder revolt.","778":"I have several of the Amazon HDMI cables, no issues with them. Amazon Basics cables in general have been completely satisfactory.","779":"Sorry to say, the information about prime is also inaccurate. Many things ship prime but are not sold by Amazon. It's basically the same as \"fulfilled by\" -- it's third-party merchandise in an Amazon warehouse.","780":"That's because Amazon's cut is so big. 99 cents, plus 15%. I think they may also take a cut of what the buyer pays for shipping before it's added to your total take-home. ","781":"Amazon is an easy one because pretty much anyone can get accepted and get commission on a wide range of items. \n\nThat being said the % is pretty bad, you can get a lot more approaching companies that sells the products directly. Amazon is between 5-8% and some niches offer upto about 30% on some things. \n\nIt's definitely the easiest option, but not always the best, depending on the niche. ","782":"This seems like a good time to also encourage people to shop around on sites that are *not* Amazon. Surprisingly, many times Amazon does not have the cheapest price.\n\nThe board game hobby, for example, is a pricy one. Many hobby board games can easily retail for $50-60 or even more. (This is not your mama's Risk or Monopoly!) Many gaming websites, I'm always surprised to see, have a lot of these specialty games for much cheaper than Amazon. Other niche markets seem to follow the same pattern.\n\nEven when I have to pay shipping for these other websites, but have free Prime with Amazon, I still wind up with a better deal away from Amazon.\n\nUsually, of course, Amazon has the best price. But I suggest you always look around a little bit, instead of automatically going with the \"just order it from Amazon\" mentality (like I used to have...).","783":"When I heard about it, I was happy since there are very few good option to host giveaway on the blog. Looking at the options offered by Amazon giveaway, I don't think it fits anywhere close to what I want. It does;t offer enough social media channels to be followed or don't even give great option for branding. It lacks a lot of features which a blogger needs to run a successful giveaway.","784":"I've also used the Amazon Basics HDMI cables for Blu Ray players, Xboxes and Ps3's and it's worked incredibly across the board.","785":"&gt;They're doing this now so they can lobby for higher minimum wages which will put more pressure on local mom and pops that invest in the local economy out of business\n\nlol.  I highly doubt it.  They more than anything doing it to stick it to Target and to a degree Amazon.  I don't think Wal-Mart cares really about those stores really at this point.","786":"Just bought a fairly high ranked kitchen item for 1.99 each. Currently selling on Amazon for about 10 bucks. I'll be the only Fba seller so my price 13.99. Take home about 10.00+ on each sale. They're out there man. Scan your ass off. ","787":"I got mine from Amazon...good quality, good price. \"amazon basics\" brand","788":"Ebay works well with novelties, scarce items and used products. I don't use Amazon so i wouldn't know what to tell you. Once you get the feel of ebay it's easy to navigate.","789":"Many flip on eBay simply because Amazon isn't really designed for it. Amazon is more suited to new or used items that are in good to new condition with all accessories. Many buyers on Amazon don't read the description part at all or view the photos, so as a seller you're limited on listing defects. You also have to deal UPC codes that you might not actually have if you're selling a used item.\n\neBay is more suited to used items that are in any condition because you provide your own photos and description. That's not to say everyone reads it on eBay either, but putting something for parts on Amazon is a good way to get screwed. The buyer can basically go \"the item was listed under used, doesn't work\" and many times Amazon will do a full refund immediately.\n\nI'm not entirely sure why people even bother comparing them, they're two different companies going after different markets. Sure, they both sell products and allow others to, but that's about where the similarity ends.\n\nPrices, that all depends what you're looking for and how hard you look. Both sites can have absolute steals if you find things that are marked as the wrong product or horribly mispelled; last week I bought a new 4,000lumen projector for $49 (with free shipping) as for reasons I can't figure out the guy had it listed as a model that doesn't even exist; photos showed a Proxima C445+ which is what came. Going to keep that thing and swap it out in the livingroom. -- That sort of stuff is harder to find on Amazon becuase having to enter the UPC and autopopulating the information means it's hard to screw up.","790":"I have a Chrome Extension that puts Amazon price history, might be useful. On my phone so can't remember the name","791":"Even Amazon's adjacent areas that they're getting into - like the cloud computing or video content arenas you mentioned - are becoming more commoditized. Looking at cloud storage, there are some major players in that space, some like Microsoft and Google who will basically just give gigabytes of storage away to make their overall offerings even stickier. And companies like Box and DropBox have seen their futures look a lot murkier with the sheer volume of competition in the space. \n\nIn the video arena, content acquisition costs have exploded over the last 5 years (no more sweethear Starz deals like Netflix used to get). Sure, AMZN and NFLX are producing their own content, but those produce hits and misses (and can cost a lot of money). Your point on the Alibaba-like third-party stuff is a great one though. Running their site like a toll booth has much more potential for profitability.\n\nMy opinion is that AMZN is going to run into problems with cash flow this year or next. Even if they get a ton of Prime users signed up who actually stay on beyond the 1-month trial run, it's not like Prime users don't create costs in terms of fulfillment (and if gas prices rise, that will really compress profitability for AMZN). \n\nIt will be interesting to see how much rope they get from shareholders. That's really the question for the short-term.","792":"Tip:  Amazon has the option of \"Priority Small Flat Rate Box\" .. it's the same cost as the USPS Priority Padded Envelope.  I use it all the time. USPS hasn't cared one lick so far.  ","793":"You can have the same \"5GB roll over 4G data with a 10GB reserve\" and \"unlimited calls\/text\" on the same T-Mobile network for $55\/month with NetOnTheRun. I'm not sure about the \"free text and data internationally\" though.\n\nEvery couple of months or so they run a promotion on SlickDeals where they drop the price to $45\/month (forever, that's not an introductory rate) and they add a $100 Amazon GC as a signup bonus.\n\nI signed up for this in December and they ran the same promotion again [three weeks ago](http:\/\/slickdeals.net\/f\/7631722-net-on-the-run-service-on-t-mobile-s-network-w-unlimited-talk-text-web-5gb-4g-lte-month-100-amazon-gift-card-w-autopayment-prorated-at-35-for-feb-then-45-month-back). No complaints so far.","794":"I've *never* heard anything about interviewing every candidate. That said, phone screens are fairly easy to get, and with OP's creds, I would think he's got a good shot.\n\nAdditionally, phone screens are \"filter-out\" -- that is, it's pretty much assumed that you're competent, and you have to fuck up for them to not fly you out for an in-person interview. Those, however, are \"filter-in\" where, as you might guess, you have to prove that you know your shit.*\n\nAmazon pays poorly, but it's good resume fodder to move elsewhere for a bigger paycheck. Moving from \"one of the cheapest cities in the country\" to Seattle or the Bay Area is a huge jump in cost of living and probably not something OP wants to do until he can shed some dependents.\n\n*Source: former Amazonian, current Microsoftie.

Plenty more learned people round here to learn from. \n\nBut the lessons i've learned...\n\n- always be aware of postage costs. \n\n- only buy quality. Buy a popular item in poor condition, it won't sell, and if it does you'll run into customer issues. \n\n- stick with ebay sold items prices\n\n- garage sales are the best value - thrift stores can be over priced\n\nOh and for you guys in the US the biggest lesson to learn seems to be Amazon is your friend.

Here are some reasons why it might work:\n\n* .com not \"Required\"\n* Very simple affiliate network to break into for any vertical - Try affiliate window for lifestyle\/mobile offers\n* National brands are **VERY well set up for affiliates** - Most brands with an online application product will be able to update your commission on a live feed\n* We have very few providers of key services (I will explain below)\n\nIn the UK, services such as mobile networks, broadband providers, insurance, credit cards are usually provided by around 5 BIG companies - for example mobile phones networks : EE (Orange &amp; T-Mobile), Vodafone, O2, Virgin, Three.\n\nThese companies are in such fierce competition that affiliate payouts are incredible (when approved), \u00a350-\u00a3120 is normal for a single user and to continue the example it is relatively easy (a couple hours of work) to access affiliate links for every single network. \n\nPPC and SEO can be very fierce competition on google.co.uk but if you can play it smart or work from a different angle (generate leads to be monetised via affiliate offers etc) then there's a lot of money to be made\n\nAnd that's without getting into the financial affiliate marketing industry...\n","800":"I can buy some with paypal goods and services, something like $45 paypal for $50 Amazon GC\n\nHere's my profile  http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2wbsny\/ufsp4ever_gcx_rep_profile\/","801":"Well, a bluray box set of a tv series actually.

By nature, Google needs to save information about you in order to serve you better targeted advertising.  If\/when consumers begin to care more about their privacy, this might spell trouble.  It seems like, even before that happens though, more and more, companies are harvesting data audio on people's private conversations in their homes (Samsung's smart TV's, Amazon's echo, Facebook's Android app, etc), and it seems like a backlash against this data gathering is inevitable.

They seem sturdy enough besides the plug in, but that easily replaceable like you said. I think I'm going to search on Amazon and find the best value for the reviews. ","850":"I was eastbound on I-40 near the New Mexico border around 6:45 pm in Fall 2013.  Arizona does not adhere to daylight savings time, and it was nautical dusk; speed limit is 75 mph.  I passed a semi-truck that was probably doing about 70 while we were going uphill.  There was not much speed differential, so it blocked my view of anything beyond the freeway for a prolonged period.  When we crested the hill, I could see taillights about a half-mile ahead.  I don't know if the horse was in the road the entire time and I was looking over it, given I was coming downhill, or if it ran in front of the semi: by the time I saw it, it was so close I was looking at its lower torso and upper legs -- I still don't know which way it was headed.  Fortunately, I had no time to react -- if I had decelerated, it may have come through the windshield, rather than taking out the glass while the body went over the car.  One instant, I saw it; the next instant, everything was dark (it displaced the battery, partially visible behind the passenger headlight area; and pushed the radiator, displacing the alternator) and I felt a burst of warm air as the windshield and moonroof imploded. It hit again in the back of the roof, popping out the rear driver's side glass panel.  A smaller Jeep Patriot was behind my Grand Cherokee: it hit the carcass, and the Patriot's airbags deployed (mine did not).  So casualties were one horse and two Jeeps; three humans (two people in the Patriot plus me in my Grand Cherokee) were relatively unscathed.  I asked the trooper if wild horses were in the area, and he told me yes, but I've since learned most wild mustangs are in NW AZ; the area where the accident occurred traverses Reservations, and I don't know if tribal law requires fencing.\n\nBack on subject:  in the late-1990s, I was at a party and mentioned my 1988 Olds Trofeo had 184K miles (I sold it shortly thereafter, as the a\/c compressor failed, and fixing it (and converting the freon system) was beyond the value of the vehicle, even though it was mechanically strong -- the a\/c compressor on the Jeep failed six months prior to the accident, but I was able to order OEM parts from Amazon and have it repaired for about 1\/3 of the original quote).  An artist at the party commented that he had never owned a car with less than 200K miles.  Since that time, I've purchased two vehicles with over 100K miles on them at the time of purchase.  As many aftermarket warranties are not written on cars with more than 100K miles, that's usually a depreciation point.  There are some maintenance issues at about 120K, so plan for that, and be leery of cars 10 - 12K miles after a major maintenance interval without maintenance records (as maintenance may be deferred).  Cars have gotten more reliable (but less DIY-friendly), and Internet forums on specific models makes it easy to figure out typical maintenance issues. \n\n","851":"&gt; Bitcoins, aside from being far too volatile to be taken seriously\n\nWhich is what makes the coinbase example I gave interesting....you don't hold it very long....just enough time to complete the transaction.

If the sell through rate is awesome, I'll generally do it, unless it's hard to ship or requires a lot of time, etc.  For example, I'll pick up books that I only profit a few bucks on because I'm sending boxes in to Amazon all the time anyway, so it's quick and easy to list them and toss them in the box.  If it's riskier, I'll take into consideration things like how long I will have to store it, how easy is it to ship, etc.  \n\nMainly, I'll accept a lower margin on Amazon items because of the ease of everything, but on ebay, I shoot for a minimum of 3 times my investment, but generally get 5-10x or more.  Depends on how much the item costs, too, and how far behind I am listing on ebay.  If I'm all caught up, I might pick something up with a lower margin if it's an easy sell, but if I'm behind, maybe not.  Depends on how much money I feel like tying up that day or how adventurous I'm feeling.  \n\nDepends on the category, too.  My main focus is clothing and shoes, but I do a fair amount of other crap, too.  So I have clothing down to a science and can list it really quickly, so I might take a lower margin just because I know I can move it easily, but if it's something that I don't sell often, and requires me to research more, etc., I will do it if I have time for that.","881":"I was just looking at what already is on Amazon and the sales rank for those books is really low.

You can promote pretty much anything instantly (hard to find standalone affiliate programmes for some products).\n\n2. Compared with most of the scammy looking landing pages offered by many affiliate programmes, Amazon's site converts a lot better as they're pretty much the most trusted brand out there (this often cancels out the low commission if you can get enough conversions, IMO).\n\nHaving said that, IMO Amazon should be used as one of multiple revenue sources on a site. I've personally built sites around Amazon's affiliate programme before (i.e. a classic review site) and honestly, it's an absolutely nightmare.\n\nThe problem is that you're 100% reliant on search engine traffic and always will be. Even if you can build an email list like you suggest, it's pretty pointless if you're only ever going to blast crappy $20 Amazon products to your list. You might make a dollar here and there, but personally I think that the effort outweighs the reward (unless you really know what you're doing).\n\nMy suggestion would be to instead, build a site around a topic you give a crap amount, that also has potential to earn from standalone (higher commission) affiliate products\/services and mainly focus on those.\n\nIf you write a blog post one day and happen to mention the food blender you personally use for instance, or if you fancy reviewing products here and there, feel free to shove an Amazon affiliate link in your post. Just don't put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak.","923":"Exactly! I'm on the other end of it all.  I own a business that is niche and I offer an affiliate program, my average sale is 100 dollars and the commission I pay is 25%.\n\nThere's a lot better affiliate programs out there that Amazon. ","924":"Hey, I'm gonna be spontaneous as you today but I'm having trouble with Amazon Associates. \nI need to create website first and then apply to the program or is there any other way around so I can add my site later?","925":"I do not have an Amazon link front and center because as of right now there is no Amazon link.  They are such a pain. But you did make me realize I should indicate that it's a pre-order for a certain discount, so thank you for that!\n\nAs for color, I suppose I agree, but I'm not really sure where I should introduce it.  I just got *rid* of the site logo because a lot of people said it made the website look old, which I didn't understand.  Someone suggested colored buttons, but unfortunately squarespace doesn't support that.","926":"Clickbank has stood the test of time when other affiliate networks have fallen due to an inability to pay their affiliates or other shady shit going on.\n\nWith that said, the majority of Clickbank products (from what I've seen) is informational. Honestly, I don't feel great about promoting shitty ebooks. Amazon might pay lower commissions but it is trusted more by buyers as opposed to a crappy landing page with \"As seen on TV\" logos. Not trying to knock down Clickbank as for the most part, they have a good reputation within the affiliate marketing industry.\n\nI think that the best route to go as an affiliate is to reach out to the advertisers within your niche. You can see who they are by the ads on the side of Google when you do a search for your keyword\/niche. Reach out to them and see if you can form some type of deal where you promote their products on your site and are compensated a higher % for every sale. If that sounds like too much work, you can probably just offer them ad space on your website. Of course, this is all predicated on the idea that your website is getting traffic, whether paid or organic.\n\nI haven't done this yet but will be doing it soon after my website is established in my niche. If successful, I might make it into a case study.","927":"If you use credit cards for almost all purchases (I do as a convenience) generating 50 transactions or more per month is nothing out of the ordinary. Just work lunches 5 times a week gets you 20 transactions. Groceries once per week another 4. Sometimes a few additional food purchases midweek. Now you're up to about 30. Add your recurring monthly bills and you're at about 35. Go out a few times per month and we're now hitting 40+ (one outing can easily result in multiple swipes: concert, bar tab, parking). Then you buy a few items from Amazon or elsewhere (clothing, home supplies, etc) &amp; fill up your car a few times and you're over 50. Then let's say you go skiing or pay to play in some sports league &amp; you're pushing 60.\n\nI'm good at managing my finances and save a good chunk every month yet I still generate 50+ transactions every month. If I go on a trip it can be significantly more. I think a lot depends on how active you are. If you just go to work and come home to play video games or read then yes, 50 transactions might seem like a lot. However, if you have a decently active lifestyle it's not at all and doesn't mean you're mismanaging your finances.\n\nI know this is a bit of a tangent that isn't directly related to the original post (I'm not defending Acorns as their fees are too high), but  thought I'll just address your point.","928":"No offense to \/r\/Entrepeneur but there are a lot better place to learn about affiliate marketing than here.  WickedFire, DigitalPoint, GFY's Mainstream forum, BHW or a host of other places.  \n\nAnd if anyone was focusing solely on Amazon it's a good indication that they need to broaden their horizons.  \/r\/Entrepreneur is definitely a great companion resource (for affiliate marketers in general) to help you put everything together and give you some ideas. \n\nSidenote:  Clickbank (and it's products) is pretty close to Amazon when it comes to over saturation.  Smaller networks with are where it's at.  ","929":"Seriously thrifting is the tip of the flipping iceberg. I started out thrifting about 10 years ago.

I am a tough negotiator in a rural area so I would talk them down to 5k from 15k all the time. I have not bought an estate in 2 or 3 years.\n\nAbout a year ago I started going to auctions. Auctions are a breeze. You get there before they start and either start scanning or searching eBay and Amazon.  Look up model numbers, etc. Pick the things you want to buy, set a budget, and rock that shit. \n\nI decided that sitting at home all day was killing me so I went out and got a full time job selling cars. I solely do retail arbitrage and retail liquidation now.  Shit that I don't have to put a lot of work into.

Amazon is big, rather huge. This means when an affiliate link is clicked there is a broader chance of more sale  apart from the product you are promoting. All you need to do is make sure you have convinced the user enough to click on the product, even if that product sale is not achieved there is a chance of sale from other product from Amazon by the same user.\n\nAnother point being, trust. People know and trust amazon ( or rather any well known e-commerce site you are promoting ). All you need to do is convince the user about the product, in other cases once the user clicks apart from product the user needs to be convinced that the site does look genuine enough for him\/her to do the purchase. No matter how good you are with telling the user about the product you are promoting, if the site isn't appealing to the user they would not want to take a chance on it.\n\nI still agree on your point of more commission means better marketing can be done and you are well rewarded but Amazon shouldn't be neglected. \n\nI would like to add this to your argument, One could build a few amazon sites and concentrate on other better paying products as they too pay well instead of 100% efforts on Amazon affiliate sites.\n\nBut for start it isn't bad to start with Amazon site.

This is different from keyed transactions, which usually end up costing the merchant more. We have been successfully using 1 cent transactions without incurring any fees from the credit card processing company. The program works by behaving as a merchant, emulating the transactions and receiving the funds into our account. Then we move those funds back to the high-yield account and do it all over again the next month.

I would kind of like to get another Amex card due to some of the offers that I can get on each one of my cards, but I've heard if you ask for too much or too many cards they will do a review and shut you down (it is not very easy for me to prove my income level).","1003":"I bought some cereal marshmallows off Amazon about a year ago.  They're great to add to more adult cereals or hot chocolate.\n\nMy marshmallows went extremely stale about a week after opening the bag.  At $3\/lb., it's not the end of the world, but I recall paying much more than that on Amazon.  The worst thing is that I put them in my cereal without knowing that they were stale.\n\nTo me, the only thing worse than a stale cereal marshmallow would be a cock in my mouth.  In hindsight, I should have vacuum-packed them in small batches right after opening.","1004":"Amazon pay for corporate employees is terrible though. My dad interviewed there 3-4 years ago and they offered him the same title he currently had, and 25k less a year, all while living in California.

Can we just be honest for a second here. No one on this subreddit is interested in buying a smoothie blender =\/.\n\nSo first, did I read that right? You are doing guest posts with your content on someone elses site? Guest posts with 100% duplicate content? This will get you nowhere, and will more than likely end up damaging your SEO efforts.\n\nSecond, of course quality content is important. However, your site has barely any content on it. A few 1000 word articles is nothing. Do you honestly mean to tell me that on the second day of your sites existence, with less than 10k words of content, it is already ranked in google and getting 100 clicks from google search daily? Stop right there, because that is not happening.\n\nThe entire point of your site is to drive traffic to Amazon right? You SHOULD be worried about the affiliate stuff. Always be optimizing while at the same time providing value.\n\nProbably the only solid advice here is that when starting a new site, the best way to go about getting your first traffic is to go heavy on social media. This traffic is great but will not rank you in Google on the second day of your sites life.\n\nHarsh Reality, Brought to you by: Me\n\nEdit: I found out how you are getting sales. It certainly is not because of this site it is because you are cookie stuffing reddit. Do not be an idiot man, you will get banned from the Amazon program.
