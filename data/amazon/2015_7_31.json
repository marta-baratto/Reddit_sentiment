{"id":"3erl2h","author":"rednibia","body":"Okay, so this is not frugal living on the same level as some of you, but I have gotten a tremendous value over the last few years using a simple strategy.\n\nStep 1 - Purchase a Roku - or Chromecast, or even just a cable that connects directly between your computer and TV. I prefer something with a remote though.\n\nStep 2 - Find a group of people, everyone buys something. For example, one of you buys Hulu, someone else buys Netflix. Someone else gets Amazon Prime.\n\nStep 3 - DITCH CABLE. Internet ONLY. If you're really creative, you can even pair an unlimited data plan on your phone with a hot spot. I did this for a little while, but roommates wanted fios.\n\nStep 4 - Buy a digital antenna. This will get you a lot of local stations, especially important if you like sports.\n\nStep 5 - Fill in the blanks. You can use itunes or vudu to purchase what's not available in the subscription based services.\n\nSpecial note for Vudu: You can purchase lots of movies that are otherwise ~$20 for $3. Just buy the digital code off of someone who purchased the blu ray. You can also scan your own DVDs/Blu-Rays at walmart and unlock them for a very low fee. Then... SELL your DVDs/Blu-rays off. This actually netted me a profit big time.\n\n\nI know cord-cutting is it's own thing. I just thought I would give a run down of what I do. I also did some questionable \"gray market\" tactics - like purchasing the netflix DVD subscription and scanning them and returning them for vudu. Using library DVDs, friends and family's DVDs. Exchanging DVDs with others online(I scan mine for you, you scan yours for mine). This has net me over 1000 movies. Overall while I'd say my setup is vastly superior to people who have just a cable/hbo subscription, I have over the years paid way less than them, and have built up ownership of tons of content.\n\nThe only people who best me in value are people who torrent - which is 100% illegal.","name":"t3_3erl2h","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-27 14:49:19","week":31}

{"id":"3ese77","author":"num1DadYo","body":"I'll make the long story as short as possible.  Basically I did it with luck and a little help from Google and Amazon.  It involves trading options.  If you don't know what those are you might have to look it up.  Options are one category of derivatives that derive their intrinsic value from the market price of a stock.  Any radio host or advice I've read about saving for retirement strongly discourages trading options because of the high risk.  It’s not like holding a stock that gains or loses the amount based on the price of that stock.  Options are a great way to get a high return for a smaller amount of money than it would be to own a stock.\n\nAnyway, we owed around $21,000 in credit card debt.  Half of it was when we had consolidated our debt a couple years ago into a personal loan that was set to expire Sept 2017.  It was mainly from not managing our cash when we were younger and consolidating like 7 credit cards into one payment.  The other half was from when we had accumulated over $11,000 in credit card debt since we had moved into our first house.  We had purchased our first home last year and didn’t have cash due to child care expenses and needed some appliances and so forth.  Last year we struggled with cash quite a bit due to child care expenses and old car repairs hence the large debt rebuild up.\n\nI had cashed out my self-directed IRA last year in order to have a down payment for our first house.  After I cashed it out I had just under $398.17 left in my self-directed IRA.  In the scheme of things $398 is not a lot of money.  In July of last year I was bored at work and said screw it I’m buying a leap option (more than 1 yr) for Apple.  The option cost me $345.77 which left me with just $52.40 in my IRA.  I forgot about it and didn’t really check on it for a couple months.  I started checking on it back in Oct and noticed that the stock had gone up and my option was worth a little more.  I finally sold it for $729 in Nov.  I made a pretty decent return and now had a little more than $800 to trade.  I got excited and said “What the heck let’s invest again in Apple and a little Disney.”  I then made another couple hundred dollars.\n\nThen I played the earnings season back in Jan and did really well.  I struck some solid trades with Twitter, Disney, and Cisco.  I’m not a pro trader but I got my account up to $3000 from the $398 I started with about 6 months earlier.  Then I stopped for several months after a couple small loses and I didn’t want to lose what I had gained.\n\nNow we can fast forward to Jul of this year.  I had forgotten about earnings coming out in Jul but I felt like gambling a little bit (in the market).  I mean that’s basically what it is.  On Jul 13, I bought 3 options for Google in the middle of the day because the stock was doing really well and I figured maybe I could coat tail on it and gain a couple hundred bucks.  I ended up selling it the next day for a profit of $1100.  I was very happy.  I got so excited I bought another 3 options right before the market closed that same day.  The next day the stock dropped a little and I was down but then I looked at what was going on and noticed that their earnings was coming up so I held tight.  The next morning the stock shot up again and I made another $1000.  I should have stopped there.  The earnings were coming out after the market closed that day and I’ve been told and read never to buy at earnings because it could go either way.  I felt good about this so I bought 3 more options for $1400.  The next morning I couldn’t believe it.  The stock was up a lot and I sold right away.  I was shaking.  I made $11,735 !!!.  I told my wife right away,  I didn’t know what to think.  Then I thought about the debt we owed and how we could improve our monthly cash flow by paying off that $441 payment we make each month until Sep 2017.  I made the decision to cash out, pay the 10% penalty and pay off a huge debt we owed.\n\nIt felt really good paying that off.  It was a huge boulder lifted off one of our shoulders.  I figured now we just have to worry about the $11,000 in credit debt, and that I could live with.  I wasn’t happy about our debt but when you don’t have any cash and need things what else can you do?  I had a balance of about $5700 in my IRA now.  I noticed that Apple and Amazon were coming out with their earnings next week.  I thought to myself, how cool would that be to make another couple grand.  I told my wife and she said let’s see what happens.  I bought 3 options for Apple for $800 and 3 options for Amazon for $1400.  Apple’s came out with disappointment.  I’m down $740 now and holding tight to see if I can make any of my losses back.  The options expire in a couple weeks and are basically worthless now so it doesn’t hurt to hold on.  About 10 min before the market closed I decided to gamble a little more on Amazon and bought 1 more option.  Good thing I did, Amazon did really good on earnings.  I looked at the after-hours trading and I was up $13,000 !!!  I told my wife and she was excited as well.  The market opened and people sold like crazy.  I ended up only profiting $7,000 from it.  But still pretty good.  I then made the decision to pay off our largest credit card of $9,100 which I’ll be doing tomorrow.\n\nWhat a relief, I feel like we can finally be normal and not worry about finances this year.  Yeah we are still paying daycare expenses, but my wife needs a new car and we have to start paying back our student loans.  I don’t think we could manage it with all that extra debt.  We are making a good living now and much more responsible with our money so my hope is we don't fall into that pit again.  We still owe around $1900 for the one credit card but honestly that's peanuts compared to what we did owe.\n\nThis is my own experience and trades like that are rare, so please don’t expect returns like that if you decide to trade options.\n\nTL;DR – Started with a little cash, got lucky with a couple trades in the stock market, paid off $19,200 in credit card debt.","name":"t3_3ese77","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-27 18:41:18","week":31}

Here's how the winner was selected... I put the list of names into random.org. The higher on the list you are the bigger the prize you will receive. If you aren't in the top 7 you don't get anything. \n\n*So, the list has been randomized! Sadly after reviewing each of the winners, one of them has been disqualified for having 0 activity on their account, so the person in 8th place will take their spot.*\n\nFirst prize: $10 Amazon - /u/applefruit12\n\nSecond prize: $5 Amazon - /u/lonewolf80\n\n3rd - 7th Prize $1 Amazon - /u/Nicolas77, /u/SawBo /u/gamerbryan /u/deefx /u/cortex87\n\nCongrats to the winners! Want to see the randomized list? Click [here](http://prntscr.com/7xp6jn)\n\nOh, and shout out to Itseirbear for coming in 42nd place on the winners list!!! \n\nThis was still very exciting, and even though I am done with giveaways for the summer, I will still be around GCX making some trades :). Feel free to comment below with other ideas for future giveaways (I'm running out). All winners will get a PM within 48 hours with their GCs! \n\nOh, and want to see the form responses?

We should be in the top 5 within a couple of months and gaining a lot of organic traffic. As an SEO, I'm not the savviest business owner and I'm trying to figure out how to get conversions up. \n\nWe're building other inbound marketing channels as well now and are starting to treat the site as a full on business, as we believe we can make a large sum of money if we do it right. \n\nBasically I'm trying to figure out other people's opinions as we are not converting much of our traffic (the site uses affiliate programs like Amazon and retailers in the niche). Should we keep it affiliate and continue to scale traffic and hope that as more traffic comes it affiliate sales will also increase? Should we drop sell? Should we whole sale?

Is there a way to have an Amazon store set up on your site that appears you are the one actually selling the products?\n\nAny help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

{"id":"3evwha","author":"gundog48","body":"I've been meaning to do this for years, but to be honest, I'm very hesitant to take the risk. I was hoping to get into reselling imported goods from sites like Alibaba, either through eBay, Amazon or both. I came across some money I had from selling some Bitcoin ages ago and I've decided this is going to be my separate business fund!\n\nWhat I'm looking to achieve from this:\n\n* Becoming familiar with importing goods from abroad, especially with regards to arranging shipping\n\n* Get a general feel for the whole process\n\n* Get a little confidence\n\n* Make a small profit to reinvest, obviously it's not going to be a lot due to the amount of money going in\n\nAfter this, I'll feel happier to make a bigger investment out of my own pocket.\n\nSo, I like in the UK, I've got around $300. Won't buy a lot, but that's okay with me. The problem I'm having is that most of the time the MOQs are too high, or the profit margins are way too low. The market is saturated with cheap electronics, and most things are being sold for almost the buying price, then you have to factor in shipping to you and the customer and my own time and effort fulfilling the orders.\n\nI've looked at everything from headscarfs to sugar and there's just so much to choose from. My best lead so far has been palm sugar which I can buy for $2.30/Kg from Indonesia (minus shipping+tax) or $4-5/Kg from the EU shipped for around $35 at quantities of around 100Kg. With the EUR/GBP exchange rate at the moment, this doesn't seem like a bad idea. Though I may have to repackage, and I'll have to find a place for 100Kg of sugar! I should easily be able to sell it on at $11.50/Kg, which would have to include shipping, but that's one of the best margins I've seen so far!\n\nI feel like I'm probably going to get laughed at here because it's pretty small time, and I'm probably going about it the wrong way. Really I want something fairly inexpensive, small, and that I'll be able to make a decent margin on. How do you guys sift through it all to decide what to sell?","name":"t3_3evwha","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-28 13:15:47","week":31}

{"id":"3ex04i","author":"xyzskk3","body":"So, I decided to apply for two hotel cards today - Chase Hyatt (2 Free nights + Statement Credit) and Chase IHG (60K Points + Statement Credit, hopefully get it matched with 80K points later). \n\nCK Score 730+ (Used to be ~800). Got dented due to a recent high balance statement to fund Citigold (paid off later). \n\nI already have the following cards with chase: \n\n* Ink Plus (5/2015) - 5K CL\n\n* United Explorer (4/2015) - 20K CL\n\n* Sapphire (12/2013) - 25K CL\n\n* Amazon (8/2009) - ~5.5K CL\n\n* Freedom  (8/2009) - ~8.5K CL\n\nI applied to Hyatt Card (first) and IHG Card (second) using separate browsers. \n\nFor Hyatt they asked me to call immediately to talk to a customer service specialist. For IHG, it said application needs further review, no instruction to call. \n\nI called for Hyatt thinking it is just id verification. The agent said she can approve only after transferring credit from another card and I said okay. But then, she came back and said I applied for too many cards this year (11 cards total, including a few AU accounts), and \"their system\" denied the application. \n\nI wanted to try my luck again, and made second call after an hour or so, and this time the representative started saying the application was denied due to too many accounts, but he would try and see what he can do. After a few routine questions and couple of holds he moved about 10K from sapphire to Hyatt and I was approved !!\n\nIHG is still under review, and I didn't call. I am wondering if I should call or just wait for their letter. Any suggestions ?\n\nUpdate - No luck with the second card. \n=========================\n\n* Called the recon twice regarding the IHG card. The first time they already told me that they have sent me a decline letter citing too many new accounts, and said they cannot do anything about it. \n* Second time, the rep said she already sees that I called before, and if there is anything else that she could do for me. I requested if she can reconsider the card by moving the credit around. They asked me the usual questions but said no at the end.  I am glad I got at least one card out of this hard pull. \n\nI will go easy on chase for next 6 months or so, I guess. \n\nUpdate 2 - Success after 3rd recon call for the second card.\n======================================\n\nThe representative initially said the card is denied, but after I politely asked if there is anyway I can transfer the credit from another card, he agreed to do it. He had to send me to the identity verification one more time, but it all worked in the end. \n\n\nLessons learnt:\n==========\n\n* Total credit limit with Chase seems to be a real thing. \n\n* The rep said I can also include my spouse's income in the statement if I want.\n\n* Multiple recons seems to work, but it is pretty hard because they can see that you have called them before.\n\n\n ","name":"t3_3ex04i","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-07-28 18:39:49","week":31}

If you read the full post [on our ecommerce turnaround](http://ecomcrew.com/i-purchased-icewraps-com-5-months-ago-today-how-is-it-going/), we also cover a variety of topics on the platforms, channels and growth data for full transparency on this project. \n\nWe've been kicking around the idea of publicly analyzing businesses for sale, as we've both had seen dozens (hundreds?) of P&amp;L statements and business models for various ecom and related businesses. Some have been better than others, while we don't even know what the buyers were thinking in the worst case ones. We would love your feedback on if you would like a weekly format of dissecting a business to the working parts and rating it a \"Thumbs up\" or \"Thumbs down\" purchase.\n\nJust to kick start the conversation, some things we hold dear in evaluating a business purchase include:\n\n* Not ever paying more than a 3X valuation and ideally, 2X max\n* \"Barely spends money on marketing\" = Probably PPC their brains out\n* If you don't understand SEO, you have no business in the industry\n* One hit wonder Amazon businesses = playing with fire\n* \"Owner barely spends any time\" = I have some real estate on the moon to sell to you..\n\nWe don't claim to be the end all experts however, so please add your own advice, as we always have willing ears as well!\n\nEdit: Mike's replies will be under his username of *mikejackness*\n","name":"t3_3exewo","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-28 20:19:10","week":31}

Hammocks** A quick Alibaba search and I found $2 hammocks selling for $10+ on eBay and high end hammocks selling for well over $100.  I think everything from cheap hammocks to custom high quality hammocks could generate a profit.\n\n**2. Reclaimed furniture**  Stunning to look at and a quick eBay search I found a basic coffee table made from reclaimed wood selling for over £100 with over 20 having been sold.  It is environmentally friendly, looks good, custom designs are possible and branding is not required.  It is however bulky and you can never be 100% sure of the final product as every item will be unique.\n\n**3.Cast metal Bathtubs/Wooden Bathtubs** These items are going cost a few thousand dollars to purchase the wooden ones less so.  A quick search shows these selling for $3000 to $10000+ with an entry price on Alibaba for $1200+ not a great % return but solid profit on each one sold.  The wooden ones seems to sell for almost as much.\n\n**4.ISO Container conversions** Sell old ISO containers can generate profit however if you have the time space and required skills, ISO conversions can be extremely lucrative.  This is obviously extremely niche but for the right person could be very profitable.\n\n**5.Plant Pots** I bought some plant pots recently  and was surprised at how much they costs, large plant pots cost under a dollar to buy and sell on eBay and Amazon for over $10 each.  Ceramic ones are more expensive and bulky but still give good profit margins. \n\nThis is from a couple of hours of searching so it is by no means scrutinised at all and due diligence is required so I would definitely do my own research before investing in or buying anything from Alibaba and its always a good idea to order samples and test the market before investing a great deal of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3f5vas","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-30 16:16:57","week":31}

As I eluded to earlier, the area I'm in is prime for a locally owned bookstore.  The only literature resource available within a 20 mile radius is Walmart.

(Amazon, Gamestop, Etc.) \n\nThere has also been some pretty positive publicity for the company coming out of this months EVO fighting game tournament.   http://www.gamesradar.com/momochi-gamerbee-evo-final/\nLong story short, in the finals one players Razor fight stick broke, and he ended up using a Madcatz controller to win the next two games and seal the title.  \n\nAnyhow, it's a penny stock with potential to boom in the next 3-4 months.  And it's right back where it was when I first posted about it.  \n\nSo ask yourself one simple question.\n\nDo you want a yacht?  Because buying MCZ is how you get one.  \n\n","name":"t3_3f6r31","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","created_utc":"2015-07-30 19:57:09","week":31}

{"id":"3f8rxl","author":"itautomaton","body":"When I started flipping on Amazon I was pretty damn lazy about it. Used appliances from thrift stores sold as Like New or New. Pushing the line on conditions regularly.  \n\nAs it became more of a full-time business I stopped screwing around and learned from others  to be more conservative and avoid the big no-no's but still as flippers we lack the documentation of purchase orders for those items we flip even if they are legit. I actually order about 50% of my inventory from wholesalers but that still exposes me to a claim with zero documentation. \n\nThe other day I got a listing removed for being inauthentic, first one ever in 3 years (I've had some for condition violations, 3 in 3 years for condition violations). It was a Brand New and Sealed game listed as such - but I got it at a thrift store! So now I have no paper trail to back me up. I do have some generic \"bulk\" orders from wholesalers that maybe I could say it was included in but now I've read that Amazon doesn't even respect all the wholesaling vendors out there. \n\nI do about 1500 units per month now and have been for a few months, my volume has been increasing and I have near perfect feedback (99%) and offer refunds to any unsatisfied customers. I wonder if it is normal at this higher volume to get those types of claims regularly (never had an A to Z claim thankfully). I'm over 97% on perfect orders under performance guidelines. Still, if Amazon pushed me to produce documentation I'm fairly screwed. \n\nSo I'm stuck wondering what are the odds they would do this? Push for more info or ban my account preemptively? It is my livelihood and I have several employees, I've already started trying to cross-sell into Ebay and other channels just to diversify.\n\n\n","name":"t3_3f8rxl","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-31 04:58:20","week":31}

{"id":"3fakxz","author":"bullsplaytonight","body":"I was making a large Amazon purchase a few days ago and finally succumbed the offer of $x amount of your purchase by applying for the Amazon Chase card. I went through and did the application, but, believe it or not, my computer melted down right after I hit submit. I waited until yesterday for some sort of email, and when none came I went and called the \"backdoor\" activations line for Chase. \n\nI explained the glitch to the rep, who looked up my application while I was flipping through emails. He couldn't find one in the system, but I did find an email from CreditKarma letting me know that I had a new credit inquiry. I asked the rep to hang on while I logged into CK to verify that it was Chase. It was, and the rep insisted that I didn't have an application sitting with them. I asked for his advise and he suggested that I run the application again.\n\nThis time, there were no crashes and I was approved instantly with a nice credit limit. I made my purchase and went about my day. This morning, I see an email that came through in the middle of the night letting me know that I was approved for the card with a different credit limit of about $500 more. When I logged onto my Chase account this morning, I'm showing two Amazon cards with different last 4 numbers, different credit limits, and only one of them is showing my Amazon purchase.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I still only have the one hard inquiry on my report. But how can I go about rectifying this situation? I only want the one card, and two is likely hurting that \"average age of credit\" factor that I'm working to rebuild. Any help is appreciated.

{"id":"3farim","author":"strmd1","body":"Hi guys. I'm new to r/entrepreneur and this is my first post here, hoping to find a few useful tips from professional affiliates. \n\n**First, some details:**\n\nAbout a month ago, I started a product review website designed for Amazon affiliates program. I am passionate about aircrafts and flying, and based on that, I chose the high-end drones niche. After a lot of research on the best selling $100+ drones on Amazon, finding proper images and ranking products based on specifications in a comparison table, I started writing the reviews. It turned out that writing about stuff I wanted to buy for myself was quite natural. Next, I bought a domain name and hosting, installed Wordpress, found a proper theme and set up the website. \n\n**The problem:**\n\nI know almost nothing about SEO, marketing and attracting audience! I find these things quite complicated, and don't know where to start or what to do first. Plus, I'm in the process of relocating to other country, where I will be living for the next 6 months, working full time. This will reduce most of the spare time I used to have up until now and the website will not be on my list of priorities.     \n\n**What I have now**:\n\n   - a responsive website created last month with almost 0 traffic\n\n   - a home page that needs some tweaking\n\n   - a review section containing 5 published product reviews, about 1000 words each + 3 other unpublished ones\n\n   - a section with short reviews for accessories\n\n   - a top 5 ranking page with a comparison table\n\n   - a beginners guide page\n\n   - a video section\n\n   - social media share buttons ( only created a Pinterest account and linked it to the website)\n\n   - haven't submitted the website to the Amazon Affiliate program yet (also, buy from Amazon buttons and links still to be added)\n\n\n**What to do?**\n\nI do think the website has some potential. However, as I will have less and less time for this project from now on, I am inclined to sell it, as opposed to leave it aside and let it gather dust. The problem is that I don't know how much does it worth. I tried some online evaluation tools, like siteprice.com, but they returned a ridiculous price, not even covering the hosting.  \nWhat would you do? Or how much would you ask for something similar? \nThanks!\n   \n**tl;dr: built a niche review website with content; poor SEO and marketing skills and not enough time for this at the moment; what would it be the best thing to do?**\n","name":"t3_3farim","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-31 17:15:19","week":31}

{"id":"3fb70y","author":"mb3581","body":"I've been using AMZReviewTrader for a little over a month now.  It started out great and I thought it looked like a really promising way to get some decent items that I already needed or wanted for free or at a great discount.  I have been approved for and ordered about 7 or 8 items in the past couple of months, but have not gotten approval for anything new in the past 2 weeks.  I have always left 5 star reviews for both the products and the sellers because I have always felt that the few items I've purchased have warranted it.  \n\nI think my problems started out when I received a discount code for a flashlight.  I went to use the code and was informed by Amazon that it was expired.  I tried \"reporting\" a problem on the AMZRT website and emailed the seller directly.  I never got a response.  This has since happened 2 or 3 other times.  I then started getting emails from AMZRT saying that their records indicate I had ordered an item but have not left a review and if I wanted to continue getting awesome deals, I should leave a review.  I have replied to those emails, forwarded them to the sellers trying to explain my issues, and emailed AMZRT support directly but I have not once gotten any response from anyone.  \n\nMy point for this post is to first ask if anyone else has had these kinds of problems with AMZRT and what, if anything, can be done to resolve it.  Also,  I wanted this to serve as a sort of PSA regarding these types of sites.  I'm having to remind myself not to feel ripped off for somehow getting black-balled from something that was really too good to be true in the first place.  It was great while it lasted, and I'll continue making requests for a while longer hoping to hopefully get back in, but I'm not holding my breath.

{"id":"3fbacu","author":"ccccccccc9","body":"Some background first:\n\nI'm 33 and my wife is 36. When I met my wife, she was hugely in debt with credit cards thanks to some reckless spending habits. Fastforward five years and together we've gotten our shit together and shaved off around $50k thanks to both of us working secondary *and* tertiary jobs as well as managing our monthly expenses--though I'm sure we could do better on the latter somehow. Up until last week, I had things down to $13.1k in total credit debt. Then my wife's stupid fucking dog nearly died thanks to stealing human food, and then another $2k got tacked on overnight. So, I'm extremely discouraged as that's 4 months worth of debt progress erased as I'd been paying about $500 every month on debt. \n\nHere's my rundown on our combined monthly expenses:\n\nWife's monthly income - **$4000**\n\n*Wife's monthly expenses*\n\n* Rent &amp; utilities - $2400\n* Cell phone bill (for both of us) - $140\n* Internet - $70\n* Student loans (for both of us) - $470\n* Car insurance - $90\n* Monthly operating bills for secondary jobs - $120\n* Medical bills - $300\n* Gas/child/misc. expenses - $400\n\n--\n\nMy monthly income - **$3300** (average)\n\n*My monthly expenses*\n\n* Food/gas/misc. expenses - $1200\n* Bi-weekly house cleaning service - $200 (which will likely be cut)\n* Car payment - $450\n* Daycare - $850\n* Lawn service - $100 (which will likely be cut)\n* Paying down debt - $500\n\nOne complication is that my annual income can fluctuate and my pay schedule is erratic as I'm an adjunct instructor at multiple schools throughout the year along with some freelance work. $3300 is about the average, though. My wife's income is more or less secure.\n\nI have been working my ass off trying to find ways of saving on the weekly food and household expenses (like diapers and shit). At the moment, I'm using a combo of Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save and Costco to buy in bulk for a lot of stuff. I'm also using Target's red card/cartwheel/coupons to buy diapers and most groceries I can't buy in bulk like produce and whatnot. I cook 90% of our meals in bulk to parcel out over the week. Two years ago I bought a hybrid car to save on gas as I often have to drive a lot to get to my various jobs. \n\nThere's also two more complications. My wife popped out our first kid a couple years ago and we're still paying off the delivery bill with her HSA through work and also whatever extra there is in her paycheck. Almost forgot: We're also using FSA to help in paying for (some of) daycare expenses. The other complication is that our rent is going up by 3% for the house we're leasing. I know leasing a house for so much ($1900) isn't ideal to say the least, but we're locked in for another year and change. It's not like we can't move, but we're looking at possibly buying the house--though nowhere near capable of a down payment, obviously. It also seems like a guarantee that if we move it'd be another $5k-10k of debt tacked on for moving expenses.\n\nMore on the debt. At the moment I have $13.1k in original card debt with another $2k in vet bills for a total of $15.1k in total card debt. I have each card on 0% interest thanks to rotating balance transfers when one promotional rate ends I move it to another. My student loan debt is in the $55k range, but thankfully only 3% interest as my credit rating is solid. Both of us get freelance work on a semi-regular basis, which all goes toward debt. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-10k per year.\n\nSo, the reason I'm posting is to ask for feedback from anyone who is kind enough to read all of that crap and share their knowledge. Are we on the right track? Is there a better way to do this? We'd like to be out of debt ASAP so we can get money together to buy a house within a couple years. I don't want to look back on this in 10 years and think \"wow, I was really dumb about how I went about this.\" \n\nAny advice is very welcome.","name":"t3_3fbacu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-31 19:26:43","week":31}

He said that he was buying them online in packs of 10 from ebay or Amazon. This got me thinking that selling directly to locksmiths might be a good idea, and I found that based on my the pricing I was getting directly from China, I was able to sell packs of 10 (and single packs) much more cheaply than everyone else was, so I created [remotesmith.com](http://www.remotesmith.com/)\n\nThis website is primarily designed to go after locksmiths but it is also there for the general public, so I would love some feedback from the general public on what you like about the site and what you think I should change.

{"id":"cth8b3b","author":"Jed2Bed","body":"Tips:\n\n1. No annual fee\n2. Cash back rewards\n3. Optional: Sign-up bonus\n\nSince you'll be paying your bill *in full* every month, you can ignore the APR.  That'll only kick in if you roll your balance month-to-month.\n\nWhich card to get depends on your credit score and your spending habits. (If you don't know your credit score, set up an account at CreditKarma.com, which will give you an \"educational estimate\" of your score.)\n\nAssuming you have good credit (700's), I recommend the [Sallie Mae Mastercard](https://www.salliemae.com/credit-cards/sallie-mae-card/). 5% back on Gas, Groceries, and Amazon.com (Bookstores), $25 sign-up bonus. You don't need to have anything to do with Sallie Mae to get the card - it's issued by Barclays and just has the Sallie Mae logo. Points can be redeemed for a statement credit (lowers your bill).\n\nIf you have average credit (600's), I recommend you apply for Student cards.

{"id":"cti5ki0","author":"MELBOT87","body":"&gt;The fact that past jumps automation didn't break the system, does not guarantee safety in this regard.\n\nI never understood this argument. There is no evidence that humans will stop innovating and creating new goods and services to soak up excess demand. In fact, the entirety of human history supports it. Yet you (and others), with zero evidence and all of human history against you, think this time is different. It makes no sense.\n\n&gt;But there are also also plenty of smaller 'niches' - construction, maintenance, medicine, legal representation - all these should be seeing decreases in price from automation, but somehow they keep getting more expensive instead.\n\nThere could be multiple reasons for this. First, perhaps you exaggerate the effects of automation. Second, you may not be accounting for taxes and local regulations. Third, automation may cause prices to fall, but it could also see an increase in demand. Accounting software lowered the price of accounting services, but that only increased access to accounting services among a much larger base of the consumer and therefore there was more consumption of it. \n\n&gt;Meaning that the very small percentage of population that actually owns/controls means of production, distribution and pretty much everything else, suddenly finds that the vast majority of the rest of the human race is entirely unnecessary to their economy as a whole, being at best an overall drain requiring on average more in resources to support them, than they are able to give back.\n\nAgain, this makes no sense. Currently, what are the biggest companies in the world? Amazon, Apple, Google, Wal Mart - they create goods and services for the mass market. Their business models are based on mass consumption. If your fears about automation are true, all that means is that goods and services will plummet in price due to efficiency and competition and cost only a fraction of what they do currently. People will be able to afford much more with very little.That is what makes people richer.\n\n&gt;And my concerns is that at that point, for the first time in the history of the human race the 'upper class' will no longer need anything at all from the 'lower class' - and I am rather pessimistic as to what happens to the 'lower class' in that scenario, unless countries where that tipping point is reached are indoctrinated to more socialist values.\n\nAgain, this makes no sense. The only way companies can generate wealth is by selling goods and services. If nobody consumes those goods and services, then no revenue and no profits can be gained. There cannot be a situation where companies are simultaneously growing profits and seeing a collapse in consumption. The areas where automation might take over will be areas of extreme competition and high consumer demand. So it will just increase overall demand.","name":"t1_cti5ki0","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2015-07-27 22:14:25","week":31}

I look back at the buyers eBay feedback and suddenly there are like 4 or 5 negative reviews. I cited these in my appeal to Paypal and eBay but with no success and in the end I had a fistful of useless Amazon vouchers and no cash to show for it. It was somewhere in the region of £180.

{"id":"cti9x9l","author":"Nikhilvoid","body":"Just a few companies are driving the gains in major U.S. stock indexes this year, raising fresh concerns about the health of the market’s advance.\n\nSix firms— Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Netflix Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc.—now account for more than half of the $664 billion in value added this year to the Nasdaq Composite Index, according to data compiled by brokerage firm JonesTrading.\n\nAmazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, Gilead and Walt Disney Co. account for more than all of the $199 billion in market-capitalization gains in the S&amp;P 500.\n\nThe concentrated gains are spurring concerns that soft trading in much of the market could presage a pullback in the indexes. Many investors see echoes of prior market tops—including the 2007 peak and the late 1990s frenzy—when fewer and fewer stocks lifted the broader market. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1% this year while the Nasdaq has gained 7.4%.\n\nOther indicators are also flashing yellow. In the Nasdaq, falling stocks have outnumbered rising stocks this year, sending the “advance-decline line” into negative territory, a phenomenon that has come before market downturns in the past, investors and analysts said.\n\nLast Monday, as the S&amp;P approached a record, nearly as many stocks hit one-year lows as one-year highs, according to Ned Davis Research, another sometime precursor to rocky times and a flip from 2014 and 2013 when the market rose more broadly. The S&amp;P is 2.4% below its May 21 record high. The Nasdaq hit an all-time high last Monday and has since fallen 2.5%.\n\nA rally driven by just a handful of stocks doesn’t necessarily mean the market has turned unhealthy or that shares will fall. Indeed, skeptics have been warning practically since stocks began their six-year-long rally in the spring of 2009 that a pullback was imminent, citing factors ranging from an uneven economic recovery to rising price/earnings ratios.\n\nStill, many analysts are uncomfortable with the widening divergence between the top gainers and the rest of the market. Many see a stock market that is on the cusp of a shift— though of course no one can predict just what will happen.\n\n“It can go one of two ways: Either the whole market tanks…or the market broadens out,” said Scott Migliori, who manages the $740 million AllianzGI Focused Growth fund. “The rubber band has been stretched too far.”\n\nENLARGE\nMr. Migliori said he has been trimming holdings of Internet and biotechnology stocks. Apple, Amazon and Facebook were among the fund’s top five holdings as of May 31, according to Morningstar.\n\nMr. Migliori said he has moved into beaten-down industrial stocks, as well as shares of health-care companies that have lagged behind the recent rally.\n\nEarlier periods in the postcrisis advance were marked by broader stock rallies. In 2013, the Nasdaq soared 38%, with the top three stocks contributing 17% of the gains, according to JonesTrading. The S&amp;P 500 gained 30% that year, with the top three stocks contributing 8%.\n\nGains in both indexes were more concentrated last year, though still less so than this year. The Nasdaq rose 13% in 2014, with the top three gainers accounting for 32% of the gains. The S&amp;P was up 11%, with the top three gainers contributing 16%.\n\n“In 2013 and 2014, you had these gangbuster years for the market and everything went up,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “You have more money chasing fewer stocks now.”\n\nThis year, with the Nasdaq up 7.4%, the top three—Amazon, Google and Apple—have accounted for 37% of that gain. Amazon has surged 71%, adding $104 billion in market value. Google has gained 23%, adding $79 billion, and Apple is up 13%, adding $63 billion.\n\n“It makes me cautious because I’ve seen it before,” said John Carey, portfolio manager of the $5.2 billion Pioneer Fund, whose No. 2 holding is Apple. “There are some features of this narrowing market that do resemble what happened” in the late 1990s tech bubble.\n\nOn the eve of the dot-com crash in March 2000, the top six stocks in the S&amp;P had accounted for all of the index’s market-cap gain that year, according to Mr. O’Rourke.\n\nEnergy and materials stocks have slumped amid a downturn in commodity prices, while rising bond yields have dented high-dividend payers like utilities. Even shares of some longtime technology stalwarts have faltered. Shares of chip maker Intel Corp. are down 23% this year, while cellphone technology firm Qualcomm Inc. is down 17%.\n\nBull markets have featured thinning rallies in the past, including in the months leading up a swoon last fall in which the S&amp;P 500 fell 7.4% over a month. Ultimately, the broader market caught up and major indexes resumed their march higher.\n\nJeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which oversees $193 billion in assets, said he isn’t worried for now.\n\nMr. Mortimer said his firm in the first quarter pared holdings in some large-cap stocks that have pulled ahead, and moved into small-cap stocks overseas. But overall the firm remains optimistic on U.S. stocks, and it doesn’t think the thinning in the roster of companies driving the indexes higher signals a major pullback is coming soon. “It’s not yet a warning sign,” he said.\n\nTo be sure, some remain concerned that stock returns will be limited thanks to high valuations. The S&amp;P 500 is trading at 18.5 times the last 12 months of earnings, up from 17.1 at the beginning of the year and a 10-year average of 15.7, according to FactSet.\n\nAt the same time, a slowdown in corporate-profit growth and the prospect of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, widely expected to start this year, have many investors on guard for signs of a faltering market. But then, that refrain has been heard many times in recent years.\n\n“The game is not so simple where you can have a checklist that says, this has happened and that has happened” before a market pullback, said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management.","name":"t1_cti9x9l","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-07-28 00:03:40","week":31}

{"id":"ctipqwd","author":"axiomprime","body":"Hey there\n\nThe 10K per month is generally not that tough, unless you are in an already  saturated and/or tough niche.  Are you?  For affiliate traffic, 10k is the minimum I would want to start with.  I would shoot for 20k from my keyword research to start.\n\nIf you are having trouble with your conversions, the most obvious question is, “If I was looking to by this “tech product” and I came across  this website, would I buy it from there?”.  A lot of people think that their website is “good enough” generally, it’s not. It has to convey to the buyer that they won’t get ripped off. Most affiliate sites are just crap. I know I had a lot of them once. They made me money, but they were crap. I made them better, less crappy &amp; they made more money. \n\nThere may be many reasons why your site is not converting. Without digging into the specifics of your site, it’s a very big guess. Even crappy traffic will tend convert at 1-2%. But if you are selling something  (that people are searching for) and the visitors aren’t converting, then it’s either the traffic source or it’s the site. Considering that you are “not the savviest business owner”  I would suggest you focus on improving traffic and  conversions before making any other investments.\n\nFocus on one traffic source,  understand that well an make sure it’s consistent.  Then you can add another.  Having too many inbound traffic sources at once that you don’t fully understand, will only add to your confusion over time. Since you are an SEO, I would work out all the long tail keywords  and create great content to go with it. Once you are pretty sure that you have “buyer traffic”  focus on converting that traffic. \n\nAs an example, if I had a tech product, I would probably start with video reviews and tutorials for the product. I personally like video &amp; find it easier to rank &amp; generate traffic. YMMV. Make them good. As good as you can. There’s already way too much junk out there that isn’t remotely useful. When you create value for your potential buyers, it really pays off in the long run. Then I would focus on conversions. \n\nI would take a long hard look at your  site and  ask;\n“Does this look legit?”\n“If I am an English speaker, and I go to this site, is the English spelling, grammar &amp; phrasing correct?” “Does site look good? Or does it look like a reject from MySpace or some mini niche site from 2005?”\n“Who runs this site?”\n“Can I REALLY get a hold of them?”\netc… You get the idea. \n\nI apologize for beating this dead horse, but 60% of the time, all the time, whenever I see a conversion issue from a new site (especially affiliate sites)  a lack of legitimacy is the top reason for poor conversions. Legitimacy is going to be an issue when you are an affiliate,  and they can get the same product on Amazon or some other location. \n\nOnce you understand your conversions and have that somewhat dialed in, then you can probably start thinking about drop shipping.  Because now you understand how to generate consistent traffic AND make a consistent sale. Once you can do that for an affiliate product, you can do that for your own product or any product.\n\nThis is a bit cliche, but it is true; Most people start with a product and then try and find a market. I would suggest (especially as an affiliate marketer) that you first find a market of buyers, then give them a product they want and need. \n\nEdit: Yes you can have Amazon products appear on your site. There are plugins for wordpress, drupal, Amazon webstores, etc..

{"id":"ctjnhxx","author":"mikejackness","body":"Well, this is pretty easy for me to talk about because we are doing exactly that right now.  We are in the process of launching another brand that sells niche products and it’s totally from scratch.  To be clear, this is a product we are manufacturing ourself.  We won’t be selling any other manufacture’s products on the site.  So, I think it’s exactly what you are looking to do?  Here is an outline of our plan:\n\n1. We found a brand name that we like.  It’s a .com domain name that is just 7 characters long.  I think having a good brand name and URL is very important.  No long names, no dashes, no .info, etc.  We paid $3,000 for this domain name / brand.\n\n2. We are launching the products on Amazon first without doing anything at the .com.  It’s very easy to launch a product on Amazon with FBA.  We just send in several 100’s pieces of each item and let it go.  We have a whole Amazon marketing strategy that would be too long to discuss here.  Once we have a few 1000 sales under our belts we move on.\n\n3. Build out a website at the .com URL I mentioned above.  This way we can start to generate direct sales and slowly start to reduce our need for Amazon.  With all the sales we are generating on Amazon at this point a certain percentage will come back to our website and reorder etc.  Don’t underestimate how powerful Amazon can be to get things rolling.  (Tossing a coupon or other bait into each package is key and allows you to get sales moving your way).\n\n4. Start SEO and marketing directly.  We have a pretty proven strategy of contacting all the top players in the industry and getting the to review our products, giveaway our products, write about our products, etc.  It take giving them free product or outright paying them, but it’s pretty simple.  As people are talking about you, they will link to you (naturally).\n\nThat's it really.  Hope this helps.\n","name":"t1_ctjnhxx","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-29 02:03:08","week":31}

{"id":"ctjyr9p","author":"eoadams8","body":"A lot of times it's not the traffic it's the site design. Getting your product in front of a lot of people is only half the battle. Your website is the equivalent of a salesman. \n\nTo make an analogy, car dealerships usually locate near the interstate to attract a lot of traffic. The larger dealerships obviously will get more traffic but the smaller ones (like your site) will also get their share.\n\nThe major difference between larger and smaller dealerships are usually the salesmen (in this case they represent the website design). The fact is larger dealerships (websites) can afford to pay for the best salesman (web design). Once the traffic walks through the door (gets to your website from Adwords, social, etc.) it's up to the salesman (your web design) to convince the visitor to make a purchase. Even though your visitors came because they were interested in buying a car (or Kombucha), they will leave and go elsewhere if your salesman (web design) looks unprofessional and untrustworthy.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is you will need to invest in a great looking site that has all the trust signals (i.e. [SSL](https://www.sslshopper.com/what-is-ssl.html) certificate (https), Sitelock, secure checkout, product reviews, social proof, etc.). You can bring in all the traffic you want but your website has to convert those visitors into customers. They are not going to buy *just* because they landed on your site.\n\nPeople won't hesitate to leave eCommerce sites if they are even slightly unsure about where their money is going, like sth3000 said:\n\n&gt; Personally I try to avoid buying goods from small online stores at all costs these days.\n\nAnd i'm next to certain that's because of the trust factor.\n\nYou may not have a lot of money to throw at site design (it can get expensive) but you have to make sure that:\n\n1. your site is unique and represents your product well and\n2. you are offering something different from sites like Amazon and other Kombucha shops (things like free samples, giveaways, recipes for each supplement, or something that will keep people coming back to your site and do serious business with you)\n\nHope this helps!\n\nRegards,\n\nEthan","name":"t1_ctjyr9p","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-29 07:49:06","week":31}

{"id":"ctjzlay","author":"some_random_kaluna","body":"The following is my advice. \n\n1. Go to goodrx.com and see if you can get your mother's insulin for cheaper from other places. Just print out the coupon or take your smartphone and have the teller scan it, and it'll give a pretty good discount on that and any other medication your mom is taking. I used it before getting Medicaid, and it helped A LOT. \n\n2. You and your sister need to look up Energy Assistance programs in your area, print out the paperwork and help your mom fill them out and send them off. Even if it's just a hundred dollars or so, it'll help pay your bills and give you some breathing room. Also apply for Food Stamps. Worse they can do is turn you down. \n\n3. Try washing clothes and then just hanging them to dry in your bathroom or on your lanai/balcony. Sunlight is free and will cut your dryer bill in half. \n\n3. Buy LED lightbulbs when they're on sale and replace them all around your house. Also buy power strips, plug all your electronics into them, and get into the habit of turning off the strip when you leave. Your electric bill will fall so much the company will be worried about it. \n\n4. Instead of paying car insurance every month, ask your agent about a six-month or yearly plan. You'll have to come up with the cash every six months or year, but it'll usually be a couple of hundred dollars less, even more. And you can ask for a bit of time to come up with the money as well, which is nice. \n\n5. [Buy a panoramic rear view mirror, like these on Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=panoramic+rear+view+mirror) They're ten dollars and they'll keep you from getting in so many accidents it's not funny. It'll help establish you as a good driver, and you'll be able to pay a lot less in insurance as you get older without getting in wrecks. \n\n6. Buy a couple of Crock Pots and go to /r/slowcooking to learn how to make awesome, delicious meals using Crock Pots and bulk foods on sale. I also recommend a rice cooker and a bread machine. Build up a semi-decent food pantry in your place and your food bills will start to go down. They don't use much electricity either. \n\n7. **DO NOT SACRIFICE ANYTHING FOR YOUR GRADES. SCHOOL COMES FIRST, ALWAYS.** I recommend you go to a local college first; in-state tuition is always cheaper than out of state, even if you're getting scholarships up the wazoo, and you can send home some of your financial aid money if you need to. \n\n8. Figure out which of the rent-to-own stuff you really, really need and pay that off ASAP. Get rid of the rest; you'll find better deals in the Free section on Craigslist. \n\n9. I'd tell you to get rid of the second car but you'll likely need it. See if you can downsize to something more affordable. If you're stuck, then get good grades, get scholarships and financial aid and use a little of that money to pay it off. \n\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_ctjzlay","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-07-29 08:26:32","week":31}

Roku has the best selection in terms of apps/shows, but I found the interface to be lacking, search to be poor, and speed of the device to be slow overall.  The Fire TV is fast, has a great interface, and the voice command on it is pretty good.  The Fire TV stick is a lot like it, but slightly slower (still faster than the Roku 3), and has that great interface, but doesn't come with the voice command remote.\n\nI've run Plex on both the Roku 3 and Fire products and I like the feel of it much better on the Fires.  Downside on the Fires is that there's not a whole lotta apps out there for it (this is really where Roku excels).  However, being that I only use Netflix, Amazon Prime, Crackle, and Crunchy Roll (all of which are on the Fire/Roku), I've never had any issues.  Stay away from the Apple TV as it's old, sluggish, and has a poor selection of apps IMO.\n\nI've never used a Chromecast, so I couldn't tell you if it's good or not, but I always recommend people to get the Fires.","name":"t1_ctk13r6","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-07-29 09:45:16","week":31}

Look at Walmart and Target. Standard retail outlet. But look at Amazons recent earnings numbers. Walmart and Target is getting killed because consumer preferences are shifting from retail outlets to Web shopping. \n\nWithin tech there are many sub sectors. You could look at SaaS (software as a service) or PaaS (platform as a service) providers. But there are like you say more pure tech like semiconductors, chip makers, telecom providers, etc. what part of the tech cycle excites you? The R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D portion? The mfg and distribution portion (like Foxconn)? The sales and marketing portion (like Apple)? These are all questions that will help you zero in on what about tech and the tech Analyst research is important when making recommendation on whether a company is a buy, hold, or sell. \n\nI wouldn't say there are many books that have a great approach to this. I would create a portfolio of companies you want to follow on Seeking Alpha and read the news that comes out daily on these companies. You may also want to look for something called \"Industry Primers\" which give an overview and context of an industry. I think some may be stickied on the sidebar. Also you should read a lot of tech blogs like TechCrunch and ArsTechnica to get an up to date news on the happenings around tech\n\nAlso as someone older I highly recommend going to path of computer science and migrating to finance if you are interested. You have more opportunities in life this way. Going the other way is harder. My reason for saying this is that a college education in computer science is going to be more applicable to the real working world than finance. In C.S. You'll probably learn how to code using Python, C++, SQL, etc all languages that you could use when working. In finance you'll learn about option pricing models, alpha calculations, NPV, etc. less core to work in finance. I feel like the finance education is something you could read up on your own while getting a degree in CS and you'll be a much more attractive candidate to employers\n\n","name":"t1_ctke8jf","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2015-07-29 18:12:21","week":31}

Unless you are shipping a bunch of identical items, from retail arbitrage, then most FBA shipments take a little while to prepare. Books for example, I send at least one shipment a week of books. Usually buy them from GW, SA or some sort of thrift shop, i scan the books at the store so I already know whatever I buy i'm making money on. Take them home, remove sticker and glue residue, scan them into inventory, print label, apply label, sort which books go to which FC and then pack and ship. It takes me a couple hours to do a shipment of books, an hour or so to do CDs. May sound like a pain in the ass, but I don't buy a book that doesn't sell for at least $8, and I never pay more than $1-2 for any book (excluding textbooks). So my return for each book is worth the couple minutes per book I spend on it. \n\n\nAmazon doesn't charge you their fee until your item sells. Unlike ebay, they take their cut first. Then they put your money into a pile and deposit it in your bank account every 2 weeks. Fees vary depending on what category you sell in. If you aren't a Pro Merchant paying $40/month, there will be an additional $1/item fee on top of all the other fees. AZ fees are pretty steep but you can usually get more for the items on AZ and certain categories sell stupid fast.

It's much easier to sell PL products than ones from existing manufactures. \n\nThe biggest dangers are more competition and Amazon changing the rules on you at a moments notice.  \n\nTo protect ourselves we are doing the following:\n\nAny PL product we develop belongs to a group of products that work together.  For instance, we might have a line of kitchen products that we call Mike's Kitchen.  From there we develop an entire line of products that fit well within that brand.  This way we can cross pollinate sales from one item to another.  The main reason this is key though, is because we then launch an eCommerce store on the heels of all this.  Having our own store strengthens our brand and allows us to start weaning our way off Amazon.

We can ship the item to the address provided in the original checkout (Oklahoma).\n\n&gt;We pride ourselves on fast shipping, so if we have not heard back from you within 48 hours, we will move on with option number two, and ship the item requiring signature confirmation for delivery.\n\nIs that acceptable?

I'm not a big airline miles person and my income level has been shaky so I don't want to deal with them asking me to prove income but I have a similar FICO (probably a little higher when I applied) and got the Blue Cash and Blue Sky (both non-AF versions) around the same time with no issues.  Gave me around 12k limit on both -- I think they looked up and just matched what my other highest card was.  I'm sure I got something like 200 in cash back/250 in travel credit reimbursement for 3k spend for each card, however since then the cards have made a lot more money than that.\n\nAmex Offers usually puts a few hundred in my pocket per card, each year.  Staples deals are gravy because you can often find stuff that's free-after-rebate and then get $20 back on a $100 \"purchase\".  They have had deals recently for $20 back on a $20 Amazon purchase, $10 back on $10 google play credit purchase, $10 back on $10 itunes credit, $10 back on $75 mobile phone payments (good 3 times per card!), $10 back on $50 at Lowe's (good for gift cards -- including gas gift cards!), and $5 off $25/$10 off $50 at a lot of other retailers you might normally shop at (Home Depot, Walmart, Whole Foods, etc.).  One of the better deals was $25 back on $50 purchase at a grocery store, usable 3 times per card, and you could go to the store and buy Amazon gift cards with it.  Thanks for the free $150 in Amazon credit!  More recently they have been pushing their mobile express checkout which does a similar thing where you can get $10 back on a purchase at some sites, enabling you to get $10 gift certificates to Burger King/Papa Johns/etc. from Newegg for free.  They also have the Small Business Saturday promo, which does seem to change a bit every year, but last year was good for $30 free per card.  \n\nSome of the offers and Small Business Saturday promo will also work on the Serve (assuming you tie a twitter account to it) so even more free stuff!","name":"t1_ctldxrp","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-07-30 12:33:35","week":31}

{"id":"ctlh360","author":"CollarAndCuff","body":"This reply could end up being very therapeutic for me i think! :)\n\nOk..here goes....\n\nI worked for a very, very large multi-national transportation company for approximately 11 years. In June of this year i was released( lets not go into that now) but suffice to say it is a blessing in disguise. \n\nWhy? Well i personally think very few of us are actually doing the job we really want to do. If you cast your mind back to your early teens i had all these plans/dreams which due to my own lack of planning/goal setting i drifted into sales and before long with 2 kids, a wife and mortgage you do end making the pieces fit....sometimes with a hammer. Granted there are some people who do love there job and good luck to them. But if we be really honest ( look inside your soul) are we content in what we do? Personally i think it is inherent in us all to want to own and run a successful business  and to leave the corporate trap so we make the choices and decisions in our private and personal life.\n\nI have witnessed some extreme and quite frankly absurd corporate behaviour which i really could not print here but suffice to say these very people survive in corporate positions today. These are the very people who will profess \"its business\" whilst they hide behind the corporate bollocks of company statements/manifestos/mantras and quite frankly incredulous company intents.\n\nThat i guess is what i wanted to escape from. The drudgery of conference calls regarding a conference call for the conference call about the future meeting imported no decisions, flawed recommendations and a complete waste of time......as Jobs said...\"we have only one life\"!!!!\n\nI literally flew on private company jets, stayed in 6 star hotels overlooking the Brandenburg Gate and enjoyed 6 figure salaries and benefits. But in reality it meant nothing as i missed too many school plays, parents evenings and was so tired i couldn't even interact with my children! SO....here is what i would advise anyone to do who is in that situation:\n\nNORMAL PLAN B: (New Job...always better to get a job when you have a job)\n\n1. Refresh that LinkedIn profile. Companies are savvy now to the fact they can place there own ad on LinkendIn (even for Directors positions) for a few hundred $.\n\n2. Replace that holiday profile picture with a proper studio photo. It makes all the difference.\n\n3. You need at least 500 connections before you get any kind of traction with search results. (try searching on Amazon for a great book by Brenda Bernstein on LinkedIn)\n\n4. Recruitment Agencys? I think these are the same people who advised Blair there was weapons of mass destruction. Enough said!\n\n5. Adopt the Golden Parachute theory and approach the companies you want to work for. ( but who you really want to work for)..you'd be amazed as the best jobs are not advertised. My best man stopped work as a lawyer as he realised that it was his fathers wishes for him to practise law rather than what he wanted to do. He now runs a small business on eBay and loves his job.\n\nMY PLAN B:\n\n1. Make the leap. Its not just about the money its about peace of mind, having no regrets and being true to yourself. All your friends will say (as mine did) i was having a mid life crises. If you have the support of your family ...who really cares. Do you really need the 6 figure number? \n\n2. I started my [website](http://collarandcuff.co.uk) some 5 years ago so when the time came to leave i was already underway with the things that take the time i.e. constructing a web site, business cards, SEO, sourcing products etc etc. I now earn just short of what i did previously and get out of bed and walk 20 yards to my iMac and work (in my shorts if i wish). My accountant, book keeper, SEO team and social media girls are all employed virtually and are superb.\n\n3. Structure the day as you would at work. I start at 7....but very rarely work till 12 as i did when employed by a company. the real hard work is in the first 2 years especially if you have a web site.\n\n4. Research, research, research. Do not be put off with a crowded competitive arena. the % of competitors in a niche market have not really switched on to the impact of SEO or Social Media.\n\nIn conclusion ( sorry about the rant) its the scariest thing you will ever do. But if you have researched your idea, sourced the product, know your way to market and avoid these so called millionaires who live in Jamaica whilst generating millions of $$ from passive income\nyou will be fine. Its hard....its damn hard as you are on your own. One last thing...give this book a try....a bit dated now but you will get the drift:\n\nGeorge Marshall - Get out whilst you can.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n","name":"t1_ctlh360","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-30 15:08:47","week":31}

{"id":"ctlxy60","author":"Lillian_Grace","body":"Candles are a tough business to be in simply due to the saturation of the market so I give you extreme props for going for it and continuously trying to improve your product and exposure and not just throwing in the towel.  I would work on SEO based on your abandoned cart numbers; making sure you are adequately back linking, your website or hosting company is SEO friendly and you have redirects. In terms of SEO, make sure that you're providing adequate content and not just a picture - when search engines crawl your page they are looking for content as much as tag and keywords. You need to be providing your customers with enough \"educational\" information about your product and not just a picture and some specs; make sure to be telling them why they should buy your candle over someone elses and include an estimated burn time as well if you're not already.  \n\nI don't know what kind of website you're running or on but if you're selling on a platform like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon, do you have a separate blog that allows you to talk about your product? If not, I would look into it. \n\nUnfortunately, candles are one of those dual purpose items. Some people burn them for their smell and some people just let them sit there and look pretty. So, maybe try and find ways to \"doll it up\" post-production. I do this quite often on some of my soaps and scrubs - the process is messy but some people ( the lookers) don't want to see the mess but the picturesque artistry in the final product. (Not always possible but everyone is different; personally, I burn my candles and don't give a hoot what they look like). \n\nSomething I've seen a lot of lately is makers of handmade goods like yours utilizing YouTube for product information (keep in mind YouTube is a Google owned entity so it definitely doesn't hurt to add a little something there.)  \n\nIf you haven't already try using sites like instagram to promote your product and business and run giveaways... something along the lines of \"were giving away x product on date and month, want to win it? All you have to do is follow us, like this post, and share it with your friends\" this seems to work exceptionally well on fb.

They are controlled by a central computer and navigate using markers on the ground. Amazon has begun exploring ways that it might someday automate some of the shelf-picking work at its factories (see “Help Wanted: Robot to Fulfill Amazon Orders”). However, robots are still incapable of tasks that require fine manipulation or improvisation, so it is useful to devise ways for robots to collaborate with humans more effectively.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_Systems#Acquisition_by_Amazon\n\n&gt;&gt; Since the acquisition by Amazon, Kiva has remained silent. The company has not announced any new Kiva customers and have stopped their marketing activities. Most of Kiva’s sales staff have departed, though the company continues to hire in the engineering and manufacturing departments. Industry observers speculate that Amazon is focusing on internal operations and is not interested in sharing the technology with competitors.\n\nSo, Amazon purchased a company for $775M and expanded engineering staff.  This staff is dedicated to improving warehousing technology exclusively for Amazon, so competitor firms will need to make their own investments in parallel technology.  So that's more money and more labor to develop.  This all, of course, assumes that we won't see new competitors entering the industry in need of the same technology and ready to make the same investments.\n\n&gt; Vending machines is just one example and is doing quite well in places like Japan. This is only the beginning and will only get better with time as well.\n\n&gt;&gt; Since vending machines are now a key part of the country's retail infrastructure, people are accustomed to not only seeing vending machines, but using them. At this point, it's less that vending machines are popular, and more that they are interwoven into Japanese society.\n\nSo you've found a historical anachronism distinct to Japanese culture that dates back generations, and it's \"the beginning and will only get better with time\"?  Past that, you're overlooking the sheer volume of machines and the labor necessary to keep them stocked and maintained.\n\n&gt; Automation is possible.\n\nAutomation is expensive and inflexible.

I believe there are 3 archetypes of business that cover most businesses: Physical goods, Information, and Services. I like to think in addition to this there are four major aspects of a successful business: Innovation, Reducing Costs, Customer Acquisition, and Business Administration.\n\nAll of these need to work in balance to run a successful business. I would like to focus on one of the four aspects first. Innovation can be broken down into ideas, design, production, and delivery. How does your business beet out other businesses in these four areas? If you can think of new/different candle recipes, design better looking/smelling, or aesthetic candles, produce them cheaply and deliver them fast then you have a winning product. Do a SWOT exam (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) then give it to someone else and have the critically evaluate it, critique and add information to each of the four spots. If you have a large amount of Weaknesses and Threats try to address them before investing a lot of money.\n\nThe second aspect that seems to be hurting you is Customer Acquisition. Customer Acquistion is two things the Sales Funnel Concept, literally think a giant funnel that eventually leads to them buying, and Channels or as I like to think hose spickets that you turn on that flows customers into the funnel. It sounds like you're business could use a couple more channels. \n\nSelling channels include Amazon, Ebay, Sears.com, Etsy, Kickstarter, and any marketplace physical and virtual you can sell you're goods. Have you exhausted every possible one of these?\n\nInformation channels include search engine traffic, word of mouth, social media, mobile applications, physical stores etc. Information channels are the hardest to break into but they literally become the brand of a business. SEO takes a very long time and content, but word of mouth is fantastic. Because you have an aesthetic product focus on pinterest, instagram, facebook, and twitter. Take amazing photos and make your candles irresistible! I have seen women take average party decorations and create tablescapes that baffle you're mind for creativity. Sometime average is perfectly fine if you can make it look amazing. ","name":"t1_ctmd7dx","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-31 04:59:49","week":31}

{"id":"ctmhqfe","author":"hallsgator","body":"It's hard to put a percentage odds on it, but I will say that it is possible. I am not one of the doomdayers, tin-foil-amazon/ebay is out to get you types, but it does seem Amazon suspends accoutns more frequently than eBay.\n\nMost seem to think it is the works of \"bots\" that look for certain keywords or metrics and then you are automatically suspended. \n\nUnfortunately, most people really don't know why they get suspended because amazon is usually vague in their suspension letters. It could be too many complaints about Items Not As Described, or items that don't match the listing, items that don't match the condition description, item is counterfit, etc.\n\n\nThe problem is, there is no set number that you can see that indicates you are on the edge of being suspended. Usually you get policy violations and if you take care of it, that's that. If you repeat them, your odds of suspensions goes up. But there are still no solid numbers, like eBay's Defect percentage, that Amazon goes by (at least that the basic seller knows of).\n\nSo in conclusion of this rambling, post, yes it is possible you can get suspended but there is really no way of knowing the odds. If they ask for proof and you don't have it, that could mean trouble. The good news is that Amazon USUALLY gives you ONE opportunity to appeal suspensions with a letter and if it is well written and thought out, you get one more chance at selling on Amazon.\n","name":"t1_ctmhqfe","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-07-31 07:36:46","week":31}

{"id":"ctn87kj","author":"n8dog","body":"First, awesome job to your dad creating something and getting it out there. 99% of folks who have any idea, it just sits there - their owners too scared to get their hopes dashed. So great job. Now, keep going! Persist through this challenge, and adapt the product and business until this thing works :)\n\nHere's some thoughts: \n\n1) The website could be better. \n\n- I'd create a website and url dedicated to this one product type. What's imagonis? No one really cares until they care that this product means anything. I know imagonis is your Dad's company. But I'd just focus on selling the one product. Devote the space and time to that. I'd probably even create a website called CoffeePodHolders.com or something with some seo juice of what people are looking for. \n\n- There's a lot of great website templates on Shopify and WooThemes that would elevate this website by 10x easily. I'd look into those. \n\n- Where are the testimonials on this site? People I'm sure are saying nice things somewhere. There's a couple nice reviews on Amazon. And I'm sure others. Get those out there. Even one strong testimonial can grab people's attention and make them pay attention when they normally wouldn't. \n\n- The video is fair. If you are getting enough traffic to A/B test its effect then do that. If you don't have enough traffic, I'd probably get rid of it until you have the resources to create a slightly more professional one?\n\n- Move the installation instructions to a place where people see them after they buy. These instructions aren't doing anything to help sell the product. I need to start marking up my cabinets, and find a level just to use this thing. This looks from the images like more work than I bet a lot of people feel like. I know this isn't a lot of work, but the pictures can be daunting to unhandy people. They don't sell the product. \n\nThe sales page should be about why this thing is awesome. Not the work I need to do after I buy it. \n\n2) /u/davefmurray is right in this thread. There is already some strong competition: http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Reader-WMNT-BLK-Mounty-Dispenser/dp/B00I3CZ5KW/\n\nThat competitor is cheaper, has more polish around it's images/marketing, and does even more stuff. I can hang that thing on my Fridge w/ zero installation, and now I have a tack board too? \n\nThis is where I think this product needs to adapt. \n\nIt needs to get a ton cheaper in this market. Or... it needs to offer a lot more. Can it? One of my favorite books on innovation is [Something Really New](http://www.amazon.com/Something-Really-New-Creating-Innovative-ebook/dp/B001REFRZG). It describes such a simple concept that very few people bother with. All it describes is: 1) Figure out the steps your customers have in some task. 2) Remove or combine steps. \n\nThat's it. Figure out how to remove steps in a process these coffee drinkers have. That's why Keurig has done so well. They've removed so many little steps you have to get that cup of coffee when you need it. Boil water? Gone. Clean coffee maker. Gone. Measure coffee, find filters, no filters damn. Gone. :) \n\nWhat else could a pod holder help coffee drinkers do with fewer steps? Now this is just random 5 minute brainstorming: \n\n- but could a product help me with the ordering process. When I'm out of pods or getting close, it just automatically calls Amazon? Amazon has those buttons now right and APIs to things. Could this thing sense something and trigger some events whether its ordering for me which would be ideal, or even sms me, or put something on my todo list to order more pods. \n- I still flavor my coffee sometimes. Could this also store flavored creamers in a different drop down row? Or have an adapter convert one column to do that?\n- Keurigs are super easy for their owners. But when I have guests that don't have them, they still get super confused. How to fill it with water? Which buttons do I press? Can i make it stronger (my vue has multiple settings). Could this holder have some pull out instructions guests can refer to?\n- Cleaning. When's the last thing this has been cleaned, descaled? Does it need to? Would a built in calendar help me remember to clean it?\n- Anything to help with waste? Something here that could help me make refilling those reusable pods a little easier?\n\nYou get the idea. Just analyze the stuff you have around the coffee maker, or even adjacent tasks (that's why I like that tack board for the competitor's fridge version), and figure out how to save more time in your customers lives by removing steps. \n\n3) I wouldn't fool much with advertising for now. I mention some thoughts on things like pay-per-click ads here: [https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3899-is-it-too-early-for-me-to-start-a-pay-per-click-campaign](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3899-is-it-too-early-for-me-to-start-a-pay-per-click-campaign) which is still slightly relevant here. I feel like the product here needs to get more competitive before spending time on ads. And even then, the ad game is nuts. Very few people can make any money on that. There's a lot of coffee pod holder folks out there. \n\n4) I have no idea about manufacturing. And I don't like selling out :) I love running my projects. \n\nBut.. another idea that just came to mind. What about helping people 3d print this stuff? Is there another market there. Helping people create their own coffee pod holders. Could this have a neat angle in the DIY crowd?\n\n","name":"t1_ctn87kj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-07-31 22:40:00","week":31}

{"id":"3fic44","author":"tlahpalli","body":"Mine are:\n\n**Alibaba/BABA** - It was talked about a lot on TV and I decided to try it out.  I have seen it go up and down.  I have only kept $10 on it at this point since it hasn't made any strong earnings for me.\n\n**Amazon/AMZN** - It was showing consistent growth even before the latest sales report.  And it is a company that continues to grow.\n\n**Apple/AAPL** - It hasn't been doing so good right now, but I have been reading that it isn't going to plummet and there are huge opportunities for growth once it finds the next revolutionary device.\n\n**Google/GOOGL** - I have always been investing in Google as far back as I can remember.  I have also had to sell stocks to take care of other financial situations.  But right now, I am going in as much as I can.  They are always coming out with new things, most of which they know will fail, but the lessons learned lead to improving or innovation something else.\n\n**Microsoft/MSFT** - I am all about investing in competitive companies, like Apple, Google, Microsoft.  It helps to see when one dips, another will go up, or other fun situations.  This is also a long established company with consistent growth and innovation.\n\n**Store Capital/STOR** - I did this more as a high risk, see what happens, kind of thing.  So far it has been growing steadily so I will continue to invest in it.\n\n**Teladoc/TDOC** - Same reason as Store Capital, but I also wanted to get in from the IPO.  Sadly I missed it by a hair, but I still was able to get in right as it began to grow.  Seems stable and going strong so I will stick with it.\n\nMy opinions on these are my own, and some have research behind them, others just cause I wanted to try them out.  If you have any input, I would be greatful.  I do invest through Robinhood as well when I can buy whole shares of stock at a time.  I like Loyal3 cause I can do $10 at a time on a stock if I am not too sure on it without losing too much.\n\nI would love to see what others invest in through the site and why.","name":"t3_3fic44","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-02 16:02:22","week":31}
{"id":"3ficry","author":"DrinkHotWater","body":"I have been self employed for the past 2 decades. Gradually over about 2 years, my businesses took a turn for the worst. Our main source of income was from selling a product directly to Amazon's Vendor Central (Amazon's purchasing department for buying items direct). Our products have gradually lost their ranking on Amazon and Vendor Central is no longer purchasing our products in the quantities that they were. We have our own website, but they pale in comparison to Amazon. We went from making over $100k a year to probably about $20k. I am just guessing what we will be making over the next year.\n\nAt this time I own a home that is valued between $325K - $350K. Realtor is not certain because we live in an area where every house on the street is custom and completely different. Comps are all over the place. We owe $275k on the home. \n\nLast month I sold our boat for $14k which gave us $30K in the bank. Now it is already down to $24k. Last night my wife and I did a quick assessment of our debts. \n\nOur house payment is approximately $2500 a month with POA and solar panel installation that was added to the property tax (might cause a problem for selling the house because the property tax takes first position according to the Realtor, and according to him FHA won't lend on homes where the cost of the solar panels were put on the property tax but he is looking into it.) So with that explanation here are my debts each month.\n\n* Mortgage with Solar panels and POA: $2500\n* Leased Car: $466\n* Credit card 1: $700 &lt;--- this is a guess. I owe $15k on it but I have always made multiple purchases/payments on it each month before I get a statement and never have seen the minimum amount due as it always shows 0.\n* Business Line of Credit 2: $700 (total still owed $37K)\n* Life insurance: $220\n* Health Insurance: $150 (we made so little last year we get subsidized) \n* Car Insurance: $220\n* Water: $128 (we don't use a lot of water, this place is expensive for water)\n* Cellular phones $85\n* Electricity $5 (Because of the solar panels, we only pay a very small amount each month and pay the balance accumulated once per year)\n* Cable/Internet/TV: $125 on basic plan with FIOS\n* Food: $400\n* Gas: $500 (Will start Monday because I am going to school)\n\nI know I am missing things here because last night my wife and I did the calculations and it came out to over $6500 a month in expenses and here it is only $5400 so somehow I am $1100 off and can't recall why - but the exact debts are not what is important because the bottom line is we don't have the income coming in to pay them off. \n\nMy plan is to go to a computer code boot camp school. It is a 3 month course and many graduates find employment in the $30k - $40k for internship, and $60k up to $100K for front end developers depending on the area and skill. Both of my brothers are software developers and make over $200k a year. One is self employed and the other is very high up for a multi-billion dollar corporation everyone has heard about. They are both willing to help me in terms of understanding how to code and pointing me in the right direction to find employment afterwards.\n\nI currently have no marketable skills. I have been my own boss for two decades. The computer boot camp school makes it impossible for me to work while going to it due to the amount of hours in the day it takes. I will be waking up at 5:00 am and getting home after 7:30 pm Monday through Friday for the next three months. The school is not in my area and the commute is bad but it is the only one that teaches what my brothers have said were worth learning. \n\nI don't know what to do though. I have two young children and a stay at home wife. I want to keep my wife at home. I don't want someone else raising our kids. My father in law has said we can live with him if necessary but he would prefer we keep our house. I don't think that is a reality. In just a few months our money we have will be gone, and we will have to sell our house anyway. Forgive me for having thoughts that may seem ridiculous to you, I am just trying to make sense of what to do and throwing out what I feel are my only options. My thoughts are:\n\n* Sell the house. Live with father in law and pay off minimum payments on debts which still come out to $4k per month and will drain what we have. Once I get employed move. This keeps my credit good if I can find employment in time before my money runs out.\n* Sell the house and stop paying on all debts. This ruins my credit but gives me much longer to live off the money we have. Go bankrupt once we run out of money or start paying the loans off once I get employment, whichever comes first.\n* Stop paying off all the debts and just prepare to go bankrupt once the money we have saved runs out while staying in the house and either repaying the debts once employed or file for bankruptcy when the money runs out.\n* Sell the house and stop paying off all the debts. Live off the money until I get employed in 4 - 6 months hopefully after graduating and then try to catch up with bankruptcy as an option if I can't catch up.\n* Stop paying on everything including the house. \n\nI don't even know where my head is at, at this point. I could use some sound direction on what would be the best for my family in the short term and long term. I don't know how much my business will make in the coming months, and I have to spend all my time going to school so I can't bring in additional income for the next three months other than what my business will generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3ficry","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-02 16:09:55","week":31}

{"id":"3firjd","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hi PF,\n\nI recently got a new job that nets me an extra $1,000 USD a month in income after taxes. (About a 25% pay increase from old job) However, the transition period between my old job and my new job had me living on my savings. My previous job had me netting about $200 a month in savings, so almost pay-check to pay-check.\n\nThus from living paycheck to paycheck and using up most of my savings, I'm going to have to float two of my fall graduate classes on my credit card. Currently, I have Chase's Amazon Rewards and CitiBank's Double Cash Card (2% cash back).  I was thinking of putting it on the Citibank card because of the 2% cash back and then paying $500 a month until the balance is 0.\n\nI'm down to my last three classes with graduate school, that directly relates to me new job. My previous employer had tuition assistance, and I now have to wait 6 months to be eligible with the new job. \n\nI can't afford to put my grad school on hold because being almost done with my grad program is exactly how I landed the new job. It directly correlates with job performance. If it wasn't for the case that the new job is my dream job, I probably would have waited another year before I transitioned. \n\nThat being said, for the purposes of airline miles, cashback, etc. Is there a better credit card that I should be using to finance grad school this semester besides my Citi 2% cashback card?\n\n","name":"t3_3firjd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-02 18:35:09","week":31}
{"id":"3fis20","author":"narib687","body":"I love to listen to podcast, audiobook, and talk radio while I work.\n\n\nSo last week I bought the Kindle Edition of \"The Martian\" and I noticed an option to buy the Audible narration for and extra 2.99. So in total I paid 5.99 for the Kindle Edition and 2.99 for the Audible Narration (8.98 for both). \n\n\nNow on Amazon they sell the Audible file for 26.95 (Or free if you start an Audible account). So I figured getting two copies of the book for 8.98 is better than paying 26.95 for just the Audible file (from Amazon).\n\n\nWell like I said I loved the book and I was just about ready to make a Audible account to enjoy all I could eat listening of audio books (I was finally going to \"read\" Game Of Thrones....I have had the paperback editions for years)..... \n\n\nHowever I found out it doesn't work that way you only get one \"free\" book a month and a 30% discount on other books for 14.95 a month. So in my few sample cases (Game of Thrones) it just cheaper to buy the Kindle Edition + Audible file.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nGoT Book 1:\n\nAmazon Combo Deal : 4.99 + 12.99 = 17.98\n\nAmazon Audible File : 41.95  \n\nAudible : FREE! Saved 3.03 (17.98 -14.95 membership)  &lt;---- Best Deal \n\nAudible (Not 1st book of a month) : 31.50 * .7 = 22.05\n\n\nGoT Book 2:\n\nAmazon Combo Deal : 5.22 + 12.99 = 18.21\n\nAmazon Audible File : 53.95\n\nAudible : FREE! Saved 3.26 (18.2 -14.95 membership)   &lt;---- Best Deal\n\nAudible (Not 1st book of a month) : 63.00 * .7 = 44.10\n\n\nThe Martian:\n\nAmazon Combo Deal : 5.99 + 2.99 = 8.98 &lt;---- Best Deal\n\nAmazon Audible File : 26.95\n\nAudible : FREE! Could have cost you 5.97 less (8.98 -14.95 membership)  \n\nAudible (Not 1st book of a month) : 29.99 * .7 = 20.99\n\n\nSo in these cases Audible is only the best deal if your free monthly book.... But after the cost of membership you are only saving 3 dollars or so.... In all cases if its your second book of the month you are better off getting the Amazon combo (It saves anywhere between 4 to 20 dollars)\n\nBut maybe there are free book I can get with a Audible subscription..... Do the members get a different book price and then the 30% off?","name":"t3_3fis20","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-02 18:39:19","week":31}

Hopefully I can give you a few ideas!\n\nAs mentioned, the blurry picture doesn't add anything. But the slogan: \"Wholesale Keyless Remotes for Locksmiths and Consumers\" could be kept and placed underneath your logo.\n\nThe search function doesn't seem to work at all: \"No search performed. If you are looking for something, please try our homepage.\"\n\nI'd try to clean up the left nav and really focus on priorities. In general, customers do not \"explore\" websites. They already have a specific interest in mind and strive to locate the link on the page that matches their interest. Every option you add distracts from the others. Here's what I'd recommend as far as the left nav goes:\n\n1. Does a customer know whether they are large or normal wholesale? Which link should they click if they don't know? I'd move the text copy from \"Large Wholesale\" to the normal wholesale page and remove \"Large Wholesale\" as a separate page. \n2. Imagine you visit Amazon wanting to buy a book. Underneath Books, Electronics, and Movies, they have a section called \"Other Items\". Would you ever click on it without knowing what it is? I'd call it \"Locksmith Tools\" ... or \"Handy Accessories\" ... or something else along those lines?\n3. \"Promotional Materials for Locksmiths\" and \"Remote Instructions\" are great.\n4. \"Quality Guarantee / About Us\" is great content, but I'm not sure it belongs in the same menu as the shopping categories. Can it go on in the footer of every page? Or, you already have links to it in the header and footer.\n5. You don't need a Home link as long as your logo links to your home page.\n\nSo I'd suggest a left nav of:\n\n* Wholesale Remotes\n* Consumer Remotes\n* Remote Instructions\n* Locksmith Tools\n* Promotional Materials for Locksmiths\n\nMuch easier for your customers, yeah?

If you have student loans, they should be reporting. \n\nAnyway onto the real question: BCE is not exactly an easy card to get (especially with little to no credit), so I don't think you'll get approved. But since your file is so thin/non-existent, a single inquiry won't hurt too much, so being denied isn't the end of the world.\n\nWith that said, Discover It for Students is a great card to begin with. It is effectively a 10% rotating categories/ 2% all other spend card for the next year. Discover tends to extend credit to those with little or no credit as long as their file is clean.\n\nSince you're considering BCE, may I suggest the Sallie Mae card issued by Barclays? Odds are probably slightly better than BCE and it is 5% back on gas, groceries, and Amazon (categorized as \"bookstore\") purchases. I'm also a college student. I have a BCE, and although it's a great-looking card with decent rewards/benefits, I regret not applying for Sallie Mae instead because I find its rewards structure much better. \n\nI would forgo the Cap1 Journey card.

If you keep track of serial numbers, invoices, and other markings, you could open a case with Seller Support of that ever happened and show them proof of the scam. If you sell Merchant Fulfilled, Delievery Confirmation means nothing to Amazon.  The only way you can prove delivery is with Sig Confirmation. \n\nI know this all sounds bad, but it really doesn't happen that often. I'm just giving you worse case scenarios. \n\nI would suggest FBA for just about anything.  You get more protection vs negatives and you can't get A to Z cases opened but you can still get scammed and returns just as easily if not easier.  \n\nYou can use the fee calculator at fbacalc.com to figure out your fees.\n\nHonestly going solo on platform is risky because if you are all of the sudden banned, your income source dries up.

Sure, it makes sense - you often have to make some sort of investment to make money, be it in the form of education, capital, time, labor, etc. But when a company insists on collecting upfront fees for participation, that's a pretty good indicator that you're hookbait. \n\nIf you are looking for a legitimate way to make money retailing products, there are plenty of completely free ways to do it - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, etc. I guess even Facebook has selling features embedded in groups now. You just need to put in the legwork and find products people are willing to pay for. \n\nAs an example, I have a group of friends that scrounges for old video games/systems and resells them online for profit. I also know a gentleman that works with local merchants and resells their products through his online channels. And a few graphic designers that teamed up to make/sell custom t-shirts.\n\nYou don't need what these \"network marketing\" companies are selling - nobody does.

{"id":"ctowqyt","author":"ealxele","body":"All in. $2,000. Full-time.\n\nSo I am no longer working at my corporate job since the end of July this year. Today is my first day of being unemployed. I have saved up about $2,000. About $200 of that is going to be used for the equipment to make my flipping life easier and the rest is going to be used for my bankroll to flip.\n\nIt took me 24 years to realize no matter where I work, I never want to work for anyone anymore. Since my contract ended at my corporate job recently...I plan on flipping full-time and never looking back. To be honest...I am pretty excited!!\n\nI know it will probably be wise to get a part-time job to supplement myself while doing this, but I want to challenge myself to see if I can really support myself doing this full-time, alone. I've never had so much drive in my life until now and really believe I can do this. The biggest motivation for me is that I never want to go back to working for someone so I am literally going to pour out my heart &amp; soul into this.\n\nSince I have only flipped things part-time (for fun), never really fully committed to doing this full-time; my first month's goal is to my bankroll and make at least $1,500-$2,000 in profit. That is what I am aiming for. Then I can learn from my mistakes and make more money as the months progress. I have done some research beforehand and read some tips and pointers from this subreddit, but I want to learn more.\n\n*This is my basic foundation:*\n\n1. **Starting point:** Thrift stores. From each aisle, going to write down an interesting item. Figuring out what category/sub-category makes profit and what doesn't. Then get a really good idea on what sells and what doesn't. Starting with thrift stores and venturing from there.\n\n2. **Rule #1:** Generally only sell products that will get me a 3x profit return. I am mostly going to use eBay/Amazon to sell things.\n\n3. **Rule #2:** Large or complex items are terrible. The shipping hassle, returns, storage space. Not worth it.\n\n4. **Rule #3:** Proper time management. Hustle hard, take advantage of your free time since I am no longer employed &amp; most importantly take care of yourself.\n \n5. **Advice I've read:** Always invest in yourself. The earlier you do it, the quicker your life becomes easier (i.e. an excellent printer, adequate storage space, surface pro 3, lighting set-up, decent camera, simple things like a tape gun, etc). Also one of the best advice I have read is to love what you do. If flipping is something you don't have a passion for, this is not going to work out for you. Ultimately, you want to do this as having fun, and don't view this as 'work'. I truly believe in that and I am going to have as much fun possible :)\n \n*I am just seeking personal guidance from people who are doing this successfully as their full-time career:*\n \n* What are some of your top things you would recommend someone getting into this career?\n\n* My goal is to flip full-time now and whenever I have a good idea on how to support myself doing this then I am going to do FBA full-time. Ultimately, I wanted to get into FBA full-time in the beginning but since I am no longer working at my job I need money coming in to pay the bills, etc.\n\n* What are some things you have learned based on experience that you can pass down to me? Things that will help guide me in the right pathway.\n\n* eBay vs. Amazon. I never sold through Amazon but I have a good feeling I will like it! The question is if I want to do merchant vs. FBA, can you do both? I want to sell whatever products I can in the beginning, unless I can find a niche that I like then of course, I will go that route. But I do plan on finding a specific product that I will be doing FBA in down the road.\n\n*Thanks in advance!*","name":"t1_ctowqyt","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-02 17:23:15","week":31}

{"id":"ctozvq3","author":"junkbutton","body":"My suggestion is, if you've never done Amazon or FBA before, you need to ease your way into it. Amazon expects their sellers to be very professional, organized, and definitely follow their policies. They have no issues with suspending sellers, sometimes without even a warning first. Make sure you familiarize yourself with their policies, and spending some time on their forums is a good idea too (learn from others mistakes).  Don't cancel sales, don't say something is in better condition than it is, and make sure what you are selling is an EXACT match to the detail page (and by exact, I mean look up the definition of exact, and do that). I say this because selling through them is awesome (especially FBA), and if you want to sell online, for the foreseeable future, you will need them. Good luck.

{"id":"ctp0553","author":"MathAndFerrets","body":"Well anything you invest in is an investment. I think the distinction is whether OP has found a GOOD investment, one that will provide a consistent positive return. OP definitely did not find that with the dinar. However I know several people who have made oodles of money with other currencies trading back and forth. After all, forex is the single largest area of trading in the world last I checked. For example, every time an Aussie buys something on Amazon, they pay in AUD but Amazon converts it to USD.\n\nI really think you could be wrong about long term investments. Not very wrong, but a little wrong in the following way: the Feds inflation target is, what, 2%? May as well shave 2% off of your yearly statements. Getting out of USD and into something less inflationary (swiss franc?) and then investing  those instead is an automatic boost to whatever interest or dividends you are receiving (compared to USD). At that point, though, you aren't investing *in* the currency, you are investing *through* the currency. So in that sense you are correct: I don't think many people would recommend buying a bunch of, say, pesetas or yen or whatever and simply sitting on them, hoping the Mexican or Japanese economy beats the US economy next quarter.\n\nTraditionally, currency is supposed to be a safe place to store your wealth. So diversifying currency holdings can act like a hedge against volatility in currency values. Make 100 USD and put 5 USD into swiss francs. A big slip in the dollar sends your remaining 95 USD, a respectable grocery trip, down to half a tank of gas. Such a slip is generally disconnected from a big slip in the swiss francs, and so if the US economy shits its bed with 70s style inflation, at least you have SOME wealth that is unaffected, ie a clean bed to sleep in. \n\nLong story short, though, we agree on this: OP may as well have put 750 USD into a charcoal grill and started a fire...","name":"t1_ctp0553","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-02 19:15:59","week":31}

{"id":"ctp1l2m","author":"Jancy52","body":"Practicing adutl is a challenge even for those of us of advanced age with adult children of our own. i'm in my 60's and swear that I feel like i just turned 25 inside, in-spite of my children being in their 30's.   You have my sympathy about your mother, I took care of my own mother in her home until she died.  I know how hard those times can be, hopefully she's left you with advanced directives and power of attorney to ease your burden.  Go for hospice if available.       \nMy  recommendation on your bills  is to rethink how you use your AC - ours' is easy, so it  doesn't go on until 11:00 am, and goes off at 9:00 pm.    We keep it set to 77° and run a floor fan directing cool air from the AC into other rooms as needed - not using any ceiling fans as they are old, wobbly and scary to watch.  I also put up fabric panels in my hallway and in front of doors to prevent hot air from our south facing rooms from making the house hot,  plus I spray down the fabric panels with a clean water sprintzes during the day  which helps cool down the room from evaporation.  My pups had to learn how to go under the panels from area to area.  The panels also helps hold heat in those rooms in the winter time.  I hung them up on shower curtain rods I had extra's laying around - creating a tunnel a the top  using a 3\" tube i sewed onto the top edge.   I got my panels on Amazon in old fashioned \"hippy\" prints featuring colorful Grateful Dead prints and my friends like to look at them, remembering our college days.   I actually use a plain unfitted sheet to my own bedroom as it matches my colors in the room.   We haven't used real doors in my house in months. \n\nCheck your AC to see if it needs to have the filter cleaned out and look on-line for the directions for your model to see if you have it set in the right mode for continuous running. \n \nBe sure to heat proof the house with curtains to block out light in the  summer heat  - I use heavily lined black out curtains on my windows.  I also put light styrofoam inserts into the windows to block out even more light and plastic wrap over the windows inside.    My community standards prevent the use of Aluminum foil in our windows which is tacky anyway. \n\nRemember that all appliances produce heat/ including your computer and any interior lights that are on inside the home, plus TV sets.   If you are cooking hot meals in the kitchen you are probably heating up your house unnecessarily -there are alternatives to doing that like choosing the time of day and how you cook.     If you do laundry in the home, are you using a dryer?   I'd do laundry at 7:00 am and then  hang stuff outside to dry by lunchtime, use cool water to wash.     Shower at night if you use hot water.  While living in California we used the bucket method for taking showers and conserving water.   But there is  that word again - hot.  If you are using a hair dryer on your hair that adds heat so consider letting hair drip dry?  Think in terms of not adding heat into your house or doing anything that creates heat - except for sex - that's an ok activity for creating heat.     \n    \nAbout grocery shopping - you want to provide yourself with a pantry to save money, learning how to buy in bulk when you can afford it for possible lean times ahead - but learn to cook by scratch in order to reduce your overall grocery bill. I  no longer buy cake mixes - i make my own up using cake flour, baking powder, salt, etc. for pennies on the dollar compared to a mix.   Why waste money on prepared meals that are expensive if you can do the same on your own from scratch and would be more healthy anyway. My sons prefer my home made pasta and our own tomatoe sauce I can from the garden grown tomatoes.  Hopefully you can find a home economics website to read up on the principles of cooking from scratch and using cookbooks or use  Youube to learn from.     The key is to know how to √ eat healthy.   A Good website to review is the government nutrition site where you input your age, height and weight and the site calculates your nutritional needs for you.  My healthy plate.    Includes healthy eating on a budget. http://www.choosemyplate.gov/     ONce you figure out your daily nutriional needs you devise a full month  menu for each day of the month and grocery shop for the menu not for your belly.   There are  plenty of menu planners on the web.    Centeralize your food budget around protein needs at each meal is easiest way to proceed.   I'm having a hamburger meal of some kind or another for lunch today - mixing in vegetables and rice i had left over from last night and will add to the hambuger an onions I'll be browning a lunch time and will make  extra for dinner.      I also get a single piece of fruit at each meal ( I count out 14 peices of fruit at the grocery store each time I go  there, once a week), and four green\"salads\" I make with a half head of lettuce using plenty of other fresh vegetables/ nuts/trail mix at lunch and dinner all this week.  I  make up a whole baked chicken on Sundays early in the morning and then debone the whole thing, portioning out the meat into serving sizes and freezing them -   and make up chicken broth to be used in my cooking the rest of the week (I have a mud room off my kitchen where I do heavy cooking during the summertime to avoid heating up our living spaces.) I also make my own refried bean mix making beans from scratch, i also make my own cornbread from scratch.   I use a 10 in 1 oven and a crockpot in order to avoid heating up my kitchen.  My favorite appliances are heavy cast iron frying pan, a dutch oven, a goose neck kettle for making my pour over coffee set and a moka pot for expresso and a single burner toaster.  I rely heavily on my immersion blender to make dog food at home - higher in protein than the crap in a can, and less additives for them.   I also dehydrate and can our garden surplus.  My other favorite appliance is my yogurt maker and my vacuum food sealer so I can freeze prepared foods to rewarm in the microwave.     Two years ago I researched how to reduce, recycle, reuse and repurpose every item that comes into my house; we now produce only half the garbage we used to make and my overall costs are much lower, my goal is to fully reduce my carbon footprint. \n     My greatest savings was building  my pantry.  I used the book:   How to build a pantry in three months by Daisy Luther. i only buy foods i will actually use.      I make up soup meals for nights nobody in my house wants to lift a finger to  cook using  the plans found in the book: \"Dinner is in the jar\" by Kathy Clark,and own a large amount of mason jars for this purpose -  otherwise my son's would rely fully on Top Ramen and prepackaged meals for quick and easy meals.    I also follow the mealprepsunday here on Reddit for ideas of making up meals in advance and cheaply.  When I  was working i used the old \"once a month cooking method.\"   it took up two days of cooking to make meals in advance for the entire   month just assemblyng stuff to be heated in the oven.   \nThere is a book i got on kindle called 'how to feed a family of 4 on $200 a month' that has a link to budget101.com.    Reading that also helped me a lot, even though I am an experienced cook.   \n      It can be humiliating,k but if you need to,  apply for food stamps and energy assistance to reduce overall costs  and help your budget- there is no shame in seeking assist if you need it. There is a SNAP eligibility link on the web; http://www.snap-step1.usda.gov/fns/ \nAlso, go down to social security and talk to them about SSI if you need it.    Was your mother already  on social security? If so,  you may be eligible as a survivor under her current  benefits.   YOu might need to get her an application if she  does not have social security benefits, because of her condition she might be eligible for social security if she is no longer working.   Read up on this at the social security administration website - you may get turned down initially, but keep trying.    Also consider moving into a HUD home or HUD apartmnet!    HUD homes have to undergo inspection for energy efficiency and have heating/cooling and the landlord would be subject to responding better to your housing authority in your area if you got accepted on hUD. Also, considering  your mom's diagnosis - she probably has a social worker on her case - go talk to that person about getting help thru various social programs while she is still working with your mom.  Including getting support for yourself.     I  know that sounds insensitive, but what the heck - better to get help while you need it and can seek it out.  don't wait until you are emotionally exhausted.  What if your mom needs to go home on Hospice?  What help is there for you both?   \n     Sweety, it is no fun adulting on your own.    Most of us are right there with you.   it's hard to just think it out.   ( is hard to think when one is emotionally distressed and not feeling like an adult, but being forced into it.)   I'm such a mom myself.... God bless, good luck.               \n","name":"t1_ctp1l2m","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-02 20:01:16","week":31}

{"id":"ctp5l8p","author":"FlippingCurmudgeon","body":"The USPS is taking in Amazon's business because it's barely keeping them financially afloat by doing so. Saturday delivery would have already ended without them. I know the carriers hate the extra work they now have to do since Amazon switched to Parcel Select for most deliveries instead of UPS. In a few years, Amazon will have their own package delivery truck network in all the major metropolitan areas, because it's a huge cost savings. It will be interesting to see what happens to mail service once that happens.","name":"t1_ctp5l8p","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-02 22:02:11","week":31}

{"id":"ctp6k1x","author":"hallsgator","body":"Right, it would be terrible for the world's best logistics company to acquire them. \n\nThey could deliver their packages more efficiently and at a lower cost since they run the entire operation. They already have the infrastructure to handle all their own delivers, they just need the manpower and the many locations the post office has.\n\nThey could keep rates low as that's what Amazon is all about. Beating the competition with price. This would result in UPS and FedEx having to step up their game in service and price.\n\nNot to mention it would remove a big program from the government.

{"id":"ctp6v06","author":"silverwolfer","body":"It would also create a huge problem with monopolistic practice, and cutting off service to areas that are not profitable.  Trigger on top of that, how would Amazon treat mail from competitors ?   Part of the reason USPS can beat UPS and Fedex in prices and service area is that it gets subsidized tax dollars in operations. \n\nJust like I don't want my healthcare to be prioritized, I sure as hell don't want my mail to be in a competitors hands if am shipping Ebay items that day.","name":"t1_ctp6v06","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-02 22:40:50","week":31}
{"id":"ctp774x","author":"sadruminations","body":"USPS gets no tax dollars and it not subsidized by the government in any way. All money they get comes directly from people paying for postage(and supplies I suppose).\n\nBut yes, USPS will never get acquired by Amazon or anyone else, and it would be a horrible idea to do so.\n\nI also disagree with hallsgator that Amazon would do it more efficiently. The USPS is already the most efficient package delivery system in the history of the world.","name":"t1_ctp774x","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-02 22:51:11","week":31}
{"id":"ctp84j6","author":"Phantom707","body":"Skip the Amazon Chase card. The only bonus category is Amazon, and there are other cards that provide rewards for that as well as other categories.\n\nIt would help if you gave us a general breakdown of where you usually spend your money. With that in mind, we could offer more specific advice.\n\nAs a general cashback card, I'd suggest getting the Barclay Sallie Mae credit card. It offers 5% back in gas, groceries, and bookstores (including Amazon). The downside is that there's a monthly cap that's rather low, but as a general card, it's really nice if you don't have too high of monthly expenses.\n\nIf you're willing to get into this \"more properly\" (for lack of better term), a better idea would be to first sign up for the Barclay Arrival +. This offers ~$400 in travel credits if you spend $3000 in the first three months and is basically a 2% cashback card (as long as you redeem that for travel expenses). The annual fee is waived the first year, and when the annual fee comes due, you can ask for a product change to the aforementioned Sallie Mae card to avoid paying.\n\nWhere you intend to fly/travel from is also very important. You seem to have an interest in American Airlines, so I'll assume that you can access an airport serviced by them. I'll wait to hear back before offering further thoughts, though.","name":"t1_ctp84j6","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-02 23:19:58","week":31}
