{"id":"40izqp","author":"LastWeekHelltrain","body":"Hi, I'm hoping this is the right subreddit to ask and I'm trying to type this up where it makes sense but I'm running on empty so I apologize in advance if there's some typos or doesn't make sense. I can clarify if pointe out.\n\n\nI'm trying to find anywhere where I can get a small loan while unemployed. Unemployed as of yesterday. I need $240 and was intending to get a payday loan today and then when I got paid next week immediately pay it all back. However, I was fired last night after have too many absences for medical. So now I've found that I'm left with no way to make my payment on the car that was due tomorrow. Though I have part of the payment it won't be enough hence the need for the odd/small loan. It had already been recently shut off and I was graciously given time to pay them what I owed plus that current weeks payment. I lose the car if I don't make this and I won't be able to function without it. \n\n\nI'm explaining to much of my personal life though so back on point: I will receive my final paycheck on Jan 20th where I would pay back the loan. But to any lender I've found so far that is irrelevant, understandably, but I'm desperate. I've also considered seeing if one person might consider giving me 240 in exchange I have an Amazon line of credit (unused) where I could buy them an equal amount of whatever because honestly I would rather have to slowly pay credit than lose my car. And before someone mentions or asks how I would pay future payment in the first place, I have a job coming up in 2 weeks (it's a commission type project I'd been warming on) that will pay for everything for the next month which is plenty of time for me to find a job and get back on my feet and can donate plasma as a supplement too. This all couldn't have happened at a worse time and I'm screwed without my car, I don't know what to do, and feel out of hope. I don't have any friend or family I can ask for assistance. I'm at a dead end. Can anyone think of anything at all I can do to get a loan of any sort? \n\n\n\nApologies again for the scattered mess that is my post.\n\n\n\nThank you.","name":"t3_40izqp","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-11 22:27:31","week":2}

To accelerate my savings and growth, I would like to start a stock portfolio with companies like NFLX, FB, GOOG, and AMZN.

{"id":"40k6hu","author":"pancakeclambake","body":"Hey /r/personalfinance. I've been budgeting for the past year using YNAB, but I'm not sure if I'm on the right path. I wanted to see what you all thought was best for the near future and where I could improve my financial situation/outlook.\n\nI'm married, and my wife and I bring home $4,700.00 a month. Our monthly bills (electricity, mortgage, internet, etc.) are usually around $1,200.00. Another $1,000.00 is spent on groceries, eating out, gas, and household goods.\n\nI put $500.00 aside each month for rainy days funds (automotive, home maintenance, medical expenses, and vet expenses).\n\nWe pay $700 a month for our student loans. Most of our loans are at 6.8% and we're paying on a 10 year standard plan. We also pay $200 a month to my mom to pay her back for a new A/C unit and some appliances that we needed for our home.\n\nWe have $7,500.00 in an emergency fund right now, and we usually put $500.00 a month there. \n\nThat leaves about $600 dollars each month that we split between non-monthly purchases (Amazon prime, christmas presents, going to the movies, etc.) I've also started putting $100 of this remaining $600 towards a cruise for our 5 year anniversary in July 2017 (which may not be wise to do at this point)\n\nAnd I suppose this extra money and the money I place in the emergency fund is really where my question comes into play. My wife's car is 16 years old and has around 200,000 miles on it. I'd like to get her a newer vehicle, but I don't know how to best budget for this.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not sure if it's better to keep building our emergency fund or if I should take that $500 and throw it towards our student loans (or if we should continue to pay under the standard 10 year plan)\n\nFeeling a little lost on what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","name":"t3_40k6hu","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-12 02:44:17","week":2}

{"id":"40pc94","author":"traxtar944","body":"Today I was browsing Amazon looking for a new belt, and came across a crazy story when searching for reviews that really upset me. A college student started a belt company called Slidebelts, and sought help from a cousin who had experience with starting and running businesses. He was moderately successful, though small. As time passes, he sees this cousin repeatedly at family gatherings, continuing to get answers to questions and general advice. Fast forward a bit, and suddenly that same cousin is on Shark Tank pitching an idea for the SAME belt, denying knowledge of any competitors! \n\n[YouTube video of Mission Belt CEO on Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TqTaEGmN1Q)\n\nNeedless to say, the family itself was in an uproar at the betrayal by a shady family member who was looked up to for help. Totally understandable. [One family member even went to reddit to ask for assistance and advice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i1e9y/my_cousins_lied_to_my_brother_stole_his_business/)\n\n[His parents even wrote about it](http://www.deilataylor.com/its-not-personal-its-just-business/), and say in the comments that they forgive cousin Nate for betraying their son Brig, founder of Slidebelts... I don't know if I could do that, myself. \n\nThe real kicker is that Brig started creating this type of belt after receiving one as a gift from a student while serving on a church mission in Moldova back in 2007, and the name of his cousin Nate's \"new\" company was... fucking MISSION belts!! Nate claims the name is because his company was originally providing micro loans ([which is a shady business in-and-of itself](http://nextbillion.net/nexthought-monday-the-kiva-fairytale/)) to needy families in poor countries. \n\nI'll let you choose your own expletive.\n\nHas anyone else here been slighted by a family member who feigned interest in their product, only to pull the rug out from under them? Tell us your story, and what you did to protect yourself so we can do the same.\n\nEdit: For clarity on which is Brig (original business, Slidebelts), and Nate (cousin, founder of Mission belts).","name":"t3_40pc94","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-13 01:25:15","week":2}

I haven't booked an airline flight in five years, and never with any Asian company. Each time there was fraud they have been foreign currency transactions.\n\nHow is this happening?

He said that the location where the transactions occurred would eventually be determined by an investigation, but not immediately.

{"id":"40t0j6","author":"clintwiley","body":"Is it advisable to open an independent and/or used bookstore? After reading an article in the Washington Post about how successful used bookstores have been recently, I cannot get the idea out of my head.\n\nI live in a town of 45,000 and the county population is around 150,000. Roughly 20% of the county population has a college or better education. I have an opportunity to rent 3500 sq. ft of retail space on a busy corner where 30,000+ cars pass each day. This location is in the more affluent part of town. There are four bookstores in the town. One is a Books-a-Million in a mall. Another is a 2nd and Charles in a former Borders store (I believe they're owned by Books-A-Million). There is a fairly large used bookstore a few miles away that is stuffed to the rafters with used books, videos and CD's. The forth is a used bookstore and is about a mile away. It is affiliated with a church as a charity and specializes in home-school and educational stock.\n\nThe idea would be to offer a more curated inventory of primarily used, remands and hurts. There is the possibility of offering some new as well although I'm uncertain of that approach yet. There is a loft that might be ideal for CD's and vinyl records, too. I would also offer the inventory online and even use Amazon FBA for online sales of duplicate books that we determine may sell well there.\n\nThere are no plans to open a cafe with this.\n\nI grew up in a family that operated two retail businesses and for the last 20 years I've owned and operated a service business that I started when I was in my early twenties. So, I have knowledge of the various business-related necessities such as accounting, tax collection, POS, etc.\n\nAm I crazy to consider a used or independent bookstore in this day and age and, if not, in the type of location as I described?","name":"t3_40t0j6","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-01-13 18:23:54","week":2}

{"id":"40w3tv","author":"BadFlea","body":"I'm seeing more and more of this the last few months... Very early Monday morning I ordered an item. It was available for next day delivery if I spent $35 or more on the order, or free 2 day Prime delivery. I picked 2 day since it was under $35. When I got to the checkout screen it showed that the 2-day item would arrive on Thursday. That's 3 days. But if I paid an extra few $$$ for 1 day delivery, I could get it on Wednesday. Maybe the folks at Amazon need to learn how to count calendar days! Later on Monday around 10PM I could still order the item for next day delivery if I paid extra. So if the item is available for 1 day shipping at 10PM, why if I don't pay extra for 2 days it turns into 3 days? \n\nThe rep said 1 day and 2 day shipping only means that is how long it will take in transit, after the amount of time they need for \"processing\" the order and to get the item from a fulfillment center. In other words, it could take 2 days for them to \"process\" the order and another 2 days in transit and still be on time.  As a long time Amazon Prime shopper this is not how they did business in the past. \n\nHey, that's okay if they are going to take longer than 2 days, but don't tell me 3 or 4 days is really 2 days. Say it is not Prime eligible and list how ever long they want. But this bait and switch and asking for more $$$ to deliver in 2 days what we already pay a membership for is not cool and probably soliciting a class action lawsuit.","name":"t3_40w3tv","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-14 05:50:55","week":2}

{"id":"4100ky","author":"ShouldntButAm","body":"**How I paid off $10k in CC debt in one year ($55k, SoCal, NO WINDFALLS)**\n\nI wanted to do a write up in how I paid off my CC debt in a year, because every post I see about people paying down large portions of debt after a major job promotion or raise or change had no meaning to me.  I needed to find a way out of credit card debt that was accrued over a large period of time without having to depend on a windfall or major life change, and the majority of the success stories I found were from people already making 6 figures, or had changed jobs multiple times to triple their income.  Here's how I did it with a simple 2% cost-of-living raise and a low-mid income.\n\n**Income/COL Stats (Begin January, 2015)**\n\n**Beginning Cash:** ~$1,000 (Dec 31, 2014)\n\n**Location:** Southern California, 45 min. North of Los Angeles\n\n**Income:** $55,000 ($1,480 Take Home every 2 weeks)\n\n**Raises:** 1x 2%, effective April\n\n**Rent:** $775 (2 BR Apt, $1550 split with partner)\n\n**Gas:** $3.15 - $3.85 / gal\n\n**CC Available:** $12,400 (4 cards)\n\n**CC Debt:** $10,000 (81% Used)\n\n**Avg CC APR:** 22%\n\n**Credit Score:** 630\n\n**Car**: $455 ($250 car, $205 insurance)\n\n**Phone:** $105\n\n**Step 1 – IMMEDIATE Reduction in Monthly Costs**\n\n**TV (Saved $130/month)**\n\nI dropped my DirecTV bill ($150+ a month) at the end of 2014.  I had to pay a couple hundred bucks for the cancellation, which was fine, as I saved that much after a month and a half of no service.  With the internet a practical necessity, and Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, I substituted $150 in cable for what is relatively $18, since I consider the free Prime shipping to far outweigh what we pay (as a household) for the service.  We also barely watch Amazon streaming, so I don't consider this paid TV for this purpose.   I also found an antenna on sale for about $40 purely so I could watch some sports.\n\n**Phone (saved $50/month)**\n\nThe first thing I did was call and change my phone plan.  I was grandfathered into unlimited data as long as I had stayed with the rate that I had been paying.  However, when I looked at my usage I found that, primarily because I'm usually connected to WiFi, I was using less than 3GB of data a month.  Switching from my old plan that was around 7 years old, I went from $105 a month to $54 a month.\n\n**Insurance (saved $50/month)**\n\nWhile I had various driving related issues on my record, my insurance for my leased civic started at around $205 a month for the year.  I was about to start shopping around, wherein I found that by switching companies I could save around $60-75 a month.  However, due to some bad history falling off, safe driver, etc, my insurance ended the year at about $154, and they've been great in helping me take care of some issues I had along the way, so I didn't feel the need to change.  I would say, though, that anyone looking to save money should shop around, as switching companies will result in a money savings the majority of the time.\n\n\n**Step 2 – Planning and Preparation**\n\n**YNAB – You Need a Budget ($65)**\n\nI spent money to buy YNAB.  It's a tool that was highly touted, and since I didn't really need some of the features of Mint, and YNAB was so user friendly (the phone app is too easy), I figured the $65 would not be really frivolous, but instead would be a valuable asset on my road to recovery.  Being able to track every dollar I spent was not necessary sometimes, but having the underlying responsibility and commitment to myself in the background forced me to change the way I viewed my money.\n\nAlso, using the Reporting function on YNAB let me SEE my progress month after month...ok to be honest I checked it like every few days...but SEEING the progress helped keep me on track.  I watched the trend move month after month, and this is what I saw at the end: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png\n\n**Excel – Short Term Predictions**\n\nI created a spreadsheet in Excel that tracked all of my cards separately as well.  While YNAB does allow you to budget, it does not effectively help you plan down to the days of the month.  With payment due dates, bills, etc, I needed a way to not only TRACK my money, but to PREDICT where my accounts would be on any day.\nThis would prove absolutely crucial, as it let me make massive payments without fear of overdrafting or any other bad news pop ups.  There were times when my checking account was as low as $20.  This didn't really matter, though, because I knew where my money would be days and weeks later with no surprises.\n\n**Come Up with a Payoff Plan – Snowball, Avalanche**\n\nI needed to decide how I was going to tackle this debt first.  Through a series of taking care of partners, bad choices, and various life events, I went from having a 785 credit score and 9% APRs to about a 630 and maxed out 19%-25% APRs.  I messed around with unbury.me for a little bit, and determined that the course of action would be to tackle the highest APR first.  However, my plan wasn't all the way conventional.\n\nBalance, APR - $2,000, 23.99%\n\nBalance, APR - $2,200 22.90%\n\nBalance, APR - $3,586 19.99%\n\nBalance, APR - $2,200, 22.90% (Cash Rewards Card)\n\n**Create TINY Emergency Fund - $1,000 Break Glass for Disaster**\n\nFirst thing I did was change whatever money I had over to my checking account, and put $1,000 in a savings account.  This is something I did not touch for the entire year, thankfully, even after paying for car maintenance, fun times, or gift buying, or anything else that came my way.\n\n**Zero out 401k Contributions – (Employer Profit Share, NO 401K match)**\n\nSince my employer doesn't do 401K matching, I had no incentive to keep putting money into my 401K.  If this service is available from your employer, do not stop contributing to your retirement funds.  I did it solely because there was no extra money to be gained in the short term.  If I had matching, I would have saved money elsewhere (like food, see below) and still maintained retirement contribution funding.\n\n**Create a Budget**\n\nI used YNAB to set up a budget to TRY to stick to.  I set a lofty goal of paying off $1,000 in credit cards every month, and worked my budget DOWN from there.  I had the complete understanding that I would probably not hit this mark, but it forced me to find out where I didn't really need to waste money.  I would barely make this work by the end, through a series of monthly ebbs and flows, but only as an average.  I hardly ever hit the $1,000 mark.\nThis would entail paying off $1,000 across all cards.  Effectively this would be about $175-200 in minimum payments, and the rest of the $800 all to one card.  I often would miss this goal.\n\n\n**Step 3 – ACTION**\n\n**How to Control Spending – Using Cash Back Rewards Cards ONLY**\n\nEven though I had the idea to pay down my highest interest first, the first thing I did was put my first big payment onto my cash rewards card to clear up room.  I opened a Capital One Quicksilver with a 1.5% cash back reward at the end of 2014, and made it an effort to use this card for 95% of my purchases.  I also have a Chase Freedom that has 5% cash back on rotating categories, which I would swap out to use during certain times of the year.  This was moreso a mental thing, as it let me feel like I was actually earning throughout the year, even though I was paying every dollar I had to my name to credit debt.  Additionally, I netted just around $450 in cash back rewards by Dec 2015.\n\n**How to Control Mental Stability – Won't Always Hit the Goal**\n\nAs the months started to wear on, I had to change my budget little by little.  I knew by month 3 that paying $1,000 straight to credit cards every month wouldn't work.  Luckily by being paid every 2 weeks instead of twice a month, I knew that there would be a month in the middle and end of the year that I would be paid a third check.  I used the majority of these checks to \"catch up\" on payments.\n\n**How to Control Emotional Stability – Allow yourself some joys in life**\n\nVISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW I SPENT MY FUN MONEY: https://i.imgur.com/FddeIrY.gifv\n\nKnowing that having a goal to pay this off in a single year was going to put me far away from some fun things, I focused on and took some liberties whenever something would come up.  I would do cheap happy hours with coworkers, I would still buy cheap fun things ($20-40 board games that I can play with my GF, a gadget here or there), and I would definitely allow myself to go out to dinner or go on date night with my GF a few times a month.\nUsing YNAB tracking, I realized that I STILL went to eat out to the tune of $300 a month.  This, for all intents and purposes, was frivolous fun money.  There was no need to spend this much if I had truly cared to reign it in, however food and service in Southern California is not cheap, and I was determined to enjoy myself and my friends and my GF throughout the year. \n\nIf I had been in uncontrollable debt, or anything more than what I was, I would have cut out eating out to once a month.  Luckily my situation was controllable, and I allowed myself the flexibility and peace of mind to swap certain things for the possibility by a month or two.  Ultimately, I still paid off my cards in under a year.\n\n\n**Step 4 – Watching the Weight Fall Off**\n\n**The Beginning**\n\nThe first milestone was in March, when I was able to completely pay off my first credit card.  This was a major relief, and an acknowledgement that I may actually be able to pull this off.  After this first card was down, all I thought about was the next one biting the dust, and the next, and the next.\n\n**The Middle**\n\nMy next payoff was in June.  Again, I wasn't hitting my $1,000 mark every month.  The realization of that in the beginning allowed me to maintain some sense of self, not feel 100% beholden to the debt schedule, and when the milestones hit, they felt FUN instead of RELIEVING.  Once I hit this point I really felt like I had it all in control.\n\n**The End**\n\nBy November I made my last payment.  My last.  Payment.  $10,000 in UNDER a year.  I spent some money, I had some fun, I enjoyed myself and my friends, and I paid off the entirety of my credit debt.  Un.  Believable.\n\n\n**Step 5 – The Aftermath**\n\n2015 Chart: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png\n\nAt the end of the year as my debts started to become $0, I noticed a major influx of credit line increases and credit score increases.  In the span of that year my APRs dropped, my credit score rose by about 80 points, and my available credit was nearly doubled, all WITHOUT a phone call, an email, or any effort to do so.  The credit card companies are DIRELY missing the thousands of dollars I've been paying in interest, and they want me BACK.  They have repeatedly raised my credit limits and dropped my interest rates over the past couple of months.\n\n\n**Year Beginning/End**\n\n**Phone**\n\nJan 2015 - $105\n\nDec 2015 - $54\n\n**TV**\n\nJan 2015 - $150\n\nDec 2015 - $18\n\n**Car Insurance**\n\nJan 2015 - $205\n\nDec 2015 - $154\n\n\n**Credit Available, Credit Used**\n\nJan 2015 - $12,400 / $10,000\n\nDec 2015 - $22,900 / $0\n\n**Credit Score (Don’t have my final quarter available yet, but I assume it will increase again)**\n\nJan 2015 – 630\n\nOct 2015 – 705\n\n**Cash Back Rewards**\n\n$450\n\n\n**FINALE**\n\nIn short, I was able to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt with a $55,000 salary (2% raise) in SoCal in a year by immediately removing paid TV, changing my phone plan, and lowering car insurance.  I set aside a credit card to use for all purchases that had 1.5% cash back, which gave me some gift money for Christmas, and let me feel like I was earning throughout the year even though I was paying out every dollar I had.\n\nThroughout the year I let myself understand that some months I would only be able to afford 60-70% of my goal, but that was ok.  In the end it all worked out.\n\nI hope this helps someone who is on the fence or who often gets discouraged by stories of people with 6 figure incomes who can't control their wealth any more than we can.  IT CAN BE DONE.  And it might be easier…and \"funner\"…than you think.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nCouple things.  First off, I would not always suggest that one should cut all retirement savings in the hunt for debt resolution.  There were a couple factors that went into me making this decision, one being that my APRs on my credit cards were astronomical.  I would suggest spending some time looking into your personal situation and what your company and/or personal gains/losses would be before forming your plan.\n\nSecondly, thanks for all the positive responses!  As for the negative responses telling me \"oh yeah just pay off $10,000 in a year thaaanks\"......I get it.  It's the internet.  Understood.  Please save your breath and your fingertip typing tire tread.  I simply made this post to give a take on an Average Joes mental and physical tackling of a very common problem, and honestly to call it what it is, lifestyle.  I'm just hoping to let people know who were in my situation or in my state of mind a year ago that it's possible to get it taken care of, even in an average situation.\n\nThirdly, LOL I am not a shill for YNAB.  It just seemed to be a better fit for me than Mint.  I spent some time on PF reading and looking at people's stories before I chose it.  The main point of this for me was that it held me accountable!  Having this little app on my phone requiring me to put all my expenses in, looking at charts and budget tables every week, and seeing negatives where I overspent was like having a little gremlin on my shoulder every time my wallet came out!  It was instrumental is changing my perception of money...MY money...the money I earn!  And deserve to keep.\n\n**EDIT - Clarification on Take Home/Budgeting Clarity**\n\nPeople seem to be asking about my take home a lot, and I think it's a very valid point to hammer home.  I was bringing home $1,480 * 26 = $38,480 / $55,000 = about a 30% withholdings (taxes, health, etc).  Again, this was at the beginning of the year, and I got a COL increase of 2% a little over quarter of the way through the year.\n\n**As I mentioned in the OP, I get paid every two weeks, NOT twice a month.  This equates to 26 paychecks per year.  What I did was budget to the tune of two paychecks a month ($1,480 x 2  = $2,960) and not factor in the extra check that would come around in July and in December.**  The third paycheck on December 31 paycheck would end up not mattering in this instance, as I had already paid everything off by the beginning of December, however the third check I got in July went to car registration ($200), GF's birthday spending (Aug), some fun activities, and an extra payment dollars towards the card (I believe I put in an extra $500 out of this?  Along with the monthly.  Whatever was left over (wasn't a lot) I let sit in my account so it had more than $20 :).\n\nHad I not gotten this extra payment, I still could have spent the same in August and finished the pay-off in December, however **this wasn't extra cash.  This was a budgeting decision.**.  I decided to budget only off of $35,520, not my annual take home of $38,480.  This was primarily an emotional facet, as the money was coming to me either way, but in an effort to reel in my spending habits, and to experience some joy over the Summer, I chose to not budget for that third check in July.\n\n**EDIT - Excel Tracking Example**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wnpwfwX.png\n\n**Excel File Dropbox Link**\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bv38oxylouziuap/Account%20Balance%20Forecast%20File.xlsx?dl=0\n\nThis is a portion of how I tracked my ACTUAL cash flow in/out, regardless of budgets/budgeting software.  **The budgeting software helped me allocate, while Excel helped me track.**  I hesitate to post the full document, as I'm not sure how useful it would be to anyone else's situations, but I'd be willing to help someone get one together for themselves if it would mean getting them on the right path to debt resolution TODAY.\n\nI'll attach a screenshot of one of my Excel sections that I used to forecast my money.  I also did this in the same worksheet for all of my credit cards.\n\nAs it may be confusing to some, I'll break it down a little bit.  You'll see in it that I have a salary paid, rent and bills paid, and then future forecasted payments (in gray).  We'll have the Chase payment (this was minimum +~$5), the Cap One payment (this was THE card I was paying down at the time), plus a Quicksilver payment for a large amount.  This Quicksilver one was NOT paying down debt!  It was simply paying down the amount I had used during the month of March, as I used that card for 90%+ of my purchases to accumulate cash back rewards.  This is how I tracked not only where my money was going, but where it would be on a day-to-day basis.\n\n**This also REALLY helped me see how much money I DIDN'T HAVE!**  By March 26 I would have $3,500+ in money in my account.  Normally this would be telling myself hey, I can definitely afford to buy something worth a couple hundred bucks!  But no.......now we see by April 3, literally a week afterwards, my account would only have $193 in it.\n\nAgain, this is just an example of how I did it.  I would set it up differently depending on needs, accompanying software, and personal setup.","name":"t3_4100ky","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-14 23:30:49","week":2}

{"id":"410ma2","author":"imgonnasyringeya","body":"Hi guys. First off, I LOVE finding ways to improve the efficiency of my life, which to me is basically what /r/frugal is all about. So with that said, I thought I would share a few things I have changed in my life that have made living better for me. This is basically just a list of frugal actions I have taken. I might be unusual here in that I DONT like to compromise quality of life for a little money, I would rather spend more up front and get quality that lasts, and costs less down the road.\n\nServices:\nRepublic wireless hybrid wifi/cell phone. Uses Sprint network, unlimited everything (3G) for $29/month. I replaced my Tmobile service ($60/month) and it is better in every way.\n\nRoku/Netflix/HBO/Hulu/Slingbox. We can literally get any show we want, any time we want with this setup. Granted, we have generous relatives that let us slingbox off their spare room cable box for live sports or other events. We also split Netflix/Hulu/HBO with a friend, total $20/month for everything.\n\nAmazon subscriptions for dog food/bulk household items. You can save 20% when you need to buy stuff you need to buy any way, AND its shipped to your door. Saves time and money, how can you beat that?\n\nInvest in creating energy savings. Low flow shower heads. Caulk is cheap and helps ALOT in cold weather. Window inserts can be made or purchased and help alot (especially with old windows). Nest thermostat is a huge improvement over traditional thermostats, knows if you are home or not an regulates temperature automatically. Good for me because I forget all the time to turn down before I leave.\n\nCheap hybrid car (Older Prius C). This car rocks, 50+ mpg on average, costs 10K used and will go forever (my experience so far). Never needs maintenance (beyond fluids or tire rotations). Fills up for $20 if that. Four seater works for hauling people or cargo, but its a small car so you can park in tight spaces. NOT great in snow, but I have a lifetime of experience so I manage.\n\nThats my savings rant for today, hope it helps some of you find some new services that improve your life and save you money!\n","name":"t3_410ma2","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-15 01:48:26","week":2}

Business snapshot:  Founded 2013 - started out as an Etsypreneur, then formed a S-corp this year, mid-200k in sales last year, 2 part-time employees not including myself and spouse, selling on Amazon, Etsy, and a domain with a shopify website. Our sales broke down last year approximately 50/50 with FBA and Etsy, even though we only started selling on Amazon in November.  I'm a horrible marketer [started on pinterest today], we have lots of repeat customers, a good product, and an exclusive amazon listing (Amazon Brand registry]. So far so good, looking to take this up a little bit. We invested in additional equipment and are ready to continue growing.\n\nTL;DR I hope to encourage a discussion about trademark licensing and getting a new product sold by retailers.","name":"t3_411diz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-15 04:56:21","week":2}

I also offer them much higher prices than local trade-in stores. There's a trade-in chain which pays 1p (2 Cents) for any DVD more than 2 years old, and another smaller chain offers 10p for any DVD regardless of the age. To be competitive, I offer between 10p and 15p per DVD including free collection and instant cash payment.\n\nA guy sends me about 20 photos of his DVDs. Nothing special, the usual ten-a-penny titles (300, Just Married, 28 Days Later, Oceans 11 etc).\n\nThere's 280 in total, so I offer him £50 for the whole lot. I explain that about half of the titles there are only worth 1p at the big trade-in chain, and they sell them for 20p and 30p anyway. I resell on Amazon so I can get a little more myself.\n\nHe then goes off on a rant about how he's paid \"Thousands for them\" and he's not going to get \"Ripped off\".\nI explain that it's an unfortunate fact of life that things - especially technology - loses value over time.\n\nHe then starts moaning that he'd \"Rather leave them to rot on the shelf\" - Which is quite ironic, because 10 year old DVDs do suffer from disc rot! - and then tells me i've \"Wasted his time\".\n\nIt's a shame that people have unrealistic expectations of what their old stuff is worth!","name":"t3_413s7z","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-15 17:26:50","week":2}

I placed a market order on several puts for Amazon, with a bid of 2.20 and ask of 2.80 early this morning. The order confirmation came back and everything looked good. Next thing I know, they filled the orders at 5.65 each, withdrawing twice the amount of money in my account, giving me a negative balance. I called their office and they said they would \"investigate it.\" Luckily, Amazon tanked, I closed the trade and actually came out profitable. I don't place Market orders very often, I know it's almost never a good idea. I no longer want to use their platform. I have placed the funds back in my bank account.

So... here I am looking for a new broker. I know all of the big names, but what I don't know is who I should go with. I primarily buy puts and calls, and sell covered calls.

My two main concerns after reading the reviews are:\n\n1. I've read that Chase has charged people interest on purchases starting at the date of purchase. Essentially charging interest to those that pay their CC off every month and don't carry a balance.\n2. Chase has processed payments after the due date (if it was paid by the due date) and then charged interest or marked it as a late payment because those penalties go into affect upon processing, not when payment is received.\n\nHave you had those problems? Or are there better cards?\n\nDue to a divorce situation and whatnot, my credit is pretty poor. However, I've paid off all of \"my\" debt. I have a YNAB Budget set up and I'm living off of last months income.\n\nAfter looking at the Amazon card and realizing that a lot of my purchases come from them. And I dine out / get gas a bit.

{"id":"41b66y","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hey /r/personalfinance! 24 Year Old single dude here, and I have recently discovered its time to get my financial house in order to improve my future plus I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I just signed up for YNAB and I'll be working my budget through that as transactions happen.... but here is what everything boils down to for me: \n\n**DEBTS**\n\n* Amazon Store Card ($130) - Will be paid off on Feb. 1\n* Barclay Card ($1830) - Deferred Interest for 17 additional months\n* Capital One ($1800) - Currently at 0, but will have 3 charges of $600 late Jan, Feb, &amp; March for a grad class.\n* Chase Visa ($7140) - 0% Interest Until Dec. 2016\n* Discover It ($7829) - 0% Interest Until Dec. 2016\n* Mazda 6 ($21,000) - Roughly 10 months into Payments. Paying $375/mo.\n\n**ASSETS**\n\n* Emergency Fund: $1100, I would like this to raise up to $2k soon as I have a dog as well. \n* Roth IRA: $~2000 (Not Currently Contributing)\n* Temporary Savings: $2500\n* Company Reimbursement of $2500 for Graduate classes. (Was planning on throwing this in a Savings account to keep away new debt with new classes). \n* Take home pay of $4000 a month, paid monthly. Should be approaching $4200 for 2016 thanks to a raise. \n\nSo my strategy for this is to just debt snowball everything. Amazon Store Card will be paid in full with the next paycheck I receive. The temporary savings is to get me through Tax Season. I made a poor choice and took an early withdrawal from a 401(k) that I had when I switched companies. So I expect to be paying penalties of just below that come April. Stupid mistake I know, and lesson learned. \n\nI think a year will be pretty tight for all of the CC debt, although, I expect to make decent progress, and think 18 months is a pretty achievable goal. The car as is will be paid off in 3 years. Plan on attacking this harder once CC debt is gone.\n\n*Options*\n\n* Pay minimum on Barclay to chunk the Chase card out of the way sooner, and by December. \n* Pay off Barclay and then move on up through the debt snowball. \n\nI have also come to the conclusion that It will be pretty tight to pay off both Discover &amp; Chase by December, but will examine Balance transfer options around October - November this year so that I can avoid the interest.\n\n**Monthly Expenses**\n\n* Rent - $1300\n* Utilities, Everything else monthly - $600\n* Contributing 2.5% to Company Retirement plan (Mandatory Contribution Amount)\n\n**How Did I Get Here**\n\nYikes... I'm still figuring this one out, but a turbulent 2015 left me with quite a bit of emotional spending and lack of pain / discipline with credit cards. Have cut up most all cards with the exception of Amazon Store Card, Meijer Store Card, and Capital One. I have remained disciplined with the Amazon Store Card in paying it off each month, as well as Meijer ($.05 off of gas each time), and Capital One will likely be going to the chopping block.  \n\n\n**GOALS**\n\n* Pay off 2 CCs by the start of 2017 (Not including Amazon Store Card) \n* Find a cheaper place when my lease is up in July\n* Begin saving for a starter home (Goal for around 26).\n\nI'm looking for any advice, strategy, critique of my plan here. If you need additional information, don't hesitate to ask! Also... I'm a believer of Dave Ramsey's system, although not sold on his investment approach, but I'm definitely open to any further suggestions for books / resources!","name":"t3_41b66y","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-17 01:34:21","week":2}

Note-taking allows you to get consistent note credits. \n\nThis website pays out in $10 gift cards when you receive 800 credits. Their payment forms are PayPal, Amazon, Best Buy, Starbucks, and Zappos. \n\nFor each set of notes you upload, you get 25 credits. Each person that downloads your notes gets you more credits. You can submit three types of notes on OneClass:\n\n* Lecture Notes (15 Credits per download)\n* Textbook Notes (24 Credits per download)\n* Exam Notes (36 Credits per download)\n* You can upload handwritten notes also!!\n\nBonus Credits: earning badges, referrals, and adding exam dates. You get 60 bonus credits signing under my referral link and confirming verification in your email.  \n\nI have a Google Drive FULL of notes from my previous years that I probably won't use later. So I'm banking like $10 every 30 minutes. The more notes you have, the more credits you get. \n\nNote: Before you want them to pay out, change your email to an .edu email. They sometimes want to verify if you're a student. There are easy ways of getting an .edu email.\n\nFeel free to leave a comment or shoot me a PM if you need help. \n\n[Referral](https://oneclass.com/a/771216) | [Non-Ref](https://oneclass.com/)\n\nEdit: grammar and errors \n\n**Edit 2**: OneClass wants notes that are original and from the student.

{"id":"41erme","author":"Wheelman","body":"NOTE: For a lot of background information, about a year ago, I shared this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2wxteh/designed_imported_and_successfully_sold_a_product/ - skim to the bottom for most of it. Not required reading, just more background.\n\nI started a standup paddleboard company called Skyline Watersports, (renamed to Skyline Board Co.) , designed and imported the boards (2 containers worth – 200+ boards) and set up a website to sell them on (and we sell on Amazon). I openly and repeatedly admit I'm a terrible marketer, don't have a great sense of how to market to retailers, and dislike the idea of knocking on businesses doors to try to get them to buy boards. I've had great feedback from Outdoor Retailer (a big outdoors show in Utah), have almost 100 really happy customers, and keep my operating expenses rock bottom low. We have 2 posts on twitter, no instagram, our FB page is a bunch of my friends, and we’ve still managed to sell a lot of boards, both locally and around the US, and in the Caribbean.  We have one retail partnership established (they have a board on display in their store) but haven’t sold any yet (it’s winter here). Paddleboarding is a super-hot market right now, more and more people are getting into it, but I simply don't have the time, location, and skillset to grow this company properly. \n\nThe driving reason behind me doing this is graduating from dental school and moving out of state in the next 6 months. I will be busy starting a career and learning about the business of dentistry.  It still is (literally) a fun ride, but it’s time to hand the torch off to someone. I have a lot of systems in place to help this happen – and the purchaser would have everything in place to just start marketing and selling boards. The entire importing/customs/OEM system is well established, as well as the logistics on my end. I have a great reputation with one of the highest quality OEM board manufacturers in Asia that will build and brand the boards per my specs, a logistics company based here in Chicago that has incredible support staff (when you have 50k-75k on the line, you don’t want to have any doubts as to where your container is at). They’ve even sent a rep out to the factory in china at no cost to me to check everything out before I sent final payment. Additionally, we have a cardboard company here that does all custom boxes, a shipping company that does inexpensive deliveries to anywhere in the US, experience shipping internationally, and more. I’ve figured out all the logistics, but I stink at the web side of things. \n\nFinally, we have ~100 boards in stock + accessories, representing an inventory of between $55-75k, depending on valuation. It’s likely that a significant amount of the value of the company lies in inventory, and this could make acquisition slightly more difficult due to the increase it adds to the purchase price. \n\nWhat’s the best way to handle this sale?\n","name":"t3_41erme","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-17 19:39:19","week":2}

I'm sorry about the plebs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/419ieg/new_to_rwallstreetbets_here_are_some_resources_to/)**\n\n**How the AMA will work:**\n\nI will start answering questions at 7pm Eastern. I will answer the top 25 questions so go ahead and leave and comment and then upvote the questions that you want answered the most. If I have extra time I will answer more questions but I feel like this method will filter out the \"What are options can you please give me free money\" type of questions. \n\n**About me:**\n\nHey its me World_Chaos. Yes it's true I'm a senior in High school and it all started because money has always been my passion since I was little. It was my passion so much that my father taught me how to swim by throwing coins at the bottom of the pool. He told me that I could keep the coins if I could dive down and get them. This fascination transferred over to middle school when we played stock market games on MarketWatch with friends and in class. From then on I just started to immerse myself into the world and finance and learn as much as I could by; watching shows like Fast Money and Mad Money, listening to podcasts, and constantly staying updated with the news. I trade everyday and when I'm at home I watch the markets on two screens. No, I am not just trading daddy's money I started off buying and selling Ipads by getting a lower price on the [gift card exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/GCXRep/comments/2za21w/uworld_chaos_2nd_gcx_rep_profile/) for Amazon gift cards then selling the Ipads on Ebay. I took these profits and started trading leveraged ETFs like SPXS, SPXU, UWTI, DWIT on robinhood and then moved over to options on Fidelity. I had amazing success of turning my 3k profit into $15k that eventually my parents and other friends gave me access to their accounts. I've been trading options for a long time and used to post on wallstreetbets but then just kept to myself. Here are some examples of my other posts. [1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/38iogh/so_i_sold_the_all_the_puts_for_216k_sorta_weak/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/389o6s/yolo/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3iavqu/watching_shanghai_slowly_drift_below_3000_as_a/), and [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/396gfk/more_yolo_on_spy_correction/).\n\n\n\n**Why do an AMA?**\n\nThe reason why Im doing this AMA is because I've gotten a lot of PMs recently and I've started to get sick of answering the same questions. Some funny examples of the PMs are:\n\n*\"I just got $10k from someone and I want to start trading and shit. Have any advice?\"* \n\n*\"do you think i could make enough pay off my $9,000 car loan?\"*\n\n*\"I'm a junior in college. I need to make at least $1000 quickly, and gambling with options seems like the best option.\"*\n\n*\"Feel free.. to tell me to fuck off - Just curious if you have a game plan or thoughts for next week?\"*\n\n**Whats my play on Tuesday?**\nHonestly no idea it all depends on how the futures look and how these Iran sanctions go through and how Asia looks. So one big mess that I can't tell you till it actually happens. Thats why I'm all sold out and sitting on cash ready. \n\n\n**NOW!!!

{"id":"cytfp68","author":"blueskyaboveo","body":"Definitely find yourself a niche or specialist skill and try to get as close to being an \"expert\" on something as it opens up so many more opportunities for a revenue stream outside of a full-time, traditional 9-5, retail, or structured job. In my \"real life,\" I'm self employed and I do a lot of contract freelance marketing, event production and consulting. Been doing it 7+ years. Every now and then I contemplate going back and working for someone else because...it's just easier not to constantly hustle or be 100% responsible for your own livelihood, but I enjoy the freedom of setting my own hours, finding my own contracts/clients, travel, etc., WAAAY too much. \n\nFor my side hustles, I flip on eBay but looking to start doing Amazon FBA for additional income -- planning on launching a private label properly in the next couple of months after trying RA and finding that it's too much work and not easily scalable.

{"id":"cytmfg8","author":"jpoms13","body":"I recently helped my girlfriend with a similar situation, and things have worked out for the better. She was looking at about 110K in student debts split very similar to how yours are split across subsidized, unsubsidized, etc. \n\nWe refinanced most of her loans with Citizens Bank with a fixed rate of 6.3% which was higher than we would have liked, but still lower than what she was looking at, especially with the variable rate loans. \n\nIf you are seriously considering consolidating and refinancing, then you will want to go with a fixed rate loan. Variable rates, though they may look cheaper, will likely end up costing more as interest rates rise.\n\nNext, you'll want to identify what loans you actually want to consolidate. For example, those loans with 3.9% interest, they have an excellent interest rate and you probably won't do better than 5% on a private consolidation. It may be annoying to have to make multiple payments, but look, I don't care, we're trying to save money not make your life a cake walk.\n\nFinally, contrary to what many people say, it is not in your interest to pay off smallest loans the fastest. Forgive me rough around the edges style, but all the psychological feel good crap is exactly crap. It's horrible advice. Many financial experts will say to pay off a small loan, regardless of whether or not it has the highest interest rate, with any additional money you pay because you'll feel good about yourself. NONSENSE! If you are serious about saving money and paying less, then any additional money you pay towards your loans above and beyond your standard monthly payment, MUST be directed at the loan with the highest % interest rate. 9% on 12,000 is killing you, not 2,400 @ 6%. \n\nAlso, if you aren't already doing so, take advantage of every penny that you can earn without having to take on additional tasks. What do I mean? If you usually buy water bottles but don't recycle them, start (if you're state recycles). Are you currently being paid to use the internet, No? Then join a site like SwagBucks that rewards you for using their search engine (which is really just Yahoo!). Do you pay for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime? Find a friend and share passwords to save a little every month. \n\nThese things seem trivial, in fact many people will come out and say that a few dollars here and there don't make a difference. Do you know what I say? I say look you're in debt and you want to save money, do everything you can to get out!\n\nAnd P.S., as I mentioned, my girlfriend started out with 110K in student debt and is now down to 88K in just over a year.","name":"t1_cytmfg8","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-11 03:56:45","week":2}

It pays 40k before taxes. It has 401k (3% match), excellent health, vision and dental. It also has a company car that I can use for personal use (officially, up to 600 miles a month, unofficially, those extra miles get tacked on to a service call). My immediate boss is a good friend. I do maybe 4-5 hours of work in a day, the rest of the time I'm just hanging out in my car in my territory with my phone on waiting for a call.

I'm not his idea of a go-getter (I'm just not a go-getter when it comes to making someone else rich). There is no upward mobility. I'm where I'll be. The guys to my left and right have been there 18 and 27 years. The pay is less now (when adjusted for inflation) than when I started and this year it was just announced there would be no raise. Which really isn't that big of a deal since it would have only been 1-2% anyway. \n\nThe might be coming bad\n\n7:30-4 with 30 min lunches might be strictly enforced. GPS vehicle monitoring might be coming. Stricter rules on using the cars for personal use will come with that (can't lie about mileage when they can see how many miles you went).

She has tried to get me fired in the past. As a manager it will happen eventually.\n\nI haven't figured out 2015's numbers yet, but 2014 was our first good year where we brought home 66k after expenses and taxes from eBay and Amazon. This year has been quite a bit better. A whole lot better actually. Increasing my income isn't really that much of a concern because I have a lot of side hustles and skills. My main concern is insurance. I have to have good insurance to maintain mine and my wifes health. Without it our medical costs per month would be near $3500.00.

{"id":"cytu8ni","author":"gamma927","body":"In general, you should own a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to manage your risk. There's no guarantee that any one stock you pick will go up, and it's good to hedge against any company or industry-specific risks. For instance, if you went all in on oil stocks two years ago, you would've lost a large chunk of your money, whereas if you purchased an index fund, your losses would have been offset by gains in other sectors. \n\nThat being said, your question was specifically what stocks were good. There are a lot of different ways to interpret \"good\", but in my opinion, the most important factor is choosing a company you are certain will stick around. From what you've written, I'm assuming that you're looking for a couple bargain stocks that you can buy now, forget about for 20-40 years, and then look at all your gains. \n\nIn this case, the most important factor is to select companies that you are certain will stick around for the long haul. Try to find big companies that make essential products, such as Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM), Altria (MO). While these three may not be the most interesting companies, they will likely stay in business for the forseeable future and grow your capital through regular dividends (per-share payments). \n\nIf you're feeling a bit riskier, you can invest in growth companies that you think will succeed in the future. While you're unlikely to pick the next Apple or Netflix, your time horizon allows you to take a few more risks than others. I would recommend against some of the biggest growth companies such as Apple, Tesla or any of the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) because they've already grown significantly over the past few years and are significantly overvalued. \n\nAs a disclaimer, it's still important to diversify even when you pick individual stocks. Make sure that multiple sectors are properly represented in your portfolio, lest you expose yourself to certain risks. \n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to PM me!","name":"t1_cytu8ni","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-11 08:48:19","week":2}

I was doing MTurk, penny clicks sites etc in the meantime, bringing in enough money to maybe pay the occasional bill. They take a lot of time for not much reward.\n\nOur finances settled a little and I was able to start credit card churning. I also signed up for a ton of companies that do focus groups and market research. I found out about websites that pay you to test websites and apps. These are high pay per hour, but are few and far between. I still did Mturk and task sites and all of these little income streams maybe added up to $500 per month.\n\nI wrote a short smut story and sold it on Amazon, I had planned on writing these short stories to build a serious income but very shortly after my first story, I got lucky (in my eyes) and was hired on to two self-employed online jobs (2.5 years ago) both of which I have to this day. One I love, and the other I haven’t worked all year because better income streams take my time. I'll leave that one in the next couple of weeks, but I treated it as a backup if my main job ever let me go. Last year I got hired onto a third and a fourth job, I left one because it needed my full concentration, which wasn't possible around my two young children and the fourth job ends in March, they may keep me for another year if I'm very lucky but it's rare.\n\nIn anticipation of the fourth jobs lost income I started flipping seriously on FBA in Nov and I've been doing okay, but I'm limited to strictly OA because of the kids. It's a huge learning curve and I'm grateful to have my other income streams to rely on. But nothing is guaranteed, I could lose any of my jobs at any point which is one of the reasons I got into flipping. I feel like I need multiple eggs to feel secure and I'm juggling a lot to allow me to stay at home. \n\nLooking back, I feel like determination and flexibility is the key factor, I know I can write and sell a book, I know I can apply for and get various jobs online, I've never had a period of time where I can't make money at home. I'm lucky because my husband has a stable and very good income (good at least for the Midwest) but my income is very quickly reaching his. \n\nIf you want any advice on companies and some specifics of anything I do, feel free to PM me.","name":"t1_cyu3azn","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-11 16:30:04","week":2}

{"id":"cyu67xt","author":"zoidbergular","body":"Your emergency fund is for emergencies, not for growing your wealth. You aren't going to get returns from a CD, etc. that outweigh the loss of liquidity in the event of a catastrophe.\n\nThat said, an excellent option for your emergency fund (unless you happen to have a local credit union etc. with better rates) is [LMCU Max Checking](https://www.lmcu.org/banking/checking/checking_max.aspx). Anyone can open an account; if you're out of state they require a one-time donation of $5 to the ALS foundation. The account will pay 3% interest, compounded monthly, on a checking account balance of up to $15k which is suitable for many peoples' emergency funds. Anything above $15k gets like 0.1% or something minuscule. The only catch is that you have to do a few things to be eligible for the advertised interest rate:\n\n* Make one direct deposit per month\n\n* Make 10 debit card purchases per month\n\n* Log into online banking 4 times per month\n\n* Sign up for electronic statements\n\nI've been using this account for the past year or more, and it's great. The customer service is really good and it's very easy to meet the monthly requirements for the 3% interest rate. The online banking screen even has a handy link for \"Max Checking Status,\" which will show you whether you have met the criteria for the current month. It's the best option I was able to find for my emergency fund and I highly recommend checking it out.\n\nEdit: Another plus is that using websites like Mint.com or Personal Capital will count towards your online banking logins, as that's how these sites access your transaction info. I haven't verified this myself, but I've also read that you can do things like automate the purchase of small e.g. $5 Amazon gift cards with your LMCU debit card and that this will count towards your debit card transaction requirement.","name":"t1_cyu67xt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-11 17:48:27","week":2}

I'm curious as to where you think Google's failing at that.\n\n&gt;Charm bracelets is a 98 cent keyword on Bing so I assuming there is a market for it and it must be converting. \n\nI don't do much with Bing, but a low-cost keyword doesn't necessarily tell you much. Edit: Unless, is that supposed to be a high-cost keyword? I'm used to adwords, where 98 cents would be a very low CPC in my industry.\n\n&gt;BTW, what do you think of Google selling their own stuff right on the first page of their orgainc results? \n\nI don't really care, TBH. Many people skip the first section in their scanning anyway, because Google clearly marks it as ads. But even within that, Google has algorithms that determines a site's quality score, which in turn partially decides which ads are served when. \n\n&gt;It has the same reward as always putting Amazon on the first page - it pays something. Google gets the top payout from the Amazon affiliate program.\n\nIt seems like you have a chip on your shoulder about Amazon, and I'm confused by it because in my (personal consumer) searches, Amazon doesn't come up reliably first. Like anything else, Amazon appears when it's relevant to my query. Does it appear higher than other things that are relevant to my query? Yes. Does it appear lower than things that are MORE relevant to my query? Also yes.

For example if we look at Vanguards total stock market, VTI, the index is made up of 3791 stocks. But just ten stocks, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Exxon, GE, JNJ, Berkshire Hathaway, Wells Fargo, Amazon and JP Morgan, make up ~15% of VTI. VTI is also 16% Tech stocks. \n\nNow if we look at their Tech index, VGT, it holds 390 stocks. The top three holdings are also Apple, Google, and Microsoft, but this time the top 10 stocks in VGT make up 57% of the index.

To much for almost anything. So I never click Sponsored links. However, you may not know this, Sponsored links are usually the best, because regardless of all the Google-ware (i.e. your SEO metrics) that may raise a site high in the organic list, Sponsored says a lot more about the business, not the website.

Look at your previous receipts and compare them to prices on Amazon, most of the time you can get a better price on the item or a similar item. Also if you know how fast you use items (toothpaste &amp; granola bars idk) you can set up a subscription and save 10% on those items. So I usually use 1 tube of toothpaste a month and I know what type of Crest I like it will just send me that every month. Not only do I get a better price than WalMart I am also getting that 10%. Amazon actually has really good options for food so thing I grocery shop for is fresh produce and raw meats. Saves money, gives me more control over my budget and helps me eat healthier. Also for me personally it is hard to walk into a store and not buy more that what I went there to buy so buying your goods on Amazon instead of seeing it in your face and then just seeing how much you have to pay at the register helps out so I can track in my cart how much I can buy with my budgeted amount.

{"id":"cyv9f2y","author":"willybumbum2","body":"First, I just have to clarify.  Murphy's Law is that everything can and will go wrong...during an experiment if it was executed infinite times.  For instance.  If the experiment was to shoot a balloon from 10 feet away to see the effects, everything that could go wrong, would go wrong if infinite executions of the experiment were completed.\n\n\nNow that we have sorted that out, let's get to the PF section.  You actually have a pretty easy solution.  Rent to two friends that you trust for cheap.  Tell 2 guys/girls that you trust, I'll let you live here for $300-$400/month but you have to keep things clean.  Obviously use a contract.  If that were to happen, let's analyze how long this would take to pay off your debts.  First, I personally believe you need to be adding a whole lot more stuff to your budget:\n\n* Savings (should be setting aside ~$400/month at the least IMO)\n* Haircuts\n* Healthcare\n* Retirement Savings\n* Netflix/Hulu/Amazon (if applicable)\n* Car maintenance\n* Clothes\n* Entertainment\n* Going out to eat\n* House maintenance\n* Car Insurance (didn't know if that was included in your costs above)\n* Life Insurance\n* Car License, registration, taxes\n* Gifts\n* Anniversaries\n* Taxes on extra income (don't know if you are a contractor or not, if so, you should be setting aside about 25% of your income for when tax season rolls around)\n\nThe above are just a few examples.  I feel like your budget should be broken down a bit more.  So let's assume that only $300 is the difference between your income and your expenditures.   \n\nLet's say you use all your new income of $1500 (assuming already taxed) on debts with the previously discussed $300.\n\nTotal for the next 3 months to pay off debts = $1800/month\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**First: Credit Card Debt**\n\n* $6000/($1500 + $300 + $500) = 2.6 months\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Second: Pay off HVAC Debt**\n\n* $6100 - (2.6 x $256) = $5434.4 balance after finishing CC debt\n* Assume you roll the CC payment into HVAC debt and you now have 2 roommates paying $300/month\n* $5434.4 / ($1500 + $300 + $500 + $600 + $256) = 1.72 months\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Third: Pay off Car debt**\n\n* Assume we roll CC and HVAC money into Car debt\n* You didn't leave balance of car, assuming $20k\n* Assuming all $455 goes to car payment\n* $20,000 - ((1.72 + 2.6) * $455) = $18034.4 balance while paying down CC and HVAC debts\n* $18034.4 / ($1500 + $300 + $600 + $500 + $256 + $455) = 5 months\n\nAll of this suggest that you could be done in approximately 9 months if you got 2 roommates after about 3 months and charged them only $300 to live there.  You can play around with my numbers if balances, payments or numbers aren't right.  It's not that bad of a situation.  Also, in those 9 months, if you saved $400/month.  You now have ~$4600 in the bank while paying off debts.  That way, if something happens, then you will be better off.\n\nLastly, keep the car.  You are currently upside down.  Just pay all your debts off like crazy.  Even if this all takes you 1.5 years, you are golden after all that.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions or issues with my assumptions.  \n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit: Other people are saying to pay off the CC and HVAC debt at the least amount i.e. HVAC @ $254.17/month and the CC at the $500 that you are discussing.  For me, you have high enough extraneous debts that I would want them all out of the way.  In order to maximize your money, yes, pay those off right at the end of the 0% dates.  I just hate having small debts like that.  It is also important to me to have large amounts of available income each month.

I;m always very conscious of my 'salary' because there's a lot of people earning a lot of money here so I kinda feel like a second class citizen haha.\n\nSince I have two kids I do non-phone jobs. I currently work as a search engine evaluator. Lionbridge, Leapforce and Appen all hire for this work, you'd be hires as an independent contractor and pay is between $12-14 per hour. ZeroChaos do similar work too, they pay a little higher and hire as an employee, but they only hire for 12 months. I assume due to labor laws and avoiding certain benefits they wont keep you on after the 12 months. Apparently you can reapply after 6 months and get another 12 month contract but that's YMMV. Some of these companies hire for social media evaluators too, I worked on one of these projects for 6 months as an auditor. The auditor work was fine, just too much for me with two young children, but the actual day to day work you'd do seemed mind numbing, but people say that about search engine evaluation, but I don't mind it. \n\nIf you don't have kids there are so many other options, American Express, Amazon, and other companies hire for at home call center reps and Apple and others hire for at home chat reps, they hire as employees too and I believe they have good benefits and a pretty solid salary.

I have the same problem as you, I don't make very much money and what I do save always ends up in some weekend trip with friends or a family vacation. One day I went through a years worth of financial transaction on my only credit/debit card and added up everything that was an \"unexoected\" expense. Usually these are actually expected but just not monthly. For example ; new tires for car, doctors appointments, vet bills, Amazon prime, contacts, etc. I added them all together and divided it by my number of paychecks I have in a year. Turns out its about 150 bucks a pay check. I set my account to auto transfer 150 from my checking to my reserve account. Now my reserve account is set up for yearly expenses. Next I added up the cost of my last major vacation and divided it up the course of a year and that turned out to be $50 a pay check. That gets auto transferred to a savings account which is now my vacation fund. Now my checking account every pay check gas a more realistic number I need to live by each month and the stress of unexpected expenses doesn't bother me as much. I still don't have a savings because I invest all extra money I have into debt but it was useful for me to get started.

Ultimately you are at the mercy of Amazon's matching software when it comes to these spreadsheets and the ASIN you get matched against.

You are at the mercy of the data that is already in Amazon's system, whether it is right or not. And guess what? Even if you add all the right info to your spreadsheet, and Amazon actually has it wrong, you are still responsible if you match to the wrong ASIN (and a customer gets the wrong item as a result). Long story short - you better check all of your SKUs to ensure they matched to the right ASINs. This is a very manual and time consuming process, but the alternative is pissing off customers, and Amazon won't do jack shit to bail you out. \n\nEdit: One option to ensure the right match is to use the ASIN in the standard-product-ID column, and the word \"ASIN\" as product-id-type. This will force your SKU onto your chosen ASIN. However, Amazon may have disabled this option as it was causing problems with data integrity on the back end.

If we work it out though, Amazon is a flat $26.99, plus your applicable tax and assuming free shipping. \n\nIf we then go to Michaels, their price is $49.99, but you get a half off coupon!  This means you divide the price by two or multiple it by 0.5.  This means the price is $24.995.  The United States does not formally use half cents, so we will round up to get a solid $25.00.  What this means is that we can now subtract the Michaels price from Amazon!  \n\n$26.99 - $25.00 = $1.99.  So, the price difference between the two items is $1.99.

Even after marketing and shipping, they were clearing ~$50 each.  They would run sales regularly like \"Last 7 in this color, 20% off!\" and make out like bandits.  The trick is not to make TOO much money (not sure what the exact figure is) but if Amazon figures out the competition sucks and they can make a killing, they will simply source and sell the same product as you.

I was saying, not only is it illegal but it is **also** against ToS. \n\nWhether they allow it or not is irrelevant. In some cases, people who pull SSN out of thin air to use on jobs and what not are ruled as not guilty due to them not really knowing if it belongs to anyone. However, willingly and knowingly using another person's identity *is* against the law. I know quite a few judges and other law enforcement and they were talking about this. Unless the rule suddenly changed in the last two or so years. I had one friend mention a case where a guy used his wife's SSN, then they got divorced. I can't recall what it was, but her SSN was on some account of his and then she sued him for using it 'for numerous years' despite them only recently getting divorced. He claimed she allowed him to use it, she said he 'forced her to agree', end of the day the guy was found guilty. \n\nOf course, your spouse probably won't file a report and therefore you won't be found out. But let's say for a moment s/he does file a  report. It can land you in a lot of trouble. Because in the end, it is illegal.

I do know that when I get an error on my flatfile submission, it's usually 1 book out of 100 that has a funky ASIN instead of the ISBN I input with my scanner.  \n\nWith other media items, CDs and DVDs, for example, I always scan the UPC into Amazon and find the ASIN listed on the Product Details section of the item page and use that as my listing reference.

{"id":"cywflok","author":"just-a-reddit-user","body":"I run a site/blog that gets about 20 million page views/month. Income is very substantial. \n•You need to set your traffic goals much, much higher. Consider how you would build the site and what it would take to bring in 50,000 people/month vs the 500 that are coming today. How would you build out the site if your goal was 500,000 or 5,000,000 per month? Those numbers might sound intimidating, but realistically you need to aim for at least 500,000 page views/month to earn anything approaching a fulltime income. \n\n• Stop focusing on her. The truth of the matter is that few people care enough about an individual traveler to actually follow her site. This would be different if she were a celebrity, extremely notable in some way. She's going to have  a really rough time attracting thousands of people/day with her current writing style and topics. She can incorporate her experiences in the articles, but they should focus on helping people in some way. \n\n• This might be oversimplifying it a bit, but ask yourself this question: \"Why would anyone except her mom follow this blog?\" As of now, there really isn't an answer. \n\n• Enough w/ the negativity. Here are some basic pointers: The content is too short and needs to be MUCH longer if you hope it to show up in Google search results for any topics. If she wants to treat this like a business, she needs to treat it as a business rather than a personal diary. What are people searching for? What is she an expert on and how can she marry the two together? \n\n• Adsense has the potential to make serious $. Anyone that says otherwise simply hasn't run a high-traffic site before. Is it ideal? Probably not if it's your only source of revenue, but Google is the biggest online ad business in the world. Some of my friends run sites bigger than mine and run Adsense exclusively rather than selling ads themselves/working with other ad networks. The issue is that you need scale to do it right. At this point, you won't see much $ at 500 or 50,000 pageviews per month, so it might not be the best solution in the short term. \n\n• Affiliate programs can be fantastic - you can earn up to 8% from Amazon 10% from hotels.com, etc. The issue is that you'll have to target content/offers very well. She can do thisby reviewing products, hotels, etc. and writing authoritative content.  Managing affiliate programs can be a real pain and she might be better off signing up for Viglink or Skimlinks to automate the affiliate links. She probably doesn't have enough traffic to strike direct deals or to qualify for affiliate networks. \n•She needs to build a network of other travel/fashion/style bloggers and get in tight with them. Link to their best work, Retweet their work, basically network as best she can. Ask them to link to her featured articles/best work in return down the road. \n\n• Find something that makes her TRULY UNIQUE/STANDOUT and get someone to sponsor whatever that aspec of her/her site is. $1,000 is nothing to a lot of companies/brands. Is she super passionate about a brand of clothing? Is she super loyal to a particular airline? Does she champion anything at all? Whatver it is, there's a good chance she can  set up a small sponsorship w/ a company once she gets the ball rolling. \n• Use YouTube, IG, Twitter, FB to network and promote her site AND those that she identifies as peer sites. \n• If you want to read up on SEO, check out Yoast.com. Not 100% right on everything, but will get you started down the right path. \n• Be patient. The hardest thing is to grow your audience. However, audiences can grow really fast. Traffic does not grow linerarly and can spike really quickly if you connect w/ your audience and/or fill a niche that's underseverd. \n\nBest of luck!

I'm averse to buying large items online (e.g. big TVs, refrigerators, ovens, washers, dryers) and I think most people feel the same way.  The biggest competition there is other local retailers so I'm sure prices are competitive in that sense.  Small items are much more likely to be bought online if there isn't an immediate need for it, but then again Amazon is expanding their 1 and 2-hour delivery service.\n\nFor me, selection is the biggest issue.  I've heard, \"You can order it at BestBuy.com,\" far too many times.  That's essentially the same as saying, \"You just wasted a 30 minute trip.\"  They might price match some online stores but only if it's the same product.  I was there a few days ago and they had almost no cases for my Galaxy S5 and the ones they did have were just ugly as hell.  And again, I think you get far more useful information looking at online reviews than \"kicking the tires\" yourself.

{"id":"cyxnecl","author":"Dude_with_the_pants","body":"I'm new to the sub but I'll put in my 2 cents. I've learned quite a bit moving into my new apartment on a not so great salary. Sorry for the long post. It kind of just started pouring out. \n\nKeep receipts and a record of all \"job search\" related expenses including travel, gas, training, materials, or hotel stays for interviews. If I remember correctly, most of these things can be deducted from your federal taxes.\n\nStart looking for the places that on average have the cheapest prices on necessity items. Gas, groceries (smaller, local stores, Walmart). Shop there exclusively. Couponing and sales help a lot too. I've seen people purchase $250 in groceries and save $100 with coupons alone because they were smart and strategic about it.\n\nDo defensive driving online for cheap (6 hours spread over a few days or a Saturday). They give you a certificate that you turn into your car insurance to lower your payment by 10-15% (this might not be true in all states).\n\nSee if you can lower your cell plan. Switch to a lower data cap, lower monthly allotment of call time or texts. Lower it to what you actually use or the bare minimum. You can always raise it to the next notch if necessary. Stay on WiFi as much as possible to keep your data usage down. I work in public education. I actually receive a 15% discount with Verizon because of a \"preferred employer\" discount. I also received a $200 discount on my apartment security deposit for the same thing. There might be something similar for you for different services you use. It never hurts to ask.\n\nShop around for cheaper car or home insurance. Companies will usually provide a discount if you put car/home/etc insurance all under 1 company.\n\nCut cable TV. Go with basic cable or over the air TV (it's free, you'd be surprised the amount of TV that you can still get with a good set of rabbit ears or an antenna, it's crystal clear too, no more grainy picture). Keep Netflix. That $8 a month is well worth the amount of possible entertainment. See if you can switch to a cheaper internet provider or lower your data plan. Shows will often have recent episodes available to stream on the network's website. Just Google \"the show name full episodes\" or \"watch episodes.\"\n\nKeep up with routine car maintenance (oil change, etc). Don't put it off to save money. It's like medical expenses. You could save a little money by not having health insurance or skipping a checkup. But you'll really regret it when a big, expensive problem pops up that could have been prevented if it was caught early.\n\nBe mindful of your electricity usage. Turn off lights and other electronics when not it use. FYI, computers are still drawing power when they're asleep. Actually choose \"shutdown\" to turn it off. For true micro-managing of your power, unplug things not being used, even surge protectors. Electronics still draw power when they're plugged in. Lowering your thermostat by a few degrees will dramatically save on electricity because the A/C isn't on as much. Just dress warmer/cooler inside the house. Turn down the temperature a little on your fridge/freezer, it shaves a little more off your bill.\n\nThis is true in Texas, I don't know about other states. You can actually choose your electricity provider and price at [PowerToChoose.org](http://www.powertochoose.org). You may have something similar where you live. You might be able to get out of your electricity contract.\n\nI actually just learned this one about an hour ago. Take a 1 liter bottle or half gallon jug and fill it with water. Put it in your toilet tank. You will now save water with every flush you make. It's a small thing, but it adds up on your water bill. \n\nDrink more tap water and less other drinks. Get a filter if you have to, but drink it from the tap. Bottled water is too expensive (not to mention bad for the environment). There's tons of health benefits, not just financial benefits. Keep a jug/pitcher of it in your fridge to always have clean, ice cold water.\n\nHead over to r/personalfinance. They give great advice and provide amazing help on budgeting and other financial stuff. Don't be afraid to share accurate numbers with them. It lets them help you better. \n\nThere's always free or cheap entertainment around town. Community events, touristy-type events and locations. You still need to provide yourself with entertainment to keep your spirits up.\n\nBring your/the kid's lunch to work/school. It's much cheaper than buying lunch everyday. Eat at home and cook as much as possible.\n\nTry to find some other forms of income. De-clutter your house by selling things on eBay or Craigslist. As others have said, file for unemployment as soon as possible. Provide small services for people and get paid for it.\n\nCheck out r/beermoney. It's a sub that concentrates on making money online or with smartphones. I've been doing this myself for several months. I know, it sounds like an infomercial, but there are legitimate businesses that pay you small amounts of money to perform different tasks. It's often the unseen part of their marketing and research department. The sub is called beer money because that's the expectation of the amount of money you can make, enough to keep up your beer supply. I'm just trying to temper anyone's expectations. But there's also people that pay for groceries using these websites. There's several websites talked about on the sub. Most people swear by [Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com) or [mTurk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). Swagbucks is centered around playing video ads (it can be very bandwidth/data intensive, be careful to not hit your data cap) on your computer and smartphone or doing online surveys. You then receive \"Swagbucks\" (points) for certain tasks. 100 Swagbucks = $1. Doing this a little each day can add up. So many Swagbucks count towards store gift cards or cash through a PayPal account (which you can then transfer to your bank account with no fee). mTurk is centered around performing different tasks for specific people on Amazon, tasks usually are marketing and research related. mTurk has the higher earning potential but takes time and research to get to that point. Swagbucks is much more accessible to a beginner and has very good earning potential. There are guides on r/beermoney and plenty of people to help. It can take a couple weeks to receive your payment once you cashout your points. Some beginner's advice, create and use a separate email from your normal one for your  beermoney accounts. That way you won't have to worry about more spam. Don't think you can cheat the system somehow. They've gotten very good at catching and banning people trying to cheat them through various technological means. If you make more than $600 a year doing this, you must declare it on your taxes.\n\nGood luck. I hope this helps.\n\n","name":"t1_cyxnecl","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-14 07:21:02","week":2}

{"id":"cyxpuyz","author":"bioeasel","body":"Hi folks,\n\nPer the article, Amazon recently announced a 20% discount for prime members on new video game releases. Video game publishers currently use a form of (legal) vertical price fixing called Resale Price Maintenance. It means that sellers attempting to lower prices below the price set by a publisher can no longer be given that product to sell. \n\nWhat I'm curious about is how Amazon is lowering prices so drastically ($12 on most titles) without any backlash. Best Buy and GameStop have similar discounts and membership programs as well, so that's an important factor.\n\nI'm also curious what you all think the business tactics are behind this decision. To me, it seems like Amazon is attempting to gain a larger share of the market by potentially undercutting Best Buy and GameStop in terms of convenience and even price for some folks. Everyone and their dog has a Prime account these days, and the potential savings on games and shipping are enough incentive for most people to get a Prime account and buy ALL of their games from Amazon. So it seems like there are two major benefits to Amazon in that respect. \n\nAnyway, what do you all think? This seems like a really interesting econ topic to me.","name":"t1_cyxpuyz","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-01-14 09:29:07","week":2}

You can get a number of rotating 5% cards and just use whichever one will give you 5% on what you're buying at any given time. However, this is tedious and inconvenient to keep track of, which is why I don't like cards with revolving categories.\n\nThe best and most convenient single card is the Citi Double Cash, which 2% on everything (1% when you purchase and 1% when you pay the bill).\n\nI also like the Amex Blue Cash Preferred (6% groceries, 3% gas, 3% at certain department stores, 1% everywhere else, $75 annual fee). The Blue Cash Everyday gives you 3%, 2%, 2%, and 1%, respectively, but with no annual fee. You'll have to do the math on your spending to see if the paid version is worth it.\n\nIf you shop on Amazon frequently, they have a Visa that gives 3% back on all Amazon purchases. They also have a store card (i.e. can only be used on Amazon) for Prime members that gives you 5% back as a statement credit.\n\nThe Double and Blue Cash pairing is the best combo of rewards and convenience, in my opinion. I use this combo regularly and have been very satisfied. I do also use the 3% Amazon Visa for Amazon purchases, as the reward dollars link directly to your Amazon account such that you can apply them to future purchases.","name":"t1_cyy5i72","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-14 19:07:14","week":2}

{"id":"cyy70hw","author":"brp","body":"I have a few cashback cards (except for the Citi Simplicity) and they have the following benefits:\n\n1. **AMEX Blue Cash Preferred:** $75 annual fee, but 6% Cashback at grocery stores.  This gives you 3% more cashback at grocery stores than the $0 annual fee AMEX Blue Cash Everyday card.  If you do the math, you only need to spend $210 or so a month ($210x0.03x12) at a grocery store for the extra 3% to negate the yearly fee.  I use this to purchase gift cards at the grocery store (earns 6% as well) and effectively get 6% cashback on a lot of normal purchases.\n2. **Capital one Quicksilver Card.**  1.5% cashback on any purchase (no category BS) and no annual or FOREX fees.  I setup all my automatic recurring monthly bills that I can (e.g. Tolls, cell phone, utilities, cable bill) on this card and then keep it in a drawer.  This way I always get a decent cashback on these items and also since I don't use it out and about, if/when my regular spending card(s) gets skimmed, I don't have to change/update all my automatic monthly payments w/ a new card (or forget to update them as has happened in the past).\n3. **PNC CashBuilder Visa Card:** 1.75% cashback (bonus 0.5% due to having a Performance Select Checking account with them) makes this a pretty decent card with no annual fee.  I got this card for the $100 bonus they're offering as well as to use for some around-town purchases that don't fall into a specific category.\n4. **Chase Sapphire Preferred:** $125 yearly fee and 2 points on travel.  Not really a cashback card, but a great card to use for travel expenses.  I signed up for a bonus promotion that gave me a higher than normal yearly fee, so I am currently in the process of canceling this card and getting a Chase Marriott Visa that provides similar benefits.\n5. **Amazon Store Card (Synchrony Credit):** No annual fee and 5% cashback all the time at Amazon.  This gives the same or better cashback than the Chase Freedom rotating category and Chase Amazon Visa card, which have both now been mostly relegated to my sock drawer.","name":"t1_cyy70hw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-14 19:39:39","week":2}

Get in and get out for a clean 10% scalp.\n\nAMZN - if you are not buying right now you are a fucking idiot. They cleaned up on Xmas, their video platform just spanked everyone and debt does not matter. $650 around earnings.  5 - 8% rip if you get in now and wait till Feb. it will be bumpy but it is a fucking buy.\n\nNFLX - Will we see $125 again, not in the near future. it is on sale but it is a long term hold, you can scalp but it will be low margins. Maybe $118. All the talk about AsiaPAC is still a ways off so unless the market gets stupid or something out of left field happens I dont see $125 in the next 90 days, but I am a dumbass, so take it for what it is worth, free advice on the internet from a stranger with an erection. \n\nDIS - all the talk is they are going to crush EPS, $100 is a bargain, will get back to $110 - $115 around earnings. ESPN is the outlier. They fucked themselves with major games during new years parties, but the Super Bowl in Spanish might save them.

When a business is formed, you should make a list of all the different positions in a business, from CEO to salesperson, and everything in between.  Put your names next to each position that is applicable.  Then, for each position, write out exactly what responsibilities that position will have.  As detailed as possible.\n\nAs time goes on, the company list needs to be updated, it's a living document.  There should be no question about who should be doing what, from building maintenance, cleaning, paying the bills, marketing, payroll, accounting, everything.\n\nThat all should happen BEFORE the business is started, but it seems you need to do some catch up.  If your partner is not a reasonable person, and you have taken a subordinate position, you dont have a lot of options.  Id start by discussing the above with them and see what they say. \n\nEdit:  A great book on company organization in plain English, that is easy to read and informative is called The E-Myth Revisited.

{"id":"cyyeauo","author":"Nestledrink","body":"There are a few ways I can think of:\n\nOpen a savings account separate from your checking bank. Some of the online only banks works well (Ally and Barclays Savings are well regarded here). This is to give you one extra hurdle to withdraw your savings\n\nBudgeting is one thing and everyone can do it easily. What's hard is to stick to it and be accountable. Most people here would say \"SELF CONTROL\" but it's not that easy. We all know that.\n\nUntil the past few years I had a lot of issues savings and one way that works for me is to literally use Excel and write down ALL my income and expenses. If you know Income Statement for business, I basically make a MONTHLY income statement for myself to compare it with the budget. \n\nI literally listed all my income and expenses line by line grouped into **granular** categories. This is important for me because if the category is too big then it's hard to trace them. You really want your categories to be just one step above the line by line transaction. For instance, all my groceries spending goes to Groceries category and all my other food budget goes to Dining Out and I also have a \"discretionary spending\" bucket which is basically miscellaneous spending. I do break out my phone, utilities, and internet separately too.\n\nWhat this does to me is to realize how much I spent in one category or more. In a perfect month, I want discretionary spending to be $0 so if it's not, I can dig further into it what kind of crap I bought from Amazon that's categorized here. When my dining out budget is large, I am able to check why.\n\nI find that manually entering your expenses makes myself more accountable and aware of spending. Just looking at these expenses on mint or bank account does not work for me.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nPS: Yes this means you gotta keep all your receipts...\n\nPPS: Do this every 1-2 days. **Not once a month**.

Interest will be charged to your account from the purchase date if the promotional balance is not paid in full within 24 months. Minimum monthly payments required. Offer is subject to credit approval. Applies to any order total that includes an advertised eligible product sold by Amazon.com made on an Amazon.com Store Card account or an Amazon Prime Store Card account (\"Qualifying Purchase\"). Any purchase of products sold on Amazon.com by third-party sellers do not count as a Qualifying Purchase but may receive the benefit of this offer if on the same order as a Qualifying Purchase. No interest will be assessed on the promotional purchase if you pay the following (the \"promotional balance\") in full within 24 months: (1) the promotional purchase amount, and (2) any optional debt cancellation charges related to the promotional purchase. If you do not, interest will be assessed on the promotional balance from the date of the purchase. Depending on purchase amount, promotion length, and payment allocation, the required minimum monthly payments may or may not pay off purchase by end of promotional period. Regular account terms apply to non-promotional purchases and, after this promotion ends, to your promotional purchases. For new accounts: Standard variable purchase APR is 25.99%. Minimum interest charge is $1.50. The APR is accurate as of 3/1/2015 and will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate (as defined in your credit card agreement).

Not \"we are going to show you the lowest price from a 3rd party when we sell the same thing ourselves for a few bucks more\".\n\nAlso, that link you posted is almost 6 years old.  In that time, they have now allowed-3rd party sellers to also offer Prime shipping.  These sellers are more than welcome to attempt to charge less than Amazon and still offer Prime.  \n\nHere is a screenshot I just took that isn't 6 years old.  I just searched Seiko and clicked on a watch.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8km9P2z.png\n\nNotice how now, ALL of the 3rd party sellers are Prime-eligible and there is NO price difference between my logged in account on the left and the screen on the right?\n\nCan you actually show a SINGLE example of where an item SOLD BY AMAZON is being sold at a higher price to a Prime user than the same item also being sold by Amazon?  Feel free to look around, but I can save you the trouble: no, you can't.  There is no \"charging someone more because they have Prime.  The Prime user, even in your 6-year old link, still has the ability to actually look at the page they are on an choose the cheaper, non-prime option if they want.\n\nI honestly think you are being purposely obtuse at this point.\n\nYour original statement was:\n\n&gt; You could well be paying more because you have prime.\n\nThat's false.  Well, you COULD be paying more if you don't take 2 seconds to look at the actual webpage and see a 3rd party seller price.  You have now basically changed your argument to \"but, they were showing the Amazon Prime item to the Amazon Prime subscriber!!\"\n\nAlso, I'm not digging around to find another item right now, but a thing they do now IS actually tell you directly if an item is cheaper without Prime somewhere else.  Normally, right under the price, there is a message that states something along the lines of \"This item may be available cheaper from a 3rd party seller without Prime shipping\", or something like that.\n\nSo really, even though you've changed your argument, it's still incorrect.","name":"t1_cyzhehg","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-15 19:40:49","week":2}

{"id":"cyzinps","author":"Only1nDreams","body":"I may sound like a bit of a hippie here but I think that Japan economic decline is because the whole country has depression.  People call Japan's rebound from the devastation of WW2 miraculous, but it wasn't. It was just a whole nation that decided they were going to expand the typical workweek to grow faster than everyone else. Companies set ridiculous standards in order to achieve growth, and growth was achieved, for a time. \n\nBut then people literally started dying from overwork (see [Karoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi)). Work practices like this went on for 20 years before the economy started to slow down and companies realized that working employees to death wasn't a sustainable business practice. The problem is that culture is not very malleable. People who spent a majority of their careers in this environment have it hardwired in them, and they pass it on to the next generation of workers. The culture of growth or death remains deeply rooted in Japan and its consequences go beyond worker health. Depressed people are not creative, they are not forward thinking, and they do not think about improving things or innovation. They think about surviving until they can make it back to whatever vice they have that lets them escape from the mental torture chamber they live in. \n\nLook at successful North American companies now. One of the greatest success stories in the past 20 years is Google, and a lot of Google's success stems from how they treat their employees. Some of their best products come from 20% time, literally a whole day's worth of time per week letting employees work on whatever they feel like. The corporate ingenuity that makes companies like Google so successful is nonexistent in Japan, and it has caused them to remain stagnant. \n\nIncidentally, it's also one of the main reasons I won't invest in Amazon, I simply don't believe that a company that is run like that can be successful in the long run. They're just going to keep churning talented people through the meat grinder of their corporate culture until there's no one left that wants to work for them.

{"id":"cyzqqgg","author":"r_notfound","body":"I believe the biggest \"moat\" (defensive competitive advantage) enjoyed by Netflix is that they are a content producer, not just a content venue.\n\nAmazon and Apple are both attempting to profit off of charging for access to content that they did not produce, and must in turn pay for. You left Sony off your list, but the Playstation store also has this type of content... as does Comcast, TWC, Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc.\n\nNetflix is aggressively pursuing original content creation, which allows for them to control the cost of content and achieve greater vertical integration. It's a smart bet in my opinion, as the other players end up in a race to the bottom trying to compete on content pricing (hurting margins) or through differentiating on performance and features, which gets tougher and tougher over time. (The iTunes app may offer a better experience than the Amazon browser interface, but are you willing to pay an extra dollar to watch a movie on it?)\n\nAlso, most of Netflix's competition has a domestic focus in general, influenced by their market position being primarily based on physical goods.

{"id":"cyzrv52","author":"sr71Girthbird","body":"Random thoughts ahead from someone in the industry:\n\nI work for a company that sells video processing services, so this is very interesting to me, and is often talked about in the office.\n\nIt's important to note that Netflix does all video processing in the cloud, but does not resell these services. Apple requires you send content to them in the correct formats, and does very little themselves. Amazon both processes a ton of video, and resells these services as part of their AWS suite (amazon elastic transcoding.)\n\nThe biggest move in the space recently is that Amazon bought one of the big 3 video processing companies, Elemental Technologies, and have been/will be integrating Elemental's boxes (specialized computers) into their services over the next few months. Keep an eye on Harmonic and Telestream, the other two, to see what happens to them moving forward. \n\nI fully expect Amazon did this because they want to get into the space in a bigger way, and want to keep their costs low, as opposed to paying these companies for their boxes over and over as they continue to scale up their streaming service.\n\nI guess my point here is that I fully expect Amazon to take some market share from Netflix, but Apple likely will not. Apple seems to be focusing their development on entirely new products, while Amazon is making a concerted effort to get more into the streaming (and video processing) space. \n\nAlso interesting to note that Netflix almost exclusively uses Amazon web services to do their video processing, which means there could be some very interesting things going on as they start to compete more, possibly with Netflix moving away from AWS services entirely (my company hopes so!)\n\nHere's a quick [link] (http://www.techworld.com.au/article/443660/how_netflix_has_cloud_do_heavy_lifting_video_transcoding/?pp=2) from a few years back which talks about the Netflix - Amazon relationship.

(Not doubting you, just want to do my homework if I was off base.)\n\nI would agree that it's an interesting dynamic between Amazon and Netflix regarding the processing, but I think it's one that is sustainable for a number of years. There are plenty of examples of these types of relationships. Right now Netflix is still in a phase of strong growth and subscriber additions.\n\nI think many years from now, when Netflix has saturated the market and is looking for ways to improve operating margins, they will look at things like operating their own content processing to reduce costs. For now though, they are focusing on the core of their business, and using Amazon to limit the degree to which they are required to be invested in datacenter operations and such.","name":"t1_cyzsho5","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-16 00:04:55","week":2}

But I'd be surprised if that stops it. At a minimum, I think they would have \"lanes\" where they can fly, such as over roads and power lines. Maybe even hours of day when they can/can't fly. Yes, they'd still feel like they're over us all the time, which I agree isn't what I would want.\n\n&gt; trucks can do the job nearly as fast\n\nYes, amazon has same day delivery and one hour for some things here too. But there's a reason it's only in a few select places, because that's a very hard thing to scale up. Adding drones allows them to scale. \n\nThat said, same day delivery isn't a big deal to me 99% of the time. But, even with 2 day prime, UPS is having trouble keeping up... Amazon is looking to buy/lease their own fleet of airplanes, they use Fedex to handle some overflow, they use private couriers for additional capacity, they use USPS for Sunday delivery. They're starting to max out the capacity of existing ground delivery systems and they're looking to how else they can solve the problem. \n\nTaking a step back, I don't think I want so many drones overhead either.

{"id":"cz16ovi","author":"hoghammertroll","body":"Another Hearthstone player on /r/Flipping? Awesome!\n\nNothing cheesy about your response (I swear, this has nothing to do with my bias towards Hearthstone), but I honestly find inspiration in some of the simplest or weirdest things. I mean, for crying out loud, I've had life-changing motivation come from certain guitar riffs I've heard a million times in songs I listen to daily, but happened to randomly pick it out while listening to music that day.\n\nAlso, I'm new to the flipping game (about finished with getting all of the supplies ready to start, now to snag some items to flip), but as a frequent buyer, for years, on both eBay and Amazon, the way you handle customers is exactly what I, as a buyer, would want. \n\nGiven the nature of buying online, vs the nature of a brick-and-mortar place (waiting for days on an item I've purchased from another \"faceless seller\", rather than walking out with an item the day I buy it from my local Walmart), I still have friends and family that look at me weird when I tell them I've bought this or that from eBay or Amazon (because I'm purchasing with the point and click of a mouse, rather than driving across town to get what I gotta get). \n\nJust as I see flippers here weary of scammers buying their items, only to file an INAD and return a box of rocks, a lot of people I know are still stuck in the mindset of the early days of online shopping, where they think everything short of holding the goods in their hands the moment their money leaves their possession is going to get them ripped off.\n\nEven given my experience with buying online (I've been buying for years, never really had a problem with anyone or anything), buying from a seller who communicates well and acts professional is much more comforting to me (as a buyer), given that I can't just drive a few miles down the road to return the item I bought if it wasn't what I needed or turned out defective. \n\nThe worst experience I've had thus far with buying online is I actually purchased a printer recently (to print shipping labels), and the seller had sent it in a box of packing peanuts, but didn't wrap the printer in anything. Because of this, I spent the better part of 20 minutes picking tiny pieces of Styrofoam out of the insides of the printer after opening it. He also hadn't included the USB cable with it (there was nothing in the auction that stated that it did not come with the cord, so I assumed it came with everything needed to use it). I sent the seller a message kindly offering a simple suggestion about not using packing peanuts for printers in the future, or wrapping items like that in something first (I'm generally an easy-going guy, so the peanuts thing wasn't a big deal, but knowing how some people are, and given the seller had roughly 50 feedback, I was just trying to be helpful for him in the future, since I assumed he was new to the game), and inquired about the missing USB cord. \n\nThat was 2-3 weeks ago, haven't heard a peep from him, so as soon as I hunt down the cord to test out the printer, he may have himself his first neutral feedback. For this guy, it may not be a big deal, but a simple response and possible clarification on the USB cable would've left me satisfied enough to leave a 5-star positive feedback, provided he responded in a professional manner, and the printer works properly.

Alongside this, on mobile Facebook constantly polls your location data, giving them excellent (and unique) data which can be used to prove their ROI to advertisers.\n\nBy default, adblock leaves non-intrusive ads unblocked. Facebook sponsored ads are non-intrusive. Internet users who block ads are more likely to pay attention to ads that they see due to the lack of advertising saturation that they encounter on a daily basis. Source: [Citation Needed yo]\n\nAs Facebook are a closed advertising network and they control the technical presentation of the content (via HTML, rather than injecting a script from an external ad network), it's trivial for them to make ads unblockable on the desktop client. Blocking adblockers will become a serious conversation in the coming years and (unintuitively) Facebook are in a much stronger long-term position within the advertising business than GOOG in that respect.\n\nThat all being said IMO, you (the royal you) are a moron if you're considering FANG at this current in time point due to market volatility. Disclaimer: I'm a coward when it comes to macro. The market's down due to geopolitcs and at this point in time there's serious (IMO founded in reality) speculation as to whether the coming reduction in Chinese VC will topple a few unicorns in the next few months, what I can't say is whether that will have a significant impact on the established tech players.\n\nP.S: Any moron can tell you that Amazon have been fudging cash flows heavily with leases for the past few years, what they won't tell you is that most of the quant/newsflow guys haven't picked up on it yet. It's overvalued, a very poor value investment (understandable not to appropriate for this sub), but the market's moving on flawed data, it'll change at a whim and someone with a ton of insider knowledge will make a ton with a well-timed short.\n\nP.P.S: Every analysis needs a chart. I base all of my investments on [this one chart](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles).

{"id":"cz1palr","author":"Teawouldbelovely","body":"I hope it happens soon. I just feel like Etsy is not professionally run.  For example today the cost to ship a piece of jewelry to Europe went from $6.50 to $13.00 literally overnight.  \n\nThe cost to ship a dress to Europe has gone up $10 over three years. About $5 this year.  There's no real reason for this cost increase since fuel prices are down and the main reason for the cost increases is that USPS expanded pricing brackets.  So for example 12-35 ounces are all one bracket for international shipping.  \n\nTo explain that in layman's terms I can put a dress in a manilla envelope OR in a box the size of a microwave, stuff that box full of newspaper, throw in a free complimentary coffee mug and both packages will ship on an airplane to Europe, or Australia or Asia for the same EXACT price. $22.  It's a bad move for USPS and international business shippers.  (No other shipper in the US is allowing anything like this even for domestic shipments).\n\nI feel like amazon, would have had someone in washington lobbying against these sorts of price changes or lobbied for special prices/service from USPS. Amazon got USPS to deliver Sunday this year.  Ebay already has their global shipping program so I just send what I sell there to Tennessee and  Ebay ships internationally at whatever negotiated discounted rate they have. I think with fed ex.\n\nInternational sales used to be about 1/3 of Etsy's business and 38% of mine.  I'm sure that went down last year because of currency issues and it will continue to go down because of shipping costs. However, I saw that coming and managed to grow my business last year and am pretty sure I can continue to if Etsy stays around.\n\nWith the current management situation though that's a big *if*. I could write at 10 page paper on OTHER problems. This is just one example.    ","name":"t1_cz1palr","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2016-01-17 19:11:44","week":2}

Shipped an older version of a digital photo display, and I KNEW it worked 100%. One week later return request for some really minor problem that I know it didn't have. It was on me as the seller to pay for the shipping back to me, which would end up losing me money.
