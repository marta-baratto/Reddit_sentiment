{"id":"3tzppm","author":"koopkaty","body":"[Originally posted on StayPlucky.com](http://stayplucky.com/post/133812712963/microwork-websites-that-arent-so-terrible)\n\nSometimes the hustle is hard, so you want to just do some fast web work to get a little $$$ on the side. But there are a ton of scammy microwork websites out there. Here are some sites that I’ve worked with that actually aren’t the worst. They certainly aren’t the best because it is micro-work. I’m also disclosing the actual money I’ve earned from them recently to give you a little picture of it.  So here we go:\n\n[1. SwagBucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/)\nI know it’s hard to believe something with ‘swag’ in the title is legit, but it really is. Number One, if you refer other people to swag bucks you get 10% of what they earn, which is pretty cool but they have a ton of surveys,videos to watch, ways to earn while you online shop, and even get points by doing searches in their search engine. They recommend making their search your default but I personally can’t bring myself to do it because I love google so much. You can’t make huge amounts in a day, but if you do like a survey or so often enough, you can get enough points to get good giftcards, including paypal. \n\n**Real Reward:** I did enough surveys and I got a $5 Starbucks giftcard (maintaining my gold status is very important to me).\n\n2. [Amazon MTurk](MTurk.com)\nBasically the mecca of micro-work. You won’t be working for a whole lot but you can do surveys, transcriptions, weird image work, some search evaluation and sometimes you can be invited to do things. Most of the time though, you’re not going to work for more than $1, so you’re gonna end up doing a lot of work over time. I don’t ever really work for under $0.20, that’s ridiculous. Most of it isn’t hard at all though. You can either transfer it to real money or towards an amazon giftcard. \n\n**Real Reward:** I loaded earnings onto my amazon account and got a tea straining ball and A Vindication on the Rights of Women. I also have a lifetime earnings of $12.55. I haven’t gone real hardcore on this website. \n\n[3. Ipsos I-Say](http://www.i-say.com/)\nThis is a survey website. You can honestly only do around 2 a day because they only really have so many surveys you can do, but you get an email everytime a survey is available to you and honestly that’s annoying, but if you do it over time, you can accumulate enough points to buy gift cards for paypal or other stuff. \n\n**Real Reward:** After randomly doing surveys for a while, I got enough to trade in for a $5 Starbucks giftcard when I was in a coffee related bind\n\n4. [OneSpace (previously Crowdsource)](http://www.onespace.com/)\nSo it’s pretty much a content mill with writing 200 word answers for like $3.50(though it’s like $6 right now for the holiday season) and evaluating searches for 20 or 50 cents, but with bonuses happening for every several tasks you do- it honestly adds up if you want to do a couple jobs in between your not-so-constant freelance work if you’re kind of starting out or getting back into it like me. I signed up with PayPal so pretty much every time a job gets approved it goes into my paypal.\n\n**Real Reward:** I got paid $3.50 today for a job I did 2 days ago and I have $6 pending. (I don’t get on here a whole lot but I’m trying to get back into it).\n\n**And Some Honorable Mentions:**\n\nUpWork (previously Odesk and they also just absorbed Elance)\nI’ve earned $158 on here this year, and that’s only after becoming recently active in the last month or so. It’s basically the freelancing website in the game right now because Odesk and Elance aren’t really a thing anymore. (I’m not a fan of freelancer and especially not a fan of fiverr). Whether you’re programming, writing, virtual assisting, voice acting, being an artist or really anything, there are jobs. \nIt is really competitive though and you’re competing against people with ridiculous rates. And by ridiculous I mean like working for $2/hr. I’m not joking.It’s scary. But it’s a good place to build a portfolio or get work, you just have to be willing to compete.  \nThe reason it’s on here is because there is often quick micro jobs you can do. \n\n**Reddit**\n\nReddit is a great way to find jobs. Micro or Macro. Here are some subreddits I believe in to find work:\n*r/beermoney\n*r/web_work\n*r/forhire\n\nand there are many more that offer if not jobs but just really great advice. I hope this article was helpful to you and helpful to that hustle. ","name":"t3_3tzppm","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-11-23 22:15:47","week":48}

{"id":"3u7zj0","author":"noFlairDoNotCare","body":"So full disclosure, I'm new and still have much to learn from you brilliant bastards but I wanted to contribute something at least. \n\nEssentially, Amira Nature Foods is a 100 year old rice company that came under attack by Prescience Point with allegations of fraud. If you look at their chart, that's what dropped it from the $15-20 range to the $5 range. These allegations seemed bullshit, and turns out they were. \n\n\nRecently they were cleared of these charges, which caused the spike back up to $8. It's been on a steady rise since. As of now, it's above $10, so it's too late to get some of those gains, but I do believe there is some upside left. \n\n\nThey've made deals with Whole Foods, and another with Price Chopper stores so they're continuing to grow. They are releasing financials any day now (before the end of the year) which I believe will help shoot this up even further. I think conservatively $15 would be easy to hit, but wouldn't be surprised if there was a spike to $20. That would be ~50-100% increase if you got in now. \n\n\nI know this isn't the usual type of stock you see on here, but it's treated me well so far and I wanted to return the favor to you sons of bitches. I've been in since $5 with only 350 shares, and only regret not buying more when I had the chance. \n\n\nAgain, I'm an idiot so do your own research and please let me know if I'm completely bat shit crazy here. Like I said, I'm new and learning, so I would appreciate any other opinions or ideas about this. Hopefully this will help fund some yacht accounts, though. \n\nEDIT: Spelling, formatting\n  \n----------\n\nEDIT: Retailers Post-Allegations\n\n/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR asked a good question about retailers before and after. Here's a list of agreements with retailers AFTER the allegations. Some are limited to regions, so I included the states as necessary.\n\nAnnounced agreement with KeHE distributors to distribute in the U.S.\n\nCrossmark and United Natural Foods\n\nPublix\n\nAmazon.com\n\nCostco:\nArizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada,  and Utah.\n\nJewel-Osco:\nIllinois, Indiana, and Iowa\n\nNorther and Southern California, Utah: 5 Distributers\nGelson’s Markets, G&amp;G Supermarket, Harmons Grocery, Murphy’s Market, and SPD Markets.\n\nWhole Food’s:\nAgreement with stores in Florida. This seems like the beginning of their relationship and hopefully they’ll expand to all of Whole Foods.\n\nShaw’s Supermarkets:\nSubsidiary of Albertson’s. Stores in 5 New England states.\n\n\n\nEssentially, they're working with some big names and forming partnerships that will likely continue to grow their reach in the U.S. They're all over the world, so there are many others internationally as well. \n\n----------\nEDIT: Unfortunately today has become a bit hectic so I haven't been able to do as much further digging as I would like. I haven't found any evidence of them LOSING and clients due to the false allegations, but I can't say for sure that means that they didn't. I'll continue digging once I have some more free time. It's the holidays so I don't feel like there will be too much action in the meantime. I'll post more once I find information worth sharing.

{"id":"3u8wvk","author":"Rapn3rd","body":"A few months ago I got my first Amex card, a Blue Cash Everyday card. It offers 3% back on groceries, 2% at some dept. stores and on gas, and 1% on everything else. What I learned when logging into the mobile app for it is that there are a plethora of deals you can add to your card for free that change every few weeks/months.\n\nThe past few days I got $25 off of $200 at newegg, and $15 off of $60 at Amazon (both of these deals are good until well into December if you have an Amex card!). Coupled with a free trial to prime for shipping, and an email promo from newegg for $50 off an xbox 1 bundle, I've saved roughly $100 over $425 when you factor in everything, including shipping.\n\nStacking benefits and offers is a great way to save some extra cash during the holiday season, so long as you're careful to make sure they stack together! I've found that typically, card offered benefits stack well with promos from websites.\n\nI just wanted to share that with the community since I know a lot of people will be increasing their spending over the next month or so, it's always good to explore the options you might not think of. I know Amex isn't accepted as ubiquitously as Visa or Mastercard, but the amount of money I have saved with this one card trumps my other 3 and I've only had this card for a fraction of the time. As a bonus, I didn't get a hard inquiry when I applied for the Amex card either!

I use it to pay for expenses, car rentals so I dont have to pay a deposit and for inventory. \n\nI've had the card for about 4 or 5 months and have yet to pay a penny in interest but it's almost always been maxed due to the nature of my work.  Obviously, a higher credit limit is much more adventageous because as long as I am using it for this purpose I can always pay it off in full prior to 30 days.\n\nThe question is, should I reduce my payments and throw it all at an increased credit limit. It allows me to keep the same spending power, but I will end up paying interest for a few month as I would using money that I would normally use to pay it off to instead increase my credit limit.\n\nThis card is also reported online and is my only active credit card.  I feel this is a good way to also get a higher limit reported.\n\nThoughts?  I'm currently at a 1,000 limit and i can probably get another 2-3k to throw at that by the January 16th deadline.  \n\nTo be clear, at least through January I am pretty sure that any funds I use to increase the limit I can throw back into my business and recover within 1-3 months.  December and January are huge months for our Amazon store.  ","name":"t3_3ue21n","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-26 21:59:15","week":48}

{"id":"3ugkpw","author":"willinliv","body":"With all the razzamatazz around Black Friday this year I logged into Amazon early on in the week and did some Xmas shopping thinking that there was already a discount. Friday comes and I haven't even taken receipt of some of the items, and the prices get reduced. A camera by £50 (UK pounds), and the Fire 7 from £49 to £34.\n\nFollowing advice online I opened up a live chat, and initially the agent told me that they do Price Difference refund but not on Black Friday deals. I thought it worth just questioning that a bit further to say that nothing to stop me sending back for refund and ordering at new price, and wouldn't this cost Amazon in long run, and the agent very cheekily replied that he'd see what he could do. He refunded on the camera and then also the Fire - so quids in! Here's the chat transcript if you want to try the same:\n\n----------\n\nInitial Question: Hi Amazon, what happens if Amazon lowers a price a couple of days after I purchase an item (and before I have received the item)?\n\n\n09:06 AM GMT Amazon: Hello, my name is Arvind. I’ll be glad to help you today.\n09:07 AM GMT Amazon: If the order is met with all the defined conditions and the item is sold and fulfilled by amazon. We try to refund the price difference. However this is not applicable to today's black Friday deals.\n09:11 AM GMT Amazon: Are we connected?\n09:11 AM GMT ME: Hi Arvind\nsorry I got distracted\n09:11 AM GMT Amazon: No problem. \n09:11 AM GMT ME: But I can return the original item right, and order a replacement at the new price?\n09:12 AM GMT Amazon: You can return the item for refund and you have to place a fresh order with new price :) \n09:12 AM GMT ME: ok, great. I wish you could just do the price difference - it would cost less, and I'm sure you think the same?\n09:13 AM GMT Amazon: I will try :) \nCould you help me with the item name ? \n09:13 AM GMT ME: Yeah sure, thanks for looking into this\n..\nCanon PowerShot G7X Digital Camera (20.3MP, 4.2x Zoom)\n09:15 AM GMT Amazon: I will issue refund of GBP 55.80. Would that be fine? \n09:17 AM GMT Amazon: Will, you there? \n09:18 AM GMT ME: hi yeah that would be great!\n09:18 AM GMT Amazon: and it's done :) \n09:18 AM GMT ME: ok, and i've got another one\n09:19 AM GMT ME: thanks btw\n09:20 AM GMT Amazon: Sure. \nWhat's the item name? \n09:21 AM GMT ME: ok, thanks...\n09:21 AM GMT Amazon: You are welcome. Would there be anything else I can help you with?\n09:22 AM GMT ME: yeah there was another item that was reduced today: Fire, 7\" Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers that I bought a couple of days ago. Again I could send it back, but it would save on return shipping...\n09:23 AM GMT Amazon: could you help me with the order number? \n09:23 AM GMT ME: no probs\nORDER # xxx-xxxxxx-xx\n09:24 AM GMT Amazon: Thank you for providing the order number.\nI will make the necessary changes and refund you GBP 15.00 back to you. Is that fine?\n09:24 AM GMT ME: Arvind thanks you very much\n09:25 AM GMT ME: sorry I thank you very much!\n09:25 AM GMT Amazon: It's my pleasure helping you!\nI have successfully issued GBP 15.00 back to you. :)\n09:25 AM GMT ME: many thanks\n09:26 AM GMT ME: best wishes for a great weekend\n09:26 AM GMT Amazon: Thank you. \nI hope you have a great weekend too :) \n09:28 AM GMT ME: cheers","name":"t3_3ugkpw","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-27 13:26:16","week":48}

{"id":"3ugucs","author":"MonsieurJongleur","body":"**N.B. You may find this tedious, or a frugal humblebrag, so I'd advise skipping it unless you struggle to feel comfortable with your spending, even when you know you can afford it.**\n\nI grew up pretty frugally. Use it up, make do, do without, all that kind of thing. I never went without, but everything was purchased from a viewpoint of \"Is this a NEED? Can I make do without it?\"\n\nNowadays, that constraint has been somewhat eased, but I still frequently feel uneasy about spending, especially when it is for something 'frivolous'.\n\nSo I decided to audit my Amazon purchases. \n\nThe argument about online shopping is that it enables overspending, impulse purchases, and other demons of consumption. To make matters worse, we have a Prime membership, and Prime members spend about $1500/yr, compared with about $625/yr for non-members (source: Business Insider).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n##Methodology\n\nI was curious to know whether I had spent \"too much\" on crap because it was easy to access and the free shipping made myriad small purchases more seductive. Since \"too much\" is a subjective assessment, I was most interested to see if I bought stuff that I *forgot* I bought, or bought and used for only a little while.\n\nSince I'm not the type of person who goes physically shopping (although I do frequent a few other online stores) I felt that auditing Amazon purchases would be a significant proxy for all types of online shopping-- by far the bulk of our purchase are made through Amazon, with a small amount being made through Walmart, Petsmart, Home Depot, Yankee Candle and a handful of clothing retailers.\n\nSo I looked through the listing of stuff we've bought since Jan 1. \n\nI divided it into 5 rough categories. Sorry, there was no easy way to export this data, but I made some rough notes.\n\n*Stuff for Me, Stuff for My Husband, Household Goods, Grocery,* and *Yard Maintenance*.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n##First Analysis\n\nIn a broad strokes analysis, there were only 2 items that I felt were bad purchases: A small glass syrup dispenser that I had planned to use for cream, and a butt cushion (which I got for 80% off through SnagShout) But my husband grabbed the cushion for his office chair and the syrup dispenser fulfills its designed purpose by holding actual syrup, not cream. It wasn't that these were bad products, it's just that they didn't solve the problems I purchased them to solve. \n\nIn fact, \"buying item to solve a specific problem\" was the dominant theme in almost all our purchases. Although most of these items could be considered \"upgrades\" and largely unnecessary ones at that, I found that I looked with satisfaction upon many of these purchases. \n\nFor instance, the largest category of spending was probably **Yard Maintenance,** and that's because I got serious about square foot gardening and extending my growing season in order to get more fresh produce. I also bought a bird feeder large enough for cardinals, my favorite birds. ($13)\n\nThe second largest category was **Grocery**. This was the year we cleaned up our act, diet-wise. My husband has lost 50lb and me 30, and we buy the fancy low-carb protein powder for our daily smoothies, as well as things like erythritol, which we can't source locally. I also started buying bulk spices online (way better than supermarket spices). Even things we no longer buy, like Torani sugar-free syrups, got us over the hump of when we were switching from an indulgent pasta-based diet to a low-carb one. Now, we no longer have much of a taste for sweets.\n\nIn the **Household Goods** category, the \"spending to solve a problem\" is at its most evident. I bought freezer-safe containers to store my garden produce and buying bulk meats. I finally caved to my redneck roots and bought a minimalist canning kit (it's basically a silicone basket you can submerge jars into a stock pot with) and some jars for jellies. (Many of these have been gifted already.) I improved the organization and utility of the kitchen with various racks and gadgets so that I don't want to stab myself out of hatred for the space I'm working in.\n\nHands down, best purchase of the year was a digital food scale. I thought /r/keto were being dicks demanding people use them, but it makes everything so easy because there's absolutely no wiggle room about how many calories are going down your throat. \n\nSo what did I not need to buy? Everything. By the standards of my childhood, I could have \"made-do\" without EVERYTHING. But, damn, do all these things make a difference *from an ease-of-use perspective.* The garden supplies primarily cut back on maintenance and make the time I spend in the yard more efficient. The kitchen improvements mean I can grab a dish one-handed from the cupboard and not have to unstack a big, heavy pile. I could have gotten freezer bags at the grocery store or dug through the housewares section at the thrift shop for used tupperware. But, what I bought these particular containers for was the fact that that are stackable, square (not round or rectangular, like so many-- that's a lot of wasted space in a freezer), and the lids fit interchangeably on 3 out of 4 of the sizes.  And certainly canning supplies do turn up on a regular basis, but I didn't want to store an enormous water-bath canner. \n\nExcept the food scale. I would defend that food scale even to my ultra-frugal mother. And we eat so much less food because of it!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n##Let's Talk Frivolity\n\nSo then we have the sticky spot-- our personal spending. But honestly, I still don't see much to complain of. My husband's main purchases are books ($75) and the odd MP3. But he also splashed out on some beard cream ($2), a candlewick trimmer ($4.50), a pair of earbuds ($6.50), computer speakers ($13) and a backup hard drive for his extensive music collection($65). I think this is a reasonable amount of frivolity-- he's not out buying an Apple Watch because he has to have the latest and greatest thing. The speakers and backup drive were a result of replacing his 11-year old PC this year. The old speakers were perfectly fine, but there was no longer a port that fit the jacks. So we'll say $165 here, so maybe we would double it to accurately represent the whole year. $330. \n\nBecause I run the books, I find it both easy and hard to justify my own spending, because I have no one to be accountable to. My husband just says \"You're in charge of finances. If you think we can afford it, we can.\" Cue crisis of conscience. :P\n\nFor instance, I tend to fold my frivolous purchases into another category. This year I got into /r/coffee. By those standards, I have a budget, no-frills setup-- a French press, a Skerton Mill, and $10/lb beans from Happy Mug. But I still spent $65 for the set up and an ongoing ~$40/mo (non-Amazon) for beans. Not super frugal, but as frugal as you can get with fresh-roasted beans.\n\nI also have a small weakness for journaling. I don't purchase notebooks willy-nilly, but I spend  what feels like a lot for them. My chosen notebooks are $25/ea and my chosen pens are about $1/ea (for refills)-- but I go through 2 per month. Plus Field Notes notebooks, which are about $30/year. Already I am much less frugal than my partner and we haven't even gotten into the 1-off purchases:\n\n\t• Sleep Mask (5)\n\t• Boot form ($6.50)\n\t• Earbuds ($6.50)\n\t• Metal Model (which I still haven't opened) ($6)\n\t• Eyeliner ($5)\n\t• Knee pillow($23) (Originally purchased to help my husband recover after a knee injury, but I basically stole it after he was done.)\n\t• A single book (6.5)\n\t• Cardinal feeder (13)\n\nSo we're looking at $240 for me, doubled is $480, plus of course the $480 for coffee. The bulk of the doubling (for me) is clothing purchases. I was surprised to see that I only bought 1 clothing item through Amazon this year, but I'm pretty sure I spent around $200 elsewhere on the web.\n\n**Personal Purchases:**\n\n | Me | DH | Coffee*\n---|---|----|----\nAnnual | 480 | 330 | 480\nMonthly** | 40 | 27.50 | 40\n\n\n\n\n\\*couldn't decide how to classify; I felt like it was the only category that was frivolous enough to bear watching. I'm not going to kit out my garden or kitchen every year.\n\n** I realize the year isn't over yet, but I feel like I built in enough buffer that it's reasonable reliable. And I'll get to check it against next year's numbers!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##Final Analysis\n\nI started this analysis in order to see whether my ongoing unease of Amazon purchases was warranted. Was I buying extra crap? Did I have poor impulse control?\n\n###Take it for what it's worth, /r/frugal, but I find my spending justifiable, consistent with my values, and most importantly, affordable. (It wouldn't matter if it was justifiable if we couldn't afford it.)  \n\nI wanted to share this analysis with you because I know many of you were frugal by necessity at one point, and now struggle with the same anxiety. *Can we afford it? Am I spending money foolishly?* These sorts of thoughts can affect our enjoyment of our present situation if they are not challenged on their veracity. \n\nI was also heartened by these realizations:\n\n* **I spend money to solve problems, but only after considerable research into the best/most effective way to achieve my chosen end.** At this stage in my life, thrift store scavenging lags far behind well-researched, purpose-built solutions.\n\t\n* **Most of the purchases were either seasonal or one-time purchases.** It's no surprise my anxiety spiked this time of year, with holidays and winter-season purchasing. I will tend to buy things all at once, and then there will be minimal spending for months. So although I *feel like* I spent a lot this month, it's not so bad when you look at annual spending. The one-time purchases were to solve problems that are now solved; that's not to say there won't be problems to solve in the future, but I won't need new trellises, floating row covers, pans and so forth for quite some time.\n\n* **Analyzing my purchases helped me look at how our quality of life has improved over the past year** -- that's nice to reflect on. It also is nice to see that this spending has frequently lowered our ongoing costs -- I more consistently buy in bulk and portion things to freeze, my husband has stopped buying Slimfasts for his lunches and instead takes a homemade smooth in his blender bottle; we're eating a lot more produce, but not buying it; etc. \n\n* **I now have a solid, evidence-based figure to enter into the \"Spending Money\" category in YNAB.** I always felt bad, no matter what number I put in there. Too little and I felt broke, too much and I felt like a spendthrift.\n\t\n\n***TL;DR: Felt bad about my Amazon addiction, decided to analyze whether it was really a problem. It's not. Posted to reddit to see if there are any other geeks who would enjoy doing similar experiments.***","name":"t3_3ugucs","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-27 15:15:39","week":48}

Please see the detailed rules wiki for the actual phrasing of the rules themselves.\n\n* Rule 2 now loosely defines what constitutes an active redditor. This has always been hard to quantify, and it still is, but we have to ban so many people who try to post on GCX without being active. It's obvious to us moderators, and to most longtime GCX users, but now with a guideline of 1 month of account age per 1 page of account activity, this should help. It's not a hard rule and we're still going to handle these things on a case by case basis, of course.\n\n* Rule 2 now also specifies that there will possibly be disciplinary action for anyone who trades with someone who has an account under 14 days in age, someone who is pretty obviously not active on reddit (and we mean **really** obviously), or someone who is banned and listed on the USL.\n\n* Rule 4 now specifies that trading with someone who did not have approval to offer Amazon Balance will be grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n* Rule 5 now specifies that trading with someone who did not have approval to offer $100.00 or more in TOTAL VALUE of gift cards will be grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n* Rule 7 now clarifies that putting your rep in your post titles on GCX is not allowed, and that information belongs in the submission text. (Very minor, but good to have.)\n\nThe theme behind the changes to Rules 2, 4, and 5 is that the community needs to be self-policing, and that both parties in a trade will be held accountable for not following/enforcing the rules. The reason is that scammers make alts to funnel their stolen gift cards back into the subreddit for cash, and we have literally hundreds of examples proving that these three rules are crucial to preventing that. If scammers know they can't convert their stolen items to cash, the majority of them will have less incentive to scam in the first place. As it says in the detailed rules wiki:\n\n&gt;By allowing this balance/these high value cards to be traded without moderator approval, you are giving scammers incentive to scam in the first place, which hurts the community as a whole.\n\nSo please, help us out, and don't enable trading alts. Sure, you might be able to get away with it, since it's in private messages where us mods can't see what goes down, and maybe you'd get a good deal behind the scenes with a trading alt, but it *really* does hurt the community if you don't enforce these rules. We don't want to make this post lengthier than it needs to be, but if anyone wants more details about this kind of thing, just say so in the comments.\n\n#GCX Rep Profile Requests and Flair Requests\n\nWe have been going through over 70 pages of /r/GCXRep's modmail to make sure we address each and every GCX Rep Profile request. We aren't done just yet, but if you haven't gotten a response, reply to the original message you sent us, and do not create a new thread. We're almost there.\n\nWe're also working on flair requests. With the holidays coming up, we want to have everyone's flair updated in time for a pretty busy trading season.\n\n#Closing GCX for the holidays\n\nLike we did last year, we are planning on temporarily closing the subreddit during the holidays in anticipation of a huge influx of new users. [(Look at the spikes we got the last two Christmases!)](http://redditmetrics.com/r/giftcardexchange) This should give them some time to familiarize themselves with how to trade safely here. The community was overwhelmingly in favor of this [on our mod post last year](https://redd.it/2nb8tk), so we're planning on doing pretty much the same thing: make the subreddit restricted (no submissions) for about 2-3 days around Christmas, fill up the front page of the subreddit with [posts like this one from last year](https://redd.it/2qbiym), and then open it back up again.\n\n___\n\nThat's it for now! Let us know if you have any feedback on the rule tweaks, or anything here. We'd be happy to address any questions or concerns regarding the rules. We know it's been insanely long for GCX Rep Profile requests and flair requests, and we're really appreciative of everyone's patience while we try to stay organized with reddit's terrible modmail, plus keep the subreddit safe, and still live our lives outside of reddit.\n\nTrade safely!\n\n~Your GCX Mod Team","name":"t3_3uk3tq","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2015-11-28 07:29:59","week":48}

I'm checking out my bank transactions and see a $100 bill for Amazon prime. I know like 2 months before I bought some comics off Amazon and idk I must have took some trial, but while ordering it didn't realize it would carry over and didn't realize it would charge me. Probably should have been more aware but I just wanted to order some comics, but now coming back from a 2 week vacation, I'm kinda broke. I'm just wondering if there is anyway to cancel the Prime, and get my money back. Any help is much appreciated.\n\n\nEdit. Don't worry about my dumb post.

{"id":"3ukogl","author":"Humblesalesman","body":"I constantly get asked: \n\n&gt;Where can I find high quality pictures for my affiliate site?\n\nToday I will take a look at commonly used methods for padding out what would otherwise be a big slab of text. \n\nDespite the heading, these images can also be used on your shopify store, blog, whatever. \n\nSo in no particular order, here is how you can grab some awesome images for your website.\n*****\n\n**1. Paid Stock**\n\nYou pay for an image and you get to use it on your website. Seems simple enough right?\n\nUnfortunately many stock photography websites are incredibly expensive. Shutterstock, Fotolia, istockphoto Etc. all charge a large fee.\n\nWhile it is fair that photographers get compensated, paying upwards of $50 for a single high resolution image seems like a price gouging. Especially when the larger portion of this fee goes to the stock image website (and ironically affiliate marketers).\n\nEnter www.dollarphotoclub.com\n\n$100 dollars gets you 100 high resolution stock photos. The amazing thing is that many of the photographers that post to the previously mentioned stock photo sites also post their photos here.\n\nUnfortunately, dollarphotoclub opens and closes its membership sporadically.  I highly recommend signing up with $100 as soon as they open. You have a year to use your credits and once you have used them all you can top up with as much or as little as you like. Keep checking back and sign up as soon as you notice they are accepting subscribers. You won’t regret it.\n\nThe next best deal I have come across is Adobe Stocks $249/month plan. Cancel any time. Obviously this requires more investment but if you are a power user it get’s high resolution stock photos down below the 50 cents mark each.\n\nIf you need to credit the owner then CREDIT THE OWNER!\n\nIf anyone has found a better deal, would love to hear it in the comments.\n\n\n*****\n\n**2. Free stock**\n\nNumerous users have posted sites that you can get free stock photography from so I wont go to into detail on this. Here are some links of roundups:\n\nhttps://bootstrapbay.com/blog/free-stock-photos/\n\nhttps://blog.bufferapp.com/free-image-sources-list\n\nAgain, If you need to credit the owner then CREDIT THE OWNER!\n\n*****\n\n\n**3. DIY**\n\nWhile stock photos are all well and good, they just won’t get the point across as well as a photo you take yourself.\n\nCamera phones are now at a high enough resolution that you can take some stunning photos with the equipment you already have.\n\nHere is a great guide on getting started:\n\nhttps://www.shopify.com/blog/12206313-the-ultimate-diy-guide-to-beautiful-product-photography\n\nBut what if you need unique product photos?  A sneaky trick is to buy the product, take photos then return it to the place of purchase the same day.  Obviously this will only work so many times and you will have to be careful with the stores return policy.\n\nAmazon has an amazing return policy where the customer is always right; you can hit this up a few times as well. Go on, annoy everyone over at r/fulfilmentbyamazon !\n\nDisclaimer: I have never used the return technique above, but it *is* a used technique in the affiliate marketing world. Think twice if you are considering it. By doing so you are negatively affecting someones income. While I couldn't care less for the faceless corporations like Walmart, a lot of the sellers on Amazon are entrepreneurs like you and me, who may severely be impacted by your return. This one is definitely not ethical.\n\n*****\n\n**4. Amazon**\n\nOn the topic of amazon, if you are signed up to their affiliate program they will let you use any image that is found on their website provided you are linking back to them. \n\nWhile this is all well and good, have you noticed that some of their photos are small and grainy? Obviously these would be a poor fit on your website.\n\nSince amazon has granted you use of that image, reverse image search it. If you are using chrome you can right click and drop down to “search Google with this image” \n\nIf you are using chrome and cannot see this option then you may have to install the extension first:\n\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-by-image-by-google/dajedkncpodkggklbegccjpmnglmnflm?hl=en\n\n\nThis will bring up the same image in a whole bunch of different sizes and qualities. Simply choose the one that suits you.\n\nI have done this often when the images are of poor quality on amazon. Just be sure that the image is exactly the same, since you will not have rights to the variations of this image. Use this technique at your own risk.\n\n*****\n\n**5. Press Packs**\n\nA lot of suppliers will have a press release and a bunch of high resolution images of their products ready to go for anyone who asks to use on their blogs and review sites. This is known as a press pack.   Simply contact the supplier directly and enquire if they have a press pack or high resolution images you can use to promote their product with.\n\nSurprisingly many affiliate websites do not bother with this and can miss out on some high quality images. Press packs are generally available for the newest releases from a manufacture. But not every manufacturer keeps a press pack on hand.\n\nDon’t have a press pack? Ask if you can take images directly from the manufacture’s website. You would be amazed at what asking a simple question can actually get you.\n\nThe only way to find out is to ask. \n*****\n\n**6. Other bloggers**\n\nBelieve it or not, other bloggers are your friends in the affiliate marketing world, not your enemy. Often your content will compliment theirs and viceversa. A simple message over to the owner asking if you can use one of their images with a credit is often all it takes to end up with a fantastic free photo. \n\nDon’t be afraid to backlink. It costs you nothing, and can be mutually helpful, especially if they are a quality website. Who knows, you might just build a relationship from this.\n\nThis also rings true of reddit. Places like r/makeupaddiction have kick ass product photos that often look very professional. A pm is all it takes, but if they decline, don’t be a dick about it.\n\n*****\n\n~~**7. Steal it**~~\n\nFull disclosure: I do not condone this method. IP theft is serious and can land you in very hot water legally. \n\nBut I feel that part of why these guides are so well received is that I share everything. It is a sad fact that IP theft is rampant on affiliate websites. Not at least explaining it so that you know what to look out for with your own IP would be a discredit to the community.\n\nSo how does stealing work?\n\nYou find a picture from another blog, save it and you *slightly modify it*.\n\nYou would think that with reverse image search that this practice would no longer exist, right? \n\nUnfortunately that isn’t the case. There are three ways you can get around it:\n\n**1. Combine multiple images**\n\nIt turns out that if you stitch two or three images together, Google’s reverse image search will be thoroughly confused. What do I mean stitch together? Find two pictures you like and in any old photo editing tool sit them side by side in a single picture. \n\nYou now have two or more pictures side by side in a single jpg. To Google, this is now an original picture.\n\nThis seems to work better on photos with complex backgrounds rather than stock product photos on white backgrounds. But you can get around this with…\n\n**2. The overlay**\n\nHave a product photo you want to use with a white background? Draw “measurement lines” over it.  Readers will be thrilled at a visual representation of how big the product is and google will be unable to tell that it is not original content.\n\n**3. Youtube**\n\nYes, I know youtube is a video service. But what makes up a video? Frames. Individual frames. A simple screen shot is all it takes and you now have a fancy product photo that no one else will have on their website.\n\n\n\nThese techniques can be difficult to notice unless you are actively looking for them. Here is an [example of a website that steals images]( http://topreviews24x7.com/baby-high-chairs/\n) that uses all three techniques above. This website has been caught out numerous times, yet still ranks highly in Google. Crime DOES pay! \n\n\n**Again, I do not condone the theft of intellectual property. If you are caught, the legal ramifications can be huge, and rightly so.**\n\n\nGot another killer tip for people hunting down images? Drop a comment below.\n\nAs always, PM's will be ignored but I am happy to discuss in the comments below anything you need further clarification on. This saves me getting asked the same questions over and over and allows other reddit members to read over the exchange and potentially learn something.\n\n","name":"t3_3ukogl","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-28 11:52:53","week":48}

{"id":"3umx9b","author":"innociv","body":"I had like a 740-750 credit score 2 years ago.\n\nSince then, I got a $15,765.31 auto loan for 4 years at 2.99%, and 26 months is remaining on it. I thought that would increase my score a lot, but it's only at 755 now. I guess I was expecting to be closer to 800 by now, and wanted to be around there in order to refinance my auto loan to hopefully get &lt;1% on the remainder.\n\n* I'm 27.  \n* I always make payments on time. In my 6+ year credit history, I have 116 on time payments.  \n* There's only been 2 months where I've averaged more than 10% of my available credit of $4500.  \n* No idea what I'll make next year. Hopefully $20k+, but I work for myself and can could lucky and make a ton more.\n* I have ~$5000 in bitcoins. Should I sell that and convert it to savings? It only shows like $2000-$4000 in savings otherwise.\n\nThe bad things I see on Credit Karma:\n\n* It says I only have 3 sources of credit, which it says is bad, which I don't fully understand. Am I supposed to open a bunch of credit cards that I don't actually use?  \nOne of the 3 is my Chase Amazon credit card with a $4,500 limit. The other is the auto loan. The third is a card that was closed 5 years ago as far as I can tell(think a Paypal card that I was just a signer on).  \nIf I do apply for another card, what should I get...?  I like the Amazon one since I shop from there a lot and it saves 3% through Amazon. I don't really buy things a lot or travel, though. Maybe American Express Blue card? It has no annual fee, and 3% back on groceries.\n* I have **5** credit inquiries through Equifax and it says that is \"Very Poor\"... but the last time I applied for anything was the auto loan 22 months ago. On its time graph it shows a constant 5 from Apr 2015, Jul 2015, and Nov 2015. It doesn't go further back than that. But when I view them they appear to be fine but from many years ago. Why do they still show on my report?\n\nCredit Karma recommendations: \n\n* It says a credit limit from 4500 to 6000 would improve it by 13 points, so I did that.  \n* It says opening a new one will drop it, but that's temporary, right?  How quickly would it rise back up to what it was then past that?\n\nWhat else can I do? Are there credit cards that let you set multiple automated payments? Chase only lets me do once a month minimum or full when I would prefer to set a payment like twice monthly to keep my credit utilization down. It won't let me set it to automatically pay the balance either, it has to either be the full amount or the minimum.  \n\nAnd on the auto loan, what can I do about refinancing? I'm only seeing offers of like 1.99% which probably isn't worth the effort.  I have $8,774.85 remaining on the principle of the auto loan and I've paid $295.17 of the $693.92 in interest.  Would there be a way I could refinance to 1% for 18 months? Saving over $300 would be worth it to me if it's simple and painless.\n\nThanks in advance.","name":"t3_3umx9b","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-28 23:04:39","week":48}

{"id":"3unzhk","author":"CRSdefiance","body":"I've seen this one posted a few times here this year, but with the amount of holiday shopping going on right now I thought it might be nice to remind everyone about Paribus.\n\nThe shortened version of the service is that it gets you money back on websites when they have had a price drop within a certain window of your purchase, and works on a whole list of sites from Amazon to Newegg, Walmart, and more.  (Full list:  https://paribus.co/merchants).  Most of these sites will issue you a refund if you contact them within a certain timeframe, but Paribus just automates it and contacts the retailer on your behalf.\n\nIt seemed a little sketchy at first, but it really does work.  My wife and I have saved $75 or so in the past few months without lifting a finger.  The website does ask for a form of payment (like a credit card) because it is a legitimate service...if they get a refund for you, they then bill a portion of it back.  Anyone who either refers a friend or is referred by someone else though has this fee lowered by 5% through the end of the year.\n\nThe best part is, Paribus even works if you know that a sale might be coming up (I ordered a GTX 970 a week ago with my beermoney, and got $25 back when Amazon dropped the price for Black Friday)\n\nFor anyone interested, here's my [referral link](https://paribus.co/i/7WZTjV), or alternatively [no-ref](https://paribus.co/).\n\nIt'd be great to see a train going on this one, but if anyone has any questions I'd be happy to answer/share my experiences!","name":"t3_3unzhk","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-11-29 03:55:13","week":48}

ALL grossly overpriced, ALL 5 week fulfillment.\n\nWith only 45 ratings total on Amazon (yep, only 45), the user is averaging 9 ratings per month for the last 3 months... Not what you'd expect for 416,000+ items for sale.  So this is definitely retail arbitrage (likely) or this guy is using his overpriced items to launder money (possible due to Turkish connections below, but less likely).\n\nNot sure if it's the same person, but metrowalt.com (no content on site) was registered in June 2015.  Their info is easily accessible by doing a simple whois and is not hidden at all.  For the small risk that this person is not the same guy, I will not post his name (which is likely a fake name anyways). Further research on that guy lead me to learn that he is the co-founder of a Turkish American NYC hedge fund (KTMR Group - ktmrgroup.com) (warning: somehow the owner of metrowalt.com's linkedin site is nsfw - someone's ass picture is viewable in the \"people also viewed\" section).  The same name who registered metrowalt.com has 159 other domains in their name, most dormant.  There are some that I saw with more overpriced crap like candelanetwork.com and some of the domains are attempts to trick people fat fingering.\n\nSince Metrowalt.com registration links me to several other schemey ecommerce sites run by this \"hedge fund\", the domain owner has 0 linkedin connections, I cannot find anything meaningful about this \"hedge fund\", their address in NJ takes me to a dumpy location with a nondescript building with other companies and no KTMR on the sign - I am led to believe this guy is some kind of scammer (although fulfilling real product).

It was just a conservative placeholder. And you're correct in enlisting DuPont analysis to provide a better measure of profitability. I readily admit that that's important. But that does nothing to take away from my point. Effectively, I'm arguing that \"sales\" has the potential of increasing from 6% in the US to 40%. And from single digits in other countries like Britain and Japan to 20-30%. If you haven't looked at the Ben Evans article I linked to, I highly encourage you to take a look so that you fan see the market trends for ecommerce. They are absolutely stunning. \n\nIf we want to plug this into an ROE equation, I'm suggesting that net income has the potential of increase by 8x if current trends continue (and if AMZN can retain its current dominance). You make a reasonable argument that turnover will decrease as sales increase. Though I would make a quick aside that I suspect this decrease would be a fairly second order effect on AMZN's turnover due to the mature nature of their operations. I.e. AMZN knows how to build warehouses and distribute. Opening new ones in new locations shouldn't affect them that much. Lots of complexities here with different government regulations/infrastructure so I could be wrong. \n\nBut a hays, going back to the ROE, if you take my 8x assumption, your ROE is suddenly 64.8% (minus some small turnover factor).\n\n\nSo again, I reiterate that the real question is whether or not AMZN can capture an eventual huge ecommerce market...

This is bad. \n\nSome people make a few million a year marketing these services. \n\n*****\n\nApps, services, etc. Sure, they have the potential to grow quicker, but take Snapchat for example. I don't even think that company makes a lot yet is valued at 16 Billion. The guy is no longer his own boss because he has to answer to the VC's. Additionlly he has the pressure of making that company live up to it's lofty valuation. **And he is one in a million**. \n\nIf you ask what is better being the owner of a car wash or the owner of Facebook and can easily say I'd rather be the owner of Facebook. But there are people pumping out websites and apps left and right while there is one Dry Cleaner in my town. \n\nIf you are asking the chances of running a successful business, I have to hand it to a traditional business model that operates offline. Slower growth but done right you can make millions. People have done it. \n\nImporting and private labeling will die one day. People argue with me but once people in Asia can figure out how to market the products well the competition is going to be **fierce**. There are arguments that manufacturers won't want to alienate their North American importers, but the truth is it's going to be cheaper, easier and they are going to move more by dealing with local companies that export to North America instead. \n\nWhere is your control? You may be making $10,000 a month on a product and it can go away overnight. You won't see this with offline businesses. \n\nIs one better than the other? Yes.

Solve that problem. \n\nIt is so incredibly simple. \n\nPeople need their cars detailed. There is one place that does it, but is closed on weekends and afternoons. Provide a better service and take that portion of the market. Hire people to do it. You generate leads. Don't quit your day job until you scale it to make a living off it. \n\nThis stuff is not a mystery or a secret. \n\nJust do it already instead of searching for a \"product\" or \"business type.\" Solve a market's problem with a great solution whether that is SaaS or cleaning toilets. \n\nThe people on the show Dirty Jobs don't do it because they feel like it.

{"id":"cxadmno","author":"pressuniversity","body":"I'd advise taking a more active role in the vetting process to make sure it's a viable opportunity in the first place. The key here is to distance yourself as far from speculation as possible. No guessing games, dice rolls or big risks. That's for gamblers, not entrepreneurs. Here's what I've done in the past all with great success.\n\n1. **Listen for \"code words\" online**. Whether it’s browsing through your Twitter feed for complaints or praise, or reading through forums and Reddit threads, see what crowds of people are saying. What do they hate? Like? Not have access to? What's too cheap? Too expensive? Those words often mask potential opportunities. \n\n2. **Browse Amazon reviews**. Specifically, starting digging through 3 star reviews. 5 star reviews are all praise and 1 star reviews are all hate. Usually 3 star reviews offer insight into what worked, what didn’t and why. Take heed of how you could make something that meets those points.\n\n3. **Browse Reddit**. This isn't the “front page of the internet” for nothing. People speak rather open and honestly about their feelings on very specific things on here. Dig deep into a particular set of subreddits that are relevant to your idea. What questions are the most popular? What responses are the most popular? Why? What links are the most shared? Who writes them? Document all of this.\n\n4. **Use Google’s Keyword Volume Tool**. This one requires you to create a gmail email address and a basic AdWords account but don’t worry, it’s nothing crazy. Type in a few keywords that best describe your idea and look for high search volume and competition. The second one might surprise you but heed this: competition is a good thing. It means people are actively searching for and spending money on the idea. Don’t fear it. Embrace it! Check Google’s “Trend” tool too. \n\n5. **Use Facebook messaging**. This one might make you a bit uncomfortable, but that’s the whole point. What you’re going to want to do is reach out to potential customers letting them know about your idea or offering. A brief, personalized message to friends who'd be interested that outlines why they’d be interested + a link to your free PayPal account. One mantra I've lived by is: \"Can you walk outside and find a customer?\" Why go around the block to get next door, you know? Start as close and as inexpensively as possible to vet it.

Yes, they have some shit stuff, but especially for food, electronics, household goods, etc, they pretty much carry the same brand names as a typical store elsewhere.

Oh and provide quality content, whatever that happens to be for your niche. You probably already know this since you have a decent viewers-per-day rate already. It's a buckshot game; shoot the target with more pellets. Also, make sure that you maximize *targeted* traffic. Your conversion rate will be much higher as a result. If your are marketing guns to people who are looking for barbie dolls, they're likely not going to buy what you have to offer.\n\n2.) Amazon associates. Recommend products. You get a cut off of anything they buy in 24 hours.\n\n3.) Write/commission an eBook related to your niche. Market it as a call to action on your homepage, or any page of your site that the viewer gets to. Make it free through Kindle's KDP select program. Boost your ranking after it goes to paid. Get some reviews on the book. Keep it at 99 cents for a week and then change it to 2.99\n\n4.) Create an email list if you haven't already. Integrate this with the call to action mentioned in (3). Or recommend related products from (2)\n\n5.) Create a YouTube channel related to your niche and make some simple videos that entertain or inform. Post the videos on the site. Set up ads as a content creator, and you have a nice side ad revenue as a result.\n\n6.) Segue or dip into any related products in your niche and sell them via e-commerce. There's a lot of good (and free resources out there).\n\n7.) Don't just market to people. Create social engagement. People are far more likely to buy products or do other things that can make you money if you build a brand and get trust.\n\n8.) Does your niche have anything that can be developed as a Subscription-As-A-Service (SAAS)? Exploit that, and create a list of subscribers for a passive income.\n\n9.) Does your niche have something you can teach people? Create a Udemy course and market it on the site for a nominal fee.\n\n10.) Think of any product or service related to your niche, research if they offer an affiliate program.

Some are worth the Harbor Freight Price... most of the basic tools to build a house/homestead need to be robust and are worth buying. HOWEVER... buy them used from flea markets and Craigslist, or estate sales. Start assembling now. It takes a lifetime. \n\nWhat helped me, and what advice I've given family and friends is to read, \"The Total Money Makeover\" by Dave Ramsey. There should be books on Amazon that cost 1 cent. Read the book. He also has a nationally syndicated radio show that millions of people listen to each day, and a podcast. There are 3 separate hours he does as a show daily. As a daily dose of \"medicine,\" I would recommend listening to his podcast on your commute or when you're doing chores. His process is helping us get out of debt and it's at least put me in the Driver's seat with my family's finances. \nOnce you've cut your lifestyle enough, and you're making real headway saving, then you can really \"bring into focus\" what you can expect to buy, build and move into a homestead. It's better to wait and get all your ducks in a row... and have lots of cash... then to leap and fall flat on your face. I focus on watching homesteading youtube channel creators like \"Wranglerstar,\"  \"Kirsten Dirksen,\" \"Dirtpatch Heaven,\"  \"The Samurai Carpenter,\" and \"mhpgardner.\" All you have to do is search youtube for these channels and you'll be amazed at the Homesteading and off grid information, hard fought knowledge you can learn WITHOUT it COSTING you a mortgage. Also, mhpgardner shows STEP BY 'DARN' STEP how to grow so much produce you'll not need to plant very much and how to do it year round using a greenhouse! Cody \"Wranglerstar\" has a book called \"Modern Homesteading\" that just came out a few months ago. It's a good book to 'introduce' you to Wranglerstar. He's a great motivator and a decent role model on the whole Modern homesteading movement without being too \"Environmentalist\" for my liking. Props to his wife for writing the book, however. \n\nGood luck. I hope you get what you need to make your dreams a reality... without getting into a real nightmare.

(Thanks, 1990s management techniques, btw.) \n\nThe firms in an industry exist in a multi-dimensioned space, constituting a blob in which this or that balance works well or badly over the long run. Noting what works and heading in that direction is not innovation. What does constitute **meaningful innovation** is moving in a purposeful way beyond the bounds of the industrial blob, either by staying within the existing dimensions that span the industry (Waterstones, physical book stores that have an unprecedented range of books on the shelf) or adding to these (Amazon, no stores at all, but a colossal range of books that you can order.) \n\nInnovation can occur by chance, but you need to recognise what has happened and why it is helpful. So the key word is \"purposeful\": you need to identify what is wrong with the status quo, and generate a response that goes beyond industry bounds or else recognise a chance event that has these properties. At the core of innovation, therefore, is perceiving the industry dimensionality, its \"system\", how it works; and noting limits, choke points or impending problems that are open to innovative solutions. \n\nOK: dull.

{"id":"cxbs100","author":"Tite_Reddit_Name","body":"Wall of text incoming...\n\n\nWhile they are different \"games\", I agree they attract the same sort of person. In the end it's always about getting ahead and creating a better quality of life for yourself and family.  Investing is certainly riskier and has no guaranteed return like churning does (if you follow the rules correctly), but with a little research and some safe bets (e.g. low cost index funds) it's a great way build up savings with a higher return than a savings account. In that respect, I think churning and investing are almost complimentary - one gives you immediate improvements in quality of life, the other gives financial security. Assuming the world economy doesn't crash forever :p - and for those who want to bring up the 2008 crash, as long as you didn't sell then or invest in companies that flopped (which is why I mention safe bets), your investments should have long since recovered.\n\n\nAs a side note, might also be interesting to look at return % on your portfolio and compare that to miles/points/cashback \"returns\". However, as someone mentioned here, nothing is earned until you sell your investment (e.g. stock). My friends who are experienced investors hope for around 10% growth on their portfolios each year (and my 401k gets about 2-3% maybe). Now compare that to 2% cashback cards, or to miles/points equivalents. I'm sure miles/points will have a greater immediate return, and the ability to MS just makes it a pure win-win. It's also not completely apples to apples since most churning rewards are for travel only.\n\n\nTo share my story...I recently got super into investing (right during that August crash - that was quite the learning experience). I started researching nonstop, reading all the news, and building my own dashboards. But I stopped doing most of that pretty quickly because I'm in it for the long run - these are investments, mostly in tech companies, that I wouldn't sell unless I needed the money or shit really starts hitting the fan in the economy. The effort involved in short term trading is too much for me, and I could feel it would be detrimentally addicting! So I've been going with well known companies that I trust and am pretty confident are going to continue to grow over the next few years (e.g. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Disney). \n\n\nA few pieces of advice for beginners like me:\n\n- Just like churning, never play with more money than you can afford. My father's advice is assume you are going to lose all that money tomorrow - will you still be ok? \n\n- If you are in it for the long run (at least 1-2 years), don't freak out over daily or weekly market fluctuations, it's all about general trends. They can be huge and people are so quick to freak out over temporary news (even big sounding news like \"poor\" quarterly performances of a few % off target). In fact, after monitoring this a dozen times over the last few months, I'd feel confident taking advantage of these quick dips to turn a nice profit or just buy more.\n\n- Don't ever think of the your daily portfolio gains as how much money you made today. Don't ever think of the money in your portfolio as a bank account. Unless you are going to sell right now.

The company had eight days of Black Friday deals last year, too, but this year it&amp;#039;s giving the promotion an even bigger push: new deals will be added as often as every five minutes on Amazon&amp;#039;s dedicated Black Friday page, twice the rate of last year.\n\n&gt; &amp;quot;I think they&amp;#039;re really trying to change the landscape with things like Prime Day and these eight days of Black Friday.&amp;quot; According to Wurmser, Amazon is still far ahead of its other online competitors, such as the discount-oriented startup Jet.com or the electronics-focused Newegg.\n\n&gt; &amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re not playing defensively so much as offensively.&amp;quot; Amazon isn&amp;#039;t just winning Black Friday shopping.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/3u8ax1/amazons_plan_to_undermine_black_friday/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.6, ~17492 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PMs and comment replies are read by the bot admin, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *five* *keywords*: **Amazon**^#1 **Black**^#2 **Friday**^#3 **holiday**^#4 **shop**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/business](http://np.reddit.com/r/business/comments/3u7w95/amazons_plan_to_undermine_black_friday/), [/r/RetailNews](http://np.reddit.com/r/RetailNews/comments/3tkfbf/amazons_ingenious_scheme_to_undermine_black_friday/) and [/r/Technology_](http://np.reddit.com/r/Technology_/comments/3tf9zu/amazons_ingenious_scheme_to_undermine_black_friday/).","name":"t1_cxcoqfs","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-11-25 17:14:07","week":48}

I just know I'm going to butcher something inadvertently.  ;)\n\nSecondly, Check out Dan Miller.  He has a podcast and book called \"48 days to the work you love.\" (Not sure how to insert a link via phone, but the address is www.48days.net) He is a Christian and uses Christian principles in his teaching, but isn't heavy handed about it.\n\n He helps people \"find or create work that is profitable, meaningful and purposeful.\"  He helps you think about your skills on a way that you never have.  For instance, have you considered self publishing Amazon books on specific topics?  You could write an e book about the 10 biggest things you need to know about writing on your SATs, or 10 things to add and remove from a resume, or how to ace you college entrance exam. There are tons of ideas that you could turn around in a weekend with your knowledge.  Putting them on Amazon means you would have quite a nice little stream of residual income.\n\nDon't sell yourself short.  What you find easy, many will not. I'm sure that as a teacher you see unprepared students hit the real world all the time.  These people go on to really need your knowledge in different stages of life.

Try and get them used. Even better, see about getting an international copy on Amazon or the previous edition. I did that with organic chemistry, spent $5 for the previous edition and my only concern was they reordered the homework problems so I'd have to look in a new edition to make sure I did the right ones.  \n\nAnd don't forget to have a little money to have fun and live.

Even full time/professional sellers sometimes have certain items listed for 6months or more before it sells.  \nIt can be frustrating to list a bunch of items even with best offer..and then have them expire even after 30 days..even if your price seems to be reasonable. \nThere are also people that say people pay more on Amazon, especially FBA for certain items. The thing with Amazon though is it's not as transparent to know when and how much items sold for...but with eBAY all the data is there by looking at solds. \n\n\nI'm not sure if it's true that everyone is jumping ship to Amazon..but you do hear a lot more stories about people selling on Amazon versus eBAY these days. \n\nOne big thing to is the commission, eBAY fees are considerable less than Amazon..especially Amazon FBA. \nYou really need to find the right type of products with enough profit margin to make money with FBA. \n\nA lot of products are in restricted categories or not sellable on Amazon. For example if you sell used clothing..I don't think there is really a market for it on Amazon. \nI'm not sure why you would need to use eBAY as a stepping stone?...since it's easier to list on Amazon.\n\nOne thing I don't like about Amazon FBA is that a buyer can just return an item..and you just receive an email saying a refund was made. I just had two of these within like a 2 day period. The buyer also has 30 days to return the item too. \n\nOn eBAY you have more control and the buyer has to contact you directly and you can negotiate with them to make them happy or figure out the situation. \n\nI believe it's different with Amazon MF (Merchant fulfuilled) ..I haven't had a return on Merchant Fulfilled yet though. \n\nI'd suggest just selling on both, and figuring out what works best for you. If you are doing retail arbitrage with brand new sealed items , Amazon will probably work best. If you are selling used,vintage/collectible items eBAY will probably work best. \n\nNobody should limit the type of items that you sell. \nA lot of it will depend on what types of items you can source locally\nDo you have a lot of stores that have great clearance deals? Amazon might be better. \nIf you have a bunch of thrift stores with good deals on quality clothing..then maybe selling on eBAY would be best. \n\nhope this helps a bit..\n\n","name":"t1_cxcw7lf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-25 20:19:28","week":48}

One example is a book I bought for $1 and sold for $100. \nSome people have bought famous artwork worth a ton of money . \nThe ROI of thrift store items is generally a lot higher than elsewhere like doing retail arbitrage.\nRetail arbitrage is going to stores and scanning items ..with the Amazon Seller app or another app and seeing if profit can be made selling it on Amazon. \nRetail arbitrage margins are usually less than thrift store profits. But people can sometimes buy out all the stock. In thrifts you usually only find one item on the shelf. \nPrivate Label is when you sell your own product on Amazon..these are generally products already made in China (generally) and then you buy them cheap and list them on Amazon. Advantage of this is you can buy thousands of these items at a time ..so it's more efficient...also you create your own brand so to speak to differentiate yourself. \nI have done RA ..but I haven't done private label. \nFrom what I've heard/read..private label isn't as easy as just listing the product on Amazon..you also have to promote the product through advertising like Pay Per Click..doing \"blasts\" ..giving out products to get reviews and things like that. \n\nI think thrifting is a good way to start..as you can buy a lot of inventory for little money.

I can understand the licensing strategy and by all means, if you can license something profitable for the right multiple go for it, however most people will be better off with an Internet-based business simply because of reach and low cost access to customers. In addition to reach, barrier-to-entry is insanely low - like in the hundreds of dollars using companies like Shopify, Squarespace, Etsy, or Amazon's FBA, and that isn't even considering Wordpress with cheap plugins. \n\nThis also doesn't take into account scale, which with the Internet is worldwide. With B&amp;M it's tied to the retail location. \n\nIn addition, let's talk about this $100k business. I can't think of many examples where you could buy a real world B&amp;M for $100k that's actually profitable. Think about it. Using a 3x multiple you'd essentially be buying a $33k/yr business! That, IMO, is a dangerous use of capital. \n\nIf you applied that to an Internet business, which wouldn't have near the overhead of a B&amp;M operation you'd be buying the same $33k/yr with a lot less risk. \n\nMaybe it's just me, and my experience online, but I would take that same $100k and replicate an existing successful business with a focus on building my email list reserving as much capital as possible for scale. \n\nI also wouldn't divert dreamers from chasing their dream like you do in #4. Technology just wouldn't evolve without people that chase and refuse to give up their dreams. It may not be the most feasible cash-flow business in the beginning, but good IP will always be in demand.\n","name":"t1_cxe2abq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-26 22:12:56","week":48}

How about instead paying off your loan *slower* so you can live again?\n\nI understand it's great to pay down debt as quickly as possible, but it shouldn't be at the expense of your life. You could easily make a feasible two- or three-year repayment plan, which is still a very reasonable timeframe to pay off $30,000 -- most people couldn't even do that -- that frees up enough money to do other things in your life. Should you find a job that provides for more income you could change your plans to pay off your debt more aggressively.\n\nThe problem with your envisioned investment strategy is that one year is just too short of a timeframe. Sure, if you put all your money in Amazon stock a year ago, you would have doubled your money. But there's too much risk involved with something like that, and even with \"low-risk\" funds, you're not going to gain much. The general philosophy is with greater reward comes higher risk -- and vice versa. If you don't want to risk the money you have, understandably, you're going to have to settle with investments (or, more likely, a saving account) that would likely earn no more than a couple hundred dollars on $10,000.

That said, just the 1080p mode on the M Series is glorious, and much better than my other 1080p TV.\n\nI love the approach Vizio is taking. Total no-frills: no 3D, no curved screen, barely qualifies as a \"smart\" TV. But they use a quality panel and have good electronics. Which is all that really matters. Just be sure to calibrate it per CNet or AVSForum.\n\nSorry I didn't talk you out of it.

They often make special SKUs for Black Friday so their standard warranty you associate with the brand is null and void (\"Sir we can't replace it, we no longer make that SKU\"). Lastly, my favorite trick I have seen with Black Friday is with Digital SLRs. Prices are lowest in August/December -- when people buy DSLRs for back to school -- so they raise the prices in October, just so they can slash them back down to \"retail\" on Black Friday and call it a \"deal\". \n\nIf cheap 4K is here to stay, it will be just as cheap in Jan.

Earth imploding?\n\n&gt; IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN OUR LIFETIME, AT ONE POINT RECENTLY THEY HAD TWICE AS MUCH MONEY THAN THE US GOVERNMENT. YEA. http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/04/13/fun-number-apple-has-twice-as-much-cash-as-the-us-government/\n&gt;   \n&gt; Mutual funds are extremely dodgy. They are for lazy people who don't want to take the time to learn how to do it themselves and pay someone to do it for them. The worst part about them is that even if there is a negative return, such as -5% you will stay pay the 1.5% management fee for a grand return of -6.5%. See the problem?  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Why would you pay someone 1.5% on an investment that will yield 7%. That leaves you with 5.5% which is absolute shit. If you are paying someone 1.5% in fees, you better be seeing a return of 20%+ (my personal opinion)  \n&gt;   \n&gt; PLEASE DON'T BE LAZY AND LET SOMEONE DO IT FOR YOU, TEACH YOURSELF TO DO IT.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Here is some math\n\n&gt; Invest $8,000.00 for 20 years at 7% return = $30,957.48\n\n&gt; Invest $8,000.00 for 20 years at 5.5% return = $23,342.06\n\n&gt; You just paid someone $7615.42 because you were too lazy to learn how to do it.\n&gt;   \n&gt; MORE MATH  \n&gt; Invest 8000 for 20 years at 10%,15%,20%,25% ROI (return on investment)  \n&gt; 10% = $53,819.99  \n&gt; 15% = $130,932.29  \n&gt; 20% = $306,700.79  \n&gt; 25% = $693,889.39\n&gt;   \n&gt; Invest $8,000.00 for 20 years while contributing 100$ monthly or $1200 annually  \n&gt; 10% =$80,684.31  \n&gt; 15% =$253,864.59  \n&gt; 20% =$530,726.39  \n&gt; 25% =$1,105,423.02  \n&gt; Now obviously averaging a return between 10-25% over a 20 year period is difficult to do. But it is not unheard of.  \n&gt; You see those numbers? THAT IS ONLY WITH $8000 DOLLARS. IMAGINE IF YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THAT OVER A 50 YEAR PERIOD WITH MORE MONEY.\n&gt;   \n&gt; Invest $50,000 for 50 years at same ROI\n\n&gt; 10% =$5,869,542.64 =  You can literally live off of the interest in a 1.5% savings account now. One years worth of interest will equal $89,363.79 DOLLARS FOR DOING NOTHING\n\n&gt; 15% =$54,182,872.08 = Oh sure ill take a picture for top 1000 wealthiest people in the state\n\n&gt; 20% =$455,021,907.5 = Forbes wealthiest people? Sure why not\n\n&gt; 25% =$3,503,246,161 = Great, just joined the billionaire club. Maybe Ill buy a city for luls.\n&gt;   \n&gt; To the best of my knowledge these numbers are accurate.  \n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\n----\n\n^(I am a bot.

I basically had to build my own closets etc and have been buying up stuff to ensure my clothing doesn't get ruined.  I ended up boarding up these areas (they were previously exposed to underneath the house) and sealing and painting the whole bit and installing closet stuff.  I'm still paranoid about insects and insect damage so I've invested in cedar hangers and sweater bags.\n\nOverall I feel like most of my purchases were justified, but a few were questionable.  I had doubts about them before purchasing, but same with some of the stuff that worked out wonderfully...  I feel like I won't (and shouldn't) need to sustain this level of spending in the future once everything is all set up, and am hoping to get back down to steady state soon.\n\nThanks for the post, and best of luck.","name":"t1_cxf110k","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-27 21:39:43","week":48}

However, those who use primarily Amazon for their spending may realise they are better off paying an annual fee rather than individual delivery charges. If they were already spending a reasonable amount then those people *may* actually be better off overall by purchasing prime. It's not possible to determine from the sentence in OP's post.

{"id":"cxfhd4c","author":"SeattleDave0","body":"Washington Mutual. I bought 82 shares in August 2008 at $3.65/share, thinking that the market is over-reacting to the financial crisis making this stock very cheap. They were trading for over $30/share back in September 2007, so I was thinking I could make a ton of money if I hold onto these shares through the whole financial crisis as they go back to their historical level. \n\nA few weeks later the shares had dropped down to $3.61/share so I doubled down and bought 206 more. At this point I figured since I had over 100 shares, that I'd sell covered call options so I could collect some income while I wait for this drama to calm down. So on Sept. 15, 2008 I sold 2 covered calls, getting $0.22/share for 200 of my shares, with the option expiring a month later on Oct. 18, 2008. \n\nAs I was driving into work on the morning of Friday September 26 I heard on NPR that the FDIC had seized Washington Mutual overnight, shut down the bank and given all of the assets (and debts) to JP Morgan Chase. I was shocked, to say the least. The idea that WaMu would be shut down was beyond the realm of possibility in my mind. Overnight, my 288 shares had gone from being worth around $1000 to $20 ($0.07/share). I ended up paying $18.50 just to clear it all out of my account ($7 commission to sell the shares + $9.50 options commission to buy back the call option + $2 for the value of the call option = $18.50) leaving me with just $1.50 left from my original $1,022.47 cost basis.\n\nThe lesson I learned? 1) Do your due diligence before buying stock 2) Don't try and catch a falling knife, invest instead in great companies. If your due diligence comes up with significant question marks, there are probably better companies out there to invest in. 3) I don't have time to do the due diligence required to make smart investments. So, after years of avoiding it, I subscribed to Motley Fool's Stock Advisor; paying them to do most of the due diligence for me. Up until this point I had the philosophy that I don't need to pay someone to tell me what to invest in. I'm smart enough to figure it out myself. Losing 99.9% of my investment in WaMu was a major wake up call.\n\nAfter spending some time reading their newsletter and methodology, I bought Netflix, Marvel, OptionsExpress, and Amazon on October 17, 2008; which ended up being some of my best investments ever. I also bought Nintendo and Activision Blizzard on that day, which were money losers, but the gains from the other four more than made up for those two loses. I have been happily beating the S&amp;P 500 ever since.","name":"t1_cxfhd4c","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-28 06:35:32","week":48}

It ended up being $750 after tax, which is more than I would prefer to spend, but the current tv has lasted me 9 years.

So, I have 3000 points towards Kroger gas discounts. My Expedition holds 26 gallons and I tote two 5 gallon containers when I fill up so I can purchase 35 gallons. 3000 points means three fill up with $1 off each time or $105 in savings, so the TV will be $645 in the end.","name":"t1_cxfhhtu","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-28 06:40:58","week":48}

{"id":"cxfjbdt","author":"Mr0range","body":"Allow me to be devils advocate because 4500 in 5 days on 100% ROI is certainly not the norm. I've been doing this for about 4 months now and have a decent amount of experience to speak from. RA is not easy and it is not a stable income. I like to group items you find in big box stores into two categories: \n\n1) clearance items or store liquidation. These yield the best return and are often 200+ ROI. The problem is once you buy them out, that's it. One day you may hit the jackpot clearance aisle but find nothing the next two months. People can make a lot from these but it is not stable. The next category solves this problem. \n\n2) replenishables. These are regular or discounted items which you can restock. Normally they are &lt;50%. If you're lucky you can find one that is higher but with Amazon fees that is difficult. Any item that moves fast (good sales rank) will not vary much from amazon's price. These come with their problems too. Because the margins are slim if someone undercuts you, there goes your profit.\n\nGenerally that is how I sort product from big box stores. Finding an item with decent sales rank and ROI is really not as easy as people say it is. The unpredictable nature of item searching is what makes RA not the most stable form of income. It's why I want to move towards wholesale and private label. You have to put in the time to research different areas for RA to work. Just going into a store and scanning away will burn you out. \n\nWhat you should learn:\n\n1) sales rank. Learn the ins and outs. If it's a shit rank do not buy. You don't want to be stuck with an item for months. Read this sub for more info.\n\n2) cash flow. Manage it wisely. With you (13k in the bank) it probably won't bother you much. Amazon only pays every 2 weeks so your inventory needs to sell before that deadline or risk being stuck with it for another 2 weeks. \n\n3) condition. Sometimes clearance items will be returned items. Inspect each item carefully and be very weary of items with damaged packaging. One bad review can really hurt you and affect your buy box chances. \n\n4) Buy box, pricing strategies and how best to maximize your profits while moving inventory. Sometimes times pricing at 24 and waiting for the 19.99 guy to sell out is in your best interest and other times it's not. \n\n5) Market fluctuation. If you can predict an item's price rise it will pay off. Using camelcamelcamel and keepa will help. \n\nSo there's that. Took way to long to type this on a phone! I just wanted to offer a different perspective that showed RA isn't just a walk in the park. It takes time and effort to succeed. \n\n","name":"t1_cxfjbdt","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-28 08:04:57","week":48}

{"id":"cxfo9z7","author":"JonnyC275","body":"That $10k isn't much once you consider that your bills are coming out of it (net -$1500/mo). \n\nTrying to start a product based business that can generate a sustainable living wage, with that kind of capital, within a few months, is almost impossible.\n\nTake out all your unexpected expenses, like duties, giveaways, blogger promotions, PPC, loss from shipping damage, design work, software subscriptions, insurance, etc.\n\nNow you have like $5000-$8000 left. Take out your first payment for inventory, you have $3000 left. Take out one months pay, add your $1000 side job income, you're at $1500. \n\nAnnnnnd its gone.\n\nI'm not saying this to shit on your dreams. I'm not trying to be a hater or anything. I know its easy to think that you can get started with a grand and be making $50k per month within a few months because of all the bullshit guru courses and people posting half the story.\n\n\"Started five months ago with $2k. Making $90k per month. 60% margin\"\n\nWhat they leave out is that $2k was a test order, then right after it started going well, they had to get a family loan for $30k plus a $20k line of credit, and all their credit cards are maxed out right now. All just to fund inventory and marketing.\n\nThat or they're earning a really high income with their job as a doctor, sales rep, etc and plowing all their money into their business. Or they had investors that funded them after they got started. Or had a lot of savings.\n\nSome simple math: $50k in sales, with a healthy 40% margin after fees, means the COGS is probably around 30% (60% costs with half going to fulfillment, warehousing, any referral fees if you're using Amazon/eBay). \n\nThat means you need $15k per month just to meet the demand for your products. \n\nThen consider that you're not ordering each month, but once every few months. Assume you have to pay in full when they're shipping your order out. That means every  say 3 months, you need to have $45k ($15k x 3mos) to buy your inventory.\n\nAll of this before any marketing spend.\n\nAnd before your salary.\n\nYou'll need more cash, debt financing (loan or LoC) or investors.\n\nI'd suggest building a service business with your market research and ecommerce skills, while starting very small with the private label side hustle (*and not needing it to generate a livable wage*). Then grow it as you can, and when you hit a winning product, seek financing or investors, or put some of your own money into it. But just don't depend on a product business to generate an income for you with $10k and a few months.","name":"t1_cxfo9z7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-28 14:04:04","week":48}

VC firms and PE firms raise investment funds not only from the partners of the firms, but also from state pensions, retirement funds, mutual funds, etc.  We see institutional investors like Fidelity, for example, recently writing down some of the value of their investment in Snapchat.  \n\nThere are billions of $ invested in over 100 unicorns, totaling a $450 billion+ valuation.  If most of these unicorns go bust, expect retirement funds and pension funds to take a big hit.\n\nSo, that's the source of investor funds.  What about the sink of these funds?\n\nThese startup funds fuel the salaries of very well-paid tech professionals in major tech hubs.  This goes on to fuel property bubbles in these hubs, fuels restaurants, fuels state and local government coffers, fuels car purchases, fuels a LOT of the economic growth since the great recession.  If this bubble bursts, the local and state economies will feel the pain, and indeed, I believe the national economy will go into recession.\n\nIn addition to spending money on tech workers, these tech startups spend money on other tech businesses.  Amazon, for example, is the top cloud provider for new tech startups.  Amazon has a P/E ratio near 1000.  Imagine what happens if the tech startup bubble bursts?  Suddenly, a lot less revenue for AWS.  Suddenly, AMZN crashes.  Amazon today looks a lot like Cisco did in 1999-2000.\n\n**tl;dr** - we're definitely in a tech bubble.  You guys who say that we aren't, or that the bubble won't have adverse effects when it pops, are wrong.\n\nedit: misspellings\n\nedit2: For those of you who were babies during the dot com bubble, I want to expand upon my \"Amazon as Cisco\" point.  [Here's an article](http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_40/b3701082.htm) on the \"Four Horsemen\" of the dot com bubble.  These were the megacap companies driving the Nasdaq ever higher - similar to today's narrow market breadth, where much of the gains are driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google).  \n\nGo to Google Finance and check the stock price of CSCO, dating back to the 90's.  It had a market cap of over $500B in the late 90's!  Similar to Amazon today, ALL THE TECH COMPANIES were using Cisco routers, and investors thought its market dominance justified this extreme valuation.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and Cisco has NEVER regained that market cap.  It's currently worth $180B.  A lesson for all you Amazon investors...","name":"t1_cxfx8j8","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-28 19:43:03","week":48}

{"id":"cxfywq9","author":"Bubbagump210","body":"I think this is a very different era. Understand, back then there were multiple factors in play:\n\n* No one had any idea how to actually make money on the internet. People were investing in companies simply because they were tech.\\\n*As was mentioned elsewhere, simply by existing or having a news article, a .com domain registration etc. would cause valuations to sky rocket.\n* Much more of the total market cap was tied up in tech due to the mania. Even retail investors were being ridiculous, not just VC folks... when the arm chair investors are piling on, you know you are hosed. Now, there may be a tech bubble, but I don't see it taking down the entire market.\n* The companies today actually do (in most cases except maybe Twitter) have a revenue model. Uber, AirBnB, etc have real money coming in. Are they profitable or sustainable or will Etsy get creamed by Amazon? Time will tell, but at least there is cash flow.\n\nAll that said, I would NEVER invest in these sorts of companies unless you are an early investor in their private stock days. Which, unless you are a Sequoia, Francisco, Bain, Spectrum etc. or a company founder, you won't be able to do. All the upside is when they are microscopic. Once you hit the public market, it's too late and you need to diversify in indexes or the like unless this is just fun/gambling money.","name":"t1_cxfywq9","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-28 20:32:04","week":48}

I do all the maintenance work(Motor Oil/Transmission Oil/Coolant changes, brake fluid flush and all minor repairs).  They will run for at least 10 more years.  So I would like to stress that you **get rid of the MINI**, get a beater for 2-3k off Craigslist and learn how to do some minor work on cars. It is easy and very useful since you will be able to take care of 2 cars in the future. It is well worth it.   Yes, i know i know the Mini is under water but it is sunken cost.  You are just treating the symptoms by trying to refi the Mini. \n\nOur total annual expenses for 2015 is about $43,000 for a family of 4 that includes the mortgage.  We do not have any debt except the mortgage. We do not feel deprived at all and the most important thing is that I will have an option to choose to work or not, depending on my mood in just 3 years from now.\n\nSo you need to decide which pill to take now, **instant gratification or debt free or even more such as Financial Independence**? \n\n\n ","name":"t1_cxgg3mz","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-29 05:19:53","week":48}

{"id":"cxgmals","author":"esquilaxxx","body":"Here you go:\n\nChicago residents who subscribe to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Spotify are bracing for bill hikes this month, thanks to what some city officials are euphemistically calling an \"amusement tax.\" But clearly Chicagoans are not amused — and they shouldn't be — about what amounts to a tax on how they choose to spend their free time.\n\nIn July, a first-of-its-kind tax took effect in Chicago targeting streaming entertainment services. The tax also applies to cloud computing services and online subscription databases, such as financial services databases and Amazon Web services. Not surprisingly, it's taxing that first set of targets that's causing such outrage among city residents.\n\nThese new taxes were not voted on by the City Council. Instead, the Chicago Department of Finance created the new taxes by administratively clarifying two existing city taxes — the amusement tax and personal property lease transaction tax. City officials estimate the 9 percent levy on \"electronically delivered amusements\" will raise all of $12 million a year — hardly worth the uproar the tax has ignited, considering the city's proposed 2015 budget was $7.3 billion. And Chicago's actual revenue increase will almost certainly be lower than $12 million after the streaming services pass along surcharges and subscription price increases spark a surge of cancellations. While the overall economic impact to the city's bottom line is relatively small, these types of moves do not engender goodwill among city residents and put streaming tech services in a tight spot: Absorb new taxes or pass them on to consumers.\n\nA May 2014 YouGov/Huffington Post poll found nearly 1 in 5 Netflix subscribers polled would cancel their subscription if the price went up by $1 a month — and nearly half of those polled said they'd cancel if it climbed $2 a month. In Economics 101, that's known as the price elasticity of demand; namely, as the price of a good or service rises, the demand for it falls.\n\nAnd the law of unintended consequences could also manifest itself here in a less savory way as well. The streaming services keep their fees reasonable in no small part to discourage piracy, so the amusement tax poses the real risk of reducing affordability and reincentivizing piracy.\n\nThe tax will complicate how companies operate in Chicago and any other cities that follow Chicago's lead. While that's problematic enough for the companies involved, think of consumers who will either bear the brunt of higher costs or find themselves with fewer options simply because they live within city limits. New paid streaming services won't be able to compete with a free alternative, whether it's ad-supported streaming or unsupported streaming in the form of piracy.\n\nFury over Chicago's 'cloud tax'\nFury over Chicago's 'cloud tax'\nNone of those rational considerations deterred officials bent on balancing a massive budget shortfall in part on the backs of consumers of streaming media. And remember, the amusement tax covers not just movies and TV shows but also music and online gaming platforms like \"World of Warcraft.\"\n\nIn the \"monkey see, monkey do\" world of big-city government. One can expect other cash-strapped municipalities to follow Chicago's lead on the amusement tax, if Chicagoans don't rise up in righteous indignation and force City Hall to back down.\n\nProponents will argue the amusement tax is based on the same principle as the federal gasoline tax: Since you use it, you should pay for its maintenance. But the gas tax funds the building and upkeep of the highways and bridges used by all of us who fill our tanks with gasoline (precisely why it's called a \"user fee\"). By contrast, there's no logical nexus between Chicago's amusement tax and the information superhighway. The revenue generated will not be reinvested into improving your Internet service. You already pay taxes and fees on your monthly Internet service bills to fund infrastructure needs, so the amusement tax amounts to, simply put, double taxation.\n\n'Cloud tax' upsets Chicago tech community: 'Life just got 9 percent harder'\n'Cloud tax' upsets Chicago tech community: 'Life just got 9 percent harder'\nNetflix has already indicated it will raise its subscription price in Chicago, and other streaming services are likely to follow the video-streaming giant's lead. At the same time, however, some defiant Chicagoans are talking about changing their billing addresses to somewhere outside city limits specifically to avoid the amusement tax.\n\nThat should send a wake-up call to the administration in Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, are you listening? If not, your administration may be the only one in the city wearing a smile about this tax.\n\nGary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, the U.S. trade association representing more than 2,000 consumer electronics companies, and an author.

{"id":"cxgxbuw","author":"Yboring","body":"Bottom Line: Your best all-around solution is an inkjet printer with auto-duplex capability, coupled with HP's Instant Ink subscription.\n\nWhile it's possible to get per-page costs very low through online printing services like VistaPrint and OvernightPrints, these are only cost-effective if you need many copies (at least 25, most of the time) of the material you're getting printed. Additionally, most of these are limited to booklets of 48 pages or less.\n\nThere are online book printing services, wherein you can get bound books (e.g. BookBaby.com), but even the cheapest option there is going to run you nearly $100 for a single 200-page booklet.\n\nIt's possible that a local print/copy shop may have some low-cost options for you. You might try your local MinuteMan press, and ask what their cost is for on-demand printing. Specify you have a 200-page (or however many) PDF you'd like printed in full color, duplex, on standard copy paper. I doubt you'll get better than $0.10/page, because even laser printers cost a good deal of money per-page, and they'll be quoting you a price that guarantees they'll make money even if every page you send them has a full color photo (using 80-100% toner coverage, vs. the 5% toner coverage that the \"Print Capacity\" you'll see listed on toner cartridge specs is based on).\n\nSo then let's look at printing at home.  You can't really put a price on the convenience of printing when you want, how you want, without having to deal with someone else, not to mention the immediate turnaround, and not having to submit a file, wait for approval, then go pickup the printout, and hope it looks like you expected.  There's also the advantage of being able to print off single pages of other things you need, whether it be a recipe, DIY instructions, boarding passes, etc. If you go with an all-in-one machine, you additionally get the advantage of being able to scan documents into your computer for safekeeping, or making copies of other things you have laying around (maybe a neat magazine article on D&amp;D you'd like to share), or even creating your own guide from a collection of different files.\n\nSo, Laser or InkJet?  \n\nLaser pros:\n\n* Durable, waterproof prints\n* (usually) very crisp text and line art\n\nLaser Cons:\n\n* high initial cost, generally speaking\n* much higher energy consumption\n* slower print speeds (often) for color documents - the paper has to run by 4 different print drums to print color\n* Additional consumable part (Print Drum) in some models\n* Higher replacement cost for toner cartridges.\n\nInkJet Pros:\n\n* Lower cost per page (particularly when coupled with HP's Instant Ink -more on that below)\n* Better color reproduction - Lasers have a tendency to be heavy in one color or another (Canon Lasers are almost always too red, many Brother Lasers print too dark)\n* Photo-quality reproduction of images\n* Often faster print speeds (this varies based on model, and on print settings)\n* Low energy consumption (and generally quieter than Lasers)\n\nInkJet Cons:\n\n* Not so waterfast - if you spill something on the page, it's going to bleed. If your paper is stored in a high-humidity environment, you can get fuzzy edges to your text, also)\n* Text crispness can suffer, depending on the printer, print settings, and the paper you use.\n\nWhile actual cost-per-page of laser (and inkjet) printers can vary widely, depending on both the printer and the toner or ink used (there are generics available for almost every cartridge out there, usually at a 75% savings or so), along with the actual ink coverage (a page of 12pt text is around 5% coverage, a full-color photo might be well above \"100%\", since you're printing in multiple colors over the page) color laser CPP is often in the 20-30¢/pp range, with inkjets anywhere from 10-90¢/pp.  However, there's an interesting solution that's come out in the past year.\n\n(I have no affiliation with HP, other than having used their printers (along with others) for the better part of 2 decades.) \n\nHp Instant Ink is a subscription-based services that, for a monthly cost of $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month, keeps your printer full of ink (they provide ink cartridges to you in the mail, at no additional cost beyond the subscription price) whenever it's needed.  The subscription allows you a set maximum of pages per month (regardless of the content of the page - whether text or full-page photos), with the ability to rollover a full month's allotment to the next month, as well as purchasing additional pages, pro-rated to about the same cost as your monthly subscription.\n\nIt does require a constant connection to the internet, as the printer monitors your print usage and ink levels, and reports them to HP - for both billing purposes and for shipping you the new ink (ahead of when you need it - you've always got replacement cartridges on hand).\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n\nMonthly Plan Cost | Pages Included per month | Cost Per Print | Allowed Rollover Pages | Cost/additional pages | Add'l Pages CPP\n---|---|----|----|----|----\n$2.99 | 50 | 5.98¢ | 50 | $1.00/15 | 6.67¢\n$4.99 | 100 | 4.99¢ | 100 | $1.00/20 | 5¢\n$9.99 | 300 | 3.33¢ | 300 | $1.00/25 | 4¢\n\nYou can upgrade or downgrade your plan at anytime. Upgrades can happen immediately, downgrades will happen at the end of your current month.\nIf you decide to cancel, the InstantInk Cartridges will no longer work, and you'll have to mail them back to HP, but you can continue using your printer with cartridges of your choice.\n\nAdditionally, HP says the InstantInk cartridges hold more ink than even the XL cartridges, so you'll be replacing cartridges less often than you would if you bought them yourself (not a big deal, but thought you'd like to know).\n\nLet's look, then, at the cost of printing one of your 200-page PDFs.\n\nPaper cost: Let's say you go with a \"nice\" inkjet paper, since these are binders you'll be using for a while, and you want to be able to print on both sides without it bleeding through the paper. I'd recommend at least 24# paper (regular copy paper is usually 20#), or even higher, with a nice brightness level. I've had really good results with HP's Bright White Inkjet paper (24#, 97 Brightness). 2500 Sheets is $35.99 on Amazon, or 1.4¢/per page.  If you buy in smaller quantities, 500 sheets are 6.37 + 2.99 shipping = 9.36/500 = 1.8¢/pp. Still not bad.\n\nAssuming you screw up some pages, we'll use 2¢ per sheet for our calculations.  200 pages need 100 sheets of paper, so $2.00 paper cost.\n\n\n\nPlan | Overage Pages | Overage Cost | Final Cost \n---|---|----|----\n2.99 (50pgs) | 250 | $16.66 | 19.65\n4.99 (100) | 200 | $10 | 14.99\n9.99 (300) | 0 | 0 | 9.99 (with 100 pages leftover)\n\nWhile all of these prices beat the cost you would've been quoted at a Kinkos/Staples/etc, it's clear your best bet would be the 9.99/month plan, at least in months where you know you'll be printing a bunch.\n\nAs far as printers go, there are a [\\(fair\\) number of HP printers that are eligible for InstantInk](http://store.hp.com/us/en/SearchDisplay?client=&amp;searchTerm=instant+ink+printers&amp;search=%2526%252361473%253B&amp;beginIndex=0&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;charset=utf-8&amp;langId=-1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;pageView=list&amp;resultCatEntryType=2&amp;sType=SimpleSearch&amp;searchSource=Q&amp;storeId=10151&amp;jumpid=cp_r163_us/en/ips/instant_ink/instantink/elgshopallprinters). I'd look for one with Auto-Duplexing, obviously, as you'll want the printer to handle the double-sided printing for you. Costs are between $49 and $279, depending on whether you get just a printer (made for home use) or an all-in-one (usually made for office environments, meaning higher duty cycles (how many pages per month the printer is made to handle - up to 30,000!), faster print and scan speeds, and greater reliability and lifespan overall. The OfficeJet 8610 has great reviews, is on sale right now for $99, and has all the features you'd need.\n\nGranted, the greatest single expense in the cost-per-page analysis above is the cost of buying the printer. That first booklet of 200 pages is going to be expensive, since it'll be cost of printer + cost of paper + cost of ink, but as with all fixed costs, it becomes cheaper and cheaper in the long run. After you've printed 1000 pages, your amortized cost per page with the above printer is just 10¢ ($99.99/1000), and it will continue to go down from there. My OfficeJet 6500 plus has been running strong for 4 years, with 4489 pages printed as of this very second.\n\nAdditionally, HP is [running a special where the first 6 months of HP Instant Ink are free for new purchases,](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/ads/instant-ink/overview.html?jumpid=in_r11400_us_en_ii2_iienrollpage_03162015#footnotes) use Promo code HOLIDAY15 at enrollment checkout. (scroll about halfway down the page to see this). You'll still pay overage fees and taxes, but if you choose the 9.99 plan, you can get 1800 pages printed for almost free (if you stay under 300 pages per month), cancel before the last month is out (if you so wish), and go buy generic ink cartridges (right now, $30 for a full set of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and 2 Black). Or, just downgrade to the lowest level after the last month, and only have to pay 2.99/month, with the ability to upgrade to the higher plans on months when you want to print out something new.\n\nAnyway, there's my recommendation. While I haven't used the HP Instant Ink service yet, I might just jump on the printer sales (and that 6 months free promotion) this week.\n\nHope this helps!","name":"t1_cxgxbuw","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-11-29 19:06:28","week":48}

This time last year, I started flipping by buying a cheap box of DVDs (nearly a year to the day, actually). A few months back, I went in on this full time with €500, and this is the first week I've cleared £1000/€1,400 in a week, and £3,000/€4,257 in a month. Right, fees take their toll, but it was only a little while back I was excited for hitting the £2000 in 30 days mark, so to clear £3000 makes me feel awesome. Especially since I still have stock in Amazon that, if it sold, is worth about £3500/€5000ish. \n\nBlack Friday accounts for most of that £1000 in the last week as well. I so wasn't ready for it either; I didn't reduce prices or anything, and thought BF would only really affect people doing massive sales.

{"id":"cxh0ex2","author":"Humblesalesman","body":"Pretty much everything you need to know is laid on the TOS and operating agreement.  I highly recommend you read through it because if you are intending to operate this as a business then these constitute as a binding contract. You wouldn't blindly sign a contract in any other area of your business, so you should treat this as  no different.\n\nTo put it super simply:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The amazon affiliate disclaimer** - This MUST be featured somewhere on your website. It doesn't have to be in the footer. It doesn't have to be on every page. It DOES have to be somewhere logical and easy to access. While it appears they use a bot to crawl for this disclosure, in my testing I have found that it is also manually sighted. Hiding it in a white font on a white background won't do you any favors.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Reviewing** - Your site is left to it's own devices UNTIL you make your first sale. At that point Amazon will review your website. Once accepted they seem to review it fairly randomly sometimes months between, closer to the end of the month when you get paid out. This is entirely based on personal experience and testing and your milage may vary.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Content** - You will be rejected for poor content. A TIWIB clone with nothing but pictures yanked from Amazon and two bland sentences below each picture generally won't cut it. Rule of thumb: The content should provide value to a reader EVEN if all the amazon based content is removed (links, pictures, etc.) Every time I apply for the program I make sure I have at least 10 pages of content. A static front page is not going to do you any favors, a blog style front page where posts are ordered by date seem to work best.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Acceptance**  - Here is where it get's a little hazy. Because your site is being reviewed by a human, bad websites do slip by all the time. But heres the thing, if ever your site is re-reviewed, another reviewer *may* decide that it shouldn't have slipped past and drop it. Do it right the first time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Buying through your links** - During your first few sales they will ACTIVELY monitor your purchases, if you have used your own affiliate links in this period  to buy something and double dip, you will get booted. But once you are selling hundreds of items  a day it seems to be somewhat forgiven **Do so at your own risk**.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is all based on my own personal experience and testing. Your milage may differ.  There are obviously more speed bumps but these are very clearly laid out in the TOS and operating agreement.\n\nEdit: Spelling.\n\n ","name":"t1_cxh0ex2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-29 20:25:09","week":48}

Amazon has the velocity limits, at the time eBay didn't have holds but they would suspend while verifying information. If one shuts you down it's good to have a backup. \n\nThe last variable I can think of, depending how fast you flip things and how fast you sell you can reinvest quicker with eBay as they pay 3 days after delivery vs Amazon's 3 week. Which is better is completely dependent on your business model but it's something to think about. Edit: Probably should add if you use Amazon FBA they can offer some nice credit limits which makes this entire point useless. I don't think they offer this to MF sales though.","name":"t1_cxh57v3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-29 22:27:35","week":48}

The full price is $25, I'm running a 50% off base price promo on Amazon for Black Friday - Cyber Monday, this code takes an additional 25% off of that price, bringing the total down to $6.25, or 75% off the full price.\n\nMake sense?","name":"t1_cxh5wq3","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-11-29 22:46:28","week":48}

{"id":"cxh6uq1","author":"boxsterguy","body":"Amazon money is completely wrecking the real estate market in that area, but in a good way (for you). Don't limit yourself to the bank appraisal. Check comps in the area. I wouldn't be surprised if $500k was your low end, with a decent expectation of getting $600k or more in a bidding war.\n\nThink of it this way - it doesn't really cost you much to list it high. If it sells, great. If someone lowballs you, it'll probably be for more than you're thinking it's worth right now anyway. And worst case scenario, you can always reduce the price or take it off the market if it's not selling.\n\nI'd probably hold onto it until the spring, though. People don't buy a lot of houses during the winter.","name":"t1_cxh6uq1","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-29 23:11:44","week":48}
