If you sell on craigslist and everyone else sells on ebay you may still have a strong local market at your price point. You can also use other avenues to get a competitive edge.  Maybe you sell clothing and have repeat customers that know you measure correctly or maybe you retain them with great customer service. \n\nIn other areas it may be that the market is already saturated with that product. For example penny booksellers on Amazon, most of your profit is coming from the contracts you can negotiate for cheaper shipping, and not from your price as it has already hit a minimum. \n\n&gt; These people would be sellers on Amazon, right?\n\nYes sorry that was unclear. By buyers I meant other flippers in your area. If you double the amount of flippers in my local area I would have to find new ways to source to maintain the same sales as they would be buying up inventory before I could get my hands on it. \n\nOne way around this mentioned somewhere in the thread by /u/che85mor .

However, as I myself pointed out, AWS only accounts for 8% of AMZNs total revenue, but **50%** of operating profits. \n\n[Here's an article today (quite bullish, IMO) of AWS' standalone valuation, with the relevant part:](http://techinsidr.com/is-amazon-web-services-a-100b-business/)\n\n&gt; Given these unique characteristics, I feel that a 13X revenue multiple is more appropriate for valuation purposes. AWS’s revenue growth and profitability is off the charts and they occupy a dominant competitive position in the SaaS application delivery space. Using a 13X revenue multiple, it results in a standalone valuation of **$104B.** [Emphasis mine]\n\nNevermind the fact that valuation depends on profits, not revenues, we'll value AWS along Bezos preferred method. So here's the $104B question: With AMZNs current market cap close to $300B, where's the remaining $200B-ish of the market cap coming from? All from low margin retail division? Drones? Or do AMZN bulls expect AWS to completely take over the company, despite contributing only a sliver to revenues (and as /u/redcards pointed out, [very capital intensive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3ptdow/amazon_shoots_up_9_on_surprise_profit/cwad6ju)\n\nTo reiterate: AMZN market cap is almost $300B, AWS can be valued at $100B, where's the other 2/3 of the market cap value to be found?\n","name":"t3_3qbxbs","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-26 22:02:56","week":44}

{"id":"3qhw0j","author":"battlemage4lyfe","body":"So my SO's old car is a beater and he wants a new car to himself (to drive to the ground/give to kids). \n\nHe has two incomes, essentially. One comes from managing/owning his family businesses but the income goes straight to his parents (to pay for their retirement + bills + comfortable lifestyle, etc). He half lives on this income. Additionally, he and his parents live in one home. \n\nHe recently decided to get a day job for even more income. It's 45k non-fixed (there will be overtime but I don't know at what rate; word is there will be a LOT of overtime where it's possible he can gross 55k after taxes, but that is word of mouth). \n\nOn his new second income (the 45k), he wants to 1) get a new car 2) start saving up for a real, adult lifestyle. Retirement, rainy-day fund, etc. \n\nHow much can he reasonably spend for a new car? He's looking to spend $30-35k for a new car on his salary and that just doesn't sit right with me at all, but literally everything else is paid for already, too. His first income pays ALL of the bills. His second income, the only monthly bills will be $8 for Netflix, $50 for insurance, and $80 a year for prime. I believe he'll use his second income for his lifestyle now, too. It ranges from $650 monthly (basics for food, entertainment, etc) and up to $900 for months with expensive purchases. I pressured him a little bit to put money away every month for a down payment on a house for us in maybe 5-7 years. We will assume nothing will come from his first income. \n\nI will find out a more detailed budget. I don't know too much about finances. Please help? Please ask as many questions as you want. \n\n\nEDIT: The salary is at least $40k a year and will not go lower than that but can go much, much higher. \n\nTL;DR \n\n* Wants a new-new car \n\n* $45k salary after tax \n\n* No bills except $8 Netflix, $50 insurance, $7/month Amazon Prime\n\n* Wants to allot $500 a month towards card payments on a 3-year or 5-year plan, no leasing \n\n* Rest of the money will go towards living costs/savings. \n\n* No debt \n\n* Around 10k savings (that will not go towards car) \n\n* Is considering wanting to put a down payment on a house in 5-7 years ","name":"t3_3qhw0j","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-28 01:40:04","week":44}

{"id":"3qq9i7","author":"SendCreditHelpPlz","body":"Reddit, I dug myself to the otherside of the world in credit card debt, compared to my income. One credit card led to many, even while telling myself, \"I won't be that guy.\" And now, I am that guy. \n\nFirst, an outlook of my future as it currently stands: I am 26, and I work and attend school full time. I was conditionally accepted into a pharmacy school beginning next fall, so I'm not wholly worried about future income. Once I start pharmacy school I want to either not work at all, or work at the most 2 days/week. The problem is that I have incurred so much credit card debt now, it's starting to affect my day-to-day life and will make not working while in pharmacy school completely unavoidable. Will I be able to afford (this) necessity? What will I have to hold-out on? Some days are worse than others.\n\n**Net Income:** $400-$550 biweekly (closer to the 450 mark, but when I \"budget\" I also round down and use 400, up to $550 to include paid holidays)\n\n**401k balance:** $7,339\n\n\n**Auto payment:** $208/month (about $5k left on loan).\n\n**Credit cards and their balances:** (each one is essentially maxed)\n\nCredit union: $500\n\nCapital One Journey: $2750\n\nCapital One Platinum: $3500 (annual fee of I think $35)\n\nAmex: $500\n\nChase Slate: $500\n\nBarclays: $500\n\nCiti: $1000 (currently no interest, I forget when it starts accruing interest)\n\nKohls: $300\n\nAmazon: $700\n\nWalmart: $500\n\nTotal: $10750, more than half of my gross pay per year. I suck.\n\nI also get student loans each semester, but I am not as worried about those given my almost-set-in-stone future career. I am elgible for the EIC and child tax credit come tax season as well. Previously when I received my refund, we bought what we needed and the rest was thrown at credit card debt, and then spent. (With that previous point, I realize that I have spending issues and have been trying to keep it in check.)\n\nPossible solutions? Pay off as much as humanly possible this coming spring using student loans and tax refund, and pay remaining out of 401k ($7,339). I would like to know if this is a viable solution to the mess I put myself in, and/or if there are others ways to solve it.\n\nI am at school right now, and I work tonight and get home approximately at 10:30 EST. I will try my best to check this throughout the day, but if not I definitely will be back tonight to give any more details I might be forgetting.\n\nTL;DR: Mad credit debt of ~$11k, do I take funds from my 401k to help pay it?","name":"t3_3qq9i7","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-29 18:32:21","week":44}

{"id":"3qqk0s","author":"ForTheSeamless","body":"GoDaddy (Ticker: GDDY)\n\nFounded in 1997 and currently boasting over 60 million domains, GoDaddy is the clear market leader in the domain registry space by a large margin. The company was taken private via an LBO in 2011, in 2014 there was a 350mm dividend recap and then it finally IPO'd on April first. Expected price range was $17-$19, the stock opened at $20, and rose almost 31% to close at $26.15. \n\nGoDaddy's domain business is its bread and butter, and then it also has hosting and presence services and business apps. The hosting and presence services and business apps segments are not only growing extremely quickly, but they also have much better margins than the main domain business which will result in overall margin expansion for the company over time.\n\nGoDaddy's domain business is the main customer acquisition vehicle, and then from there customers tend to purchase other services. The company's main target customer are new businesses trying to gain an online presence and join the e-commerce wave, and small businesses that already have an online presence but want to streamline it or make it better. A major catalyst for the company is international expansion. International revenues currently make up 25% of total revenue, up from below 20% just a few years ago. GoDaddy since 2012 has also been custom tailoring its product offering to the various market it services. This is to say they are offering their product in a countries language, having a dedicated customer service team in that country, etc. GoDaddy has also been growing inorganically through small tech acquisitions to help the company bolster its product offerings. \n\nI don't understand why everyone is hating so much on GoDaddy. The company has extremely stable revenues due to its subscription based services and deferred revenue recognition, and subsequent negative operating working capital. Top-line growth beat expectations last quarter but the stock dropped because its net income missed expectations. The company is obviously investing heavily in itself to get further ahead of its competitors, and it can do so safely because it knows it will have revenues coming in as the deferred revenues are recognized over time. People often cite that GoDaddy has had a net loss since 2009, but totally ignore the fact that it has been cash flow positive on an adjusted EBITDA basis. If GoDaddy really had profitability issues then it wouldn't have been taken private in LBO because it wouldn't have survived it. Other cite the large debt load as a concern, but then don't realize the bulk of it doesn't mature until 2021 and even then has relatively low interest expense. Another major concern cited is that its domain business has no barriers to entry and large tech behemoths like Google and Amazon have entered the cloud space. The thing about the domain business is that its a relatively common service but theres vast disparities in prices offered. None of Google or Amazons or any other major competitors have prices anywhere close to the prices that GoDaddy offers. GoDaddy is essentially the Walmart of domain names.\n\nFYI GoDaddy posts earnings on Nov 4 after market close.\n\nSo please, why all the hate on GoDaddy?","name":"t3_3qqk0s","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-29 19:38:59","week":44}
{"id":"3qqsmd","author":"tn_notahick","body":"So with my 12yo son's little business, I always make first contact with CL ads (safety mainly).  He asked me to contact a guy that has 100 books for sale for $100.  They are just random books, from what I can tell, nothing worth a ton of money but good enough for a 12yo to flip for 50-75 cents profit each. I found a few that might be $2-3 profit, but nothing crazy from a quick look-over. \n\nI wrote him my standard email, explaining it's a 12yo kid who has a \"little business\" so he can learn about business (accounting, customer service, cash flow, etc. etc.) and that he usually only makes 50 cents profit per book (on average). \n\nHere's the reply:\n\n&gt; Your son is 12 years old, so I doubt he knows much of anything about the used book business. Whereas I worked for three different out-of-print/rare/antiquarian/second-hand books dealers for over a decade. Two of those businesses went out of business, and the third has always struggled. It is really difficult to make a living anymore in books, thanks to Amazon, Ebay, and all the other online SPECIFICALLY BOOKS dealers. He has a lot of competition. \n\n&gt;He's only 12--his college education is still a number of years away. So your story is a little thin.\n\n&gt;Thank you for your inquiry, but I am getting tired of people asking me to lower my price. I know what I've got here, and apparently so do all the people who try to low-ball me. If he wants them for $100, I will be happy to sell them to him. \n\nI basically replied saying that the listing has been up for over a month, and if so many people have been making lower offers, maybe, just maybe, that's what the market says they are worth! I also asked him just how many years before college that a kid should start getting motivated to start making a few bucks? Would 1 or 2 years be acceptable to him, since 5 years seems to be too soon?\n\nSo he writes another long email (this is edited to get rid of the off-topic unimportant stuff:\n\n&gt;Your emails are just lies.

{"id":"3qqv5s","author":"magladde","body":"Hello all,\n\nSo I was wondering if it was time for me to get a new credit card. I got a credit card as soon as I graduated High School just to build credit (Mothers idea). I have never really carried a balance and it has been about 5 years. To my knowledge this credit card does not have any rewards or benefits associated with it (except for the ability to overdraft which I have dclined to use.) So is it time for me to switch to a new credit card? I was interested in the Amazon credit card because I do a fair amount of shopping there but I am unsure if this is a good idea or not?","name":"t3_3qqv5s","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-29 20:47:36","week":44}

{"id":"3qs9o3","author":"AJD73","body":"Hey guys, really quick question here regarding shipping from China to Canada/USA. I've been in contact with a supplier and am set to put in my first order for product, however the quote I am being given for shipping has absolutely halted me in my tracks.\n\nNow, keep in mind this is really small time, so please bear with me. Item in question will cost me about 4$/piece to manufacture and label, and I planned to make a small purchase of 100-200 OQ to start off with. Item will sell for 15.99-17.99 on Amazon, and I plan to use FBA. Now each peice weights about 1- 1.5 lbs, and for a 100 OQ I have been quoted 390$ for shipping, 760$ for 200 piece OQ. These shipping costs, in addition to the costs I'd incur getting a UPC code and shipping to FBA from my location likley put my cost per unit around 8.30, which coupled with the FBA costs leaves me with razor thin margins.\n\nSo, basically I was just hoping I could get some guidance regarding standard shipping prices and if there is anything I could be doing different here. I know eventually if I could manage to get some product selling I would be upping my OQ and start using sea freight, but as of right now this doesn't seem like an option. Does anyone have any advise or experience with a similar situation? Does this shipping rate look standard? \n\nThanks a lot guys.","name":"t3_3qs9o3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-30 02:33:07","week":44}

{"id":"3qti0s","author":"renaldo686","body":"We do a fair amount of business on Amazon as manufacturers.  Some items we ship ourselves and some items we use FBA (fulfilled by Amazon).  We ship our items regular post with delivery confirmation, but because there is no signature confirmation Amazon will always take the buyer's side when there is a claim, even if the item shows delivered.\n\nAmazon is broken, all anyone needs to do is find a seller fulfilled item, order the item and claim it never arrived, you will then get the item for free.  Simple as that!  You may ask, \"Why not ship with signature confirmation?\" , because the cost outweighs the benefit, one claim a month does not justify the extra expense of shipping each unit with a signature confirmation.  So many sellers with items that cost under a certain amount will not ship with signature confirmation.\n\nSpecific case, we sent buyer his order, 55 days later he says he never received it.  So knowing that Amazon will deny my claim we went ahead and sent him another product (our profit margins are huge so it is cheaper to send another than to grant the full refund of the original).  After we ship he sends another email saying that he doesn't want the replacement, and he was demanding a refund.  So now we are out 2 products and the money and Amazon sided with him 100%.  \n\nBasically, Amazon will always side with the buyer, and as a consumer it is VERY easy to scam people on Amazon and Amazon doesn't care because they make the sellers pay.  \n ","name":"t3_3qti0s","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-30 10:17:58","week":44}

{"id":"3qx6ya","author":"WhateverAccount123","body":"So after years of selling on eBay, I'm looking to moving some inventory to Amazon, as it shows better potential on many of my items.  I have had a seller account for a little less than a year now, and until this month, made few sales on it, and only had 1 feedback (which was 100% positive).  This month I sold around 25-30 items as I have gotten more into Amazon Selling.  Within those listings, I have had a customer ask for a cancel on an item due to it being duplicate (this came in after the item shipped), another customer asking for a return since the order was unwanted (again, after it had shipped), and now I have someone who says an item (which was brand new) is defective and wants a refund.  On the last one I checked and their was no request for a return, just a message stating he wanted a refund (which seems suspicious to me).  \n\nIn all my years on ebay it was RARE that I had a customer complain about an item or try and scam me.  Yet I've had about 10% of my orders have some kind of problem.  I currently do not sell FBA but plan to very soon.  My main concern is that I am finding a lot more difficult customers on Amazon than I have eBay, and want to know if this was just bad luck or is actually normal.

But things got busier and I was not able to do that very often.\n\nToday we have hit some good numbers in a year so I thought I will make a post to motivate some of the Reddit entrepreneurs.\n\nIf you did not read the older post I linked above, this website was a hack I coded in about 2 hours and it worked so I continued working with it. \n\nI have gotten so much hate for Flippiness for various reasons that I had enough reasons to quit. But those who believed in it, and paid me every month to renew their membership, were a testimony to the fact that what I built worked. So I never quit. It's been about 18 months now and we are going strong. We have users who have now made Flippiness their full time job.\n\n**Lesson:** Ignore what haters say. If there are good people paying you for your idea, it is worth it.\n\nNow let us come to the updates:\n\nThis month is a special one for us. \n\nWe have crossed 1500 registrations on the site this month, thanks to an article on Lifehack about our process. \n\nWe made $4000 from affiliate commission from Amazon. This is the commission we make when people buy or sell books through our links. The beauty of this is that it is in addition to the membership fee we get. This is how we monetize our free users as well.\n\nWe have grown our paid subscriptions by two folds, due to the new users. I hope we don't lose many of them.\n\nWe have added a bunch of new sites to our lists from where our users can buy and sell books.\n\nI was able to take my wife to a 15 day Euro trip using the money I made from Flippiness. \n\nHere is something you may find interesting. **Advice** If you have a product where you could create a community of your users so that they can exchange their best ideas, create a Facebook group. Most people are on Facebook and hence they will get regular updates from you. This will also let them answer each others' questions. When I was out for 15 days, nobody realized that I was missing because questions were getting answered by the community. It helps you get trust. Oh, keep the group moderated or you are inviting spam. Here is [our group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freecallshub/) if you guys want to see how community members helps each other. \n\n**This may motivate you**\n\nFlippiness is a by-product of my first startup Bookup. Bookup did not work (well it still makes a little bit) but the data that we collected gave me the idea to build Flippiness. I am now a firm believer that if you think better and take bold decisions you can make it work. If your idea is not working, and you know that this is really a good idea, see how you can pivot it to look like a really good idea. You may have to sell it to a different audience though.\n\n","name":"t3_3qz49q","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-31 16:44:57","week":44}

I literally went from a steady $4,000/month to barely $2,000 a month from August to September. I kept refilling my inventory with items that should sell well and... like, flatline. Nothing. No bump. $300/week for inventory and nothing's selling. That's not normal for me. After a sourcing spree I almost always have a bump where the quick/low sales rank items fly off the shelf. \n\nI use AOB as an inventory uploader. I started late July. So after listing on amazon I request an inventory report for all active items and do a purge and replace on AOB.

{"id":"cwcqhkk","author":"jimichangas","body":"It's definitely possible, and there are several different things you could do. \n\nWhile I've never done it, there are certainly people who buy things as cheaply as possible on eBay, then turn around and manage to sell it at a higher price - right on the same site! Also, sometimes an item will be cheaper on eBay than on Amazon, or vice-versa, so poaching something from one to resell on the other is certainly doable.\n\nKnow anybody who needs stuff sold for them? This is how I got started, and continue to do it a lot. Started off selling stuff for an older guy who wasn't computer-savy but had the street smarts to know when something was valuable, and as time went on he collected this stuff until he was running out of space. Enter me, 'computer guy'. Once word got around, people crawled out of the woodwork with stuff for me to sale. Some people will nay-say reselling for people, but fuck that! Just make sure you arrange payouts at 50/50.\n\nLive near any businesses - box stores in particular? If so, learning when they throw out their trash and hit those dumpsters at night. I'm serious, you wouldn't believe the stuff to be found in those places. There's a fun book called [The Art and Science of Dumpster Diving](http://www.raccoonsongs.com/Raccoon%20-%20Miscellany/Dumpster%20Diving%20book/Art%20&amp;%20Science%20of%20Dumpster%20Diving.pdf), which is full of good tips.

{"id":"cwcuvji","author":"PickerLeech","body":"I've been picking and flipping for the last 3 years - on a casual hobby basis. I've learned a lot mainly from youtube. \n\nIt's not as simple as it appears to be in the US - and that can lead to purchasing items that don't sell, sell incredibly slowly, or sell at a very nominal margin. \n\nYou've hit the nail on the head in regards to the issues for Aussie flippers - high shipping rates, and lack of resources. The main lack of resource is Amazon. If you watch the US guys on youtube, almost all of them transitioned from having a fairly scrappy piecemeal \"messy\" business focused on ebay, to having much more quantity of sales and purchases and (in my mind) a much stronger and more businessy business by focusing on selling on Amazon. Not only do we not have that as an option, but our ebay just does not have the number of users that the US ebay does. \n\nOn top of that, I've seen ALL the thrift stores that i've been to go from being bargain central to not at all worth the time. Purchasing on Gumtree seems pointless (haven't spent much time on it) as sellers want ebay prices (or higher). And Craigslist in Sydney is dead (the last time I looked). \n\nI have some luck with Online Retail arbitrage, but it's not really enough to justify any significant amount of time that's put into it, and it seems that true bargains are harder and harder to come by. I get a little action via ebay sniping. I get a little action via Retail arbitrage, but again it's just very occasional and not enough to justify dedicating time to it - I just have a quick look around if I happen to be in the store. \n\nI think the positives are that a lot of (but by no means all) Garage Sales can have good bargains - but it also seems that the number of \"professional\" garage salers is increasing (those that are attempting to sell at a profit). I think that there are probably fewer pickers / flippers than there are in the US, so if you do go garage saleing you're less likely to face competition. I also think that if you somehow figure out a \"niche\" that you stand a good chance of being able to run with it. \n\nPersonally I'm edging towards DVDs and to a lesser extent CDs. Easy to list, store, send. Nominal margin, but there's the potential to become an expert in that niche and the potential to deal in fairly high quantities.

They've painted this picture of the successful collection of millions and billions of uncollected use tax to state and fed lawmakers, with made up polls (you will never see a list of the leading questions they ask), and an impressive array of PR firms masquerading as grass roots small businesses. \n\nThe reality is that the \"amazing easy free software\" has no guarantees of accuracy, no defense against death of a thousand cuts audits from thousands of different local tax rates, and is not free in any sense of the word, if time is valuable. \n\nThe use taxes that legislators are being promised will be offset by higher prices and less purchasing. The arguments used by brick and mortar shops are the same used by Sunday liquor sales opponents (we can't compete! Family values!), and are often out of touch owners of dying industry that view the Internet as an enemy rather than a boon, and also pretend that Internet businesses are disconnected from their communities, don't own or rent property, pay utilities or suffer the costs that most brick and mortars do. \n\nAmazon and Walmart and most every big box store out there support these bills as they already have the physical locations and accounting infrastructure to make this a non issue, but these extra demands would be prohibitive for any small startup. Another huge supporter is the International Council of Shopping Centers, members of which have *huge* real estate assets which are becoming less valuable as consumer attitudes change about things like Black Friday etc. \n\nThese bills could also be construed as a privacy invasion, as records of every purchase made by customers would be reported to third parties. {That's never gone wrong. }\n\nNotably, no brick and mortar store wants to require actual \"fairness\", and demand ID from every customer to ensure they collect taxes from a customer's location, which is exactly what they desire from Internet businesses. \n\nThose are just some of the things that suck about all the Internet tax bills that are being pushed like crazy. The obvious PR, paid editorials, and clear conflict of interest would have me opposing this even if it didn't threaten my and every one I know's small businesses. Every legislator I've talked to about it is uninterested in voting against the local big box store (I'm in Minnesota so I have Target and Best Buy) no matter what, so there's that too. \n\nMeh.

Tracking demonstrates a package was delivered. Insurance protects against damage and loss (with some limitations). Also note: I am an ebay and Amazon seller only and I'm not familiar with selling via auctions on UK-ebay, I pay for USPS tracking on all my packages for two reasons 1) to provide top customer service and 2) to demonstrate that a package arrived. If a claim is opened by a buyer ebay customer service looks at facts to decide the outcome. If a 'scammer' states a package never arrived and I have USPS tracking confirming delivery I have done everything I can to delivery the purchased item and the claim should be decided in my favor (given there are no other issues). Consider tracking as an 'insurance' for your business. On the topic of insurance, the following excerpt is from the USPS website, \"You can purchase insurance coverage for your mail pieces for up to $5,000 in indemnity to protect against loss or damage. Insurance costs are based on the item's declared value. There are limitations for insuring some products and certain items. USPS Priority Mail Express shipments include up to $100 of insurance and Priority Mail shipments $50. For more valuable shipments, additional coverage is usually available.\"  I pay for shipping based on the item's value and less than 40% of my sales requires insurance.

{"id":"cwdg3pi","author":"-Pin_Cushion-","body":"&gt;U.S. Companies Warn of Slowing Economy\n\n&gt;By Theo Francis And Kate Linebaugh\n\n&gt;Quarterly profits and revenue at big American companies are poised to decline for the first time since the recession, as some industrial firms warn of a pullback in spending.\n\n&gt;From railroads to manufacturers to energy producers, businesses say they are facing a protracted slowdown in production, sales and employment that will spill into next year. Some of them say they are already experiencing a downturn.\n\n&gt;\"The industrial environment's in a recession. I don't care what anybody says,\" Daniel Florness, chief financial officer of Fastenal Co., told investors and analysts earlier this month. A third of the top 100 customers for Fastenal's nuts, bolts and other factory and construction supplies have cut their spending by more than 10% and nearly a fifth by more than 25%, Mr. Florness said.\n\n&gt;Caterpillar Inc. last week reduced its profit forecast, citing weak demand for its heavy equipment, and 3M Co., whose products range from kitchen sponges to adhesives used in automobiles, said it would lay off 1,500 employees, or 1.7% of its total, as sales growth sagged for a wide range of wares.\n\n&gt;The weakness is overshadowing pockets of growth in sectors such as aerospace and technology.\n\n&gt;Industrial companies are being buffeted on multiple fronts. The slump in energy prices has gutted demand for drilling equipment and supplies. Economic expansion is slowing in China and major emerging markets such as Brazil, which U.S. companies have relied on for sales growth. And the dollar's strength also has eroded overseas profits.\n\n&gt;The drag on earnings and sluggish growth projections for next year come as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates for the first time in nine years, and could add momentum to those in favor of postponing any rate increase until next year.\n\n&gt;Profit and revenue are falling in tandem for the first time in six years, with a third of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting so far. Analysts expect the index's companies to book a 2.8% decline in per-share earnings from last year's third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\n&gt;Sales are on pace to fall 4%--the third straight quarterly decline. The last time sales and profits fell in the same quarter was in the third period of 2009.\n\n&gt;At some companies, foreign-currency effects hurt results significantly. Consumer-products maker Kimberly-Clark Corp. predicted that currency swings would slash earnings by 25% this year, while Johnson &amp; Johnson said that the dollar's moves would reduce sales growth by almost 7 percentage points this year, even without further fluctuations.\n\n&gt;This week, another third of the S&amp;P 500 are expected to report their results, including such giants as Apple Inc., United Parcel Service Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\n&gt;Much of the anticipated decline stems from the hard-hit energy industry, where sales are expected to drop by more than a third from a year earlier and profits are likely to plummet 65%, Thomson Reuters says, based on analysts' estimates. Basic-materials companies face a 17% drop in profits, and industrial sales are expected to decline more than 5%.\n\n&gt;United Technologies Corp., which makes Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners, said it expects profits to be flat or down in three of its four operating segments next year, despite strength in its U.S. operations. Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told investors last week that the Otis division's sales in China fell 19% in the third quarter as commercial construction slumped.\n\n&gt;Other companies voiced similar concerns. \"If you look at kind of the broad industrial-production index, you see industrial production sequentially coming down,\" said Fredrik Eliasson, chief sales and marketing officer at railroad operator CSX Corp.\n\n&gt;CSX is scaling back some operations in response to declining coal shipments as power plants switch fuels, eliminating nearly 500 jobs in Corbin, Ky., and Erwin, Tenn. In the current quarter, the company plans to reduce its average head count by 2% from the third-quarter level.\n\n&gt;U.S. manufacturing production rose in September at its slowest pace in more than two years, the Institute for Supply Management reported earlier this month. Economic activity at 11 industries tracked by the group contracted during the month, while just seven reported growth. Meantime, manufacturers told ISM that customer inventories remained high, contributing to a slowdown in new orders.\n\n&gt;Some investors and analysts worry that companies accustomed to boosting earnings by cutting costs, repurchasing shares and refinancing debt will soon have to face the reality of worsening sales. \"The ability of corporations to take a 1% to 2% revenue line [gain] and turn it into 5% to 6% profit growth is waning,\" said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group. \"They've run out of rabbits to pull out.\"\n\n&gt;Still, cost-cutting continues. Companies from Twitter Inc. and Biogen Inc. to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Monsanto Co. have announced job cuts in recent weeks. That could boost the U.S. unemployment rate, which ended September at 5.1%, its lowest point since April 2008.\n\n&gt;\"Things are definitely a bit shakier than they were several months ago,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. But, he added, \"the U.S. is fundamentally in decent shape.\"\n\n&gt;Indeed, low fuel prices have boosted U.S. car sales and buoyed airlines' results, and the U.S. construction market remains robust. And, even among manufacturers, the aerospace industry is doing well. Technology giants Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. posted strong results on Thursday, as did Google parent Alphabet Inc.\n\n&gt;Such strength suggests that the broader economy is unlikely to succumb to the industrial sector's gloom, especially given robust profit margins, said Jeremy Zirin, chief U.S. equity strategist for wealth management at UBS. \"The broad mosaic of data suggests that the U.S. economy is still doing OK,\" Mr. Zirin said. \"This isn't a very bullish view, it's just saying things aren't as bad as feared.\"\n\n&gt;Others worry that the slowdown is spreading to consumer businesses. Wal-Mart recently warned its sales this year are likely to be flat, down from projection of as much as 2% growth, and cut its earnings forecast for next year as it raises wages.\n\n&gt;And truckload carriers have warned that they aren't witnessing the usual uptick in retailer demand as the holiday season approaches, thanks to stubbornly high inventories, said Alex Vecchio, a transportation analyst at Morgan Stanley. \"Transportation companies are typically a leading indicator, and our data is not good,\" Mr. Vecchio said.\n\nhttp://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-companies-warn-of-slowing-economy-20151025-00043","name":"t1_cwdg3pi","subreddit":"economy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhpn","created_utc":"2015-10-26 16:45:04","week":44}

There's no savings if I can't eat it before it expires.

{"id":"cwdphy0","author":"jhuckins","body":"**Server\\Systems\\IT Side**\n\nIn terms of the technical logistics, you can google a few guides on how to get a minecraft server set up on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for near-zero\\zero cost. Depending on the size you may be able to live with a \"micro\" server, or scale up to something costing you a non-zero amount of money per month. If your friend truly plans to do this long term, I'd suggest starting there as it has a lot of quick start guides and will let them know what they are in for in terms of being a server owner\\admin.\n\n**Business Side**\n\nFor ease of example, let's assume you are starting with essentially a near 0 cost server (AWS, probably no more than 5-10 people depending on server options) - you still have to answer a couple questions:\n\n1) Who are you going to target? Friends? Do you have 10 friends\\family members\\etc who would pay you $1\\month to play on your hosted minecraft server? \n\n2) How much is your time worth? Even with \"free\" servers, the above example gets you $10\\month, or $120\\year. You'll spend ~40 hours just tinkering with the initial server setup, I doubt you want to make $3\\hour.\n\n3) How are you going to grow your business? AWS can scale for you at a cost that works, but how are you going to grow from 10 friends to 100 strangers?\n\n4) What is going to differentiate your server\\product from the other 100s out there? Does your friend know enough about minecraft? Have they played on other paid servers? Have they played on other free servers?\n\n5) Lots, lots more.\n\nI wouldn't jump into Monetizing this as step 1. For me step 1 would be \"Can I build a server that is fun for me to play minecraft on?\" and then I would go from there. If your friend has some \"free\" labor to pull from (particularly on the admin\\server side) then it's a different question.","name":"t1_cwdphy0","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-26 20:32:53","week":44}

{"id":"cwdrwh3","author":"soadorable","body":"You seem to live pretty closely to how I live budget wise. For food, $400 is more than reasonable when you cook in bulk and plan head. You can check out /r/eatcheapandhealthy for some ideas.\n\nJust from what you've posted, I don't think its your rent that is killing you, I think it's your \"fun\" money. $75 each per week is $600 per month. That is nearly 2/3 of your rent. If you take it down to $50 per week each, you are doubling what you have left over at the end of the month. \n\nHere are some things I did when I was struggling with my finances:\n\nYou may have done it already but take a look at your cable/internet/phone bill and see what you can cut. How about any other subscription services? $10 here and there add up quickly and after some time you will find that you are better off without a lot of things. (I should say here that I would not expect anyone to do away with their phone or internet services but if you really need too there are cheaper options out there)\n\nYou said that you reevaluated your car insurance but one negotiating tool I always like to throw out there is that you can negotiate your rate with the number of miles you drive per year. If you don't drive much your insurance company will lower your rate according to how much you drive.\n\nWhen I was in college I had to really crack down on myself and go through a financial overhaul. One thing I did to make it more enjoyable is to create games out of it or little mini challenges. Tuesdays and Thursdays are 'No Spend Days\"- no money is to be spent whatsoever. Friday is \"Extra Savings Deposit Day\"- it doesn't matter how much it is but every Friday I have to deposit extra money into my savings account.\n\nI did (and still do) everything I can to generate more income. \n-I started cleaning houses in college and 8 years later I still maintain one client; this provides a couple hundred dollars extra to my budget and only costs me 6 hours of my time each month. \n-I use Amazon's mTurk program to generate a bit of spending money also. This is pretty time consuming and doesn't yield a whole lot of extra income but I can do it while I watch TV and with the little time I actually put in anymore, it generates enough for me to buy a book or two per month on Amazon. \n-My biggest money maker when I was in school was my weekly yard sale. I would walk around the town daily and pick things up in free piles, college kids leave great things in free piles (dishes, cookware, bed frames, nightstands, dressers, pet items, etc.), then I would have a yard sale that weekend with the item I found or I would sell them on Craigslist. I was making $200 a week just doing this. I still do this to an extent when I find good items; recently I found a Christmas tree stand that is going for over $100 on ebay.\n\nAnyways: My entire point is that I've always found that the money is out there, you just have to be resourceful and it will come to you.\n\n","name":"t1_cwdrwh3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-26 21:30:58","week":44}

{"id":"cwdtst3","author":"BeeRando","body":"I've used GCX for quite a while now, and I'm always happy to get other people join. IMO I think it's the best place to trade GC's on the internet, if you know what you're doing.\n\nFirst off,  if you want your chances of getting scammed drastically lowered, only trade with confirmed traders or higher.\n\nThat being said, GCX has had trouble for a while now getting peoples flair upgraded and there are plenty of beginners that by all rights should be confirmed traders, so don't automatically blow a beginner off.\n\nSome tips for not getting scammed:\n\n1 - ALWAYS make sure the person you trading with has commented on your thread and check the Universal Scammer List to see if they have been banned on other subreddits.\n\nYou are required to comment on the trade offer thread before you PM, if they don't they are probably trying to scam you. NEVER TRADE WITH ANYONE THAT REFUSES/DODGES TO MAKE A COMMENT. Make sure you click the thread itself to confirm the comment is there, sometimes people will send to 2 PM's with one made to look like they commented.\n\n2 - Be very wary of impersonators, they will piggyback off of the reputation of legit traders by making a slight change in their name (e.g. Firmino11 could be Firminoll) and they will sometimes PM you in a short time after a legit trader comments on your offer so you hopefully send them the codes by mistake.\n\n3 - Look at their GCX Rep profile. Check to see if they have previous trades (the more the better), and who they've traded with - a bunch of trades with new accounts could be a sign of feedback padding.\n\n4 -  Look at their user profile. If they are only posting on main subreddits and use 1 line comments that don't really add anything to the conversation, they could be trying to spoof being an active redditor. Also, check to see if they have rep on other trading subs.\n\n5 - When receiving funds always check them directly on your online wallet. Scammers will sometimes fake a Paypal email saying you've received funds when you actually haven't. \n\nSide note about Paypal - If the funds are there check to see if they have been sent as friends and family, if it hasn't and they didn't tell you, they  could file a dispute with Paypal and they WILL get their money back, leaving you with nothing.\n\n6 - Avoid offers that are too good to be true, e.g. they're selling Amazon at 50% or buying it for 1:1. Of course sometimes they're are actually legit offers like this, albeit very rarely, but it's best just to pass over them.\n\n7 - You don't have to trade if you feel like the other person is sketchy, tell them you don't feel comfortable trading with them. Always report suspicious behavior to the mods.\n\n\nAlways double or triple check every step, and you should be fine.\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cwdtst3","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-10-26 22:17:59","week":44}

{"id":"cwe18zl","author":"regressiveparty","body":"Legality:\n\nEveryone else in here is correct, you technically don't have to do anything. Not every business has to be registered as such. I believe its an income requirement. If you wanted to get yourself more legal protection and you were planning for this to be much larger, consider becoming an LLC. You can register all of this online for like $150, without doing anything other than filling out forms. Just google \"LLC registration\" + your state. There are a million services. You can register in your state for convenience or in a standard state like Delaware. If you do that you need a \"Registered agent\" service. Usually those are offered with the packages for incorporation.\n\nGrowth:\n\nHobby businesses are fun, but you definitely want to make sure you have a sizeable volume of sales before you quit your day jobs. I think the best way to start out is to take advantage of already existing platforms for marketing. Etsy.com is great for crafts, just make sure to educate yourself about what works and what doesn't. eBay still works for selling as well as Craigslist. You can look into softwares that will help you post onto Craigslist and manage them. Craiglist is probably the best ROI option in my opinion. \n\nEventually, once you get your feet on solid ground I would suggest upgrading by creating your own page, preferrably a landing page (consists of only one page of information). You can do this for free pretty easily on Squarespace.com, and if you go the landing page route my favorite is Landerapp.com (its also the cheapest). When you get that up you can start experimenting with paid advertising. Google adwords, FB sponsored posts, etc.\n\nIn the long term, if you really do start making your stuff (and its not handmade) then you can think about getting on Amazon, and eventually the Amazon FBA program.\n\nTake it slow.

{"id":"cweqxny","author":"gunsashands","body":"If you sell them through Amazon FBA, you can send in all your inventory. You can have Amazon fulfill the eBay orders for you. \nWhat I do when I'm selling multiples on both venues is leave some units for the Amazon listing and then create a multi-channel fulfillment order to temporarily reserve some stock for eBay. They allow you to save that order for up to 2 weeks. You can cancel it whenever you want or edit it to ship a unit to the customer. It expires if you don't ship it, and those units are released back to your Amazon stock. You can create a new order to reserve the stock again for eBay. There are softwares and sites that offer to sync your listings across different venues, but if it's just a couple of items, it's cheaper to manage it yourself.\n\nHopefully I explained it in a way that makes sense. Basically, you can create a fake order on Amazon to reserve your eBay inventory.\n\nBy the way, a user pointed out that there are toy restrictions on Amazon for the holidays. As far as I know, this only applies to merchant fulfilled orders, so you should still be able to use Amazon FBA.\n","name":"t1_cweqxny","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-27 17:41:06","week":44}

{"id":"cwerian","author":"BigSpooky","body":"where's the other 2/3 of the market cap value to be found?\n\nIn the retail business.  For example one well known firm with an $800 target puts a .8x GMV (gross merch. value) multiple on 2017 sales of $326B for 260B and uses 16x ebitda on AWS to get to $97B + 30B net cash.  Thats $90B north of current valuation.  The 16x for AWS seems reasonable to me - the moats there are deep - this is not godaddy.  WMT is at .5x GMV with all their issues the .8x does not seem outlandish given the scalability of AMZN retail.  \n\nAlso it seems a bit unfair to look at the capital-sensitivity of AMZN relative to completely different business models, let alone businesses that are publicly regulated.  WMT has latest Q @ $186B of PPE generating revs of 485B, is AMZN doing 100B of revs on 20B really all that bad?   Oh and redcards also seems to be overlooking substantial differences in capital structure with *DUK $50B market cap and ED $19B market cap* - leaving out that DUK also has $42B in debt and ED has about 14, ie both of them are equal parts debt/equity.  AMZN at 281/9 is about 3% debt.\n\nI have no position in the stock and lean towards \"its overpriced\", genuinely interested to see where the above logic is wrong.  I'm just think traditional retail may be the proverbial melting ice cube value trap where it looks cheap because the fundamental drivers of the business have changed.  As long as AMZN shareholders are willing to subsidize future growth today (as they have been more or less for the last 20 years) I don't see the real mystery in current valuations.","name":"t1_cwerian","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-27 17:54:27","week":44}

You need to start looking into other industries and see what you can bring to your online store that differentiates you from your competitors- not just the ingredients. For instance, the likes of Ella's Kitchen revolutionised the baby food market because they stopped speaking to the parents and called it the red one appealing to the toddlers. Is this not something you could consider and making it more appealing to what the fish needs rather then just picking up an ordinary pack of fish food they can get anywhere.\n\nSecondly, your website has ALOT of white space I am a big believer of minimal design but there are ways to go about it. Have you tried creating a header the full width of the page and the little picture at the bottom needs to be a banner and not a random little picture. \n\nOnce this is done you can focus on your traffic there are communities for everything nowadays you need to embed yourself in them and talk to them why your fish food will spread magic in their fish tank. Consider getting shout outs on Instagram pages or even check out Pinterest to see if there are any niche boards people can pin your product to. (BTW your Pinterest link goes to the Shopify one) \n\nIf you are going to have social media links then you should be active on them for instance your Instagram you can make this beautiful and visually appealing and attract fish lovers or even people that like pretty pictures but one day may just purchase from you. \n\nFinally, have you integrated with other platforms such as Ebay and Amazon?","name":"t1_cwf1jb6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-27 21:43:42","week":44}

We are planning our 20th anniversary trip to Hawaii. We never had a honeymoon, and haven't had a trip out of the states ever. Personally, I want to go to Europe, but she wants to go to Hawaii, so I'm gonna get lei'd :D  \n\nThis year the wife and I have opened the following rewards cards: \n \n*  Citi AAdvantage (30k AA miles, with some paid travel, banking miles for trip)\n*  Citi AAdvantage Business (50k AA miles, banking miles for trip) \n*  Chase Freedom x 2 (23k, we love the UR points for everyday use, and 5% categories). We both opened Chase Amazon cards in October 2014, but closed those cards this year in order to get a larger CL on the Freedom cards. \n*  Cap 1 Quicksilver (was low on the pecking order in first AoR, but approved, and have a few bills on autopay)\n*  Discover IT (Transferred balance from one of our first cards we opened in 2012 that had a high interest rate)\n*  Amex SPG x 2 (83k Banking SPG points for trip)  \n*  Amex HHonors (43k, was in 1st AoR to get Hilton points, prior to SPG offer 2 months ago)\n\nThe wife took the signs of getting approved for the larger bank cards as being a \"thumbs up\" to go ahead and apply for some store charge cards, i.e. Home Depot, Lowe's, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, Kohl's, Maurice's, and a couple more. She made me an AU on these cards, and it does help with the available credit having some other lines of credit open. However, when I applied for the CSP, and Ink+, Recon said I had recently opened too many lines of credit. They wanted to see how I handled the lines that I currently had, and to consider applying at a later date, therefore I plan to apply next summer. Would it be prudent to close the store cards so there's not so many lines of credit? I'm of the opinion that it's to leave them in the safe where they're at right now.\n\nWith that being said, I'm trying to figure out the best way to get the maximum points available for lodging so we don't have as much out-of-pocket expense for accommodation, as well as better seating on the flights (I'm 6'4\"). Would it be better to build up the UR points on both Chase cards, SPG points or HHonors points? Would VGC's be the best way to obtain this goal? \n\nEdit: removed duplicate wording","name":"t1_cwf3wgy","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-10-27 22:38:45","week":44}

{"id":"cwfvgx6","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"None of us can predict the future. Apple may not have the growth ahead of it that it once had (and law of large numbers blah blah blah), but at a 13.5 p/e, the stock is quite reasonable. Still, I think it Apple has the means to evolve, it becomes whether they will or will do so fast enough to satisfy investors. In the meantime while Apple is very reliant upon one product and there's no real well-defined new \"thing\" on the horizon (car yes, but details are minimal at best and that is probably 3-4 years out), the valuation will probably stay in this neighborhood.\n\nAmazon is incredibly expensive fundamentally, but it's a mentality of build and build and build and probably once you've become a dominant force, the building/expenses halt or decline and the prices go up. Still, at 800+ p/e, it feels like a very bad case of FOMO (fear of missing out.)\n\nI like Google just fine, but I think for me it's more the idea of what Google may evolve into 5-10 years from now.\n\nSo, Apple's a good value but I think people's expectations for the near-to-mid term may be unrealistic unless something considerable happens - Apple makes a major purchase.\n\nI think Amazon is becoming an increasingly dominant force in retail, but I'd be a customer not an investor. Google is fine for the longer-term and I think they'll be less reliant on search/ad revenue over time.","name":"t1_cwfvgx6","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-28 15:15:34","week":44}

{"id":"cwg33zx","author":"PM_ME_YOUR_RATTIES","body":"There are a lot of good suggestions, especially around graduate housing through the university and around fun money. Overall, your housing budget seems OK relative to what you earn, so maybe there's some other fat that can be trimmed. If you post a full budget, people can likely help a bit more with some recommendations as well.\n\nRegarding the \"fun money\" category, cutting that to ~$300 total/month (instead of the current $600) is definitely doable. Some key areas that will make that possible:\n\n*Good wine can be had in box form these days, usually for around $5/bottle equivalent. Bota box is a great option for this- ~$20-25/box, depending on your area, and you can get a ton of tasty options. Since each box is 4 bottles, that covers a reasonable amount of wine consumption over a month with 1-2 boxes- and it doesn't get stale, so you can actually do a single glass without feeling like you need to finish a bottle. Maybe get a red and a white, then work your way through a couple different varieties until you find ones you really like. I will admit to being partial to their Riesling, but it can be tough to find.\n\n*Free events. You're in a college town, there are free (or &lt;$5 cover) events you can go to. In nice months, doing a picnic (all homemade) and bringing wine (see above) can be a great way to relax with some friends on a weekend. \n\n*Friends places vs. going out. You can also suggest to friends that you rotate through each of your places (or focus more on someone's place that is set up for it better) and eat cheap, but tasty, with home cooked meals and inexpensive drinks. Games like [Cards Against Humanity](http://smile.amazon.com/Cards-Against-Humanity-LLC-CAHUS/dp/B004S8F7QM/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446052488&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cards+against+humanity), [Ticket to Ride](http://smile.amazon.com/Days-of-Wonder-DOW-7201/dp/0975277324/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446052535&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ticket+to+ride), [Telestrations](http://smile.amazon.com/Telestrations-8-Player-The-Original/dp/B001SN8GF4/ref=pd_sim_21_1?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=61sTRg%2BjCdL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&amp;refRID=09Q2TWZ97TTNTHQGZ625) (or [Telestrations: After Dark](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V42YPKO?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_6&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) for some very dirty humor), or [Settlers of Catan](http://smile.amazon.com/Mayfair-Games-MFG-3071-Edition/dp/B00U26V4VQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446052701&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=settlers+of+catan) are all great group games (and those Amazon links are just for reference; you may be able to find them cheaper); if you budget buying one game a month for 3-4 months you can have a solid set you can pull out when people are over. If your friends do the same, you can all get different games up front, figure out what you like, and get more of that type (you may also be able to find a local game shop that hosts a game night to try various ones out; that's a great way to figure out how good a game is without taking the $30-$50 plunge up front, and you may make some new friends there as well). That's a lot cheaper than going to a bar, even just once a month, since I can buy a six pack for the price of 1-2 beers when I'm out, plus you get to hear each other more easily for the conversations you have (beyond the game itself). Note: single friends may not be willing to give up their bar nights, since that's how they meet people. Couples tend to be more open to this, though a lot of single folks are willing to do something like this on a Friday, then go out to bars on a Saturday (or vice versa) with another group of people.\n\nHope this helps some.\n\nNinja Edited for formatting issues.","name":"t1_cwg33zx","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-28 18:21:17","week":44}

The place to be for investors world wide is the USA. American equities for the sensible and American bonds for those more nervous. There's no better place to park money than the U.S. That said, when we finally see the U.S. new housing construction take off (it's still priming its engines), then inflation here in the U.S. would begin, but even that would have a 6-18 month lag. So, the Feds will raise the rates probably the least possible in December, but not to stave off inflation, but to do what really needs to be done as the rates are just too ridiculous. The Feds may (questionable) do it only one more time next year, but until there's a boom in housing, there will be no real inflation. The low energy (specifically gasoline) prices will pump some healthy inflationary pressure into the economy, but not enough in the short term.","name":"t1_cwgcj51","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-28 21:57:19","week":44}

I personally believe FB is a huge growth stock for the following reasons: \n\nInstagram - Has only just recently been opened up to all advertisers using Facebook's self serv ad platform. This will be HUGE. Instagram is growing on a daily basis and has tons of traffic.. more ad revenues to an already increasing bottom line for facebook.\n\nWhatsApp - This is a great app with a lot of users. now charging 99c per year but eventually there is a lot that can be done with the app and user base.\n\nOculus Rift VR - Facebook really hit it with this purchase. Think about all the advertising potential when you are viewing your newsfeed on an oculus device.. the technology is in it's infancy on the consumer side so think 5+ years from now how great this tech can be utilized.. social aspect etc.\n\nThese are just some reasons why i think FB is my generations google when it comes to a stock you can get in on now and profit on later... this isn't just a website or a social network, once Sandberg came in she really turned this into a machine... a solid company that owns and creates technology and data along with great advertising placements that continue to generate revenues at a rate  beating estimates on a quarter by quarter basis...\n\nHow do they always find ways to raise their revenues and beat estimates? They are CONSTANTLY Coming up with new ad placements and pricing models.

{"id":"cwi5mzc","author":"Quazijoe","body":"I'm so glad to see the advice I've seen here.\n\nAs a teacher who has many students who leave their work to attend school full time, I can definetly say, the students who can afford to do so, have income and stability that makes that possible. \n\nIf the only way you can achieve that is with this job, you aren't ready to go full time. \n\nAnd Hard lesson. In an ideal world yes, you should leave that job and find a career better suited to you. But your lifestyle and goals right now don't support the plan your trying to cobble together. You need to start thinking strategically. \n\nIf you do not see your future with this company, and the only way to achieve your goals in life are to leave it and go to college, then thats fine. You are not ready to do that yet, but you can work towards that. \n\n1. Saving mode. You are now going to scrimp and save every penny, cut back on bills, go out for dinner less, scrounge for every penny you can so you can build up that nest egg.\n2. Pay off that debt now. As much as possible, as fast as you can. Quitting your job, and having large debt are not compatible.\n3. Can you achieve some of your college goals while with a company that will support you doing that. You are so incredibly lucky to have a company cover any part of it, use that. night courses, weekends, online classes. Get those courses done while you are with the company.\n\nNow as for the problems at work. If your coworkers are the issue, and your company is large enough and complex enough to have such thorough policies, you must have an HR department. I'm willing to put money on that. Have you used it. A few anonymous reports of unprofessional behaviour, complaints of making work intolerable and increasing employee turnover for valuable human capital and HR will be all over that shit. \n\nRegarding the complaints about the type of work and the overtime. That I can't really fix. I fight for overtime, because that's how you increase your savings drastically. If you want to be that guy that wants to get rid of it, consider making suggestions to your boss about how to make the work easier or more efficient with the aim of reducing your overtime if possible. Your co workers will hate you, but whoever looks after the budget will love you as that's usually where their bonuses are determined. Scheduling changes, hiring on part time staff, bringing in paid interns from colleges would all be great ways to reduce your workload and save the company money. \n\nIf the work is still unfullfiling, well thats the way it is. Your Job Right now is a means to an end, and your focus should be on that nest egg.\n\nMoney is afterall just a quantitative way of measuring your options. The More money you have, the more options you get. Your working so future you can have more options, look at it like that. Make some minigoals to predict how much you can save every month and try to maximise that to see how you achieve more. With your level of income, and some savings, within a year you could definetly wipe out that debt and have money to spare. \n\n\n**Areas of savings:** \n\nDoes your school not have a gym? Usually you pay for access to the facilities with tuition. Check. That could be an area of savings. \n\n**Your loans:** \n\nIf you aren't being charged interest for your student loans, That is a key one to be paying off. Thats the golden time. \n\nOtherwise I would prioritise whichever loan has the highest interest rate and pay that off first. Credit card first, then whatever the stupid one was, and I would assume car. \n\n\n**Your Expenses:**\n\nFrankly, your budget that you have given us does not look anywhere near complete. Especially if you have a dog, are single, and \"try not to go out\". With a 40000-50000 level of income and living pay cheque to pay cheque... \n\nYou should have 11000 every year after all expenses. What are you spending that on? Be honest with yourself and see if thats necessary. Amazon, itunes, I haven't seen mention your cell phone bill. Are you going to starbucks a lot? Smoke, beer, other recreational activities you can cut back on?\n\nEither you aren't telling us about some expenses you do have, or you don't have a clear understanding of your spending. \n\n**Homework:**\n\nGet a tracking system in place. I recommend Mint.com. It hooks up to your online bank accounts and credit card, and it will automatically figure out your history as you do your thing. Give it 3 months tracking you and you will know precisely what your budget looks like month to month. \n\nYour first goal is to save up 6 paycheques worth of money in your bank account and not touch it. Why 6, because that is more than enough to get you to stop living paycheque to paycheque, and give you some freedom to think clearly. \n\nSecond is to not allow that amount to reduce, it should only grow.\n\n","name":"t1_cwi5mzc","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-30 08:44:45","week":44}

{"id":"cwid8om","author":"RandPaulsBrilloBalls","body":"&gt;  Surely there's some glimmer of hope for this company??\n\nYup.  When it dips low enough, Musk will hold a press release about using compu-global-hyper-mega-rocket-tubes to turn the moon into a giant solar farm or some other similar scheme.  Fanboys will prop the stock back up.\n\nReally, there are 3 types of primarily residential solar companies in the US.  There is Solar City, which does leasing exclusively.  Then there are smaller interstate companies like Real Goods Solar [NYSE--RGSE, also taking a hit today], who sell panels and dabble in commercial applications.  Then there are the real local contractor guys.  They don't leave their state.  They are teams of roofers and carpenters and electricians.  There are lots of these little companies.\n\nResidential solar might become their main line of business for a while.  But if you need your house re-wired or your roof re-shingled, they're on that too.  Basically, the same guys who would build an addition on your house or install a diesel generator in your basement will come and throw some solar panels on your roof.\n\nThese small contractor groups have a couple of advantages.  \n\nFirstly, they have no investors.  They generally keep little to no stock.  They simply order panels as demanded with customers' money then install them.  \n\nSecondly, they are not solely reliant on solar panels and they never keep ownership themselves.  The tax credit can disappear, and it will affect payback time for homeowners, but these installers never touch the credit or any of the incentives, so for them it doesn't matter.  And if demand drops because incentives change, they can simply go back to advertising new roofs or additions or something more than solar.\n\nThirdly, the best incentives are in blue states, and these small groups can be union shops and hire union labor.  Might not seem like much, but the IBEW has a lot of sway in Massachusetts (my state), for example.  They have local friends, they know the local building inspectors, they know the legislature, etc.  They don't want competition from some out-of-state giant company that pays its workers half of what union wages are.  And they'll make life difficult as they can because of it.  \n\n[SolarCity proudly states that its employees aren't represented by any union.](http://investors.solarcity.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1193125-13-129655&amp;cik=)  But [they're mostly in states where unions are popular.](http://www.solarcity.com/sites/default/files/solarcity-map-states-light.png)  And [IBEW will fight them for work every time.](http://www.ibew.org/articles/14daily/1404/140422_solar.htm)  \n\nUsually the line goes like this: \"Yeah, you *could* go with the big flashy company.  They're cheaper, but you're going to get what you pay for.  That means some 20 year old kid who's not a master electrician who might wire things dangerously and who will install a less efficient system.  Give it to me, I've got 20 years experience and I'm a certified master, I'll put top-notch stuff in, upgrade your electrical, get you a higher-quality system, and make it last longer and be more efficient.\"\n\nI'm sure it's actually all safe either way, but you see how it goes.  It's a new player in the buildings and trades market coming in to local markets that are already saturated with guys on the ground who have more skills and experience at doing this kind of stuff and who know the neighborhoods and the politics better.  \n\nThe other thing about any growth stock is you need the stomach for risk.  By the time you've heard of it, it's probably to late to get the great gains, unless you're really ahead of the curve watching every IPO.  Even then, VC already took their cut, and the great gains might be done.  Dividend stocks are far safer.  Might be boring.  But it means BMW, not Tesla; Hannon-Armstrong, not SolarCity; Walmart, not Amazon.  Now, in the Amazon case, it seems to work, at least for now.  \n\nIf you want risk and you want to play very hyped growth brands, I'd suggest playing long straddles and long strangles with options.  That way there, any crazy 20% movement, up or down, and you cash out.  This is very risky, and probably very unpopular in /r/investing, and they will probably remind you that (so far) AMZN has proven to be a very profitable investment, so YMMV.\n\nDon't sell so low...not on a 20% drop day.  I wouldn't.  There should be a bounce somewhere.  But as a long term hold, I think it's risky, unless a lot goes right in Congress.  If you really think there's long term value there, and you think that Buffalo plant's really going to change the game, then maybe today's the day to buy in more. \n\nTL;DR - Panic selling is typically bad.  Think about what attracted you to the company in the first place and look into how you imagine they might turn things around...","name":"t1_cwid8om","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-30 15:22:41","week":44}

AMZN might be worth 100x (dubious) cashflow when the Italians are selling 2yr debt at negative rates, but at even 1% rates my suspicion is it becomes a lot less attractive.

Obviously there are classes where you can't go without (math classes come to mind) but I would put the number somewhere between 15 and 25% of classes where I either didn't buy or didn't open a text book for a course. Just finished up 6 years of school in May, 3 years to finish a BS and another 3 for my MS, both in engineering. Averaged 3.5 GPA for both so its not like I was just skipping everything having to do with the text book and scraping by. One other piece of advice is to sell any books you know you won't need as soon as possible. I hung on to a lot of mine and when I did decide to sell them new editions had been released and they weren't worth shit.\n\nEdit: By sell I don't mean to the bookstore on campus, they'll pay you pennies on the dollar for what you paid. Just list them used on Amazon and you can probably recoup 90% of the cost.

{"id":"cwihsl2","author":"shazoocow","body":"The retained value metric actually assumes a 90% renewal rate, but even then it's actually not that huge a deal. Let's take your 100% assumption since it's easy and conservative. Calculate the NPV of 20 years worth of cashflows at a 6% discount and then compare it to the NPV of 30 years of cashflows at a 6% rate.\n\nThe 10 extra years of cash flows add 20% to RV vs. the 0 renewals scenario.\n\nDo it again assuming 2.9% annual growth in the cashflows. Now the added RV is about 32%.\n\nDiscount the computed value of the retained earnings to factor in a reduced renewal rate if you think it's appropriate. The company reported 4.4B RV this Q. Factoring in zero renewals and subtracting $1.1B in net debt and you get 2.24B net retained value. I think the real number would be somewhere between that and SolarCity's communicated value. At a $2.79B market cap, SolarCity's trading for not much more than just a (more realistic) valuation of its future cash flows.\n\nBTW, SolarCity actually delivers breakouts for each separate part of the RV calculation: Initial contracts, renewals and MyPower. You can be as aggressive or conservative as you like in using them.\n\nThe principle of defaults is an interesting one. SolarCity isn't leasing customers solar panels, per se, and it's not just chucking panels on anyone's roof. It's actually selling people guaranteed prices on power that, including the cost of the panels, are lower than their utility's rates. Customers who default have the option to pay more elsewhere or have no electricity - the alternatives aren't really options for most people except those in all but the most dire of circumstances. Also, those people are likely to exit default at some period in time because, you know, no electricity. Considering that SolarCity's customers have FICO scores &gt; 750 on average defaults are likely to be pretty low. SolarCity experienced *cumulative* net losses of 0.7% over the past 4 years. Pretty damned low.\n\nThe conference call and quarter's numbers make it pretty clear that the cost of sales is what's really hitting the bottom line here and that management can trim that back. Incidentally, I have a sneaking suspicion they sandbagged next year's growth estimates. Assuming that SolarCity can/does execute on the plan to trim costs (and growth), I think people may be surprised by how suddenly they can reverse their negative earnings.\n\nI'd say that this is a sort of Amazon scenario. I think that SolarCity has a very bright future ahead of it with a very large addressable market for both commercial and residential, and that the principles and numbers fundamentally make sense. I went ahead and bought more, plus added to my 2018 synthetic longs.","name":"t1_cwihsl2","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-30 17:21:57","week":44}

The data presented so far says your end holds the key.  \n\n\n\n\nUnder what listing are you selling that item?  \n\nDoes what you are selling match 100% in all ways with what you are listing it on?  So same color and number of controllers, all cords and where they came from (3rd party/original) etc.  \n\nHave you fully plugged in tested, played at least one game and connected to internet any non-new systems?\n\nWhat is the listed reason given for the return?  Obviously liars aren't going be honestly more than likely, but we do know that most returns are legit and not fraud so it's worth checking out for a common theme.\n\nYou're aware that buyers do not need to read condition notes and that you cannot use that field for things like \"This is for video console only, no cords or other items\" (Unless the ASIN is for ONLY a system nothing more.) If you are doing that I would expect high returns \n\n\n\n\n\"Hey everybody, I had this incredibly rare and unique situation happen to me, Im going to give you one side only, treat it like a legitimate and serious issues that totally makes it reasonable for me to give the advice to not sell a huge chunk of the video game category.  \n\nNevermind that if it were unprofitable that you wouldn't have many people selling on there, but there is neither here nor there.  I'm also not at all convinced that it was \"hell\" trying to get a refund when you recorded serial numbers and had them on the original listing.  I also take the further step of including the serial in the condition and state that returns will be accepted for the same serial number only.  Since you are protected by amazon against any returns sent in a different condition from how you sent them, you can inoculate yourself against this stuff by simply recording the serial number in the listing, make sure you include the photos for the item (yes, extra work...but worth it) as well as any other unique blemishes or other information.  This prevents a bait and switch.  Works for both Amazon and Ebay.  I would also highly recommend doing FBA.  \n\nSecond, the process for winning a case like this is simply explaining that the listing included the following photos (attach photos), the listing itself stated the following (copy that over, including the serial number verbiage), and what you got back was this (attach photos and serial number of what was returned).d\n\nLet them know as per Amazon policy you are filing for reimbursement for your item (if you are FBA).  If it was third party fulfillment then you can deny refunding and cite the same information.  Then open a case and report the buyer for a fraudulent return. \n\nWhole process once you know how to do it takes &lt;10 minutes normally as long as you have all your stuff organized.  \n\nLast....FBA!  \n\n","name":"t1_cwiw0b5","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-30 23:29:34","week":44}

{"id":"cwix5oj","author":"jrossetti","body":"What's the difference between knowing what you sent Amazon or what you sent the customer?  This doesn't make sense.  Who care's what happens to your shit once it's inbound scanned by UPS.  \n\nHere's the joy of FBA.\n\nThey Lose the item get paid, broken item get paid, customer damaged return, get paid,never go to the post office, never deal with a customer return email, never have to worry about storage, something happening to the items at your house, or ANY of the other issues that anyone has brought up in this thread so far.  Exactly 0 listed reasons are legitimate reasons to avoid FBA. \n\nThere is almost NO business case to be made about it either.  FBA items on average WILL always sell faster than non FBA for.  FBA costs include the box, wrap, pack, ship, customer service, ,INSURANCE FOR LOST/STOLEN/DAMAGED/CUSTOMER DAMAGED/customer returns not in identical condition, and make your items Prime Eligible.  \n\nEven better, it all works with you never having to go to the post office again.  Now take all the hours related to handling those functions and SOURCE.  Hit up an extra thrift shop, spend another hour in Target trying to scan and source.  Do research, find more places to visit, or pick up a few hours at work and use that money to do those functions.  All of those are better business decisions than fulfilling your own stuff for the reasons given in this thread by other anti-FBA folks.  :P  \n\nThe only reason I can think of that people say things like this is they simply dont' understand FBA.  So hopefully this is eye opening.   They've lost two entire shipments I sent in to the warehouse.  I don't even know how that is possible, but let's face it.  If you mail enough items, eventually something happens, and when it does, FBA pays you for them.  It was as if a customer bought an entire inbound shipment.  Sure, I had to wait a month and a half before  could reconcile it, but let's be real. I would have sold some of those items, but probably not all so why not!  It's how much id have gotten if I sold it myself anyway.  There's simply no negative's to me for this.   \n\nI ship at least 100 unique items to Amazon per week minimum.  Ive been reimbursed as high at 800 bucks in a single month before.  Hell, you can practically count on them losing a few of any item you ship a lot of.  I got some little computer pet type things similar to bean babies and some avery labels for a song at a thrift. In the last 3 months they have lost 8 of the 200 or so animals I sent in, which was enough to break even on all 200 without having actually sold one to a real person yet.  The labels, they lost 22 on a shipment and another 4 were warehouse damaged and that too was enough to break even.  \n\nThe best way I can try to explain why it's so awesome is you are taking all the areas that shrinkage occur and passing the risk to Amazon so when it happens (when, because it happens to everyone) it's like the item sold instead of you losing the item and money used on it. \n\nPlus if you're like me in Chicago, fuck mailing shit in winter.  Hell, fuck mailing shit anyway.  So time consuming and frustrating. \n\nI'd be genuinely interested in knowing what the customer return reasons for those items are.  If you would like the help that is.  I love analyzing business data like this to identify issues.  I'd hate to think someone could have THAT bad of luck and want to reiterate that it's not normal, and you shouldn't give up video consoles :P","name":"t1_cwix5oj","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-31 00:05:00","week":44}

{"id":"cwjhm22","author":"jrossetti","body":"I mean this as respectfully as possible, but you don't seem to understand how Amazon works at all as it relates to this subject matter.  I'll try to elaborate even more for you.  I consider it a win every time I convert one of you folks :P  This should be an easy sell!  I'm salivating at the thought of having items that sell for that much =) \n\nThe math is still good dude.  The fees for selling are identical.  I'm not sure why you think it's different, but it's not. FBA and MF fees for selling are the exact same number.   \n\nEven at 3.77 for a 500 item, its still about a year of storage which is longer than your stated shelf life of items, and that's assuming they wont sell faster which is a terrible assumption because it's practically guaranteed to sell faster. This is hardly a required point for my argument though.  You can remove the 3.77 and still come out ahead.  \n\nI'll explain the fees in a moment too because you need to see the math and its apparent you haven't done it. (Understandable, it can be daunting)  Allow me since this is my bread and butter.  We all gotta learn sometime :P I can prove you're spending more money than an FBA before factoring in anything beyond your shipping costs.  Everything else is just gravy on the mashed potatoes.  \n\n\n\nPlease note that Amazon has selling fees which apply to all sellers fba and merchant both, and are the same.  \n\nFulfillment by amazon is an entirely different set of fees. So for the rest of this post I will try to clarify that \"fees\" does not mean everything combined, we have to differentiate or it wont make as much sense. \n\n\nThe pick and pack FBA fees are ridiculously low.  1.04 cents per item, then .50 per pound.  You pay the same fees for the actual SELLING of the item either way.  The fulfillment fees do not scale based on the sale of the item, the selling fees do though.    Your fees for selling, are the same fees that I pay for selling.  The only difference is in the additional fulfillment fees and there's literally and factually a zero percent chance of you beating their prices, even if you had to pay that fee.  This is not an issue for expensive items.  \n\nHere is the breakdown for the fees we BOTH pay.  Mf vs FBA\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161240\n\nThis is then the listing of the fees that you pay for fulfilling by Amazon.  I sell MF Items too, and one thing I can tell you for absolute certainty is it's cheaper for me to mail a shipment in via fba and let them mail it than it is for me to purchase via post office and do any work fulfilling it myself.  \n\nI don't know your items exactly, so I am going to use a PS4 for the compare and I've attached a photo for you.  http://imgur.com/DNci9ld\n\nYou will have to adjust based on your item, but you can do that yourself.  I am going to assume that you are able to get a 1% increase in your item price due to being a Prime item with guaranteed 2 day delivery as youre now offering a better service.  So that is $505.  (You can always charge a bit more for a prime item as long as only MF folks are below you in price.)\n\nYou're going to insure it for 3.77.  You're going to mail priority more than likely. We're talking a large flat rate box approximately, so $17.90 minus whatever discount you might get.   For the sake of argument, I'll pretend you have a 50% off coupon so your mailing fee is only 9 bucks well call it.  This will cover me when you come up with some other mailing service that might be cheaper.  \n\n$9 + 3.77 is 12.77 which is STILL higher than the cost you'd pay on FBA.  Now you still have to provide all the materials, labor, and time.  The math doesn't lie.  In fact, our test item would have to not sell for over a year before the storage fees would get to the same price and we'd need to factor that in to be accurate.  \n\nPretty much ANYTHING you can sell as MF, you can sell faster as FBA.  ANYTHING.  This is not hyperbole.  There are almost no cases where this will not be true for anyone on this sub.  The only time this is not true is when you have a full blown monopoly on an item that is in demand and they can only get it from you.  Your items rank lower as a merchant, your items ship slower, your items are not fulfilled by amazon, or available for prime.  (although that appears to be changing for some qualified sellers with a proven track record).  \n\nDo you even understand how many people will ONLY buy via Prime because of how easy it is and not having to actually deal with a third party seller who may or may not be following amazons rules correctly?  These are all tangible benefits I can't legitimately put a price tag on, but I've already demonstrated youre coming out ahead before we factor these, so this is all extra!\n\nNow, you're in a very special situation which is a gold mine for FBA folks. You're dabbling in high end merch.  For whatever reason, you think that shit will sell slow. It's selling slower because you're MF, not because it sells slow on Amazon.  Give me a few ASINS and I can likely prove this to you.  I'm making a statistical assumption without having the full data i need to be sure.  \n\n\nI'll be happy to do it through PM so you can protect your sources if you wish. \n\nWait, what's this?  Items over $300 are ZERO FULFILLMENT FEES?  What IS this black magic?  This my friend is where your items make you using FBA an absolute no brainer.  Now you pay the same in all fees combined, and have to provide none of the labor, boxes, materials, and time to do it.  \n\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201119410\n\n What really makes you special though is high end items..HAVE NO FULFILLMENT FEES.  You get it included as a perk for selling expensive shit. Im gonna say this again....you can't beat free!  Im repeating myself here though.\n\nWe can go further down the rabbit hole if youre not running a pro account too.  I'll skip over this for now.   Things like search rankings and having GUARANTEED two day shipping, or being able to be shipped using super saver by your customers who order isn't something I can spit out a report or something on, but they ARE tangible and worthy benefits.  They just aren't needed to demonstrate you're spending more doing it yourself as MF...extra gravy for you.  Now you can get more mashed potatoes to sell with that extra time you have =)\n\n\n\n\nTLDR:  For a high end item, your item would have to sit at the amazon warehouse and not sell for well over a year for it to be cheaper to MF like you are right now, and that's just factoring postage, insurance, signature costs on your end vs 100% of the FBA expenses. \n\nEdit for the lower price items.  I would have to do some numbers, but you have to have very low priced items before you can make more fulfilling yourself than using FBA on the combined fees side of things.  It's still better once you factor all of your MF costs like time, labor, materials, etc.  Simply do FBA, and spend 100% of the time you used to use on that crap doing sourcing and listing more items and you'll be making more money for the same time spent.  \n","name":"t1_cwjhm22","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-31 16:15:45","week":44}

Just wanted to get the info out.\n\nEdit 3:  You're right.\n\nI'm not sure who downvoted you, but you may be correct. I'm verifying now.  Will edit when I get the ruling.\n\nEdit:  This is where I do my obligatory FBA people never have this issue at all.  On top of it, ive never gotten a restocking fee for my items as an FBA, i get fully reimbursed if it's not in the same condition.  \n\nEdit 2:  I'm now being transferred to the third person. Haha.  \n\nEdit 4:  Me: This is a 100% theoretical scenerio, but one that is quite common. I'm trying to find out what amazons official policy is on feedback given that ONLY relates to the cost's in buying or returning an item. Costs are neither a sevice or the item itself which are the two things feedback is allowed to be given for as per amazon guidelines on feedback.\nAndre: This is a seller question correct?\nMe: Wouldn't it be both seller/buyer?\nsince sellers have to deal with feedback and buyers give it. I don't see how this is one or the other.\nI feel obligated to ask why that matters? The answer should be the same regardless.\nAndre: Joe, it sounds like you asking this question as it would be interpreted by a seller. As the seller would receive the feedback.\nI am trying to determine the correct department to refer your question to. This is the Amazon Associates line. We only deal with our internet marketing program.\nMe: It shouldn't matter, whoever handles feedback related stuff. I should get the same answer regardless.\nseller buyer, it's all the same.\nAndre: Ok joe\nA Customer Service Associate will be with you in a moment.\nYou are now connected to Nonelela from Amazon.com\nNonelela: Hello Joe, my name is Nonelela, I'm part of the Amazon.com Locker support team. I will gladly assist you further.\nMe: locker support? lol\nthis is not the right department i dont think.\nNonelela: Please allow me a moment to go through the transcript.\nMe: This is a generic feedback question unrelatd to my seller or buyer accont\nNonelela: Thank you so much for your patience, I haven't finished going through everything but I'd like to ask whether your question is regarding conditions which would result to your feedback being removed by a seller?\nMe: no\ni'll make it simple\nAmazon allows feedback related to two things. A seller service, and the condition of the item vs how it was listed, correct?\nNonelela: That's correct.\nMe: Okay, so the question is where does cost line up. Would a review that is ONLY about the cost of the item or to return be okay?\nA cost is not a service.\nA cost is not related to the conditon of the item.\nTherefore if we are being literal about the policy, it shouldn't qualify (to me)\nNonelela: Have you seen this page: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/...(See full link)\n?\nMe: yes, ive read through everything. It isn't cited as an example anywhere except the forums from other sellers\nHow satisfied were you with how your order was packaged and shipped? (for products)\nHow was the work quality and professionalism of the provider? (for services)\nDid you get good customer service and prompt resolution? (if applicable)\nWould you buy from this third-party seller again?\nWhat could have been improved about your experience?\nthe cost of an item doesn't fit into any of the bullet points. A cost relates to everything in the world. A cost is NOT a service, nor is cost an item.\nNow amazon can tell us that cost is a service as it's their site and they can do what they want, but if we're going by the literal definitions of what things are, then no, a cost only review would not qualify to me.\nAnd ultimately, that's what i am trying to figure out. What does amazon say a cost is. If they say it's service, then it's allowed. If they don't say cost is a service, then it isn't.\nNonelela: I perfectly understand where you come from now Joe. The cost or charges are not explicitly stated as relevant points for when feedback is submitted however since this is also not explicitly forbidden and the purpose of the feedback function is to allow customer's to tell other buyers and parties involved about their overall experience then some people might feel the need to mention the cost if it is a major part that affected their experience.\nMe: Excellent, that's exactly what I was trying to figure out.\nKinda crappy to let someone complain about enforcing a standard policy, but it is what it is. Good to know since I was telling people it wasn't allowed haha. Time to go rectify that.\nMay i have your permission to copy/paste this to a public message group?\nI have one other question. This point is moot for an FBA seller isnt' it? We would never be able to get feedback for a return policy cost if we FBA can we, since it's FBA? Would that qualify for removal as you fulfill it and is now related to YOUR service since we passed that responsibility to Amazon?\nNonelela: Yes everyone has policies and not all your customers will be happy with you enforcing your policies because at the end if it means they should lose out and they do not agree they will complain about it. This is not saying that they are wrong, after-all feedback is based on the specific person's experience and is subjective. There's also an implicit burden to the readers to analyze what they read.\nMe: Yeah, i wish people read more haha. If it's one thing I know is that too many consumers never read and then are shocked when something they agreed to comes up. :P\nNonelela: That's correct, we would most likely remove it if the feedback is related to the fulfillment of the order.\nMe: Okay, lol.

I've written a blog about this and the most popular approach in the US &amp; Canada: http://blog.amplifiedinvestments.com/2013/09/21/do-you-invest-in-mutual-funds-you-could-be-giving-away-your-financial-freedom/\n\n- Real estate - this requires much more hands-on management - of tenants, repairs, vacancies, etc. - but can provide you with a much higher return on investment because your $230,000 can be used to purchase ~$1 millionin real estate at a rate of 15-20% down (commercial or 6-plexes require 15% down; residential multiplexes require 20% down); closing costs excluded from the calculation - I've written a blog summarizing real estate to help you understand some of the benefits here: http://blog.amplifiedinvestments.com/2014/10/08/how-can-i-make-money-in-real-estate/\n\n- Business - by far the most hands-on and riskiest form of investment. I've owned a dozen businesses to date and only 15 years into being an entrepreneur are my experiences able to help me consistently create successful businesses.  The first few businesses are the toughest and most likely to fail because you'll be learning the fundamentals of business, finance, legal, accounting, human resources and many other important facets of a business.\n\nAlso you can check out my most recent blog that was written to provide guidance to individuals seeking financial freedom and not knowing where to start, hopefully this helps you fill in some of the gaps: http://blog.amplifiedinvestments.com/2015/01/16/financial-freedom-where-do-i-begin/\n\nIf I were you, because you have a reasonable nest egg available for investment purposes, I'd seriously consider real estate investing for the following reasons:\n\n- Low barrier to entry\n- Easy to learn as you go along\n- Most decisions are common sense (e.g. a tenant doesn't pay -&gt; evict; repairs needed -&gt; perform repairs; vacancy -&gt; advertise, etc.)\n- Allows you to leverage other people's time (e.g. property managers, lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, etc.) &amp; money (the bank, private lenders, etc.)\n\nBefore you consider this find some hands-on courses (go to your local real estate investors' monthly meeting and ask for recommendations) and read some real estate investing books (check Amazon and pick up the ones that consistently get 5-star ratings). Why? Because if you buy a real estate property that doesn't follow a set of fundamental rules then it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to lose money. What are the rules that I recommend for beginner real estate investors?\n\n- Properties must be cashflow positive/neutral. What this means is that after paying off the property taxes, insurance, snow removal, grass maintenance, property management, bookkeeping, accounting, mortgage and then accounting for vacancy and repair allowances you still at the least break even.\n- Properties must be mid/higher end, this will avoid most \"trouble tenants\"\n- Properties must be in a desirable neighborhood (e.g. near a convenient bus route is the most important; but also near a convenience store, coffee shop and a few restaurants preferably)\n- Properties must be in or beside cities with population growth trends and job growth trends\n\nThese fundamentals are key to real estate investing success. Once you choose the right properties it's vital that you follow a set of unemotional rules for your tenants as well:\n\n- Before renting to any tenant perform both a financial &amp; criminal background check. Set your own rules but we don't ever accept a tenant that doesn't have decent credit and/or a criminal background. We use these guys: https://www.tenantverification.com/\n- Prior to giving access to the unit photos are taken and shown to the tenant, tenant initials each photo and signs agreement that this is the condition they received the unit in and that they are responsible for damages\n- All tenants sign a key deal, identifying the # of keys given and that if they lose a key they will be charged $x for replacing the locks and new keys\n- All units are equipped with fire extinguishers and new smoke detector batteries; tenants sign forms signifying this was done and that they will maintain the battery in the smoke detector\n- Rents not received by the 4th of each month are given a written warning (even if they say they'll pay on the 5th)\n- Rents not received by the 21st of each month are informed via registered mail that you are starting the eviction process (even if they say they'll pay on the 22nd)\n- Quarterly inspections are performed; regularly and no matter what\n- Complaints are handled expeditiously and with police intervention with a police report if required (note: this happens very rarely; take it seriously when it does)\n- Repairs are done expeditiously and professionally if it impacts the tenants (toilet issues, water leak, frozen pipes, etc.). This is vital both for maintaining your tenants respect and for enforcing evictions should the need arise.\n\nThe reason for these is that you are setting the tone with your tenants that you are a serious landlord and that you care about them. Over the last 5 years I've acquired 24 units and I've only had two problems to date, there is a reason for this and it's because of an unemotional systematic approach to real estate investing.  \n\nBy leveraging other people's money (the banks) you gain appreciation on the value of the full asset when only investing a fraction of the money (e.g. $45,000 - $60,000 down to buy a $300,000 building which will appreciate at a pace of 3-5% per year). Also while your real estate appreciates your tenants are paying down your mortgage at a rate of 3-6% per year depending upon the mortgage terms. The cherry on top is that you'll reap the rewards of earning positive cashflow each and every month which you can save up for unexpected expenses outside of your repair and vacancy contingency budgets. Oh and finally you also gain tax benefits in the form of being able to depreciate your investment real estate to offset capital gains (talk to your accountant). These four benefits have helped me systematically ROI each of my investments at a rate of 25-45% per year.\n\nHope this helps, best of luck!","name":"t1_cwjjxpt","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-31 17:28:46","week":44}

{"id":"cwjpurr","author":"RagnarKon","body":"I was more or less in the same spot as you a few years ago.  What worked for me may or may not work for you, but here is what I did:\n\n* I did the obvious and canceled memberships I didn't need:  Hulu Plus, Netflix, reduced my cable package, etc. etc.\n* I froze my credit cards.  Like... literally froze them.  I stuck them in a glass of water and put them in the back of my freezer.  I removed my credit card information from any website that had it stored (such as Amazon).  This effectively stopped my credit card spending.  There was a few things I would get tempted and take my credit cards out of the freezer to buy stuff I didn't need... but by the time the credit cards thawed to a point where I could read the info I had built up enough will-power and decided it was a bad idea.\n* I setup automatic bill-pay through my bank.  The payment days were setup to be the same day I received my direct deposit from my paycheck... so the money was gone before I even had a chance to spend it.\n* After that, the only money I had left was the remaining cash in my bank account.  I couldn't go further into debt, because I had effectively grounded myself and taken away my ability to use credit.  When I look at my bank account and I only have $150 left for the entire month, I begin to second guess whether buying that $15 fast-food meal is worth it... or whether I should be buying dog food so my dog can eat.\n\nThat worked pretty well for me.  I've since cut my debt by 50%, and I'm now at the point where I am forcing myself to use a budget.  I'm using YNAB to do that, since YNAB treats credit card spending as cash.  So even though I have freed most of my credit cards from the glass of ice... I still treat them as cash.\n\n*By far* the most difficult thing for me is to stop eating out.  It is so freaking expensive and absolutely not worth the money, but it is a terrible habit I picked up in college and I can't seem to stop it.  Ideally I want to only eat out 2-4 times a month... and at the moment I'm eating out 2-4 times a week.  *Significantly* better than eating out for every meal like I used to, but still not where I want to be.\n\nBaby steps I guess.","name":"t1_cwjpurr","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-31 20:26:37","week":44}
