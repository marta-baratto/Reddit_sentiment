{"id":"3zlky0","author":"crazyrich","body":"I know a week or so ago we were inundated with BoomGift, but after using it for a bit I have some small pieces of advice that I have not seen posted yet.  I've earned a $25 payout in 18 days by downloading apps while watching tv, etc.\n\n1) Save for the bigger payouts - they are MUCH more efficient in point value.  See below:\n\n$1 – 600 Points \n\n$3 – 1500 Points (500pts / dollar) \n\n$5 – 2500 Points (500pts / dollar) \n\n$10 – 4000 Points (400pts / dollar) \n\n$25 – 9000 Points (360pts / dollar) \n\n$50 – 17000 Points (340pts / dollar)\n\nNote that if any of these are not available they periodically re-stock, so it does not necessarily mean they've discontinued that payout level.  Happens at times for the lowest and highest payout rewards.\n\nI recently cashed out $25 after 18 days and was paid within 24 hours. I cashed out a second time after another 18 days (this time helped by Referrals) and was paid again within 24 hours.\n\n[Payment Proof First $25](http://imgur.com/VhpoV3L). \n\n[Payment Proof Second $25](http://imgur.com/mhFjQPS) \n\nThe PayPal fee for $25 is $1.28 so its still about the same as $25 Amazon given GCX exchange rates.\n\n2)  Make sure you do the daily check in reward!  It only starts at 2 coins, *but it grows with the consecutive days collected*.  So far I have seen:\n\nStart - 2 Coins / day\n\n3 Days - 3 Coins / day\n\n6 Days - 4 Coins / day\n\n10 Days - 5 Coins / day\n\n15 Days - 6 Coins / day\n\n20 Days - 7 Coins /day\n\n27 Days - 8 Coins / day\n\n35 days - 9 Coins / day\n\n44 days - 10 Coins / day\n\n3)  Periodically (every 3 days or so) Supersonic will have a 2X multiplier on all of its rewards.  Prioritize these rewards on these days.\n\n4) Take screenshots when completing offers.  If you file a complaint about not getting rewarded they will ask for pics.  For apps, A screenshot showing that you have not downloaded it before (showing GET button in AppStore) and showing it opened is enough.  I have filed 3 complaints through Fyber and all 3 were resolved in 24 hours with said pics.\n\n5) Though streaming video ads from the main menu is only worth 1 coin, its no effort to do while preoccupied (like watching TV).\n\n6)  I find Supersonic is more quick and reliable about reward payment, but Fyber has a much better reporting system and has many more offers.  Check both as sometimes offers overlap to use the one with the highest payout.\n\n7) Although payment is guaranteed only if you've never downloaded and opened an app before I've received payouts for an offer where I've had the app in the past.  This is not very common, though.\n\n8) DO NOT do the email submission offers on Fyber.  They are alluring as they offer a lot of coins to just let some emails go to your SPAM folder.  Unfortunately, they never pay out, and never send a confirmation email.  Fyber requires the confirmation email to pay out on complaints.  This seems intentional on the part of the offer maker.  This has happened to me the first and only 3 times I've done these offers.\n\nUPDATE:  Fyber credited me on all 3 complaints on these offers when I replied saying basically the above - that I had received no confirmation email and that I would stop doing these offers do to them being scams.  Since they are high in coin value may be worth taking the chance - worst thing that would happen is some more emails in your SPAM folder.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**9) Here's my pitch! If you use a referral code, you start off with 200 coins.  Mine is**\n\n**3e4c419**\n\n**if you would like to use it after installing the app.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT 1,2, 3, &amp; 7:  Added 20, 27, 35, and 44 day mark on Daily check in.\n\nEDIT 4: Do not do Fyber email submission offers.\n\nEDIT 5: Formatting and second $25 payout proof.\n\nEDIT 6: Fyber email submission update.\n\n","name":"t3_3zlky0","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-01-05 19:59:55","week":1}

{"id":"3zmjap","author":"SouthOvHeaven","body":"I got the suspension hammer on NYE, and have been chipping away at my letter. The circumstances pertaining to this suspension were due to pre-fulfillment order cancel rate which is higher than the goal of less than 2.5%, as well as my late shipment rate is higher than the goal of less than 4%. \n\nWhat I am looking for is help with my appeal letter, as well as any other information. Here is my letter/action plan: \n\n\n\n\n\nDear Amazon Performance Team,\n\nI am writing to appeal the recent activities on my Amazon seller account, XXXX. On December 31st, 2015, my selling privileges were under review and immediately were revoked after Amazon's review. The circumstances pertaining to this suspension were due to pre-fulfillment order cancel rate which is higher than the goal of less than 2.5%, as well as my late shipment rate is higher than the goal of less than 4%. Listed below are the steps that correspond with my action plan.\n\n1.)The problem with shipments and order cancellations that lead to my suspension was due to poor inventory control, resulting in not enough product to fulfill orders. Whether this be a miscount of inventory I had on hand, or incoming orders to ship out to the customer. With this case, I did not have enough of the Yeti Tumbler 30 Oz cups on hand after realizing my listing was posted. Due to the high velocity in which this item sells, this item sold out before I could account for my mistake. The problem with my shipping process was due to a lack of a process dedicated to make sure orders go out same day payment is received. \n\n2.) I have already gone through all inventory on hand and incoming, and properly documented total amount in a spreadsheet that will be edited daily. I have also streamlined my shipment process by adding an additional table to my work area to put products that need to be shipped out that day only on it. This will show the accurate amount of packages that need to be shipped out that day. \n3.) Going forward to ensure this never becomes an issue again, I will limit the amount of items that will be posted either to be fulfilled by Amazon, or fulfilled by myself or any employees. With this, I can be on top of my existing products, how many there are, and how many have sold on a day by day basis. \n\nThank you for your time, ","name":"t3_3zmjap","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-05 23:18:48","week":1}

{"id":"3zmt2k","author":"Assosianya","body":"I've been slowly rebuilding my credit over the past two years, and I've learned a plethora of information from here, creditboards, myfico, flyertalk, and others.  As a part of my journey (I'm still a long ways from where I want to be), I opened up some AMEX cards around 7 months ago and I wanted to do a write-up of how well I've been treated by AMEX and the rewards I've earned with them.\n\nWhile the PRG 50k offer was still readily available, I got two cards, one for me and one for my wife.  And when this subreddit posted about the Plat 100k offer, I jumped on that as well.  \n\nSo for year one, I was looking at $450 fees ($840 fees normally, but PRG fee is waived first year).  \n\nWhat have I done to recuperate those fees?\n\nGlobal Entry redeemed - $100\n\nAirline redemptions - $800\n\nAMEX BnB Offers - $100\n\nAMEX Amazon Offers - $45\n\nAMEX Longhorn Offer - $10\n\nThus far, I'm up ahead $605.\n\nNext, I can look at MR point transfers and redemptions.  I've done both some very poor and good redemptions over the past 7 months, but I spent ~88,000 MR points (in travel and in amazon redemptions) and saved ~$1,000 in doing so, for an average point value of 1.2 cents.\n\nSo far, I'm up ~$1,600 (~$2,100 total benefits minus $450 annual fee).  And I still have ~110,000 MR points.\n\nOne perk that I can't place a value on is the Platinum Concierge service.  My family was heading to Disney in late September and we were going to go to Mickey's Halloween Party.  A few hours after we left our house, my wife realized that we had forgotten my daughter's staff for her costume (she went as Maleficent).  She had ordered it online and it wasn't available in most stores.   I thought what the heck and called AMEX.  I told them what had happened and if there was anything they could do.  I told them we were traveling and were heading towards Disney.  They contacted me back a couple hours later and told me the store to go to in Orlando to pick up the staff.  They had called and reserved it for me.  It was the only one left in the Orlando area they could locate.  They had also attempted to have it delivered to the hotel for me, but could not secure transportation because of the lateness of the day.  They apologized it couldn't be delivered but were happy they found it. So.....that was cool.\n\nAll in all, I've been impressed with what AMEX has done for me this year.  I've never had them before, but they've been a great step in my rebuilding process.","name":"t3_3zmt2k","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-01-06 00:15:44","week":1}

{"id":"3zpjp3","author":"workinreddit","body":"The market is still over priced but it's nice to see the beginnings of a correction. I look at stock prices and every large cap that has dividends is priced at 20-25 P/E which is ridiculous. MSFT at 37 P/E??? What? Disney at 20+ with ESPN in the tank? No thanks. \n\nCommodities have tanked and money has flowed out of there into  non commodity names but even those are showing signs of weakness now. Q4 earnings will disappoint and then watch out for those high flying 2015 stocks that dont have any basis for their valuations. NFLX is a $40 stock, AMZN is at best $200-$300, CMG  should fall back into the 200s sooner than the others. \n\nThere are great companies out there and some I've already mentioned but the pricing is way out of whack. Paying a 29 P/E for PG? How is that a good value and how do you expect to make money if you pay that sort of valuation for mature companies? VFC at 25.5 P/E? Where's the earnings growth going to have to be to support that kind of valuation and where will the market take these companies once the slowdown of the commodity sector and the overseas hits consumer spending. \n\nJust look at SWHC as confirmation of the market searching for anything to make money - up a ton in weeks based on simple higher earnings guidance and fear about gun control. The same thing happened in 2007 right before the 2008 crash where people were searching for potential value ANYWHERE cause everything else was over priced. It's not going to be quite as bad but it's certainly needed.\n\nCyclicals are the top of their cycle and the roller coaster is about to come down for a while. \n\nAll aboard the cash train to keep some money on the side for when stocks are priced normally again but it'll take a 20-30% drop from current prices to make that happen for even the biggest and safest of names - not to mention the stock darlings whose valuations have no basis in reality. \n\nFor us long term investors - this is a good thing - we're buying for 20 years out so we want prices to correct sooner than later so we don't have to pay outrageous valuations for years.\n\nFor short term traders - volatility is gonna be huge this year - big drops and then big short term corrections will be there but overall - the market needs that longer term correction to get values to reasonable levels. \n\nIf you know anything about the market, you know that KO at 27 P/E, PEP at a P/E of 29.5! and MCD at 26 P/E makes no sense to buy.

{"id":"3zq2kk","author":"bmberlin","body":"So, between last night and this morning I made my first FBA shipment.  A few things I noted.\n\n1) It was more effort than I had anticipated.  I read about you guys putting things on FBA all the time and assumed it was way quicker.  On the other hand, when I think about the amount of time for me to pack, label, and ship the 30 items I sent in to FBA, it was definitely a time saver in the long run.\n\n2) The labels were a pain.  I'm a small time flipper.  I started in October and had about $3k in sales in 2015.  I found a couple lots of RA that are solid profit on FBA and thought I'd dip my toe in the water.  I don't have a label maker yet and haven't been able to justify the cost just based on my low volume of sales.  But after doing the FBA shipment, I'm more tempted to get one.\n\n3) Managing FBA inventory on the amazon seller interface was confusing.  Going back and forth with inactive inventory, deleting items accidentally, having unlisted FBA inventory...it took me about 30 minutes to finally get it all sorted out.  But once I had my shipments scheduled it seemed to work out.  There is definitely a learning curve for FBA, but once you do it one time, I think it is way easier.\n\n4) Holy cow shipping is cheap.  When using FBA scan and trying to estimate FBA shipping costs, I was over estimating significantly.  In my mind, this is the major advantage of FBA to me.  I feel like my items are more competitive now because I'm taking advantage of the bulk shipping (I estimate that each item cost about 40 cents to ship to FBA).\n\n4) Talking macro-economics and Adam Smith's theory of comparative advantage, I totally understand FBA now.  Before I did it all.  In my mind, my time cost me nothing.  I have a full time job, make good money, and the flipping project was on the side for a little extra cash.  Any time spent doing it was essentially free.  But since I've expanded, I'm finding myself putting a lot more time into packing, shipping, etc.  According to the comparative advantage theory, I should be letting the more efficient groups do what their more efficient at.  I am not efficient at shipping.  I don't have a good source for packing material, I have to make boxes, use lots of tape, and it costs me $5+ to ship each item.  Amazon is all about logistics and they have a huge comparative advantage.  I should let them do what their good at, and I'll do more of what I'm good at...sourcing.\n\n","name":"t3_3zq2kk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-06 15:50:05","week":1}
{"id":"3zqhhw","author":"throwawaydad54321","body":"I'm confident we can do this.  Doesn't mean I'm not a bit stressed about it.\n\nMy wife and I got married a few months ago.  Yesterday she took a pregnancy test and came back positive.  While we weren't trying to have a kid, we weren't not trying either -- we took the position (heh heh) that if it happened, it happened, and if it doesn't we won't be too concerned about it for a while.\n\nWell, it's looking like it happened.  My wife takes home about $800 every two weeks.  My gross salary was 65k last year -- take home about 45k -- though this year insurance premiums are going up, my boss has also been teasing me with a promotion with a significant pay bump to go along with it.\n\nDue to her income, I feel like we may be better off if she becomes a stay-at-home mom/housekeeper, as opposed to having to pay for childcare, which would likely cost close to as much as her income.  Not to mention the costs of fuel, vehicle maintenance, and the savings of eating more home-cooked meals, etc.\n\nHere's a rundown of my current outstanding credit:\n\n - My Credit Score: 730 (TU) / 724 (EF) \n - Credit Cards are largely paid off on a monthly basis - with the exception of two store cards which have 0% interest offers on them -- Best Buy (~$1600 -- bought us a new TV on black Friday) and Zales ($110 - wedding ring, will be paid off next month).  The cards that are paid off monthly are Chase Amazon, Citi Dividend Platinum Select, and Target.  I have not been in the habbit of funneling all purchases through credit cards -- most purchases are made with Debit, aside from some automated payments (Amazon, PSN) and purchases at Target and Home Depot.  The plan on the 0% interest offers has always been to take the balance, divide by months remaining on the 0% offer, and pay the quotient rounded up to the next dollar.\n\n - HELOC has $12.5k balance out of 15k limit.  Wedding was financed with the HELOC.  When the wedding checks came in, I used the money to pay off the credit cards instead of the HELOC, then put the rest towards the HELOC.  Then decided now would be a good time to fix up the bathroom, which is an almost-complete project -- at this point I just have to buy paint and a floor.  I've DIY'd the whole thing.  Will likely have to make a few more inexpensive home repairs before the kid arrives -- things like fixing damage the dogs did when they were puppies (chewed up molding/cupboards/vinyl floor), painting the peeling bulkhead + garage, painting my office and moving my office to the basement so my office can become a bedroom again, etc.  The bank is automatically drafting interest payments only from our joint checking account.\n\nMonthly expenses currently include:\n\n - Mortgage - with tax and insurance rolled in, $1041/mo\n - Autos - we both have payments on our cars.  Between car payments and insurance, we pay $761/mo.  Both cars are 2013 models purchased used with 7yr loans -- one in 2014, one in 2015.\n - Internet - $60/mo\n - Hulu, Netflix, Amazon - about 30/mo\n - Her parent loan - $41/mo\n - Gas and Electric - $110/mo-ish.  \n - Oil heat -- haven't filled up yet, that's coming soon.  Last year I think we got by on only 1.5 tanks.  This year oil is much cheaper -- we do COD oil which is currently around $1.65/gal in my area.\n\nInterest rates on the HELOC, Auto Loans, and Mortgage are all fairly low, though I don't know the exact amounts.\n\nQuarterly expenses include: \n\n - Water + Sewage - about $50 every three months\n - Auto Tax - my taxes were $107.19 per quarter last year.  While we drive the same year/make/model car, hers was purchased after the tax year started, so we did not pay taxes on her car last year.\n\nOther expenses - her student loan balance is 22k.  However, we are so far not filing jointly to keep that payment deferred due to her income.  We have so far not paid anything on it.  \n\nUpcoming savings: \n - We will be cutting 10% off home taxes next year by signing up for the local Homestead Tax Savings Act.\n - We will be shaving $86/yr off our auto insurance by being married\n - If I add her to the deed, we'll likely be looking at savings on the homeowners insurance as well.  Not sure what this entails.\n\nI'm thinking that at this point, the first thing I should do is increase my HSA contribution.  I am only contributing $30/pay period (every two weeks) to our HSA, and have only about a $1000 balance on it.  Now that we are married, not only have my premiums gone up, but so has my deductible -- which is now $4000/yr.  If I bump up contributions to $187.50 or more per pay period, we should have $4000 contributed to the HSA by 9/1, which should cover the deductible by the expected due-date.  \n\nAfter that, I hope to take the entirety of our tax refunds (the plan so far is to continue filing separately due to the aforementioned student loans) and apply it to the HELOC balance and hopefully knock a good chunk off of it.  Then start to try to use my income solely for our living expenses, and as much of her income towards the HELOC as we can.  In the interim, treat the HELOC like an emergency fund (though I know it shouldn't be) and try to save. \n\nBut what next?  I'm seeing that we have about $2100 in estimated monthly bills and $3725 in just my net income, with a potential for a significant raise before September. Can we do this?  How can we prepare? \n\nEdit to add: despite the $1600 difference in my income and our expenses (not including food, fuel, etc), and the other $1600 that she makes -- we are still finding ourselves living paycheck-to-paycheck.  I know this is due to a lot of unnecessary spending -- I can't imagine it adding up to $3200/mo but it must -- but there are certainly things we can cut out.  Less take-out, less smoking (it'll be a lot easier for me to quit now that she has to), less of her shopping sprees at target/homegoods/clothes stores, etc.  Fewer luxury goods for me as well -- though not as often, I am a geek and a gamer so my purchases tend to be fewer, but more expensive...etc.","name":"t3_3zqhhw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-06 17:24:38","week":1}

{"id":"3zrfw3","author":"phearlez","body":"So I guess someone over in the Nose Frida administration got around to doing their annual protectionism or something, as yesterday I got a message from Amazon saying they'd suspended my account because of reports of \"inauthentic sales.\" Which is kind of insane, because the sales they're grumping about were (1) perfectly legitimate items and (b) all made in April of last year.\n\nHere's the top bit of the letter:\n\n&gt;We have removed your Amazon selling privileges because of buyer or rights owner complaints we received. Please see below for some examples of the listings we have received complaints about:\n\n&gt;Complaint Type: Inauthentic \n\n&gt;ASIN:  B00171WXII \n\n&gt;Title: NoseFrida The Snotsucker Nasal Aspirator\n\nAt this point I don't know whether there's some way outside folks can find old listings or if Amazon is providing the Frida Baby company a list of sales of their product over the year, but it's super weird to get this complaint over something that I sold about 40-50 of well over a year ago. It doesn't even seem to make sense to Amazon, as this was the instructions in the original message from them:\n\n&gt;For “Inauthentic” complaints include the following for each ASIN:   \n\n&gt;1. Copies of invoices or receipts from your supplier issued in the last 180 days. These should reflect your sales volume during that time.\n\n&gt;2. Your supplier’s contact information including name, phone number, address, and website.\n\nWell, the receipts from the last 180 days would be a sum total of \"fucking nothing,\" as this was purchases made in 2014 and listed over three months later. I took them at their word - knowing it would almost certainly mean another round of email exchanges, but I am stubborn like that - and wrote back simply \n\n&gt;This complaint doesn't make any sense. I have no items of this type available for sale, nor any immediate intention of selling any. \n\n&gt;Well over 180 days ago I sold some items of this type which I had acquired via a medical supply shop and they were unquestionably authentic. Any complaint you are receiving about this now, well over half a year since I had them in stock, must almost certainly be fraudulent/harassing.\n\nUnsurprisingly I got a response today that required more back and forth. Interestingly they continue with the request that I dialog directly with the company. Well, *maybe* the company, as the complaint comes from **a gmail address** of all things. It certainly calls into question how much due diligence Amazon does over these complaints. Did they do anything to validate that this complaint came from the actual rightsholder?\n\n&gt;Thank you for your response to our request. However, we still need more information regarding your plan of action for complaints from rights owners regarding items that infringe their intellectual property rights before we can consider reinstating your selling privileges.\n\n&gt;What you can do\n\n&gt;1. Contact the rights owner directly to resolve this dispute:\n\n&gt;Roger Björklund\n&gt; DMCA[redacted by me]@gmail.com\n\n&gt;2. If resolved, advise them to contact us at notice@amazon.com to withdraw their complaint.\n\n&gt;If you are unable to resolve this concern with the rights owner, you will not be able to list these items on our site.\n\nJust so I could say I did, I wrote to that ridiculous email address asking them to withdraw their complaint. &lt;sarcasm&gt;I am sure that telling them that right of first sale is the law of the land even if they don't like it will do wonders for persuading them to actually do so.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;\n\nI similarly wrote back to Amazon and told them this was clearly someone without any actual knowledge of infringement since it was not infingement and there have been no sales or listing of the items in question since April. I attached my original purchase receipt this time, as much as it irritated me to do so, so perhaps they'll whorishly pass that on to the Frida people so they can go fraudulently annoy that vendor too.\n\nThe DMCA content of the email address does make me wonder if this is someone abusing DMCA takedown notices; Amazon doesn't refer to the DMCA at all but it wouldn't be the first time someone misused that law and to the best of my knowledge nobody has ever been charged for doing so. It's not privately actionable so you'd have to interest a federal prosecutor and they'd rather drive hackers to suicide than annoy a corporation.\n\nI guess we'll see whether the Amazon flunkies require me to pretend I am contrite about this and write actual responses to their offensive demands rather than the snark I've handed over so far. Luckily this isn't a livelihood for me, nor do I expect to ever be selling this item again so I can - if it comes to that - pledge never to sell their things again. But I thought /r/flipping would be interested since it would be pretty easy for folks here to find themselves being unreasonably hassled by a company that is mad price collusion is illegal and who want to keep sale prices high.","name":"t3_3zrfw3","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-06 20:43:39","week":1}

Key points:\n\n- History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware. A few stocks of the nifty-50 era subsequently outperformed the market, but in that venerated group no stock that sold above a 50 price-to-earnings ratio was able to match the S&amp;P 500 over the next quarter century.\n\n- But many of today's investors are unfazed by history -- **and by the failure of any large-cap stock ever to justify, by its subsequent record, a P/E ratio anywhere near 100**.\n\n- Supporters [and analysts] of these valuations point to their fantastic growth and rosy prospects. \n\n- But once a firm reaches big-cap status -- ranked in the top 50 by market value -- its ability to generate long-term double-digit earnings growth slows dramatically.\n\n- What does all this mean? Our bifurcated market has been driven to an extreme not justified by any history. The excitement generated by the technology and communications revolution is fully justified, and there is no question that the firms leading the way are superior enterprises.

{"id":"3zw1zf","author":"Dazedandlost11","body":"Not sure if this is the right sub.\n\n\nI don't know if I consider myself and entrepreneur.  I trade between markets for a profit (think, flipping) on a bigger scale.  I make decent money, about ~$3k-6k profit per month, depending on how much I work at it. Mostly Amazon FBA (very hands off) and maybe 5%-10% eBay. I like this because there's no marketing or social media involved or direct, face to face sales.  Those are not my strong suits and I tend to avoid them. \n\nI like making money online.  Emphasis on online.\n\nHere's the skinny.  I have 2 young kids and a stay at home mom.  I'm our only income.  I make $1,200/mo working 32 hours a week at my job.  I know it's shitty.  But it's consistent.  I've worked there 8 years and I'm capped out for raises ($13/hr less taxes &amp; insurance) and have no room for advancement.  It's very stress free and most days I spend 2-3 hour a on my phone.  It's very boring and a lot of time on my feet.\n\nThe arbitrage has been great, except for a suspension on Amazon and since then I don't really trust that its as dependable.  If I were permanently suspended, I would make a stealth account and keep on chugging along, so I suppose it's not a huge deal.  But I want another income stream.  Arbitrage only takes me about 20 hours a week, so I have some time to work with and I'm not against trading time or money.  I would continue to grow my arbitrage venture, but I'd like another stream of income before I quit.  \n\nMy family and I live frugally in a low COL area on $25k/year and I save a lot of the arbitrage earnings on top of that.  I have $17k saved currently and actively saving for retirement.  When the youngest is done breast feeding, my wife will get a job, but she has no education and will probably only be able to make $1,000ish a month to start.  Nothing against her, but that's the way it is and it would help a ton.\n\nMy question: what are some similar ventures to arbitrage?  I don't like social media, marketing or face to face sales, so a lot of low cost to start up businesses (cleaning services, window washing, lawn care, ect..) are not preferable.  And I'd love to continue working online.  I love being in my home office, having the tv going in the background as I work on my computer and take breaks when I need to.  I love being off my feet for a change and I currently work at home 1 day a week on my business and some evenings as well.\n\nAny suggestions?","name":"t3_3zw1zf","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-07 16:58:15","week":1}
{"id":"3zw78w","author":"alienbrayn1","body":"First let me say that I am sorry for the tone of the thread, this is a pretty selfish question to ask as it may only apply to my situation. Howerver, there are other people that may benefit from your comments who may happen to be in a similar entrepreneurial ventrue. \n\nBasically in Janurary 2015 I wrote and publised an ebook to Fiverr.com, I wasn't expecting much out of it, afterall its on Fiverr, I should have done more research on how to sell properly on Amazon Kindle to get even more sales, but Ive been very busy with other ventures. However, my ebook on Fiverr, somehow, someway garnished me over 800 buyers of the ebook and over $3,800 in total sales.\n\nBack in Janurary when I released the first ebook, I let it be while the sales rolled in. I was incredibly surprised at how how well an ebook is selling on Fiverr of all places and I just rolled with it. During the early phase of the release on Fiverr, I was getting 1, maybe 2 sales a day. I thought cool, $10 a day for doing absolutely nothing. (well, $8 after fiverr seller fees :/) but I said hey, free money is the best money. \n\nFast forward 2 months and now Im getting around 2-3 sales a day. This was after I've by then accumulated a little over 20 \"5 star reviews\" from buyers, my reputation began to build and more and more people started to trust me as a reputable seller who knew what I was talking about in my ebook guide. It sort of plateaued at 4-5 sales a day max a couple months later. This was getting me about $16-20 a day after fees. \n\nBy 6 months, I now have over 150 5 star feedbacks with incredible testimonials from buyers, this just grew my reputation even higher. I thought this was the perfect time to release a second addition to the guide. Whipped it up in about 2 days on MS Word and released it with as \"gig extra\" on the original ebook guide selling page for an additional $5, I made it incentive to purchase because I included a list of other helpful information for 'free' if they bought the $10 package. People have since been buying it like wildfire, so instead of 3-4 $5 sales a day I am now getting 3 or so $10 sales a day and a couple $5 ones.\n\nFrom month 1 to 6 I made roughly $1,200 from month 6 to 12 I am up to $3,800 (after introducing the $10 package) \n\nI am thinking of ways to make more mo ey from this, I am the top result on fiverr for about 3 major keywords that people use A LOT. I have over 300 reviews now with a 4.8/5 rating and over 800 buyers.\n\nI would literally pay someone to set me up on Amazon, I have the same guide on there with 80% discount selling it for literally $0.99 and Ive only gotten 5 or so sales on there in the past 3 months, I just dont get it.\n\nI've been thinking about making a course on Udemy.com but that 50% fees is very unattractive.\n\nThanks guys, if the subject of what my ebook is is relevant to sufficiently answer this question, let me know. Theres quite a few people who do it, but it takes some knowledge is a very specific niche subject.\n\nCheers all appreciate any repsonses!","name":"t3_3zw78w","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-07 17:30:54","week":1}

However after much discussion/debate with my wife, we elected for a newer but used vehicle for the safety features/expectation we will own it for 10+ years and we hope for minimal repairs in the short term. My other vehicle I will drive as long as possible.\n\n\nCC debt is what I would really like to focus on eliminating immediately. Please provide thoughts on best plan of attack. I am expecting a tax return mid feb of about $3,500 - $4,000 (I'm addicted to filing early) and have already been warning my wife we are using at least 97% of it towards credit cards. Plan is to hit the largest balance/interest card first and make a good dent in it to get the ball rolling, but interested if anyone thinks I should just knock out the two 0% cards to free up cash flow allow for larger payments on the remaining 2 cards. I'd like to start making regular payments of at least $500 towards the two interest bearing cards going forward.  I don't plan to use ANY of the cards once they have been paid off since I now have a small emergency fund that i plan to steadily continue growing.\n\n\n401k is a bad situation. Company had to postpone their matching which was only ever 2% anyway for the short term. if this continues for more than a year, I'll really be pushing to move into a better job. Trying to build up longevity @ the company for now however. I know I need to be saving for retirement, and plan to job back on this as soon as the CC debt is taken care of. \n\n\nSecondary goal: I just finished reading Richest Man in Babylon, and it was a nice slap to my face. Want to be putting away 10% minimum as soon as I am able to. The budget listed is fairly detailed, and says I should be cash-flow positive, but it seems like there is always a birthday, or holiday/event, or clothes needed, or doc visit that uses up the buffer money. You know the drill. \n\n\nI do have a high deductible plan with an HSA that will be funded to about $1500 by end of this year. We are young and fairly healthy so don't spend much currently. This will hopefully grow enough by the time any sort of inevitable emergency comes around as we get older or my kids get more reckless. \n\nEDIT 1: Formatting/apology for such a wall of text. Didn't intend for it to be so bad initially. Thanks for reading/skimming anyway.","name":"t3_3zxyk2","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-07 23:38:28","week":1}

{"id":"4075wv","author":"gsav55","body":"I have a technical background and love teaching people new things.  I had an idea to put together this \"do-it-yourself\" type kit and sell it.  Maybe on Amazon?  Then I realized that I could make a course on a site like Udemy and people could get the parts themselves to follow along or I could post a link to my kit that has all of the parts already collected so that they don't have to source parts from 2 or 3 different sites with different shipping rates.  \n\nI've already started the outline for my course on Udemy.  But now I'm worried about supply.  If 500 people enroll in my course in the next 2 months, I wouldn't be able to supply the kits to that many people this soon.  \n\nSo I was thinking that I just release the tutorials and include a parts list for them to source the materials on their own.  Then use that money to work on putting kits together in bulk.  I think I can get my kit into the local hobby stores in addition to online marketplaces.  Maybe I would include an instruction booklet with a coupon for the Udemy course in the kit.\n\nThen I got to thinking that maybe I should just have my own website that sells the kits too.  It would also help legitimize my brand and my course.  But now I'm not sure if I should file an LLC or something so that I can create a brand name for my product and my courses.  I'd like to create more courses and kits in this market as well.\n\nAlso, with the course, I've heard people say its better to make several small courses than one large course.  There are a few projects that build on each other and I currently have them stacked in increasing difficulty in one beginner's course.  They are pretty quick projects though, so I think it makes sense in this case.\n\nI'm just looking for input, because I'm stuck thinking my way in circles right now.

{"id":"40872j","author":"awildsie","body":"Okay r/personalfinance. I'm a 21 year old college student and I've made some mistakes. I've got a long confession to make here and I really don't know where to look online for straightforward answers to my questions. \nAt 18 I opened up a Paypal account and got BillMeLater. Finally, a way to shop online. I wasn't allowed to have a debit card per my parents so I had to use a checkbook. But BillMeLater wasn't available on every site I wanted to spend money on,(I'm looking at you, Amazon) so I got my first real credit card. My parents never gave me advice on how to spend with it, they just said that I needed to build my credit and to be careful. I started out paying off the balance as soon as I spent it. I started wanting more, I got addicted to spending money. After a while my credit score started going up, so I got a new credit card with a better interest rate and a better cash back percentage at more places. I originally intended to stop using the old one.... but I didn't. I don't know why. Then I stumbled upon Amazon's credit card. \"$40 off when you apply for Amazon Credit!\" \n$40 off? That's amazing! So young, naive, stupid Sierrah applied for it. Got $40 off. In my head, I only intended to use it on Amazon purchases. That makes four, FOUR credit accounts I have open, fast forward 5 years later. All four are maxed out because I got my first apartment with my boyfriend. \nI have a $25 a month payment plan going on a $600 medical bill I received a month ago. I have $10,000 in student loans I've made two payments on, nothing is due per month right now. I'm taking a semester off to work on my debt I owe. My half of the rent is $300 a month, plus $200 in other monthly bills, i.e. AT&amp;T, electric.\nI make around $1,200 a month at my part-time job.\n\nWhat can I do at this point? I don't know how to even begin. My interest rates are only making the balances higher, and my minimum payments are only going up and that's all I've been paying for the last seven months. I've stopped spending almost completely outside of bills. I have $50 to my name right now and I'm just reaching out for any kind of advice.  My boyfriend and I are thinking we're going to have to break our lease so I can move back in with my parents, which I guess has to happen.\nI feel beyond ashamed every time I think about my debt and I needed to get this all off my chest. \n\n\nTl,dr: Was 18 and stupid, opened up 4 credit accounts and eventually maxed them, now i'm living paycheck to paycheck and can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

{"id":"40ayl4","author":"Newtoflipping","body":"Hi guys!\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. I usually sell niche products (designer clothing) from Canada to the U.S. Presently, it has been extremely profitable due to the declining of the Canadian Dollar VS USD. I want to take this opportunity to expand my horizons and sell on Amazon. I wanted to know if it was as straightforward as selling on eBay (list an item, wait for it to sell), or is the process more difficult? Is it even possible to sell from Canada to the U.S?

{"id":"40d07h","author":"wazoot","body":"I learned about Paribus a few months ago and signed up in the hopes of saving some money, considering that almost all purchases I make come through Amazon, and I frequently see the price increase and decrease on items. At first it was very disappointing as Paribus was not detecting any of the items I ordered. Eventually, after multiple help tickets through support and weeks of waiting, Paribus finally started detecting SOME of the orders I had placed. As of right now, Paribus has detected only 8 orders I have made on Amazon, when in reality, I have made upwards of 20 purchases on Amazon since creating my Paribus account (And none of those 8 that are detected have saved me any money either, so I'm not sure if that is because I got the lowest price to begin with or if it is more problems with Paribus). Every time I submit a help ticket I get the same responses (Am I sure the account is linked to the correct email, etc...) and most recently, Paribus support completely stopped replying to my help tickets. I don't know how they would only be successful in detecting a few items anyway, and that should be proof enough that it is not a problem on my end. I have left every e-mail from Amazon regarding purchases in my inbox, and I know I have the correct e-mail linked to both Amazon and Paribus. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? I even messaged the owner/founder on Reddit and forwarded him the help tickets I submitted and I still have not received any help.

{"id":"cykv4si","author":"Crunketh","body":"But not having a steady inventory is another problem. Like i said there are many factors. Let me give you an example as to why dropshipping can be bad business for ebay. If you are buying from Amazon and are not working with your own inventory, you don't know what is in stock. With that said, lets say one of your customers buys something from you on ebay and you buy it from Amazon but then it's sold out on Amazon. That would create a bad buying experience for you on Amazon but that would create and even worse experience for your customer on eBay. You send them a Cancellation request (you can only have a few requests during the seller period i believe as well) and they are upset because they didn't get their item they were looking for and from their perspective it wasn't Amazon that let them down, it was the ebay seller and ebay that let them down. Ebay could potentially lose that business and that's something they watch out for with dropshipping but if you find a steady supplier and build a good reputation you're welcomed to drop ship, but there are more risks to ebay as a business with dropshippers than there is with a seller that has a brick and mortar or stock in hand.

I'm from the UK too and also used to be super bad with money, but I'm okay now.\n\nFirst of all, if you have a debit card, start leaving it at home and taking out an amount to spend on 'frivolities' (pub, coffee, etc) for the week. Once you have to actually take cash out to spend it, you become a lot more aware of it, instead of using a card where you never have to look at numbers. I got my card declined a week after payday a lot. Alternatively/also, make a promise to yourself to check your account balance every day-this can be easily done with a banking app or at a cashpoint near work. These things make you much more aware of your spending. Awareness is 90% of what helped me.\n\nSecondly, I started a savings account from which I can only withdraw money by physically walking into a bank, shutting the account down and taking the balance out. Once you've transferred money in, you can't just transfer it out. Mine is a Nationwide Save to Buy and they also have a Save to Buy ISA (in which you get better interest rates but I think you can put less money in it-I'm not sure, but if you decide on something like this they'll explain it to you). You have to put £50 a month in as a minimum and you can have up to ten grand in there. It also puts you in good stead for the future-because it's an account designed to help you save to buy a house, by showing them that you can regularly save, they'll hopefully consider you a lot more favourably for a mortgage application in the future. Your amounts will be small now but as you progress in your career, so will your savings and they'll be able to see that. So I'd set up that account and start putting £80 (10% of your income) into it monthly.\n\nThirdly, I have a third account (as well as my current account and my STB). This is technically a savings account but a very lax one and I use it more as a holding pen for money. Every payday I put all my bills money in there-rent, utilities, phone, Netflix, etc. Anything that you pay for every month-I even put my cigarette money in there, and this year I'll be putting in extra every month because I'm going away several times and want to save for those trips. The day before those bills come out of my current account, I transfer the money over. This way, I always know that the money that I need for basic living is always safe. This leaves the money I have in my current account purely to play with (going out, Amazon raids, clothes, etc).\n\nI'm not a finance person but this is how I started when I was just starting full-time work and it's served me well. Good luck! There's really so much satisfaction in being financially independent and having your shit together.

{"id":"cylgl5k","author":"kmully","body":"Not sure I follow your question but I'll take a crack at it. It depends on what you're selling. For individual items (not sold in packs of 2, 3, etc.) you can slap a new label on it and put it in a box. However some items need additional prep work (liquids, things that can be easily broken in transit, etc.) so you might poly bag or bubble wrap those items. If so, the label goes on the outside of the item's bag or bubble wrap or whatever. \n\nRe: how many items to send in.. Again it depends. My wife and I usually do a bigger shipment once per week or every two weeks because that works better for our schedule. We just did 9 boxes to 5 different fulfillment centers. About 200 units total. We do it also to protect margins. It is more profitable to send in that many at once rather than a shipment of 5 here, 8 there. You can also choose to use Inventory Placement which is where, to my understanding, all of the units in your shipment go to one fulfillment center and are then pushed out by Amazon to other centers. The upside is you only ship to one center and can throw whatever you've got into boxes. The downside is you pay $0.20 per item to do this and it can take longer for your items to be \"sellable\" on Amazon because they are still in transit to different fulfillment centers. \n\nHope that helps.

{"id":"cylh5ys","author":"kmully","body":"If you had 50 they might tell you to send it to multiple centers, might not. Let's assume they all go in one box to one center. You print off SKU stickers (you get specific merchant SKUs for your listings, assuming you don't have the \"use commingled inventory\" option selected. (In my opinion you never want this, more in a second on this.) Put your stickers on the candles, put them in a box, weigh and measure the box, input those into FBA, print shipping label and FBA box label (it goes on top so the fulfillment center can scan this label on the top of the box and know what is in the box for counting purposes), drop off at your shipment company. \n\nFrom there Amazon can move your inventory wherever it sees fit. So they could take 10 of your candles and send them to Manchester and 40 to London. You don't control where they sit. When a customer buys a candle it ships (usually) from whatever fulfillment center can get it to them the fastest. Amazon handles packing, shipping, customer service, and returns. You get paid for the difference between what the customer paid and the fees Amazon charges for FBA. Rinse and repeat. \n\nRe: commingled inventory. If you pick this then you don't have a unique SKU to put on the candle. All candles of that certain type go together at Amazon and you get credit for 50 of them. The problem with this is I might ship in 50 candles as well but they are fake. You sell one of my fake candles (because you are selling out of the pool of total candles) and now you have problems.

{"id":"cyljjy8","author":"whoopsiepoopsieman","body":"I got the card a few years ago while purchasing something from Amazon.  There's no annual fee and the rewards are decent.  They also give you a little initial bonus (I think $80 credit right now).  It's especially rewarding if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon.  \n\n\nAs far as \"better\" option, it depends on your spending habits and what kind of rewards your looking for.  I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred, which, if you put a lot on your credit card every month, is a fantastic choice.  If you meet an initial spending threshold in the first few months, you get 50,000 points, which roughly equals $500 in credit that can be used for travel, cash, etc.  There are also other perks that come with the card and I think the rewards are better than the Amazon card.  There is an annual fee (I believe $150, but might be waived for the first year).  \n\n\nIf you're only the occasional spender, I'd probably go with free options like the Amazon card (there are others like it, too). If you spend a lot on the credit card, a card like the Sapphire Preferred (or the Citi Premiere if you like to travel a lot) would probably be better.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, opening new accounts / hard pulls on your credit / new cards will impact your credit score, so think about that too.

This card does not have things like price protection (if something you just bought went on sale the next day, Chase doesn't work to reimburse the difference, etc).  It's a very basic card. One thing though, you can use points for an array of different things, not just Amazon credit.  Among them is statement credit, which is the best use of the points (because you don't build points by using points, if you used $300 worth of point credit, you'd get no points on that purchase, so the statement credit is the best bang for buck).\n\nIf you don't shop at Amazon much, then there are better alternatives.","name":"t1_cyljl1m","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-04 15:59:33","week":1}

Is there some corner of the market not being served by the incumbents? If not, then there is no room for unit growth, there is only room for market share growth. The two are similar but different in that stealing market share requires more money and more time. Think Model T Ford vs the latest Ford Taurus. The Taurus outsells the Model T by a mile but the Model T was probably insanely more profitable given it was serving a missed market. If Tesla folded tomorrow, would its customers be unable to satisfy their need for an electric car? BMW, GM, Chevrolet, Toyota say no.\n\n&gt;  Also, I'd take into consideration that Tesla isn't profiting on vehicles because they're plowing the money back into the business (ala Amazon).\n\nWrong. Tesla isn't profiting because it literally does not generate enough revenue to turn a profit. Why do you think they keep promising to be cash flow positive 'in a few quarters'. They don't make enough money to keep the lights on let alone 'plow money back into the business'. I point you to Exhibit 1) the $750 Million they raised on fresh share issuances this year because they were literally running out of cash to invest into the business; and Exhibit 2) the $500 Million line of credit deal they inked with lenders to finance operations. \nAmazon at least (appears) to generate some income to deflect into investment; and Exhibit 3) their continued failure to be cash flow positive without new debt or equity deals.

It's easy to say \"I spend x at amazon every month anyway\", but are you spending that much because you need the stuff? If not, you can fall into a cycle of chasing after the rewards and buying crap you don't need.\n\nAnyway, the Prime card is 5% but only usable on Amazon, whereas the Chase Amazon is 3% on amazon. To be honest, the Chase card is mediocre IMO. You can get 5% on amazon for at least one quarter every year from Discover or Freedom (Discover actually did two quarters in 2015), so 3% isn't that exciting. It's a steady 3%, but there would be plenty of times where you wouldn't need to use it because of the better options.\n\nAlso: the US Bank Cash+ allows one to select \"bookstores\" as a 5% category. Most, not all, Amazon purchases are considered \"bookstores\" and would get you the 5%. It is capped at 2k per quarter though.\n\nI'd evaluate the spending first and foremost, and make sure you aren't going to be spending to justify 3-5% rewards. If not, I'd say the best overall, uncapped Amazon option is likely the Amazon Prime card. The Chase Visa is nothing special.

{"id":"cymnxyj","author":"Thatssaguy","body":"Howdy... first... congrats on taking a step back and not jumping blindly into \"marketing tells me to spend a lot\"....\n\nMy Tungsten ring was from overstock.com for 50 dollars..... same ring is 10 on amazon (I'm a sucker and overpaid... I should have shopped around).... at Jared its 600.  All the same, gunmetal grey Tungsten Carbide ring....  Buy from Amazon.\n\nMy wife, I went to a local Goldsmith and he had a few diamonds delivered to his shop... think \"office cubicle x3\" shop... its small... very small... with no \"inventory\".  Why?  Because theres no overhead.  He charges cost plus a few bucks. He sent back to his supplier the diamonds I didn't want.  \n\nHe ordered her \"Tiffany\" setting out of a catalog.  Had it delivered, polished it up, set the stone in it, and voila.  Done.  He let me know what the cost of the ring was based on the cost of gold the day he ordered it.  I paid cost for the ring.  He probably tacked on a hundred bucks for the setting of the stone.\n\nNo \"He Went To Jared\" advertising.  No \"Zales mall rent\".  No \"Corporate executive salary\" to pay.\n\nWith overtime I probably make 90k a year.  I spent less than 3 on the ring.  There aint no reason to spend more than you can afford.  My wife's worth 1000x my salary to me... so no reason to try to sum up her worth in a rock and some metal.","name":"t1_cymnxyj","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-05 12:30:58","week":1}
{"id":"cymo4vs","author":"[deleted]","body":"Well, for starters; Google AdSense is *not* really going to make all that much money on sites like that. However, that isn't my issue. You said you had Google AdSense, so the first thing I done was to keep an eye out for those ads. They are virtually invisible. They appear in a place where nobody is going to even attempt to click them.\n\nYou need those Google AdSense adverts to be a little bit more prominent. Make them stand out and I can guarantee you that the number of clicks that you receive *will* go up.\n\n\nIf the content is your own, you could consider releasing a 'book' of some description. You can sell it through Kindle. You will get a few sales this way *and* it will serve as a fantastic way in which to promote your site.\n\n\nIt is a great shame that you can't predict when you are going to get those traffic spikes because 100,000 views a month should be able to generate you some nice cash if you decided to sell adverts directly to advertisers. If you ever expand, that is the route I would go down.\n\n\nIf you wish to boost page views, give people a reason to sign up to your mailing list. Tell them they are going to get fantastic facts delivered to their inbox on a regular basis (and make it regular!). The more people you have on your mailing list, the more people you can encourage to return to you.\n\n\nIn addition to this, I suggest signing up to Amazon Associates. When you write an article, you could have a link to a book for 'further reading'. So, if people are willing to find out more about the topic, they can just pick up a book and you will earn a small commission on it. I think book reviews would work drastically well too.\n\n\nDon't focus on the physical products at the moment. Put them to the back of your mind. Nobody will buy them. Not right now, at least. Instead, focus on building up your website, getting more traffic, and earning money from advertisements. Ditch Google AdSense as soon as you have a good amount of traffic. You can start to sell advertising slots to people.\n\n\nAlso, I don't like to be a 'grammar nazi' or whatever, but you really do need to brush up on your grammar in the articles that you publish.  Why am I mentioning this? Well, because your aim is to make as much money as possible. Poor quality content scares people away. They know if something is not all that great. They will disappear. If they disappear, you will not have an opportunity to sell to them.\n\n\nTake these sentences:\n\n\n\"When returning to Earth after becoming first to land on the Moon the Apollo astronauts had to go through U.S.\"\n\n\n\"To celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s win of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 an interracial dinner was planned in Atlanta\"\n\nJust a comma in the right place could make them read so much better. They are the first sentences of your articles. I am not compelled to read that much further. Your website visitors are thinking this too! Remember; good quality content also gets shared.\n\n\nNote: your content is also drastically short. I am going to presume that most of your traffic doesn't come through the search engines? If you wish to expand, that is something you are going to need to work on in the future.","name":"t1_cymo4vs","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-01-05 12:43:05","week":1}

{"id":"cymp1b1","author":"SQLvariant","body":"If I were in your situation, and unless you're going to have to shell out a bunch of money on SW tickets soon; Start by applying for CSP &amp; Freedom on the same day, in that order.  If you get approved for both, you can chance picking up one of the SW cards that day too.  I've heard of plenty of people getting 3 Chase cards in one day, but never heard of someone getting 4 (yet).  If you get all 3, might as well try for the 4th I guess.  Pro Tip: Start applying in the morning, not at night, that way you have plenty of time to call the recon line if you need to.\r\n\r\nThe SW cards will be an option for you after you pass 5/24 but the CSP/Freedom likely will not.  Yes, you're right about Discover being better since it's 10x on quarterly categories for the first year.  Long story short there have been several little bonuses with Visa Checkout &amp; CSP/Freedom that have helped add to the pile; plus the Amazon bonus last quarter was awesome.  \r\n\r\nAlso, yes, Chase does try to count AU accounts in the 5/24 tally and you have to call recon and walk them through the fact that they're not your accounts.  \r\n\r\nBottom line: Even if you only get CSP &amp; Freedom now, ~3 months from now you will also be able to pickup the SW cards.  However the reverse is unlikely to be true.  Hope this helps.\r\n","name":"t1_cymp1b1","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-01-05 13:34:48","week":1}

She still said yes :)\n\nFor our wedding she wanted something with sapphires so we went to an actual jewelry store and bought each other white gold rings, hers with a big blue sapphire solitare, some teeny tiny diamonds, and really beautiful filigree. Mine is basically a plain white gold band.\n\nOf course, about a month after we got married she noticed her beautiful ring snagging on literally everything so we went back to the store and got her a plain white gold band which she wears every day.\n\nWe spent less than $1,000, even with buying four different rings. The most important thing is to be on the same page with regards to costs. The second most important thing is to avoid (new) diamonds.

{"id":"cymqz2h","author":"InspireHD","body":"I think a lot of the difference in value investing is that people don't understand the stock market, they are risking money they subconsciously don't want to lose, and a lot of people don't even know where to start.  \n\nThere are some people out there who can't see past the Netflixes, the Facebooks, Twitters, Teslas, and the Amazons.  How many people know that there are nano and microcap companies that are largely unknown, but are doing really well?  The problem is, where do you even start?  The television blasts stock tickers in your face and sell you on the fear of the news and so people assume 'this' must be what investing is.  Throw money into the stock market casino and hope to come out ahead.\n\nWhat I have found throughout my many years of investing is that with the amount of books out there I have kept searching and searching and searching (and literally searching some more) for that little nugget of wisdom that is going to be my \"ah ha!\" moment and suddenly everything will click.    Guess what?  I'm still searching.\n\nThe problem is that I realized that I'm not reading for knowledge.  I've lowered myself to reading for entertainment.  I'm reading for what the dreams and hopes of value investing will do for me.  I'm reading 300 pages of books over and over again looking for someone to give me the golden answer.  But it's never there.\n\nI know I need to refocus and read the annual reports, transcripts, etc.  But that is actual work.  It's not the sparks of wisdom that I crave.  It's not the entertainment that my mind wants it to be.\n\nA few years ago I actually put effort into creating a list of a few hundred companies I wanted to research.  I went one by one looking at certain parameters that I felt were my personal filters.  That lowered my few hundred down to, literally, a handful.  I found a reason to say \"No\" first.  I've had companies where I say, \"this looks terrible.\"  And I've also had companies where I say, \"Hmm, this actually looks really interesting.\"  I didn't need to do hours of math or twist a bunch of accounting concepts.  I just eyeballed everything.  When I look back at some of those companies, some of them are doing really well.  Some didn't hold up so well.  \n\nThe point is that when I actually broke it down and put in the work it started to get me somewhere.  I really enjoy reading and learning about new things, but at some point you have to put down the books and open up the annual reports or look at financial statements.  The books aren't going to hand feed you specific companies, which after all, is what we are investing in.","name":"t1_cymqz2h","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2016-01-05 15:01:13","week":1}

Tournaments are either run by private companies or run by development. Teams are entirely privately owned, obviously. \n\nIn terms of actually publicly traded companies:\n\nATVI are all over the place with their esports plans. Very split between Blizzard (HS, HotS, SC) and Activision (CoD). Blizzard have Overwatch coming out soon^TM which is expected to be a massive title with excellent esports potential. The creep of Hearthstone into the mobile market has been super successful and is an excellent income stream for the company. \n\nMSFT have been pushing Halo as a competitive title with... minimal successes. But, the title has massive consumer appeal, so the right iteration of the game and the right market could create brilliant conditions. \n\nAMZN own Twitch. This is your best bet. Every pundit and talking head always say \"Well it'll be big when it's on TV\". No. Fuck TV. Twitch is the best platform for esports and will continue to be used for it. The amount of non-esports content is skyrocketing as well. \n\nTencent (0700 on HKG) own Riot (publisher of LoL), have a big stake in ATVI, and are even rumored to be poised to buy stakes in even more developers. They're currently working to bring CoD to the Chinese market, which could be a big play. \n\nValve are privately held, so rip. \n\nYour only other potential play would be buying into sponsors, hoping that it the profits from esports (they're small right now) grow over time (we're talking a long fucking hold here). Some good ones would be HTC (2498 on TPE), TMUS, YUM, KO, INTC. \n\nTl;dr - ATVI, AMZN, 0700, TMUS, INTC","name":"t1_cymsx0u","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-05 16:06:23","week":1}

Back when I started there were easier methods of MS, such as Amazon Payments and Target RedCard, but you can still use SERVE if you google that / check these forums.  You can also buy gift cards to places you plan to shop at anyways, and essentially 'pre load' your future spending on a card you need to meet a Min Spend on.  \n\nYou can buy gift cards at an Office Supply or Grocery Store - whichever gives you 3x or 5x points (or 2x) - and then sell the cards on CraigsList/CardPool/ Ebay / FB etc...  and the fee you incur from Ebay etc should be just about off set by the discount you got at the time of purchase, per your card points.

I just bought 4 kitchen knives and a pair of kitchen shears for about $120 on Amazon. I bought them all separately. They are all Victorinox, made in Switzerland and are often used in professional kitchens. They are not works of art but rather tools for preparing food. A lot of people spend $100+ on crappy quality kitchen knives sets and never use most of them. Just get a chefs knife, paring knife, serrated bread/slicer and a fillet knife. You could have these for many many years if you take care of them. As far as cookware goes, my fiancée and I bought a blemished Le Creuset 6qt dutch oven at TJ Maxx for $80, they are normally $250-$300. This is the kind of thing you will hand down to your grand kids. We make pasta in it, roasts, you can fry in it and do so much more. For pots and pans I just get industrial quality. They are $25-$40 and are build tough, not pretty. Never spend a lot on non stick cookware, it will not last anyway. My opinion may be the unpopular one on this sub but I believe in buying the best you can afford for things that you will use day in and day out.

{"id":"cyn6upd","author":"sulandra","body":"&gt; I assume you don't object to asking your neighbor to help pay for capital improvement projects, transportation, and national defense? \n\nThis is a totally different issue.  National defense requirements are in the constitution.  This is a legal requirement as a part of this government going back 200+ years.\n\nAnd the national defense and capital improvement project benefit everyone in this society (with varying degrees).  A personal surgery for your own personal benefit isn't benefitting your neighbor.  If I am a prisoner with a state issued health insurance policy and I demand a sex change to achieve my real personal identity, is that a benefit to society who ultimately pays for it?\n\n&gt; I'd like it to be substantially higher than ER-only coverage. Regarding your emphasis on \"unlimited\" - the difficult question to wrestle with reagarding the ACA's removal of coverage limits becomes how to define \"essential health benefits\" for which benefit caps have been removed.\n\nPull up the bill and read it.  Read what is a \"qualifying plan\" under the act.  They specifically lay out all the areas of coverage that are required in a plan that makes it a qualifying plan for tax purposes (under the purview of the IRS and the law), such that the plan has a lot of requirements.  It's a very high quality plan.\n\nAnd the issue is *way* more complicated than a simple dollar amount.  Because $200,000 in medical costs to save a cancer patient at age 17 means something very different to saving a 79 year old with few months/years remaining.  That 17 year will work and pay taxes the rest of their life.  They have a different meaning to society than the 79 year old.  That's just a reality of the math.\n\nAll we've done as a society is create a nice set of revenues (new patients with high quality plans) for the healthcare industry, done nothing to address costs, and the whole thing is going to have to get resolved through mandates, centralized government pricing which is a disgrace in this internet information age.\n\nIf you (or anyone) thinks it makes sense to have a panel [(the IPAB - Independent Payment Advisory Board)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Payment_Advisory_Board) determining drug pricing, angioplasty procedure costs, MRI costs, etc. in a centralized/socialist model while the average consumer walks up and down the aisle of Walmart comparing prices in their smartphone to Amazon.com, you are a flipping fool.  Obamacare is ultimately a textbook economic example for misallocation of monies and capital.  It's a situation where douchebags in Washington DC (both R and D) think they know better than the average consumer, so let's give out freebie tax credits, drag everyone into the system until they have nowhere else to go, then we'll unionize all nurses/docs (who will depend on the payout schemes dictated by DC), and then everyone depends on the central policy makers with poor pricing/spending decision making.\n\nWorst bill in the last 50 years of this country by far.\n\n\n&gt; It seems like where we disagree is how high to set the net. I'd like it to be substantially higher than ER-only coverage. \n\nWhy?  The great thing about this country is choice and consumer control of the economy.  When you take that away, you get poor investment decisions and waste monies.  I'll tell you (or anyone), the day that I get Stage IV cancer I don't want any cancer treatment for $250,000 that is going to prolong my life by 4 months.  I'd rather take that $250 K and give it to my family and say, \"It's been great.  Take this money and live your life and do something with it.  I'm out of here folks!\"  Instead, because I'm not paying for it and I'm effectively taking it from others, I am completely incentivized to spend as much as possible on cancer therapy.  I know the statistics.  We're all going to die at some point.  Why is it sensible to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 6 months of life for a process that will eek out an extra few months?  Yet that's what our healthcare system rewards, because it's not a personal expense to you, me or the family we're apart of.

Obviously, it *was* a great promotion, but I honestly think it led to so much overspending for a lot of people. I have no doubt that some people have a need for $1500.00 worth of Amazon credit, but I think a lot of people just justified that kind of overspending simply because they wanted to take advantage of the 10%. The same thing happens with Amex offers, especially offers for overpriced department stores (Saks). \n\nA good deal isn't a good deal if you never needed to spend the money in the first place and/or you have no legitimate plan to resell the items.

With a pay-monthly, you book the revenue now and add an asset for the interest payments. \n\nHowever, the risk of not being paid remains the same. in fact, with layaway the risk is somewhat lower because you don't lose possession of the product and it is possible to sell the thing if the buyer fails to pay up in full.

{"id":"cynbtja","author":"shankems2000","body":"All credit to /u/ArchivisX as this is a copy paste from a saved thread:\n\nGet into IT. The quickest route is probably to self-study yourself into an RHCE. Less than $100 in books, $400 in certs, and 2-3 months of your time and you could pick up an RHCE. If you're not making $60k on that alone, you'll pick up $40k with ease and be making $60k at your next job within 1-2 years. You'll be making $80-100k with 3-5 years experience depending on where you live/move.\n\nIf you look on Amazon, you'll find Michael Jang writes some of the best material out there, able to get you from zero to passing the exam, with labs and all.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Certification-Practice-Virtual-Machines-Second/dp/007184208X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435195588&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=michael+jang+rhce\nThis is an example of one of his books. The last one I picked up was for the RHCE on RHEL 6. Red Hat only allows people to certify on 7 now. I would look for Michael Jang's books on RHEL 7 for the RHCE/RHCSA tests (RHCE is greater than RHCSA).\nHis books generally include a disc that has lab materials on them. The lab materials can be done within CentOS (about 99% identical to Red Hat and when doing the labs). CentOS is free. You can load it as a lightweight VM in Oracle Virtualbox (also free). So aside from the book, the OS, the VM, etc., is all free. Legit free, not pirated free.\nOnce you're ready to certify, you can go to Red Hat's website and local for a testing center. It cost me $400 + travel (90 minutes to the closest center for me) to get my cert. But why RHCE? Why not some other route? Because Linux Admins are in demand. I have no degree. I've never been to college. All I have are some certs and some experience and I get probed by recruiters daily by e-mail (non-spam, individual), and weekly by phone call. I haven't had a soft offer of less than $80k in over a year. By soft offer, I mean, a ball-park figure of salary being discussed at the first point of contact. I can usually negotiate $90-100k out of most places.\nI'm willing to personally walk someone through getting started if a person is willing to go through the steps to learn, order themselves one of the books I listed and begin the process of going through the material. It is dry. It is boring. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but if you can understand everything in his book(s) to pass the RHCE, I know you're capable of doing 90% of what it takes to be a Linux Admin.\nThe exam consists of you sitting in an actual lab, with a camera watching over you. You're given a set of tasks to complete. There are no questions. You have no idea if you're right or wrong. When you finish the exam, you're given a score which may as well be as good as pass or fail, because it doesn't tell you where or how you fucked up, but if you follow that book, you'll be able to pass.\n\nGood Luck OP","name":"t1_cynbtja","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-05 23:39:24","week":1}

{"id":"cynlxj9","author":"Starkpo","body":"Here's a question to consider:\n\nYou can borrow $5,000 at a 30% interest rate. Or, you can borrow $5,000 at a 2% interest rate. Which of those do you believe leads you to having more money long-term, and which would you choose?\n\nYou seem pretty bright based on your post, so I'm going to assume you rightly recognize that the 30% loan is WAY worse for your money than the 2% loan; it's going to cost you more long-term (by a gigantic margin) and thus it would be better to get the 2% loan instead.\n\nThe reason I ask this is because you have about $5,000 in credit card debt, but you're worried about taking on student loans. The interest rates I proposed are approximately what you'd pay for credit cards (30%) and student loans (2%). I don't know your actual numbers, so they might vary, but you're going to pay a lot less on student loans than basically any credit card.\n\nMy recommendation? Keep an emergency cushion of $1,000 in cash (there's your Dave Ramsey), and use the rest to pay off whichever credit card has the highest interest rate. OR, if you it makes you feel better, use it to pay off the credit card with the lowest balance so you can knock a few credit cards out right away and increase your cash flow. Do whichever makes you feel better. If you need to take on student loans to pay for school, that's going to save you money long-term compared to holding onto that debt.\n\nSecond, you have a minor debt problem. It's not huge, trust me (lots of r/pf posters would LOVE to only owe $5,000), but I understand that it's scary/feels bad to you. How can you tackle it? The same way you solve any \"need money\" problem: increase the money you earn, and decrease the money you spend.\n\nI've got to say, for being so young you've got your head on pretty straight. Sure you had some bad luck and that sucks, but it's a pretty small step and you can get through it. I'm not sure if you're currently in school or not, but if not you're only working 25 hours/week; time to increase that. If the grocery store won't let you? Time to find a second part-time job before school starts (you can quit later). Consider it the job that will pay off your bills and let you save up some for college, and try to work as much as possible.\n\nSecond job not possible? I'm going to trust if you say that that you're being honest and not just afraid of the thought of doing more work. If that's the case, time to find a side hustle. What skills do you have? What are you capable of? Find something you can do on the side for extra cash. Amazon Turk, web development, editing for hire, writing content for a content mill...I can't speak to what your skillsets are, but those are all possibilities for things you can do to generate some side income. Find something you're comfortable doing and put all the money from doing it towards paying off your debts.\n\nOnce you get the debt paid off you're right to start saving up for school and/or a used car to replace the clunker you're driving. Work as many hours as you can for as long as you can before school. While you're working, cut the expenses you can (though it sounds like you're living pretty frugally).\n\nFollow those steps and you should be in okay shape barring anymore bad luck.","name":"t1_cynlxj9","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-06 04:03:10","week":1}

Unfortunately for me, I live in the extreme northeast so I don't benefit from being centrally located to save on shipping. My goal would obviously be to maximize the number of items per box however I have no control over what items Amazon wants in each location.  As you said, inventory placement may make sense for me until I get some experience with the process. I'm not as concerned with margin or timeframe to return my cash as most others are.  A 25% ROI per year would make me more than happy. Flipping is something that I do for \"fun\" as I don't rely on any income from the hobby. If it gets to the point where it isn't fun anymore I'll simply walk away.\nYour shipping costs of $.25-$.50 per pound is helpful.

Both offer unlimited 1.5% cash back on all spending and have no Foreign Transaction Fee (great card for travelling since other cards will charge 1-3% of each transaction overseas as a fee)\n\nYour BankAmericard has different tiers and no AF.

Read more about it [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Discover-It). Not extremely useful overseas, as Discover isn't even accepted everywhere domestically, far less overseas except I believe in some Asian countries. Best to carry a backup card with no FTF. Discover usually includes Amazon in its rotating categories, so if you shop there a lot this card could be useful.\n\nYour Amex Everyday also has no AF.

Head over to /r/churning and read the wiki in the sidebar to get a good idea of which card would suit your needs best, since cash back is generally considered the lowest value in rewards (1cpp or cent per point, some cards and travel partners can net up to 15cpp or more if redeemed the right way), and many cards have sign up bonuses that let you bank those rewards points faster to pay for your airfare or hotel stays.","name":"t1_cynx0cq","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-06 12:15:58","week":1}

{"id":"cyoakdm","author":"MuppetZoo","body":"Fidelity is nice to work with - they were about the 3rd brokerage/401K I had and I've since consolidated all but two other accounts over to them.  I've genuinely found the people I've talked to on the phone to provide good advice and they've never tried to upsell me into things I don't want.  You can call Fidelity and talk with someone about what you want to do and what they'd recommend.  You'll likely end up with a separate brokerage account in addition to your 401K, but both accounts can be managed through the same online portal.\n\nRegarding mutual funds: a mutual fund is just a collection of other investments.  An index fund is very simple - it's a collection of stocks that track an index.  So the major indexes that everyone knows are the Dow Jones index, the S&amp;P index and NASDAQ.  There's a million other indexes out there, but most people generally agree the S&amp;P is about the right one to use to track the stock market as a whole.  An advantage of index funds is they typically have very low fees because management is stupid simple - they just buy stocks when they are added to the index and sell them when they're removed, which doesn't happen that often.  \n\nOther mutual funds might track a different kind of collection of stocks, for example something maybe called \"Large Cap Equity\".  Basically what that means is a fund like that will hold large companies that some mutual fund manager thinks will do good.  They actively buy and sell stocks that fall into that category and try to maximize how much money is made.  Those mutual funds are actively managed and as a result you'll generally pay a higher fee than index funds.  The key with those kinds of funds is to look at the major holdings - for example, if you want some Google stock and Amazon and General Electric, you'll probably find a large cap mutual fund that owns those, so investing in that mutual fund is an easy way to own those stocks.  \n\nFinally, you have a target date fund - those funds are actively managed by a manager to include stocks that some fund manager thinks will do very well while balancing it with the risk of those stocks.  For example, Tesla is a riskier company to own compared to Ford, so in a 2055 target fund you might find Tesla, but in a 2025 fund you might find Ford.  \n\nFinally, history has shown that index funds perform roughly the same or slightly better than actively managed funds over very long periods of time.  However, from year to year an actively managed fund might do much better than a particular index or much worse.  This is where diversification comes into play - you can probably do better than having an index fund or a target fund by having a collection of other kinds of mutual funds, but you need to crunch numbers to see if the extra fees/expenses are worth it, understand your risk, etc.  For your 401K right now, you're probably fine.\n\nFinally, the last thing is to just forego the mutual fund and buy and sell stocks yourself.  This is much harder to make money at, but it can be a real learning experience.  If you're thinking of going to Vegas and blowing a $1000, you might want to consider buying a stock instead and learning why it goes up and down and when to sell or not sell it.  In the beginning it seems more akin to gambling than investing.  \n\nBack to your goals: getting out of a 40-hour a week job is a good goal to have.  The irony is when you do that you'll likely find yourself working 80 hours a week.  However, you probably work at a company right now where you can learn how a business works.  Take advantage of that opportunity.  Can you find the balance sheet for your company?  Will one of the accounting managers explain to you how it works?  What does the P&amp;L look like for your department?  What does it look like for the whole company?  Learn to manage people.  Learn to negotiate.  (Go negotiate yourself a raise - most people are afraid to ask, but really it's something you should be able to negotiate.)  How do you write a business plan? Learning that finance side is both useful for when you invest in a company or start your own, it's also useful for investing in stocks.

AMZN Prime is a mental hurdle for a lot of people. A lot of shoppers at wal-mart aren't exactly bright\n\n2) Shipping -- If you live in a poverty neighborhood, you don't get shit shipped to you your house constantly. \n\n3) Instant -- there are shoppers (older ones) who prefer instant gradifcatrion when something is bought. They also like to look at what their buying physically. \n\n4) Pricing -- Amazon is known to shift pricing depending on your computer habits, time of month, location etc. www.camelcamelcamel.com can help you figure that out if you're paying the best price Amazon has offered right now.

{"id":"cyoeufd","author":"phearlez","body":"Here's the cranky (pointless) email I sent the complaintant:\n\n&gt;Hi,\n\n&gt;Amazon has suspended my seller account over an inaccurate complaint from your email address. Over 8 months ago I sold off a few dozen NoseFridas I’d originally purchased from [redacted]. They were in no way counterfeit/inauthentic, as your claim states, and I have not had any for sale in the time since. So not only was this claim incorrect, it was irrelevant since I don’t have the items anymore and no indication I will have any more.\n\n&gt;Quite frankly I do not understand why this was submitted nor can I see that you have any basis to conclude that the items were not authentic. For one, they most certainly were authentic, and two, since you didn’t buy any from me you don’t have any reason to think otherwise. This claim is at best ignorant and and worst deliberately fraudulent.\n\n&gt;Given that, please contact notice@amazon.com and withdraw the complaint so I can go about my life without expending further effort on this.

FB, AMZN, NFLX all have earnings right now and have some decent path to continue to increase those earnings. Disagree with the growth rate, but comparing them to .com busts like etoys, flooze, and pets.com is disingenuous.\n\nIf you were not paying attention during that time period it is hard to describe how insane it was.

{"id":"cyohq2o","author":"dvdmovie1","body":"\"Are you investing in oil?\"\n\nNo. I may add to Blackstone from the standpoint of I believe that Blackstone has considerable cash to invest in distressed energy plays. Meanwhile, the big oil companies are trying to do whatever they can to make sure the all-important dividend stays, while that money actually could go to purchasing assets on the cheap. I may add to pipelines, but I do not have interest in investing in producers.\n\n\"Do you think this is the year for Twitter/Yelp/other internet sites?\"\n\nSigh. Please, enough with Twitter and Yelp. People have to realize that hyped names can often turn out to be just that - hype. When things change, don't keep trying to give these kind of things second, third, fourth, fifth chances.  People go, \"oh, what about Periscope.\" I don't care about Twitter in the first place, but if management can't do well with the core product, why should I have confidence that they will handle Periscope well? Twitter may get bought, but that's no guarantee and if, we have no idea of when or at what price. That's really not a compelling reason for me to invest in a business that has been mediocre at very best.\n\n  I wish people would stop putting so much focus on hype; see what's happened to GoPro and Fitbit, among other things (look at the chart of DDD; the hype and when hype cooled and all of the people who probably kept trying to pick bottoms for the bounce that really never happened.) Shake Shack going to $90 is another. Ridiculous, hype-driven (and short squeeze, probably) move and then the momentum runs out - it's now back to the $30's in short order. \n\nBuy things that have at least a moderate-to-wide moat/high barriers to entry. Don't get caught up in hype.\n\n\"Does Netflix get crushed by the fact that they have no margin and increasing costs of content?\"\n\nNetflix's valuation is absurdity, but it will come back to reality at some point. Again, I don't want to have to sit there and time that eventuality, that's just immensely unappealing to me. If I miss NFLX, I am so okay with that. \n\n\"Does Amazon purchase Wal-mart and UPS to make their retail domination complete?\"\n\nNeither is realistic. Whether Amazon goes further into developing its logistics side like they have been lately is a question, but I highly doubt they purchase UPS and there's no way on this planet that they are buying WMT.\n\nPersonally, this year I continue to like the toll roads (V/MA) and companies that have demonstrated exceptional track records over time, including things like Danaher (DHR). My thing is really buying things for 5 or more years out - strong, consistent businesses that I have confidence in and that I think will be relevant in the years to come.

{"id":"cyonkh2","author":"greyenlightenment","body":"We've been hearing these 'tech stocks are overvalued!' arguments since at least 2012, yet prices keep going up. \n\nThere are a couple things to keep in mind: we're seeing a flight to quality, with fewer yet high-quality names (Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft,  Google, etc) participating in the post-2009 tech bull markets whereas in the late 90's, during the tech bubble, the buying with indiscriminate, which ended badly. Now Wall St. and VC is not making that mistake again, choosing instead to pile into the best of the best and [selling-off](http://greyenlightenment.com/surviving-the-schizophrenic-market/) the rest.  \n\nThe aforementioned stocks (Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft,  Google, etc)  have market dominance, rapidly growing earnings, strongly positive cash flows, high profits margins, and few viable competitors. In the web 2.0 scene, Air BNB, Snapchat, Dropbox, Uber and Slack also qualify as having strong growth (or projected growth) and market dominance, which is why they are valued so richly and will continue to become more valuable in coming years. Internet stocks are rising a tailwind due to the booming mobile advertising advertising market. As for web 2.0 unicorns, profitability right now is less important than the ability to generate profits. Many successful web 2.0 companies like Snapchat are intentionally delaying  revenue build their userbases, but inventors are confident that should Snapchat 'flip' the switch and go 'live' with their ad platform, they too will do well like Facebook and Instagram, which have had great success with mobile advertising. \n\nPE ratios are not that important if fundamentals remain strong. Amazon has done so well, for example, that someone who bought in 1999 at the very peak would still have a 13% compounded yearly return if he sold today. Pretty amazing. Google had a PE ratio of close to 100 in 2005 after its IPO; is has surged 1,300% since then and the PE ratio is only around 20. BIDU had a PE ratio of 1600 shortly after going public in 2005; the shares have since rallied 1,500% and the PE ratio is only 40. There are many other examples. In the late 90's, companies such as Pets.com and Theglobe.com that had inherently flawed business models were bid to the stratosphere - these were companies with business models that had negative cash flows, with no hope of profitability. As part of how capitalism is getting [smarter](http://greyenlightenment.com/the-collapse-of-capitalism-can-wait/), nowadays, such companies wouldn't even get past the VC seed round, let alone go pubic. \n\nAlso, the PE ratio of the Nasdaq is only around 20 instead of &gt;100 in 2000.\n\nSo I'm not too concerned.

{"id":"cyoqixv","author":"kid_cisco","body":"You don't need to do any of the stuff that you think you do. You definitely need to do a lot more research and reading about starting a small business before you start asking questions but I'll help you out with the stuff you mentioned as best I can. \n\nFirst and only necessary thing you need to do is get a business license with your state/city and sign up with your states dept of revenue to legally conduct biz. You can file taxes using your social security number for now so you don't need a tax id - your ssn is your tax id. Later if you incorporate, need business credit or are trying to separate the business from your personal stuff then you can get a EIN. You also do not need to trademark anything - it's not necessary. I would wait until you've proven your concept and made some $$ before you spend the $200-ish dollars on registering your mark (which is fairly simple, btw). For now concentrate on getting your product/brand right and making some sales, getting a business license so you can legally conduct business, and that's it. Since you speak about selling at an event, any money you get is considered income and will be taxed. You will be able to reduce this burden by writing off expenses and deducting certain certain things (price your paying for your product, event space rental, office supplies, marketing material, etc). 1099 doesn't apply to you unless you are hiring contract labor to help you and only if you pay them more than $600. You have a lot of work to do, I'd recommend picking up a beginner business book off Amazon and start from there (sorry I can't recommend any right now but possibly \"Starting and Running a Business for Dummies\" could be a good, barebones, easy read).

{"id":"cyp4inm","author":"absoluteskeptic","body":"&gt;think theyre going out of business or something\n\nThey certainly could.  One or two outbreaks and the source is known is one thing, but they've had eight hepatitis, norovirus, E. coli, and Salmonella outbreaks (and happening in multiple restaurants in multiple states).  The most recent was from an employee pressured to work even though the manager knew he was sick and against health codes.\n\nThis all leads to a corporate culture that is rotten.  They've done a good job until recently marketing themselves as healthy and environmentally conscious, but that's been pissed away.  \n\nIn 2014 they had an income of $1 billion on sales of $4.1 b.  1783 restaurants in 2014.  So each restaurant had an average net income of 560,000 and sales of $2.3 million.  Mc Donalds averages sales of $2.5 million per store, there are 36,300 Mc Donalds franchises and valued at 109 billion.  So, each is worth about $3 million.  But each Chipotle is valued at $7.85 million at $426 a share.  At the height of $758 a share each restaurant had a value of $15 million!  Keep in mind Mc Donalds has recently had a 20% jump in value (and pays a decent dividend), but profit margins and sales per store are roughly the same.  If you look into other fast food restaurants, the same more or less holds up.  As long as same stores sales are down (37% for December) Chipotle can't really make profits.\n\nIn addition, they've been doing share buybacks priced around $550.  So, that's something like $50 million thrown in the garbage.  That's assuming the price doesn't continue to fall.  Since 3Q 2013 when it was in the $430 range they've done $200 million in buybacks.  So, probably a total of $75 million wasted (or 1/5 of total after tax profits for a year).  Chipolte isn't Microsoft or Yahoo, it can't really throw away 10's of millions and expect to do well.\n\nIt was priced as a high flyer with a loyal fan base, akin to Amazon.  But, now it's not going to expand, perhaps contract this year, so it should be priced like Mc Donalds, but it'll take awhile before same store sales return, if ever.  So per restaurant value should be perhaps 2/3 of Mc Donalds.  That would put it at $150 per share.\n\nSo that's my guess for a June price, add in the bear market, any more outbreaks, lawsuits, and perhaps even get bought out.  Should be interesting.","name":"t1_cyp4inm","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-07 08:57:51","week":1}
{"id":"cyp4jhn","author":"quarrydonkey","body":"Throwaway account here.  I don't necessarily work for Macy's but I had opportunities to ask questions to Macy's sr. leadership so I'm not totally making this shit up.\n\nTheir biggest issue, imo, is the faster than expected shift in customer behavior.  It used to be dept. stores are the anchor stores in malls.  People go to the mall to shop at dept. stores and then visit other stores.  that's now completely turned over.  All new malls emphasize lifestyle and experience needs that you can't get online: restaurants, snack bars, movies, etc.  They're not dumb and they saw this trend going on since 2010 and they've been investing a lot in their online capabilities, which has experienced 25-40% growth every year for the past 5 years, that's phenomenal.  However, that's not enough to compensate for the sudden drop of their store revenue.  The warm winter and strong dollar (their big stores rely on tourists for a good percentage of the sales, strong dollar means more expensive for tourists to come to US) by themselves can be dealt with but in this case, they're just enough to tip Macy's over the edge.\n\nThe other big problem they're facing is inability to attract new customers.  Their customer base is aging and they can't attract new younger customers.  In the long term, this is the killer.  It's the fundamental's fundamental to grow your customer base, or not to let it shrink.  There are various thoughts why this is a challenge.   I think it's a culture problem.  Everywhere you look inside a Macy's store, the merchandise assortment, the associates, the display, the atmosphere, are just not hip and cool. When they try to be cool, it's as painful as seeing your parents trying to rap. \n\nLastly, the business model of dept. store is just so old and busted.  Dept. stores used to be cool since you can go to one place and get most of what your household need: clothes, furniture, kitchen stuff, cosmetics, etc.  Macy's even used to sell electronics.  Can you imagine starting a new company today with that model knowing there's this thing called Amazon that has the largest assortment in the world  -- ok maybe besides AliBaba -- but there's no way you should do that unless you have something differentiation like Costco.   \n\n","name":"t1_cyp4jhn","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-01-07 08:59:08","week":1}

I realize now that the Chase Sapphire is way better so I'm working toward changing my banking to Chase (and take advantage of a $300 checking account bonus there).  So my question is, do I apply for yet another Chase card in either United or Southwest now in anticipation of buying airfare or go with something like the Chase Sapphire or Capital One Venture in a few months after this more recent credit card hit.\n\nOf course, how bad really is it to have multiple credit cards with one bank? Both my amazon and disney cards have respectable limits so I'm just worried that they'll reject me for having too many cards with them. Thanks for help and sorry for the long intro post.\n","name":"t1_cypdz91","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-01-07 16:33:29","week":1}

{"id":"cypmsrw","author":"grimmz77","body":"Never resell limited edition consoles for games. There's never enough interest for them to sell out. Hell, neither of the COD consoles from Sony or Microsoft sold out before release. If they didn't, not much hope for ones for games that'll definitely sell less.\nThe worth of a collector's edition really can't be based off of anything but hype and content. Number rarely means anything. The Mortal Kombat X Coarse Edition that you bought would have never made you a profit, or at least nothing worth the trouble, even if you sold it the day it came out last April. A lot of fans never liked the Coarse Edition because of it's cartoonish style. There was another collector's edition of MKX that cost more than the Coarse Edition. It was the Amazon Import Edition. That CE was exclusive to Europe, and Amazon was selling it to those in the U.S. that wanted a more detailed model of Scorpion. I saw a few go for around $300 on release day.\nDon't worry about number and don't find value in anything just because it calls itself a \"collector's edition\". The only things that matter is how much hype the community has for the game and how hungry they are for anything related to it, especially when that thing is over that $60 price tag for said game that they've hyped up as the \"greatest thing of all time\"e ven though they've never played it. Sales numbers, gaming forums, and even the comments and likes on a post about a game will tell you how excited people are and how much a collector's edition will mean to fans.","name":"t1_cypmsrw","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-07 20:02:58","week":1}

Build a good volume of monthly traffic and monetize either with google adsense or amazon affiliates.  The marketing part which you said you dislike may be difficult but you could use your presence on amazon to promote your tips/techniques on your website itself.  \nAll in all I would recommend a website because it doesn't cost a lot to build and their is so much opportunity online to make income without having to sell a single product.  As long as their are eyes looking at your online property then money is ready to be made.  This is the strategy I took and built a few websites myself.

I even bought some cards and gift wrap but that's not keeping the doors open when I bought all the books, Coffee makers, photo frames, clothes, and gift cards from Amazon.  It doesn't matter how much Target tells me they have discounted that Keurig if I look on Amazon and see it's $10 cheaper. For your theory to work the big box stores need to actually undercut Amazon on the big stuff then get me on the fluff. Otherwise, Amazon is going to create a LOT of vacant real estate across the world. ","name":"t1_cyqpmh2","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-08 17:15:07","week":1}

We primarily sell clothing, but we have sold everything from cutlery sets to dust masks simply because they were a good deal and we have the logistical infrastructure to distribute them. \n\nI think the marketplaces are a great place to start as they can give you pretty consistent turnover from just a few products, and then with this flow (and little bit of profit), you are able to expand into other things.

{"id":"cyrgfhw","author":"80spizzarat","body":"Relatively new at this, but...\n\nWent to St. Vincent's thrift shop earlier this evening. It's about 5 minutes from where I live. I have T-Mobile and their data service here is beyond shitty so I'm basically flying blind. It works great in the big city about an hour away where most of the thrift stores are. Last time I was at SV I made a bad buy because I couldn't check prices. It wasn't a horrible one since I only paid $8, but that and the ridiculous prices they put on some things made me wary. I picked up a Dell ink cartridge because I had a feeling about it, put back a Brother toner cartridge because they wanted $10 and did some browsing through the \"fill a bag section for $1\" in back. They had a Sweet Pickles ceramic bank that I wasn't sure about so I left it behind.\n\nIt's literally faster for me to run home and get on my Wi-Fi than it is to look up stuff in the store. So I brought the Dell cartridge home and looked up the toner. Almost fell out of my chair when I saw the MSRP is $75 and it goes for $50 on Amazon. Got back in the car and hauled ass down there and managed to squeak in just before they closed to snag it. Then I looked up the bank and saw another one that went for $50.\n\nThat damn bank had better be there tomorrow morning.

{"id":"cyrh4ud","author":"jmp242","body":"Don't get a Toaster Oven. If you can afford it, get a NuWave Oven. It's a totally better substitute for a Toaster Oven. Easier to clean, faster to heat, cooks stuff I never would have tried in a toaster oven, cooks stuff sort of like fake grilling for some things, all around I'm super impressed. Get one from a BJs if they have one for $99, otherwise, Amazon...\n\nSlow cookers and Pressure Cookers are different things. Slow cookers are cheap, Pressure Cookers ... probably shouldn't be cheap IMO. There are some combo devices though, so maybe they're OK. Personally I use Kuhn Rikon on my stove top, but that's probably overkill.\n\nFor pans, I like Cooks International - very high quality while not being super expensive - not the cheapest either though. I just went stainless steel, which if you oil doesn't stick much and lasts better in a dishwasher. Also isn't going to flake teflon or aluminium into your food which is a plus.\n\nPyrex or Anchor Hawking for glassware. They're not special, but seem to last ok - I've yet to have one fail bought across decades (I inherited some, I bought some in the last 5 years)...\n\nCutlery Set... Most people say sets are a waste of money. I like them well enough, and if you have the money I recommend Wustof Classic - NOT gourmet, they look similar but are very different. I just got the biggest set, and it's... more unwieldy that it appears online, and is super overkill. It's probably more useful for the \"wow\" factor when people see it than for actual use. You should be able to get a chef knife and a small knife set for about $200 or so, and they ought to last forever, unless stolen or hit with a hammer or something. Get a honing device - I like the Rada one on Amazon because it's sort of cheating, super cheap and you don't have to know how to hold the angles, and you almost never need to actually sharpen a knife. \n\nFor silverware, which you might also have meant, I really found dollar store stuff as good as Oneida, but I've never really tried \"expensive\" silverware. Not really sure what benefit there would be for forks, spoons and butter knifes. I've never had one wear out, and it's rare to bend any if you're even slightly careful.\n\nI don't really go for special Oil's - I find for cooking the Sams Club general Olive Oil or Canola Oil as good as anything. Now for dipping sauces I sometimes will get garlic infused extra virgin etc...\n\nAre you going to do any baking? I would guess not, but if you're interested in stand mixers you owe it to yourself to realize there's a whole world out there beyond KitchenAid - many better IMHO. I love my Bosch Universal Plus for instance. If you do get a stand mixer, many are a whole kitchen machine - i.e. you can use the base with a blender, food processor, slicer, juicers, grain mills, flakers, etc etc... So consider that before buying a bunch of specific products. For Instance, I got the Blendtech before the Bosch - but the Bosch blender is probably 90% of a Blendtech for about 30% of the price (for just the attachment)... And I'd have one less appliance base. Then again, the Blendtech is awesome, but I don't use it enough really - but there's very little it can't blend. I actually find my old, cheap, stick blender more useful. I got an upmarket Le Equip and use it for the little food processor and whisk - it's actual blender part is pretty crap IMHO. If I find myself needing to replace the old cuisinart, I'm going to break down and buy a Bamix.\n\nSpatula - if you get stainless steel cookware, see if you can get a metal spatula - it'll be easier to ease under stuff because it can be thinner but have the same strength as thicker plastic, and it'll probably never break. And it won't hurt other stainless steel. Not having to baby the pans is amazing, coming from traditional non-stick and hard anodized aluminium. \n\nI'd think if you're cooking - will you have any freezer storage? If so, or if you're adventurous (sous vide in your bathtub? I do!) you'll want to consider a Vacuum Sealer. Food Saver is space efficient (I don't have a feeling for how much room you'll have), but will need replacing semi frequently - depending on use. We garden, and do near commercial quantities of packaging, filling 25 cu ft of freezer space with sealed vegetables every year, along with re-packaging club packs, and other things. Used more sparingly, Food Savers are fine. I moved up to a VacMaster 112 though, and it is much better, IMO. It's also huge and weighs 50lbs, so . . .\n\nAir Bake cookie trays? Anything you want to bake from rolls to cookies will use one of these. You might cheat with aluminium foil and the NuWave though at a much smaller scale. The cheap cookie trays always burn on the bottom unless you use 2 of them to emulate the air bakes...\n\nI'm probably forgetting something, but everything listed, save the Food Saver and NuWave have lasted for me, for years. I see no reason why they wouldn't last for at least a decade, some effectively forever. I.e the BUP, pyrex, Wustof etc if cared for should last a lifetime...","name":"t1_cyrh4ud","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-01-09 05:11:14","week":1}

{"id":"cyrlmo2","author":"madsci","body":"My niche products are things I saw a need for and knew how to make.  Well, 'need' isn't even the right word for some.  \"I'm pretty sure people would buy this if I made one\" has been good enough sometimes.  (In fact one of those products is chilling in the Kibo module on the space station right now and waiting to get tossed out an airlock.  No one else makes that particular type of camera module.)\n\nOne of my more successful products exists because the couple of options out there were really lackluster.  Poor build quality, lacking in functions.  It has some Chinese competition on Amazon now (that ripped off my ad copy and parts of my user's manual!) but it's still not as good, and much of the market for that particular gadget has a strong preference for buying American made products.  I'm planning to get my product on Amazon at some point and I'll see how that goes.\n\nSome of my products (it's all electronic stuff) are partially built by a contract manufacturer.  We handle the rest of the assembly and order fulfillment in-house.\n\nI built my own site, but it was a pain in the ass to get it the way I wanted it (this was with osCommerce back in 2005) and that was with a decade of IT and development experience under my belt.\n\nIf you're not coming up with an original product, I suppose you'll need to look at marketing it in a novel way or to a different demographic if you're going to stand out.

{"id":"cyrumbf","author":"specificmission","body":"In the last two months I've discovered flipping &amp; thrifting as a viable source of income. I've created an ebay account and an Amazon seller account for FBA. I've sold a dozen or so items through ebay (mostly video games I had laying around), I have 10 solid recent, positive feedback, and I'm generally comfortable with shipping now having been a *complete* newbie starting out. For FBA, I sent in my first shipment of 35 items earlier this week and they're now just arriving at Amazon's distribution centers and I expect the items to start being listed in the next couple of days. I'm now somewhat comfortable with the FBA workflow and the shipping is silly easy, I'm mainly learning the explicits regarding used items (ie: what I should put on Amazon, vs what I should put on Ebay). \n\nNow, that's where I'm at. What my question is about is where I should be headed. \n\nI quit my job the end of last month, and I currently have around 400$ in liquid assets available. What is the quickest way to turn that around and bring in a liveable ($1200+/month) wage? I have multiple Dollar-(X)-stores in my area, a handful of Walmart/Targets, about a dozen thrift stores (who mainly deal with clothes), a half-dozen Goodwill branches, and a single Saver's. I also have been dumpster diving for years, but that is *never ever* a sure thing. \n\nIn addition, I will be selling a collection of around ~500 vintage cartridge video games for someone (I'm collecting the carts this weekend and putting them up on Ebay as soon as possible). I also have had a few people with serious collections of various \"stuff\" (some video games, some antiques, some vintage clothes) ask me to sell for them. Once I'm absolutely comfortable with selling my own stuff I plan to do consignment for these people - this shouldn't be more than a month's time off. \n\nSo, my questions:\n\n1. How quickly will I be able to make a living ($1200/month) wage for myself given my situation? What is the best possible course of action for quickest profits? Where should I invest my small and finite amount of remaining capital for maximum returns?\n\n2. For vintage video games (NES, SNES, Virtua Boy), what is better? Amazon FBA vs. Ebay? I've been using Ebay and have been successful so far (1/3 of my listed games have sold in the past 6 weeks).","name":"t1_cyrumbf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-09 17:00:52","week":1}

Since you have Sapphire you can transfer them directly to your Sapphire Ultimate Rewards where they become much more valuable since you have the options to transfer them to airline and hotel partners where you can get way better redemption rates through saver award flights.\n\nIf you're only getting 1 cent per point earn or redemption rates on Sapphire or any card then you're doing credit card rewards wrong.\n\nThat said do not carry a balance, always pay it in full.","name":"t1_cyrxaas","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-01-09 18:23:48","week":1}

{"id":"cys2snn","author":"kmully","body":"You have $400 in liquid assets and quit your job?\n\nAre you serious? What are your living costs? How are you going to pay them while you wait for Amazon or eBay to cut you a check? \n\nThis might not be a popular opinion, but you are in an incredibly tight spot and I would go get a job ASAP. You are going to run into cash flow problems pretty much... immediately.\n\nI'm going to come up with a scenario with what I'd think are generous numbers. \n\nLet's say you have a 50% breakdown between retail arbitrage at 20% return on investment and 50% thrifting with a 100% return on investment. (This is just an example, obviously everyone's numbers will be different and it will depend on what kind of finds you get, etc.) \n\nLet's also say you constantly have your $400 invested, so you're earning 60% on that $400 every time you turn over your inventory once.\n\nSo 60% of $400 is $240 in profit. Now you need to set aside 20-25% for income tax, so let's just go with 20% to be generous. That's $48. You're down to $192 in profit to reinvest plus your original $400. \n\nLet's also say you turn your inventory once every two weeks. I think that is *really* generous if you're sending into FBA plus having everything sell on eBay. But let's just go with it.\n\nHere's how many turns it takes you to get to $1,200 (per turn of inventory) in post-tax income: just six. (So 12 weeks if you turn every 2 weeks.)\n\nHowever, that means you have this much invested in inventory that sells within 2 weeks every single time:\n\n * Turn 1: $400\n * Turn 2: $592\n * Turn 3: $876.16\n * Turn 4: $1,296.72\n * Turn 5: $1,919.14\n * Turn 6: $2,840.33\n\nThat's a lot of positive assumptions to get to those numbers. You have to invest every penny back which means finding inventory that fast, you have to have zero returns, you have to have 60% return on investment across all inventory, you have to turn every 2 weeks, etc.\n\nHere's how long it takes to get to $1,200 with the following ROIs:\n\n * 60%: 6 turns\n * 50%: 7 turns\n * 40%: 9.5 turns (9 turns = $1,179)\n * 30%: 13 turns\n\nNow imagine you turn every 4 weeks... now you're looking at 6-13 months before you reach that monthly income level.\n\nIn short, $400 liquid, no job, and presumably some sort of living expenses... this is just a bad idea.

Cut back on food by switching to an Also or Bottom dollar kind of store. I would also research cheap but healthy meals to cut down on your food budget. Maybe even consider a small garden that requires very little maintenance for foods that are more expensive in your area. Around here they try to charge up to $4.99 for a tiny point of berries. We found that a block away there are raspberry bushes for free that residents can pick anytime.\n\nCellphones could probably be reduced to $80/no. Have you looked into Tmobile or Sprint? There are lots of research studies &amp; beta testing that your wife could do when she's at home. It won't be a ton of money, but you could easily pick up $500/mo in cash, Amazon credits or merchandise. Centercode is my favorite.\n\nYou could look into becoming an uber drive on the weekends to pick up some extra money. Look for sites that will sell open boxed items for things like diapers and non food items that babies need. Obviously shop at thrift stores for clothes and such. Garage sales are also great, but show restraint and only look for things you really need. Ask friends if they have baby clothes they are going to just donate. Check to see if your city has a freecycle site. Stop all of the eating out and movies and such. Let Amazon prime or Netflix be your movie replacement. Bowling off hours can be cheap. There are a ton of freebie codes available for Redbox movies. Museums and children's science centers usually have one day a month that is free. Parks and hiking trails are fun.

{"id":"cysd0rx","author":"Vycid","body":"There's not a lot else to say. I've bought distressed companies that didn't necessarily every make a comeback to normal operations, but still often walked away with huge profits.\n\nGoogle \"Graham net-net\" and \"cigar butt\". \n\nSometimes it's also a matter of buying companies which aren't distressed but distribute all of their declining cashflows (ENZN, AWLCF, etc). In this case the value proposition depends on what the discount rate is.\n\nIn general, there is no downside to this sort of strategy. If you buy a company for 80 cents that's worth a dollar and headed for liquidation, you're gonna make 25% regardless of what the market does. If there's a financial meltdown in the meantime and the market drops 40% you look like a genius. \n\nThe only way you can lose is by abandoning your convictions and value strategy because the market went up 50% or something while you were busy making 25%. This is why I tune out guys who are telling me they've made tons of money on TSLA or AMZN or NFLX or whatever. That doesn't work in the long term, and the worst time to buy is *after* the irrational run-up.","name":"t1_cysd0rx","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-01-10 01:46:34","week":1}

They limited our sales to 1000 a day from an avg of 2k and then dropped them to 25k/mo (well under 1k a day avg) after we went over their arbitrary 3% defect rate (which most were total BS). They never openly disclose the fact that they limit sales (because they'd get sued big time) ... But when your sales stay exactly the same month to month within 1K of 30,000... For a year straight... With double the employees making listings and double the inventory... It's painfully obvious. We looked at terapeak, it was high peaks and sharp valleys, the peaks almost fit perfectly into the valleys. It was sad. eBay is a has been, me-too company.

{"id":"cytcur5","author":"hoghammertroll","body":"I started off my venture of self-employment as a freelance writer, but I currently work on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and do data entry for anyone I find that's looking for it. \n\nThat said, I make a very meager income (I'm actually embarrassed to state what I make here; I'd be the laughing stock of the subreddit), which continuously fluctuates. For the last two of the three years I've been self-employed, research has been a considerably large part of my work, yet I've found few legitimate opportunities that have been worthwhile (and trust me, I've done hundreds of hours of research on opportunities to make money). Of course, the Internet is a great place to make money, but there are many more dead-ends than gold mines, unless you know what to look out for.\n\nHere's a few things I've learned over the last few years, that you should keep in mind:\n\n1. Both freelance work and crowdsourcing are potentially easy short-term money, but finding work that's worthwhile takes a bit of time, and a lot of luck, unless you've got a high-demand, niche skill or you've mastered your craft better than your competition.\n\n2. Don't even bother with the freelance websites (Freelancer, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Upwork, etc). When I first got into the freelance game a few years ago, the market was already rife with cheap \"employers\" and more than enough third-world workers to give said employers a veritable buffet of dirt-cheap labor. \n\n3. Nowadays, those websites also make it damn near impossible to break into the game, what with having a limit in the amount of jobs you can bid on per month and whatnot. Of course, you could always just pay for more \"bids\" (I've heard you've gotta spend money to make money, but imagine having to pay money to apply for a job; seems a bit counter-intuitive, no?).\n\n4. There is absolutely no shortage of work on the Internet, but there is definitely a shortage in *worthwhile* work. Some months are amazing, while others are... -shudder-\n\nFor example, this year in April, over the span of two weeks, I managed to pull in over $800 from Mechanical Turk, and another private crowdsourcing platform (this is also one of my best earning months to date since I quit freelance writing). The following month, I struggled to pull in $400 for the entire month. The reason? Lack of worthwhile work. \n\nNow, when I say worthwhile, I mean work that pays out to *at least* minimum wage. Minimum wage where I live was $7.50/hr until recently, meaning I'd have to be able to make an hourly wage of roughly $10/hr just to make minimum wage after taxes. Considering many people offering jobs cheap out (the ones that pay a decent wage usually go for people with qualifications), making a meager $2/hr hardly seems worth getting out of bed for, let alone worth doing for 8-12 hours a day, 5+ days a week for scraps. \n\nOf course, none of this includes flipping, or any other form of business you might start. If you're already flipping successfully, and you're serious about becoming self-employed, then buckle down and start flipping more. Freelancing and crowdsourcing are both about as unstable as I imagine flipping can be, but the difference is there's much more profit in flipping with much less work. \n\nTL;DR - Don't bother with freelancing or crowdsourcing; I'm looking to start flipping to get myself out of that mess.","name":"t1_cytcur5","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-01-10 23:38:09","week":1}
