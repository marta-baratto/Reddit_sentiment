{"id":"3kuqxx","author":"PlzHalpMePF","body":"Dear PF,\n\nI am an example of the “power of inertia.” I read the Boglehead book a few years ago, but have mostly held individual equities since. I knew that switching over to a lazy portfolio was the right thing to do.. but I was ironically, too lazy to do anything about it. I have taken a beating in the last few weeks, and would like to get on the right path.\n\nBelow is a very long post containing A) a ton of context about me, B) what I think I should do, and C) some questions that I have. I would really appreciate your wisdom.\n\n**A) About me:**\n\nI just finished graduate school, and will re-join the working world in the next few months.  When I picked my initial 401K allocations (and bought individual equities on my own), I was an idiot who had no idea what he was doing. Feel free to tell me that, but please also give me something constructive.\n\n* **Stats:** Late 20s SINK\n* **Income:** $140K/yr salary. $40K bonus.\n* **Expenses:** $2K/mo in rent/utilities. $2K/mo eating out, going out, etc. Intend on saving the rest. Will not need a car in the next few years\n* **Current emergency fund:** $5K\n* **Current investments** ($175K total. $142K in retirement accounts. $32K in brokerage. I don’t think you need the detail below, but in case you do, here it is):\n\n***Schwab ($86K):***\n\nBrokerage ($22K):\n\n* AMZN: $12.7K\n* MON: $9.5K\n\nRoth IRA ($64K):\n\n* Cash: $5.6K\n* AMZN: $11K\n* AAPL: $11K\n* BRKB: $13K\n* MON: $9.2K\n* TSLA: $8.5K\n* WMT: $5.6K\n\n***Fidelity ($88K):***\n\n401K ($78K):\n\n401K 1 ($34K):\n\n* Dodge &amp; Cox Large Cap: $8.4K\n* TRP Retirement 2050: $6.9K\n* Vang Morgan Grth ADM: $6.45K\n* TRP Retirement 2010: $4.5K\n* TRP Retirement BAL: $4.2K\n* Metwest Tot Rtn: $2.7K\n* MIP II CL 1: $1.2K\n\n401K 2 ($43K):\n\n* Vanguard Target ret 2055: $43.7K\n* Fidelity balanced K: $0.6K\n\nBrokerage account: $10K in former company stock\n\nDebt: None\n\nThings to note:\n\n1. I expect ~$40K in income for this calendar year\n2. I paid about $25K in tuition this calendar year\n3. I have held all equities for more than 1 year. \n4. I have not made my 2015 Roth IRA contribution\n\n\n**B) What's next:** I will build up an emergency fund of $35K, and also sign up for my new company’s 401K. What I need help with is re-balancing my current investments. Based on what I have read on PF, I think here are the steps that I need to take. I would love your feedback.\n\nBasically, I have $64K in a Roth and $78K in tax advantaged accounts. Plus $32K in non-retirement accounts. To maximize tax efficiency, I should put bond funds into the Roth, then equities into the remainder of the Roth / 401K / brokerage accounts (in that order). Based on the Bogleheads wiki, I would like to build a three fund portfolio similar to the following (assuming $175K investable):\n\n* 30% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX): $52.5K\n* 35% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX): $61.25K\n* 35% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX): $61.25K\n\nThe issue is that not every 401K offers those specific funds, but there are comparables (with similar expense ratios). So I would just use the comparable instead.\n\nTo do this, I would:\n\n**I) Move Roth IRA to Fidelity:**\n\n*Why:* Retail investors cannot buy into VBTLX or FSITX (Fidelity equivalent). Schwab's\nbond funds have high expense ratios. I love the customer service at Schwab, but I don’t really see a way around this that is not involved and painful.\n\n1. Open up Roth IRA at Fidelity\n2. Move Roth IRA from Schwab over to Fidelity\n3. Sell equities in Roth IRA\n4. Buy $52.5K of FSITX\n5. Use remaining $11.5K to buy FSTVX or FSGDX (Fidelity US/Intl). Which should I buy?\n\n**II) Rebalance the two 401Ks:** Just allocate between the two 401Ks. Should I favor the international or US market equities funds in the 401Ks? Which is more favorable in a non-tax advantaged brokerage account (step III)?\n\n**III) Balance brokerage accounts:** In brokerage accounts (Schwab &amp; Fidelity), buy whichever fund was not purchased in I / II. To keep things simple, I will probably move the Fidelity brokerage account into Schwab (I like Schwab’s checking too much to give up the account).\n\nDoes this seem like a sound plan?\n\n\n**C) Further questions:**\n\n***0) Bond funds in Roth IRA:***I read about this in the Bogleheads wiki - but does that really make sense? From my perspective, it seems like I should put stock funds, which will likely have more appreciation over time, in the Roth IRA instead. Especially given current interest rates...\n\n***1) Backdoor Roth IRA:***While I could roll the 401Ks into an IRA, I would like to take advantage of the backdoor Roth IRA starting in 2016. So I should keep these in the 401K, provided at there are no account fees (I need to check with Fidelity on this come Monday)?\n\n***2) Autopilot:***Going forward, is there an autopilot way to hit this kind of allocation? Like if I direct deposit X% of my paycheck into my accounts on a bi-weekly basis, can I tell them to auto buy a certain amount?\n\n***3) What to do with brokerage accounts:***Going forward again, I plan on maxing my 401K contribution as well as doing the backdoor Roth from question 1. Besides that, I should just keep the saved/invested money in a brokerage account, right?\n\n***4) 401K to Roth conversion:*** Since my income this year will be ~$40K, should I convert some of my current 401K amounts into the Roth IRA? I suppose I could recognize up to the bracket limit of $90,750 to stay at 25% tax. Is there any advantage to doing this? My income will not drop below $90K for the foreseeable future.\n\nedit: formatting","name":"t3_3kuqxx","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-14 03:24:36","week":38}

{"id":"3l1e7u","author":"jshogren10","body":"I am back with a [1 month update on the website that I bought](http://webinvesting.co/website-investing-my-1-month-update) about a month ago as an investment strategy. You can see my original Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3hb5ss/i_was_given_25k_to_invest_in_websites_heres_what).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI am back today to give you all an update on the progress I have made.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAs you all are aware, I am big on website investing and think it is one of the best investment strategies that someone could utilize. I am trying to capitalize on this while it is still extremely easy to make money. If you haven't read the first post I made last month about the website I bought, you can do so here. I would suggest reading that before reading this post. Once you are all caught up, we can get into the update!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**My Goals from Last Update**\n\nIn the last update I laid out a couple of goals that I was going to try and accomplish in the first month. Those goals were:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n* Optimize Google Adsense ads to maximize earnings\n* Add 3 new pieces of content each week to the site\n* Test out different monetization strategies\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nLet's breakdown these goals and see if I was able to follow through and complete them.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**1. Optimize Google Adsense Ads**\n\nThis was a major focus for me this past month because this is the quickest way to improve earnings. One thing that I noticed once I got ownership of the site was that the previous owner was using 5 Adsense ads on their site, which is against Google's terms of service. You are only allowed 3 adsense ads per site and can be banned from Adsense if you have more than that. This is something that I should have looked at before I bought the site, but you will see that it wasn't that big of a deal.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBefore I took control of this site it was earning around $500 per month, which is around $16.50 per day. Let's see how the site performed in the month since I have had ownership.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNote: I wish I could share the screenshots of my Google Adsense account, but after doing some research I realized that doing so could get my account banned. This is the last thing that I want to happen so I will be going the safe route and not showing it. With that being said, from August 8th (first full day of owning the site) to September 8th the site earned $469.93. This comes out to around $15.67 per day, which is slightly below the $500 per month it was earning before I bought it.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis is okay because the whole month I was busy optimizing the ad placements and trying to find what combination earned the most. It took a couple of weeks to see improvements, but I was able to gradually increase the earnings. See the last month broken down into intervals to see the improvements in earnings:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Adsense Earnings](http://imgur.com/87ovJSP)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis is some good progress! Please note that the first two bars are actually 11 days worth of earnings and the last bar is only 10 days. This really shows the improvement. Now let's take a look at the daily averages over these same periods:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Daily Average Adsense Earnings](http://imgur.com/B1eP3ob)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nShowing the daily average earnings really emphasize how well I was able to optimize the ads over the past month. You can see I was able to get the earnings close to $21 on a daily average, which over a full month would make me $630. That is a good improvement over the $500 it was originally making. The best part is that I think I can optimize the ads even more!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy goal of optimizing the ads was completed this month, but like I said, I will be continuing to optimize them over the next couple of months to fully max out the earnings.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**2. Add 3 New Pieces of Content each Week**\n\nOne of the biggest things that I wanted to improve on this site was the organic traffic. To do this, I was going to need to consistently add new content to the site. This way I can increase the amount of keywords that the site ranks for, which in turn would increase the organic traffic to the site. The thing about trying to improve organic traffic is that you will not see immediate progress like you would, for example, with optimizing the ads.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nInstead, you will see results 3-6 months down the road, but it will be worth the wait. So the content I am adding now will not have a huge effect right away, but I am hoping in a couple of months it will start to bring in some traffic. With that all being said, I  WAS able to add 3 new articles per week. Matter in fact, I found someone that would write all of my content, add it to my site, add the images to the article and schedule all of the posts for me.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI am only paying them $10 per article which is very good! This comes out to cost me around $120-$140 per month, but it also makes this site practically hands off for me. The fact that I have someone who does all of the day-to-day tasks to keep the site running makes it well worth the monthly expense. Also, since the website runs itself it makes it a lot more appealing to potential buyers and will help me get a better multiple when I decide to sell it. Overall, I was able to add 3 new articles per week and I was also able to find someone to it for me at a reasonable rate. I couldn't have asked for anything better! I would say I completed this goal.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**3. Test Out Different Monetization Strategies**\n\nI didn't do as much testing as I would have liked with different monetization strategies, but I wanted to get one really good source of income (Adsense) before started to branch out. I did add some Amazon affiliate links to a couple of the more popular pages as well as some Etsy affiliate links. These two things brought in a couple extra bucks, but nothing to get excited about.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Amazon Earnings](http://imgur.com/yRBEWAI)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Etsy Earnings](http://imgur.com/o1iXoYp)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn total between Amazon and Etsy, the site earned an extra $15.86. Like I said, nothing to write home about, but it is still good to see earnings from more than one source. I am planning on exploring more monetization methods in the upcoming months.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Traffic Stats**\n\nWith one full month under the belt for this site let's take a look at how the traffic looked.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Traffic](http://imgur.com/Saw4dKJ)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe traffic was consistent throughout the month for the most part. The traffic ebbs and flows throughout the week with traffic peaking during the weeknd and dipping during the middle of the week.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe average daily traffic to the site was 1,474 per day.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis gives me a good baseline so that I can try improving on it month after month. Now let's see where all of this traffic came from.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[The Different Traffic Channels](http://imgur.com/9PcY8Gl)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe image aboves breaks down where all of my traffic came from by the different channels. You can see that \"Social\" traffic dominated and this was to be expected. Then \"Direct\" traffic was 2nd and \"Organic Search\" was 3rd. \"Referral\" followed all of them up. I now am going to dig even deeper into the traffic stats and look into these traffic channels to try and learn as much as possible from the data.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Social Traffic Channel**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Social Traffic Channels](http://imgur.com/aJusEsQ)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nRight off the bat you will probably notice that Pinterest makes up over 96% of the social traffic to the site with Facebook only bringing in around 3.5%.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Facebook Traffic**\n\nI want to try and diversify the traffic as much as possible. That is why I created a Facebook page for the website and I am trying to gain some traction on there. It has been slow so far but I have gotten over 1,000 visitors from Facebook; which is a good start. Check out the traffic from Facebook below:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Facebook Traffic](http://imgur.com/6gbjziZ)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe spikes you see are from when I boosted a post. This cost me $5 to boost them and I saw a lot of engagement from it. I received a bunch of post likes/shares, post clicks and page likes from these small boosts. I was mostly doing these boosts for testing purposes and to see what would happen. I also wanted to try and build up my Facebook page as well. I will continue to test boosting certain posts to see if I can get a good ROI from it.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOverall, I have made some good progress so far from Facebook and I see it being a good source of traffic for my site down the road. Right now, Facebook only makes up around 3% of the social traffic and my goal is to get it to 30% at some point. It may take a 6 months or a year, but that's the goal.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Pinterest Traffic**\n\nPinterest is the biggest driver of traffic to my site. I would like to add more traffic sources so the site didn't rely so heavily on Pinterest. However, Pinterest is a fairly safe source for traffic and there is no reason why it would be interrupted. Pinterest traffic is below:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Pinterest Traffic](http://imgur.com/XyrrKXX)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe traffic peaks on Sundays/Mondays and then dips during the week. Traffic is slowly increasing week after week. Let's compare the first two weeks against the last two weeks to see if there has been any growth:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Pinterest First 2 Weeks vs. Last 2 Weeks](http://imgur.com/CUVOS1s)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe chart above shows that we saw a 1.84% growth, or 257 more visitors, in the second half of the month. This could be due to what I have been doing or it could just be natural fluctuations. It is too early to tell, but growth is growth!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Organic Search Traffic Channel**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Organic Traffic](http://imgur.com/koZOvIu)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe above graph shows the total traffic from organic search. Traffic bounces between 200 - 400 sessions per day depending on the day. Like the social traffic, organic traffic peaks on sundays/mondays and dips around the middle of the week. It is good to learn the tendencies of your site as soon as possible so you can know what to expect and make decision based upon that. Now, let's compare the first two weeks to the last two weeks of the month to see if we saw any growth:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Organic Traffic First 2 Weeks vs. Last 2 Weeks](http://imgur.com/t5zJwDD)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWe actually experienced a decline of around 16% from the first two weeks to the last two weeks. I am not too worried about this because we are looking at such a small amount of data. I would still like to see growth from week to week, but I am not sweating this. Like I said earlier, I have been adding 3 new articles per week so I am hoping this will slowly start to increase my organic traffic.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Semrush Traffic Stats**\n\nIn the first update about this site, I used Semrush as a way to measure the organic traffic for the site. I like Semrush because it will show you all of the keywords that your site is ranking for that are in the top 20 of Google. Let's check out if we saw a growth or decline based on keyword rankings within the past month:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Semrush Traffic](http://imgur.com/AnOvHx6)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe site has actually seen a small boost in terms of the keywords that it's ranking for in the top 20 of Google. This is a good sign and I am hoping this is due to the new content that I have been adding.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Total Earnings**\n\nI have already talked about my earnings from this site in the beginning of this article, but I wanted to quickly document the total earnings for the site.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAdsense Earnings: $469.93 &amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon Affiliate Earnings: $1.76 &amp;nbsp;\n\nEtsy Affiliate Earnings: $14.10 &amp;nbsp;\n\nTOTAL EARNINGS: $485.79 &amp;nbsp;\n\nExpenses: $140 &amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Profit: $345.79 \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn total the site earned around $486 last month, which in my eyes is a good start for the first month. I am expecting higher in the upcoming months, but I am happy with this start. With $140 in expenses going towards the content creation, the site is left making a profit of $345.79 this month.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Future Plans**\n\nThe main goal is to earn as much as possible, which is obvious. However, the sure fire way to earn more is to increase the traffic. So one of my main focuses next month is going to be to increase the traffic to the site in whatever way possible. Aside from increasing the traffic, I will also be hunting down other ways to monetize the site. I will explain each step of my game plan below:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**1. Increase Facebook Traffic and Grow Page**\n\nI will trying to grow my Facebook page and increase the traffic that it drives back to my site. I will do this by posting more regularly on the page and growing it naturally. I think that I can get a pretty good following on Facebook that would to drive massive amounts of traffic to my site. Aside from posting more regularly, I will also be testing out new types of posts. One of those being quote pictures. You can see an example of a quote picture below:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Example of Facebook Quote Picture](http://imgur.com/rzkMy7L)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis is one of the most popular things to do on Facebook right now and it is killing it when it comes to getting likes and shares. I will be testing this out and see if I gain any traction. I will also keep testing out boosting certain posts for more likes/shares and to build up my audience on Facebook. It might cost some money upfront to build the audience, but it will hopefully pay off in the long run.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**2. Continue to Add Content and Try to Grow Organic Traffic**\n\nIn the second month under my ownership, I am hoping to start to see some sort of growth in my organic traffic. By then, it will be two full months of adding 3 new articles each week, which is a good amount of fresh content. I will also be trying out some different types of content to see what happens. When I first took control of the site, my main goal was to continue producing content that was similar to how the previous owner wrote their content. Now that I have a good understanding of the site and it's content, I can now try out some different types of content to see if I see any improvement in things such as traffic, engagement or shares.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**3. Try to Find 3 Direct Advertisers**\n\nIn my opinion, one of the best ways to monetize this site is going to be through having direct advertisers pay to have an ad placed on my site. Selling ad space along with Google Adsense is a good combination and one that I think will increase the earnings by quite a bit. I have a couple of different strategies to find these advertisers and I am hoping I can find at least 3 that are willing to pay next month. Since this site get's so much traffic, it should be an easy sell to these advertisers. This site is also in a niche that has a lot of different people willing to pay for ads. Getting 3 advertisers is a short term goal, I am planning on being able to get 10+ advertisers by the time I go to sell this site.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**4. Continue to Optimize Adsense Ads**\n\nI have done a good job of optimizing the ads so far, but I think I can optimize them even further. I will continue to test colors, ad styles and ad placements to try to find the best combination that will maximize earnings.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**I am Actively Seeking New Websites**\n\nI am going to keep looking for new websites to add to my portfolio. I have also been in contact with a few investors that are interested in investing into websites with me, so I will be on the lookout for new sites that I feel are good investments. If you have a website that you want to sell, you can email me at josh@webinvesting.co and I will gladly take a look.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThat wraps up the 1st month's update on how my first website investment has done. I have only had the site for a little over a month, but I feel like I have made good progress in key areas. Over the next couple of months I fully expect the earnings to continue to rise and the value of the site to rise as well.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCurrently, with the site earning $345 in profit last month, it would be valued at $6,900 (20 x $345) if it kept earning that much for the next couple of months. $6,900 is $900 more than what it was purchased for so I have already increased its value. The good news is that I see the profit being a lot higher than $345 in the upcoming couple of months, which will take the value of the site higher. More good news is that I have found a way for this site to practically run on autopilot without me, since I have outsourced the content creation and the posting of this content. Since the site is running without the need of me, this increases it's value due to it being able to run exactly the same with any owner. This means that Billy Bob Joe who knows nothing about websites could buy this site and still earn as much as it did while I owned it. This is because there are processes in place that allow it to run and earn by itself.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis is appealing to potential buyers and would increase the monthly multiple that the site would be valued at. Meaning that instead of the normal 20x monthly profit, it would closer to 25x or even higher. This dramatically increases the value of the site and will allow me to get a much better return on the site when I go to sell it. This all good news and I am happy with the progress that was made in the first month. I will be back with another update in around a month. Thank you all for reading and I hope you have enjoyed!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFull Post: [HERE](http://webinvesting.co/website-investing-my-1-month-update)","name":"t3_3l1e7u","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-15 15:10:30","week":38}

{"id":"3l3lwx","author":"SteveCoast_","body":"I had a crazy idea and blogged about it, copied below. Feedback welcome.\n\ntl;dr - Make a company that looks like valve (flat, no managers), have people work remotely, hire great people on upwork, employees blog about everything they're doing. Allow people outside the company to influence what the company does, be involved in products and so on (maybe paying a fee for this, since people do this on kickstarter, Shark Tank...). Costs are very low to do it.\n\nblog post http://stevecoast.com/2015/09/15/open-company/ :\n\nHere’s a crazy idea: It would be interesting to build a kind of “open” company.\n\nMost companies are closed in the sense that you have limited contact with them and little insight in to their internals. It would be interesting to create something where there was some high degree of openness both within and without, a flat structure and deep feedback loops.\n\nValve doesn’t have managers (flat structure) and people just work on whatever they want to, with peer pressures as a check. Amazon has a lot of the same customer and feedback goals but more traditional management. A blend of these would be interesting.\n\nThe problem is capital. Valve has a big office in Bellevue and people. Amazon have bigger offices in Seattle and lots more people.\n\nBut what if we flip that? 37signals has some large number of remote employees and that appears to work just as well. Why not make all your employees remote? No more office-related costs.\n\nPeople are, generally, expensive. Well, they are in Bellevue, WA. What if we don’t mind if you work in Timbuktu? What if they don’t work full-time? Suddenly employee costs drop off a cliff. For not much cash, you could hire 5 or 10 people on upwork to get started.\n\nIt’s never been cheaper to go do this. We could make the company handbook v 1.0 just be Valve’s handbook.\n\nAmazon started with books, Valve with Half-Life. What if you start with nothing at all but people interested in the experiment, and employees own ideas of what to work on?\n\nCould you make the company an entertainment in itself? People love following along kickstarter projects and watching Dragons Den / Shark Tank. People are already therefore paying dollars and time to be part of the experience in creating something.\n\nAn Open Company could put you right there with the people making things happen. You can follow along and influence who gets hired and what people work on. It would be like The Sims, only more entertaining because it’s real. You could help choose the company logo, be an “associate CEO”, vote on product wireframes… or not be involved at all and just watch (in your “OpenCompany” t-shirt).\n\nWorst case, it would be an entertaining art project. Best case, it would be fun and create something of value.\n\nSound fun?

I got home late august after two months of traveling, and found that my credit card has been charged 50 dollars for Amazon prime membership that was on autorenew. Here's the thing, my credit card expired on janurary 2015, and I never received or activated a new card. In fact, i wasn't even able to use any of my BofA card while abroad despite filing numerous travel notifications with BofA. \n\nAfter i discovered the charge, I went to my nearest BofA branch and they told me to just pay and be done with it. At this point the charge is 60 days overdue. So I pay off the charge, then BofA close my credit card account. Now I am denied new credit cards when I try to apply for one because I have a serious delinquency and a late payment comment on my credit report. I tried filing a dispute with experian, but nothing came of it. In face my credit score lowered after filing the dispute. I'm at a loss as to what I should do at this point. My credit is now sub 600 and I doubt I can recover anytime soon. Please personfinance,  you're my last hope. \n\nTL;DR: Went abroad, came back to late payment due to automatic renew that's got charged to an expired credit card.

I currently just started a job making £45k per year, in the past year I have been doing contracting work (engineering) and made roughly £18k. \n\nA year ago I was offered a VISA from my bank with a credit limit of £400, a few months after I applied for an Amazon credit card that started with £300 limit and jumped to £900 a few months ago.\n\nNow, I have used these cards regularly, sometime getting close to the limit. Sometimes I would pay them off in full at the end of the month, other times just the minimum or a partial payment. The point is that I never missed a payment/defaulted, went to a loan shark, or filed for bankruptcy. \n\nHaving said this my credit score from noddle.co.uk has always been 550 +/- 10. and my credit rating is 2/5. The only things that were ever \"impacting my score\" were that I was either not registered on the electoral roll (I was but it takes like 6 months for them to update the damn site) or that one of my credit cards was near the limit. Even months that my credit cards were not near the limit my score was the same.\n\nIts been over a year now and this is really bothering me. I cant even get a phone plan since I fail the credit check. \n\nI should also mention that I have moved 3 times in the last 2 years (renting the whole time). Could this be a main factor?\n\nBack in Canada all you needed to do was have a credit card and use it regularly and make payments on time and you were basically a \"perfect\" borrower.

These ‘smart models’ utilize machine learning and deep neural networks, they are constantly learning and evolving given new market conditions. Currently we are applying them to various digital currency markets, the results have been very promising. We require a financial expert, specifically an expert in trading systems, to design and implement a system to utilise the signals produced by our models.\n\n**Job Description**\n\n* Design and implementation of a semi-automated/automated trading system utilizing signals coming from the machine learning models \n\n* Implementing and maintaining the infrastructure connecting the trading system to crypto exchanges.\n\n\n* Custom indicator / feature design for machine learning\n\n**Person Specification** should be experienced or knowledgeable in \n\n* Algorithmic trading \n\n* Market analytics, Feature / custom indicator design\n\n* Systems design and Agile software development (CI, TDD, Scrum)\n\n* Object Oriented Programming (Python, Django web framework, Amazon Web Services)\n\n* Machine learning (recommended)\n\n* Natural Language processing (recommended)\n\n* Hedge fund operation (optional)\n\n\n\n**Additional Info**\n\n* We need the position filled asap \n\n* We will be offering equity in the company for the filled position (we are not offering a salary) \n\n\n\n**Model Information and Performance**\n\nOn one simulation we tested our TA (technical analysis) algorithm with around 30 coins with shared initial parameters over a 3 month period, however many of these coins had little data (small market cap/volume), the results were as followed:\n\nStart capital: $5,000\n\nTA trader: $12,706\n\nBuy and Hold: $-731.79\n\nRandom $-1,145\n\n*Buy and hold and random are included as comparisons ie how a portfolio would have performed if one was to 'buy and hold' the commodity*\n\nAnother model being developed is based on NLP (natural language processing). This relies on input from social media or ‘text data’, such bitcointalk threads, reddit, twitter etc. The semantical content is analysed and the algo finds patterns between that and price movements. We are currently working on combining the output from both algos into a deep neural network.\n\n**Feature/custom indicator design**\n\nCurrently the TA algo utilises the output from TA-lib (a library of 150 technical indicators). The design of custom input parameters (or features as they’re known in machine learning) will allow the models to make better predictions by feeding it more relevant market data. However the priority at the moment is the design of a trading system.\n\n**Final words**\n\nWe have 2 PhD’s on our team working on model development full time.

{"id":"3l9ly6","author":"abmo224","body":"I just received my first credit card and am considering getting a couple more that have complementary rewards bonuses, but I don't want to wreck my credit score by applying for too many too quickly. I've seen posts by people that say they have four or five cards that they use for different purposes, and I've read through the FAQ but didn't see anything that gave me a straight answer here.\n\nBasically I want to maximize cash back/rewards based on my girlfriend's and my shared spending habits. I applied for and received the Sallie Mae credit card that I saw recommended by so many on this sub. I got a $3800 credit line, and based on the FAQ's recommendation that I not charge more than 30% of that, I don't want to charge more than $1100 each month, which I don't foresee ever being an issue. Using this card, I get 5% cash back on the first $250 spent on groceries (a little over half our grocery budget), the first $250 spent on gas (which covers our entire gas budget), and first $750 spent on Amazon (which we don't often use, but is a nice plus). I doubt we will ever charge much more than this $500 per month, barring any major Amazon purchases.\n\nI'd like to at least get a second card that gives cash back on grocery purchases, to take advantage of the full amount we spend at the store each month. I know that applying for a card knocks your credit score down a few points for a short period. My score is 710, and I would imagine my girlfriend's is a lot lower, otherwise we'd just get a second Sallie Mae in her name. She has had some longstanding credit card debt, but after several years of hard work, she will have it all paid off in about six months. Hopefully that won't be an issue for much longer, though I have no idea how long it would take to get her score back to a decent number.\n\nHow long should I wait before applying for a second card, in order to minimize the hit my credit score will take? Is it a big enough hit that I should even worry about this? Are there any specific cards you would recommend based on our budget? At most, we spend $2k a month, so if I can't find a card that gives higher rewards on certain categories, a generic 1% back or whatever would be fine too. Our budget is roughly broken down into $800 on rent, $400 on groceries, $200 on utilities, $200 on gas, and $400 on entertainment/bars/restaurants (which we're cutting down on to increase savings, but it'd still be nice to get cash back when we do go out). Or should we just wait a bit and get a second card for her once her score improves?

{"id":"3l9mre","author":"krissykomes","body":"I really have no idea what I'm doing. My apologies if this post is a bit jumbled. I need help in a multitude of areas.\n\nTo start things off, I am a 19 year old second year student studying away from home. I'm in a four year program, and 8 months of those 4 years will be spent doing paid work in my field (co-op program) making most likely $12-15 an hour, 40 hours a week. I'd like to set majority of that money aside to help pay off my loans in the future.\n\nI get $13k in student loans a year to pay for rent, books, food, transportation, etc. My parents pay my $9k+ tuition a year using money they saved in an RESP, and I think they have about $12k left. Unfortunately, I plan on furthering my education 4-8 years onward from my undergraduate studies, so my student loans will most likely increase.\n\nI'll just be honest and say that I am horrible with my money. Realistically speaking, I should not have spent my $13k loan last year. I'll give you a run down of my costs should be.\n\nRent: $550/month\nFood: $300/month (and that's being generous)\nTransportation: $125/month\nSchool supplies: $1000 (last year, this year it'll be about $600 hopefully)\nTrips (going home and such): $2000 (again, being generous)\nOther (clothing, etc.): $2000 (I am a bit of a shopaholic, but we'll get to that later)\n\nSo, in total that is $10,800, giving myself some leeway in a few areas.\n\nI started last year with $1000 in savings, so I had $14k plus my parents gave me money occasionally when I went shopping. By the time the 8 months was over, it was all gone. \n\nI guess the first problem that I want to address is my spending habits. You know how some people eat when they're bored? I online shop. Amazon and I are very good friends. I have things that, realistically, I could have survived without, but I try to justify them to myself (oh, this will help me get organized/get active/whatever). I know I have a problem, and I have definitely gotten better with my unnecessary spending. Better is a relative term though.\n\nI arrived back here on September 1st, and since then I have spent about $1450, not including my first month of rent. $200 was Amazon, $350 was food, $130 was at Bed Bath and Beyond, $420 was school supplies, $125 on a metro pass, $120 was spent at the mall and $105 was spent eating out. That being said, I will not be spending $1450 biweekly consistently because a lot of these purchases were a once in a year sort of deal.\n\nI have tried being better with my money. I have taken $1500 of the loan money that I received and put it into a TFSA (A GIC for 18 months at 1.25% to be specific) and the measly $200 I managed to save by the end of the summer from work went into a different TFSA at 0.9%, also making $50/month contributions to said account. I'm trying to set money aside but I really don't know what I'm doing, where I should put it, and so on. Which is why I'm here.\n\nThe goal is to have some money tucked away so that I don't have to get loans for a year, or when the time comes to pay off my loans I have some money set aside to get a head start. Ideally, I'll make about $20k for the whole 8 months of my co-op work terms, before taxes. In the worst case it'll be $15k. Prepping for the worst case, what is some advice you can give me on saving money or budgeting or anything, really. I just want to start taking control of my financial situation so I'm not royally screwed in the end. I want to start saving for the long-term as well as the short-term.\n\nI apologize for the length and slight disorganization of this post, I suppose it speaks volumes about my financial troubles. \n\nNote: The few options of careers that I will be pursuing in the future will earn me anywhere from $80k-$250k annually. I'm not sure if that'll make any difference in your advice. \n\nTL;DR - I am a 19 year old student who's financially situation is a complete disaster and would like to take control of it.\n\nEdit: Miscalculated something, oops!

I will give you guys the whole scope of the story (and ill make it as quick as possible), then descend to my current problem.\n\nI started off following the safe path, high school to college. I never had great grades so I went to a state school and hated it. I already read rich dad poor dad, and had the mindset that I don't want to trade my time for money, and id rather focus on investing or building businesses or passive income systems so I can live my life how I want to. I dropped out after the 3rd semester to get a job next to my brother all the way across the country and save up money to start investing in real estate. Plans never worked out so I am staying home and plan on flipping houses with my father. I have been here for 8 months and we are close to getting something started, and I have my real estate license, but I do not want to be an agent.\n\nThis is sort of the predicament I am in now. I have all this time, so I want to start a business (online preferred) so that if the flipping houses business fails, I do not have to get a J.O.B and live miserably for 40 years until I retire. I have researched everything from affiliate marketing and niche site building which I feel are scammy, sleazy and will not provide long term returns. One thing that I have sort of settled on though, is private labeling, or starting a brand of products. I want to import goods from china with my label on them, and start marketing and building a business. If there was a way for me to build a product then wholesale it somehow, I would love that. I am basically either looking for a 4hww muse that can get me $50k+ a year with little work, or a business that has huge potential that I can grow and sell for a million+.\n\nAnother predicament: How is it going to set me apart from the rest? Sure there are a lot of people that make a living doing a couple products private labeling using amazon FBA, but I want to go past that. People's Amazon accounts get froze and BOOM no money. I want to expand to different sales platforms and start my own website with a reoccurring customer traffic. I want to GROW to a real business so I can have that great income, and long term gains. I still do not know how I will be set apart from all of the other people private labeling. I know in order to have a great brand I have to invest in a great, high-quality product, and invest in my customer service. But in the beginning, why buy from me and not the other guys? I am not really wired to create or modify an existing product and be a 20 something billionaire. I want to rely on my management, system creation, and focusing on the customer first.\n\nI think that's all. Sorry for such a long post, I have been stressed out the past week or so because I have the time and a little funds to start something that will change my life, but I do not have proper direction. It is very frustrating.\n\nThank you all very much for reading this post!! Any advice or criticism will be wonderful!\n\nKyle ","name":"t3_3lblp9","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-17 18:55:03","week":38}

{"id":"3lcaj5","author":"THEGrammarNatzi","body":"I had forgotten how long the loan process takes through a private lender, and shortly after realizing this my money from the summer had run out, so I applied for an \"Amazon\" Chase credit card to eat and get a few of my textbooks. I maxed it a few days ago, and my loan is now through, and I am not sure if I should pay off the whole balance or just make minimum payments (in terms of what is \"good\" for my credit). I've read the small Credit Card FAQ in the sidebar but a lot of well-established adults I know disagree on the topic. Is there truly no benefit to having some existing balance on the card? Accruing interest sucks, but I mean, I would like to be able to purchase a car that was made this century in the next few years and I'd assume having good credit will help me do so. I have a 66 Chevy and an 88 Rx7, and it doesn't look like gas is getting cheaper :(\n\nI'm new to adulting, so any input is really appreciated\n\nBackground:\nVirtually no credit history\n$500 limit\nPlanned to use strictly for gas and groceries, for the % back.\n\nP.S. What is the deal with the cash back %'s on credit cards? It seems so minor and hardly an incentive, but this one made sense for me so I got it anyways.","name":"t3_3lcaj5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-17 21:45:06","week":38}

Meanwhile, I count 7, 8? policy violations related to shipping, returns, and sales on this alone.  \n\nEdit in at end:  Oh man, then as I was talking to Amazon I found out that he ripped me off several bucks for shipping!  Charged me for standard shipping + .97 a pound and added 5 pounds for an item that weighs less than an ipad air.  The asin is correct and lists it as a pound but I was charged for 5.

{"id":"3lcyk5","author":"AnnaLogClock","body":"This is suuuper long, but I really wanted to give a breakdown of my budget and get some constructive criticism. Basically - what should I change to get the most bang for my bucks?\n\nI use YNAB and have for the past year, but my husband and I only recently combined finances, so my historical data isn't 100% accurate to my situation. It has been an enormous help already in figuring out where to change the budget. We also use Mint for a basic overview to make sure we didn't miss much in YNAB.\n\nMy husband and I both have jobs in IT, and live and work in Detroit. Our combined pre-tax income is $118,000 per year, plus an annual bonus for me (the last few years it's been at least $5,000, but I do not count it in my budget, and when it happens then I put it in savings). Our take-home pay per month is currently around $5,900 a month (This will change in about 4 months, because his company makes him wait until the 6-month mark in order to contribute to his 401k). This also includes deductions for a ~10,000 401k loan that we used to secure the condo we bought. Some people may find this absurd, but it was worth locking it down, for us. In order to get an equivalently sized (1br/1ba) apartment in our area, it would be about $1,400, and moving farther away from work to lower rent would increase other expenses to the point that it would still be more, especially since we can now bike to work and are considering selling the car.\n\nAll of the expenses below, not counting the savings numbers set aside, give us a little over $1,600 a month to go towards savings or debt. In the past few months that amount went to savings (First for down payment/closing costs, then towards emergency funds), and now that the emergency funds have almost all been filled, any remainder is going directly to debts, specifically student loans.\n\nI've added notes to many items below, but I'm sure I'll have missed some possible questions.\n\n**Essentials**\n\n| Budget Item            | Budgeted  | Last Month Total |\n|------------------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Mortgage/HOA^1         | $1,217.27 | $1,217.27        |\n| Homeowners Insurance^2 | $20.17    | $20.17           |\n| Water/Gas/Electric^3   | $130      | ?                |\n| Car Insurance^4        | $175      | $175             |\n| Gas                    | $70       | $83.32           |\n| Groceries              | $230      | $234.47          |\n\n1. HOA fees include building insurance, internet\n2. Homeowner's insurance paid annually, I budget 1/12 per month\n3. Utilities paid quarterly to condo association. I have not yet gotten my first bill, so the $130/mo is a complete estimate, hopefully overestimated.\n4. Car insurance is PLPD/collision/comprehensive with a $250 deductible, for a 2010 Corolla. The high rate is because I live in Detroit, and cannot remove comprehensive until the car is paid off.\n\n**Non-Essential Bills**\n\n| Budget Item                      | Budgeted |\n|----------------------------------|----------|\n| Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Music | $23.97   |\n| Cell Phones, 2 on family plan    | $116.31  |\n| Car Registration^1               | $7.84    |\n| Misc Services^1                  | $5.50    |\n| Amazon Prime^1                   | $8.25    |\n| Meetup Group Fees^2              | $29.98   |\n\n1. Paid annually or semi-annually, budget spread out\n2. I run two successful Meetup groups. For the most part, donations cover the monthly cost to run it, but otherwise I cover it.\n\n**Debt**\n\n| Debt                   | Payment | Balance | Interest Rate |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|\n| Student Loans^1        | $474.57 | $45,630 | 3.15%-6.7%    |\n| Car Loan^2             | $150    | $665    | 2.9%          |\n| Entertainment Center^3 | $150    | $1,177  | 0%            |\n\n1. All extra money over the next years will be towards eliminating this, starting with highest interest.\n2. This is a 2010 Toyota Corolla, KBB value estimate around $7,800. The actual monthly payment is around $250, but I had paid a chunk up front and currently paying lower, without incurring penalties. I'm getting a small windfall this month and will use it to pay off the entire balance of $665 in order to free up that monthly payment to go towards student loans.\n3. Perhaps a little overkill in price, but we really enjoy it, and are paying it off a little earlier than due for the 0% interest.\n\n**Other Expenses**\n\n| Budget Item        | Budgeted | Last Month |\n|--------------------|----------|------------|\n| Restaurants^1      | $300     | $234.47    |\n| Cleaners^2         | $60      | $60        |\n| Medical^3          | $0       | $82.13     |\n| Domain Names       | $0       | $15.17     |\n| Credit Card Fees^4 | $0       | $99        |\n| Spending Money^5   | $1000    | $1053.31   |\n\n1. Looking to cut down restaurant spending in the near future, succeeded a bit last month\n2. Definitely not essential but gives peace of mind.\n3. Miscellaneous small medical bills because we underestimated the need in our FSAs\n4. Forgot to close a card beforehand, they wouldn't undo it, so I sucked it up and cancelled the card\n5. I'll get into this later, I know it looks insane...\n\n**Savings &amp; Goals**\n\n| Savings                        | Monthly | Balance | Goal   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Emergency Fund^1               | ?       | $6,000  | $9,000 |\n| Pet Care                       | ?       | $250    | $250   |\n| Honeymoon^2                    | ?       | $3,560  | $3,560 |\n| Car Repairs                    | $100    | $903.45 | $1,000 |\n| Home Maintenance               | $100    | $0      | $2,000 |\n| Retirement (Total in IRA/401k) | $200    | $45,000 | ?      |\n| Aquarium Setup^3               | ?       | $0      | $500   |\n\n1. The first goal is $6,000 and it will stay there until a dent is made in the student loans.\n2. The Honeymoon fund has stayed in savings since we saved it up, the trip will be taken in March, somewhat frugally, with the goal of the remaining balance going into savings or towards debt.\n3. Seems frivolous, but it's built-in to our condo. Will be paid for by freelance work on the side.\n\n**About the spending money**\n\n$1,000 definitely seems like a lot (and it is!) but the category includes both discretionary spending and discretionary savings for me and my husband separately. Whatever he spends or saves on, I have no say over, and vice versa. Spending includes clothing, work lunch, and miscellaneous personal purchases. Savings includes travel, gifts, and whatever new gadgets we want. In general, we can reduce costs of some categories and scale back on the spending money, but for the most part it's used responsibly, we love travel and technology, and often the budget is supplemented with freelance work on the side. In an emergency situation, this would be cut back on drastically.","name":"t3_3lcyk5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-18 00:25:43","week":38}

I'm sure a large majority of us have Amazon affiliate accounts, and I'm sure with this being reddit, that a good percentage of us also happen to be gamers.\n\nI created a site to hopefully combine these two aspects. It's called [bestgamesetups.com](http://www.bestgamesetups.com/). \n\nIt's a site with 2 simple functions. The first is for users to find the best gaming setups separated into categories and voted on by the users themselves. The second function is to reward and encourage posters by streamlining the affiliate link posting process.\n\nEach function is accomplished differently.\n\nNow, I am no where near as talented as the web developers that post on this sub, and I wouldn't even call myself one.\n\nHowever, I had an idea and I used the ideas shared here to execute it the best way I could.\n\n\n\n**About the sites design:**\n\nI used WordPress, because I figured in general, hate it or love it, most people here with affiliate accounts would be familiar with WordPress. I also used WordPress because a lot great plugins have already been developed to help affiliate link posters.\n\nI wanted to make the site as simple and easy to use as possible. I chose a simple grid layout similar to Pinterest to showcase posts and keep the site clean and free from clutter.\n\nI made each grid post rankable by adding a five-star rating function for each post. You can give the post a rating system with or without being signed in.\n\n\nPeople can easily sort the posts by best, worst, or newest by clicking the \"sort\" menu tab. This can be done for every category making it easy for users to find the best posts.\n\nNow for creating posts. Posts, just like votes can be made while signed in or not. This allows anyone to make a simple post and earn affiliate money right away. However, the process is easier for members that sign in. Signed in members get author privileges to make their posts. \n\nAuthors also are given an Amazon affiliate tools that allows them to easily search for and and paste affiliate links to their post without needing to change tabs or login into the Amazon affiliate site. \n\nPosts also look cleaner when Amazon affiliate tools are used to post links. If you want to be a member just send me an pm with your email and I will make you an account.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** I made an Amazon affiliate site for gamers. Feel free to make a post using your own affiliate links. If you want to use the Amazon affiliate posting tools, than just send me a pm with your email and I will make you an account.\n\nEdit: Formatting.","name":"t3_3lhh5g","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-18 23:45:49","week":38}
{"id":"3lhu83","author":"tradersinsight","body":"One of the things which I have been doing a lot recently is using options that are expiring the day of or the next day to make quick moves based on the Gamma curve. \n\nI've been selling premium for the ATM or next strike OTM and then planning for a quick reduction in the price so I can buy it back for 50% or less. I like it because I can set tight stops and fall off in the Gamma and paired with the fast theta.\n\nA couple of key factors are\n-The stock needs to be at around $100 or higher. The reason being is there needs to be sufficient movement to allow for the Gamma fall off. This means I'm usually dealing with stocks like AMZN, TSLA, GILD, etc. SPX is also a great one in the last hour or two.\n-IV doesn't matter. Only direction does.\n-I focus on breakout moves, trading the trend, not the retracements. It's too easy to get caught with trades like these. \n-When I set my stops, I usually set it to buy back the options for .10 to .15 higher than what I paid. \n-Initial goal is 50% profit, but I'll take more if the move is significant and I have a belief that it will stay above my strikes.\n-Most of the major theta decay occurs in the last hour or two. \n\nAnyone else trade like this?","name":"t3_3lhu83","subreddit":"options","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8rv","created_utc":"2015-09-19 01:26:28","week":38}

Shart!\n\nSo I pay for this, get my disks and list them on Ebay. I know I'm screwed because after shipping and fees I'm barely breaking even. \n\nWait a few weeks and nothing is selling. Start to worry I've just blown $1000AUD and will lose maybe $500 on the deal at best.\n\nRather than resting on my laurels and beating myself up, I checked what they were selling for on Amazon. Same price in USD ($55)  as they're selling for here in AUD ($55). But the US Dollar is worth a fair amount more than the AU Dollar. So $55USD=$77AUD.\n\nSo I bundle them up and ship them all to FBA.

{"id":"3lltwu","author":"alexs88","body":"**BRIEF INTRODUCTION (PURPOSE OF THIS POST):**\n\nHey guys.  Listen.  This is not a plug for anything, this is me trying to help you.  In my opinion, all the info you need to start an Amazon business is on YouTube, Reddit, and podcasts.  In my humble opinion, you'd be a fool to pay thousands for a course or bootcamp, when you could spend that on product.\n\nI did it with $1k and in about a month.  Below is how I did it, step by step, with very specific examples from my process.  Before I dove into this world, the phrase \"start a business\" was intimidating to me.  What?  How?  Isn't that for Stanford MBA's, folks with millions of dollars, etc.?  Don't you need an earth-shattering idea that will change the world?  No, and NO!!! You need some common sense, willingness to put in about 100 hours in a month, and a thousand bucks.  Note: if you have anything more than $1000 to devote to this, it only makes it easier, but I did this with less than $1000.\n\n\n**WHAT YOU NEED:**\n\n- $1000 dollars\n- about 100 hours of time to work on this, in a month\n- an internet connection\n- a mailing address\n\n**THE STEPS**\n\n**Step 1) Amazon Research**\n\n* APPROX TIME: 1 week\n* APPROX COST: $0\n\nGo to Amazon.  Find a product that meets the following basic criteria:\n\n- It sells well\n- The top results don't have too many reviews (4 guys with 2-500 reviews?  Good.  9 guys with 4,000 reviews?  Bad.  Too much competition.  2 guys with 60 reviews?  VERY Bad.  No Demand).\n- No national brand dominates the product (Don't sell basketball shoes against Nike and UnderArmour)\n- In general you want something small and light.  This is extremely important\n\nThis is the most important part of the process, and a long, arduous process.  You will find products you love, and in two days, they will seem like crap.  It's all part of the process.  Here is a screenshot of the numbers for the top-16 products for a certain keyword, that I consider good, and am considering pursuing right now:\n\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ft3hXxw.png)\n\nWhy is this a good product?  There are a LOT of sales per month (anything over 3K sales per month for the top few competitors on a keyword is great).  Why?  Because even if I capture a SMALL percent of the market share, I can make $2-$5k per month in profit here.  Not bad.  People with as few as 30 reviews are doing $9K/month in sales.  And reviews are the toughest part of this game.  I don't care if you invent the cure for cancer, if it is on page 9 of Amazon, with 0 reviews, no one is buying it.  I can get 30 reviews in a week or two.  And if my product is good, and the marketing is good, I will be making a lot of money here.\n\n\n\n**Step 2) AliExpress - buy your inventory**\n\n* APPROX TIME: 3 days\n* APPROX COST: $522.28\n\nThis is where you go to AliExpress.  And you simply buy your product, and it is delivered to you in about 1-2 weeks.  That's it.\n\nUSUALLY, you want to go through AliBaba.  Better rates, but you also have to buy large MOQ's (minimum order quantities), and wait for a long time for it to get to you.  Right now, we are focused on SPEED.  And AliExpress is like Amazon: you order 100 of something, and in 1-2 weeks, it's at your doorstep.  Period.\n\nLets say I decided to compete in water bottles.  (HINT: do NOT compete in things like water bottles and iPhone cases.  Firstly, water bottles are dominated by great brands Nalgene and CamelBak.  Secondly, these are too popular, and hundreds of buyers, with deeper pockets than you, are aggressively pursuing.  If it's obvious, it won't work, and you will be buried on page 10 of results making 1 sale a month).\n\nHere's how you do it:\n\na) Search \"water bottle\" on Amazon.  (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_5?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=water+bottle&amp;sprefix=water+bottle%2Caps%2C194&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Awater+bottle).  \n\nb) Check out the top sellers, what traits they have, etc.  Pay special attention to the price for a water bottle.  Looks like the top ones are going for 10-13.  So you will price yours at 10-13.\n\nc) Search \"water bottle\" on AliExpress.  I did, and on the first page, I found this:\n\n(http://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Black-Environmental-Cartoon-Foldable-Water-Bottle-Bag-Portable-Kettle-Outdoor-Sports-Travel-Bottles-Free-Shipping/32306477305.html?spm=2114.01020208.3.12.m93aOm&amp;ws_ab_test=201526_5,201527_4_71_72_73_74_75,201409_1)\n\nA cool looking, foldable water  bottle, made from food grade material, BPA free, leak-proof, drop resistant.  Looks swanky.  Could probably sell.  2 BUCKS A PIECE.\n\nd) The price is 2 bucks a piece.  You may be thinking \"sweet!  Buy for 2, sell for 12, game on!\"\n\nNo, no, no, my friend.  Each piece also costs about $1.50 to ship to you from China.   So that's $3.50 per piece.  Amazon then takes a cut for allowing you to list it.  That's probably another $4.  Packaging is another $0.50 per piece (you need this.  You cant' just sent customers a loose water bottle).  And shipping to TO Amazon will be about 20 cents a piece.\n\nSo a product that costs $2...will all-in-all, actually cost about $9 to get into Amazon warehouses.  So you're making a $3 profit per item, in this example. \n\nIn general, you want to shoot for much higher, which is why I am not doing this, and illustrates why you don't go into popular products.  Companies with  deep pockets are selling 5,000 of these per month, which makes it worth it.  To you, selling 100 items a month at $3 profit...is not worth it.\n\n*LETS SAY, I BUY 150 WATER BOTTLES.  INCLUDING SHIPPING TO ME, I AM PAYING $522.28.  THAT IS $3.50 PER UNIT.  SEE SCREENSHOT BELOW*\n\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ytcq6de.png)\n\n**Step 3.1) While you wait for product to arrive - get the marketing ready - Packaging**\n\n* APPROX TIME: 1-2 weeks\n* APPROX $$: $210 bucks\n\n\nHere is the easiest way I found to make professional looking packaging for cheap.  If you can think of a better idea, do it, but this works in a pinch.\n\nGo to a site like Uline, order 150 boxes at $0.40 cents a pop.  That's $60 bucks. \n\nhttp://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-18336/Corrugated-Boxes-32-ECT/8-x-8-x-8-Lightweight-32-ECT-Corrugated-Boxes\n\nNext, find someone in your area who does stickers.  Design your own sticker in Photoshop (or GIMP) if you can't afford it, and print these.  In general, its $1 per sticker, so $150 total.\n\nStickers + Box = $210, and boom, you have packaging.  Don't over complicate it, this is all you need.  It doesn't need to be Apple-like packaging and design, just enough to get the job done.\n\nHere is a whited out picture of my packaging for my product:\n\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3J3XJm8.jpg)\n\nAgain, not world-beating, but for a week or two of work, it looks professional enough.\n\n\n**Step 3.2) While you wait for product to arrive - get the marketing ready - PHOTOGRAPHY**\n\n* APPROX TIME: 3 days\n* APPROX $$: 0 (??)\n\nGuys, you need good product photos.  Ask a friend who has a nice camera to get you some, take some good photos with good lighting (This can be done DIY for minimal money), and learn to white out backgrounds to your photos by yourself (takes an hour or two-very valuable skill).\n\nNot gonna get too much into this, but this is HUGE.  People click on your product based on photo.  It conveys that you are a professional company, and not some putz in his basement (even if you are).\n\nAt a MINIMUM, you want your listing to look like this:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/SKYE-Bottle-COOLEST-Frosted-Birthday/dp/B00KUT0PGK/ref=sr_1_79?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442698381&amp;sr=1-79&amp;keywords=water+bottle\n\nSearch for Skye Bottle, these dudes (or dude, or chick, whatever) sourced some items, tossed up a quick page, and their listening doesn't look amazing.  This isn't a company at all.  This one bottle is making $5K a month.  This is possible\n\n\n**Step 4) The Final shit**\n\n* APPROX TIME: 1.5 weeks\n* APPROX $$: $75\n\nYou get your bottles.  By now you have your boxes and stickers.  Put the stickers on the boxes, put the bottles in the boxes, pack them up.  Put them into a bigger box.  Sign up for an Amazon Professional Seller account $40/month, first month is free.  Create a listing.  Put all info on your product, and the pictures of your product up.  Send in your 150 units to Amazon FBA Warehouses.  This will be about $35 for this example.\n\nIn 1.5 weeks, Amazon will receive your stuff, sort it, and distribute it to their warehouses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Voila.  Congrats.  You have now started your own brand, and are selling on Amazon.  \n\n**Misc Notes:**\n\nGive away 50 of these in exchange for reviews.  Pretend you didn't pick water bottles, but something where you need 50 reviews to get to page 1.  You need those ASAP.  You now have 100 bottles left.  That is what you sell.\n\nIf they sell, re-invest into more bottles, and bam, you have your own company, and small business.  \n\n**WHAT IF MY PRODUCT IS A SUCCESS???**\n\nLet's say your product sells out quick.  Contact the seller, ask about wholesale pricing for an order of 1,000 pieces or more.  If you get it for $2 a pop from AliExpress, wholesale pricing probably means you can get it at $1 per piece if you order a lot.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nIf your seller is a reseller, and not the wholeseller, go on AliBaba, find a manufacturer who can make the exact same product as your got (send them a sample or the spects), order a lot.  Rinse anad repeat.\nGood luck\n\n**EDIT 1: DISCLAIMER - IF YOU ARE READY TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, USE ALIBABA, NOT ALIEXPRESS**\n\nI recommend using AliExpress if you want to hack your way to do this, and have a basic product up within a month. If you're tired of studying and want to act already, if you want to build a business with customers within 30 days, this is a decent way to go.\n\nBUT.\n\nIt's best to spend more than $1000.  And the best way to do this is to source on ALIBABA.  AliBaba is where you get shit in BULK.  You get lower prices.  And you deal directly with manufacturers, so you can print your logo onto things, customize packaging, change the color, etc.  You don't worry about putting stuff into boxes and labeling...they do that for you.  \n\nAliBaba has minimum order quantities (MOQ's) and most factories will not deal with you if you are ordering less than a few grand of stuff.  If you are not ready to commit to that, or want to dip your feet in, use AliExpress.\n\nIf you're ready for the big leagues, use AliBaba.  \n\nThe steps are pretty much the same.","name":"t3_3lltwu","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-19 23:40:42","week":38}

Sales are not so good not even compared to what we have on marketplaces.

{"id":"cv0hovy","author":"Spythe","body":"I would say I avg about 4 to 8 dollars profit per VHS. A lot of them 2 to 4 dollar profit with the odd ball one being 10+ profit. If I can make at least 2 dollars profits off of it I grab it. I think about 90% of VHS even the new/sealed ones aren't worth the time. If you never heard of it(depending on your age), odds are its worth at least something. The ones that go for 10+ are normally movies I never heard of or kids(90/early 2000) ones.\n\nMake sure to always shake them before you buy it, its fairly clear to tell if its damage or not. If you hear something rattling just put it back.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/syO1QYL.png\n\nHere is the screen grab of TV &amp; Video, I think this is 95% VHS. I don't think I have anything else that fits into that category. Maybe an odd tv cable adapter I sold or something. With those 30+ that sold, I have gotten about 4 returns. I'm not sure if its Amazon or the buyer but they don't seem to realize its a VHS and not a DVD on a few even though I make sure each one is listing under the VHS tag. I'm also gated in DVD so there is no way I listed it as a DVD.\n\n99.9% of the time they're .99c or .79c at Goodwill. Box sets are normally 3+. Only one goodwill charges 1.99+ per VHS, at that cost its pretty rare you will find one worth grabbing. Every other thrift store seems to charge less than .50 per VHS.\n\nThe really odd thing about VHS and proof with my ss is it seems to be the more expensive/odd ones sell than the cheap/common ones. Just this pass weekend I've sold 3 for a total of 60 bucks. You won't get rich off of selling new/sealed VHS but worth scanning and just adds more things to look for at thrift stores.\n\nI actually just sold this one for 30 a few days ago hoping it doesn't get returned..\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Stone-Fox-VHS-Buddy-Ebsen/dp/630236292X/ref=sr_1_1_twi_VHS_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442181944&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Stone+Fox+vhs","name":"t1_cv0hovy","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-14 00:07:09","week":38}

{"id":"cv0iw29","author":"magicspud","body":"I fully agree about there being a Market for this kind of thing but you are in the middle (in my opinion). You are not really priced at the high end as per your example but youre also too expensive for a lot of people and I'd guess you have quite a low conversion rate at this price. But if the numbers work then keep it at the price you feel comfortable.\n\nWhen you say buy it for life market. is that what you offer or is that what you are aiming for. I Honestly didn't get that vibe from the site and products  so yes I think adding more information and making it clearer why you think these products are worth this amount would be beneficial. If you are that confident why not include a lifetime guarantee or repairs. I see what youre trying to do but I don't think it comes across yet. Edit ive just seen the bit on the site where you have your story but only because I went back and looked. I'd have a small picture link to it  on the home page rather than on a drop down menu. Also I didn't find any reviews. These are shown to play a huge part in people's purchasing decisions and it's even more important at this price point. 2nd edit maybe I'm just stupid as Ive now seen the link in the home page. But reviews are essential.\n\n\nOne small thing again just my opinion is I'd drop the made in USA and heavily emphasise the made in Portland Oregon, USA aspect instead. this adds more character branding wise and makes it more personal. Plus what does the packaging look like. This for me is a luxury product and it looks like it just comes on its own? For 90 dollars I want it to have a nice box with maybe a card about its history and how it was made\n\nAlso you really really need to be looking at Christmas right now. I can do 30-50% of yearly sales in November/ December \nAnd what I sell is nowhere near as gift oriented as this product.\n\nFinally are you on Amazon? Something like this would be perfect for that especially at Christmas and it's a lot easier to get targeted traffic. If you plan now you can easily make that 5k you need in those 2 months with something like this marketed the right way on Amazon.\n\nA website is good but it takes a lot of investment to scale it up unless you know someone amazing at SEO Or social media. Something like Amazon is very very low risk and this is the kind of thing people will be looking for come the holiday season. It also pretty much gurantees targeted traffic which you only pay for when a sale is made\n\n","name":"t1_cv0iw29","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-14 00:40:25","week":38}

Which has been a wealth of information given, and it is GREATLY appreciated!\n\nGiven your suggestions, I think I may add the following to the site:\n1) A \"Buy It For Life\" link as the first image on the home page image slider. This can link to a page describing our lifetime guarantee. We definitely offered that, just have never advertised it as we've never actually had anyone return anything. However now that you point it out, that is actually ignorant on my part to not include it!\n\n2) Adding a home page image slider link to the about us page, allowing easy access to our story. Emphasizing the location of Portland, OR USA rather than just USA especially in the story.\n\n**As far as the packaging goes I can describe it to you: a) the item is placed inside of a stamped draw string muslin bag. b) inside each package is a well designed high quality post card describing the story of the brand and how things are made. Along with this we include a small business card sized \"inspection card\" this informs the customer of the rigorous attention to detail given in the production of their product. On the back there is a spot where I stamp the manufacturing date and personally initial the \"inspected by\" line. c) the item is then packaged in a kraft brown box with cotton padding inside then stamped with our logo on the outside.\n\n3) Adding a feature on the site to allow for customers to review products.\n\n4) Sell goods on Amazon. I just actually signed up for Amazon handmade, but I will look into selling on the normal Amazon platform.\n\nAnything I missed?

{"id":"cv0mhcf","author":"magicspud","body":"The packaging sounds really nice and would add value to the product. That's really the key in this price range. So Id,say you really need to include a photo of it. It would not be too difficult as you could just use the same picture for all products in that size. Packaging especially at Christmas is massively important. People are willing to lay a bit extra for something that's looks nice. But your product looked like it came as is to me and that out me off buying it.\n\nMy thought process when first looking at your site was. The site is nice. That pop up is annoying. Nice product but it's a little pricey. Are there any reviews to validate its value- no, ok well it's still nice and I could send it as a gift what's the packaging like. After that i lost interest as there are too many questions unanswered. \n\nThese questions will be what makes or breaks a sale and very few people will take the time to email and ask them, they will just move on.\n\nBut if you only take one thing its get on Amazon. Get your most popular lines and get around 10 reviews on them. If you can do that before November and then advertise this at Christmas you will clean up. I'd also suggest you send them to Amazon to be fulfilled by them. Not loads but maybe 5-10 and with advertising they will sell.\n\nYou also have the advantage of it being priced high  so you can use that to push a strong advertising campaign on Amazon. People selling $10 wallets won't be able to pay as mush per click as you. \n\nI think you just need to make your brand a bit clearer, change some small website details and test the reaction and really try and get into amazon in these months leading up to Christmas. Sales can be crazy if you get it right.\n\nGood luck","name":"t1_cv0mhcf","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-14 02:30:43","week":38}

{"id":"cv18qzc","author":"Wild_Space","body":"I tried to value Netflix a month or two ago at an investment club that I host. I'm bearish on the stock, but the others were bullish, so I can present a strong contrarian argument for you.\n\n&gt;For a long time I think a lot of people's problem with NFLX has been that while their customer acquisition and subscription model has been relatively successful, \n\nPerhaps I'm nitpicking, but it's been an overwhelming success.\n\n&gt;their implied valuation has not been justifiable due to poor content acquisition economics. This meaning that NFLX has had to pay enormous licensing and rights fees to provide their streaming content which they don't own. \n\nThose content acquisitions are fixed costs though. So they can spread out the costs over a larger, larger base of subscribers. That gives them a competitive advantage over say, Hulu who only has ~5 million subs to Netflix's ~50 million.\n\n&gt;As a result, FCF has not been there (TTM is -$543mm).\n\nThey're undergoing a massive international expansion effort. \n\n&gt;What got me thinking about a shift in their overall business model was over the week as I finished up their new Original series Narcos. It always struck me as impressive that every Netflix Original series has seemed to do very well - House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and Narcos to name a few. However, when I looked into it I saw that Netflix is the publisher of well over a dozen originals that range from documentaries to children's shows.\n\nAllow me to take off my devil's advocate hat for a second. I would argue that original content is a short-term competitive advantage. Once their competitors start to create original content, then it all comes down to consumer preference.\n\n*Puts the devil's advocate hat back on.* But as with their acquisition costs, their production costs will theoretically be spread over a larger subscription base than their competitors.\n\n&gt;What is the ROIC on publishing original content?\n\nNo idea. I've read through their most recent 10K and 10Q, but I don't remember them breaking down numbers for their original content. I know you're like Batman when it comes to investigating this stuff though, so you may be able to find out.\n\n&gt;Is the mix of original content greater than, or could it eventually exceed, the amount of licensed content NFLX streams?\n\nI have no opinion.\n\n&gt;What potential effect could a greater mix of original content have on customer acquisition economics vs. competing streaming services such as Hulu?\n\nI have no opinion.\n\n/u/Senior_Autismo posted a great question:\n\n&gt;My question to people familiar with this area is, why do you expect Netflix to totally dominate this market and not the competitors? What does Netflix do better?\n\nThat's the question I always ask. Clearly, Netflix is just beating the brains out of Hulu. It's not even close. Which is impressive because Hulu is a joint venture between Fox, Disney, and NBC. I would think it was impossible to destroy a competitor who's owned by your main suppliers of content, but Netflix has proved me wrong.\n\nIve never looked at Amazon's Prime numbers, so I can't tell you.\n\nBut my question is, what's to stop an Apple from entering the space and taking over? Or Google to leverage their Youtube brand into a premium sub model?\n\nRight now, the content providers are playing nice with Netflix. Disney signed a deal with them in 2012 that gives Netflix exclusivity rights starting in 2016. But what happens if the content providers decide they don't like Netflix being a middle man, and they want to stream content directly to the consumers themselves?\n\nThe argument against that is that Netflix has an impressive head start. 50 million paid subscribers. Who knows how many unpaid subscribers. They have all the infrastructure and relationships in place. Right now, they can probably be choked off by an Apple or a Google. But if they're allowed to grow for much longer, then it may become impossible to compete.\n\nIt's like the ESPN argument. ESPN has such a huge advantage in subscribers fees, that they can outbid on all the best deals, and spread out the costs. To use an example, Hulu paid something like $160 million for Seinfield. Spread over 5 million subs. I don't think Im being too controversial when I say, they're probably never going to make their money back on that, unless it results in a massive uptick of subs. Which it hasn't. And it won't.\n\nThen there's the argument, that at less than $10 a month, people can afford to pay for multiple online streaming services and still be paying much less than the average $100 cable TV bill. So Netflix may not be as sensitive to new competitors are we'd assume.\n\nAs for whether it's at a fair price, I tend to doubt it. But I don't think my valuation is even worth discussing because it's like hitting a bullet with a bullet. \n\nHere's a spreadsheet I threw together to prepare for the meet up I mentioned at the top of my post. https://www.dropbox.com/s/csawllm8l9tes2z/NFLX%20Meetup%20Analysis%202.xlsx?dl=0\n\nIt's not pretty because it was never meant to be shared, but you should be able to gleam some useful information from it. You can ignore my projections…those were inflated to show that Netflix was vastly over-valued even in a ridiculous best case scenario.

{"id":"cv1h0pt","author":"Engineer_Bob","body":"Note: Didn't read all of OP's message but my advice below is pretty general. You already have two vehicles, that's good.\n\nFinancially speaking; it is always better to keep a car and put money into it for whatever repairs that come up. Plus you have the added bonus of knowing every single thing that is wrong with it over the years mechanically, cosmetically and what repairs you've already done. \n\nI would argue that the only way that it wouldn't make sense if you could take that $1000 and buy the same exact car on craigslist or at a used car lot with the exact same mileage or lower and in better mechanical shape than the one you have now.\n\nIn your situation; definitely get it repaired. And while you're at it... I'm not sure what your credit is like but you should look into trying to fix that up in the long run. A good credit card with 0% apr offer for 12-18 months or even a credit card with a low interest rate (credit unions); would have saved your ass about having to worry about coming up with the money and would let you just worry about paying it back over time.\n\nSometimes it makes sense to use credit for certain things when it comes to household stuff, car repairs, health issues. Not everyone has a great paying job or a lot of money saved up due to individual circumstances. But credit will make things a lot easier whether you pay interest or take advantage of a 0% apr offer.\n\nGood luck in your decision on what to do. Remember that a newer car is around $250-$300 maybe even $400 a month plus full coverage on top of that. In two months of payments you would have paid for that repair.\n\nAnother thing I try to tell everyone. If you're the only one working in the family situation; you'll want two cars in case one breaks and needs repaired. While it's repaired it doesn't hinder your family's ability to get around in the other car. If you and the other half work then get 3 cars. Obviously not everyone can do this but it's something to think about.\n\nIf you want to make repairs easier on whatever mechanic that will be working on your car... ebay has tons of factory service manuals where you can look up exact part numbers for OEM or their aftermarket equivalents. You can get decent used parts from local/regional junkyards (car-parts.com). If you want something new, RockAuto or Ebay/Amazon (Ebay/Amazon is good for used as well). Worst case scenario you get parts from Oreilly/Advanced/Autozone. Always compare prices.

On a very quick first glance of the CFS the 60% increase in SBC over the same period raises a huge red flag. \n\n&gt;Once their competitors start to create original content, then it all comes down to consumer preference.\n\nThis is a good point. If Netflix can shift gears and turn into a producer, then Hulu, Amazon, and even Google can definitely do the same if they wanted to. \n\n&gt; I've read through their most recent 10K and 10Q, but I don't remember them breaking down numbers for their original content. I know you're like Batman when it comes to investigating this stuff though, so you may be able to find out.\n\nDefinitely not on my to-do list, especially with the laundry list of stocks I'm currently looking at (ESL, RUSHA/B, MWA, GATE, TR for those interested) for future deep dive work, already on-top of school and EC stuff as well. Like I said, I haven't done a full read of their filings, and I wouldn't be surprised if they don't break out the specifics for original content, but I'm sure it can be reverse engineered with enough elbow grease and detective work. \n\n&gt;To use an example, Hulu paid something like $160 million for Seinfield. Spread over 5 million subs. I don't think Im being too controversial when I say, they're probably never going to make their money back on that, unless it results in a massive uptick of subs. Which it hasn't. And it won't.\n\nYou raise a good argument here. I would be very surprised to see some sort of breakout of the economics for these transactions that suggest them to be otherwise profitable over the long term. \n\nI had some other thoughts I wanted to add to this response but currently running short on time. But I guess to wrap it up I assume the long-term vision (not long-term thesis) on NFLX is that *eventually* something positive will happen that will allow the company to capitalize on their large subscription base and turn a larger profit than $260m on $5b+ revenue. \n\n","name":"t1_cv1j62v","subreddit":"SecurityAnalysis","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7v0","created_utc":"2015-09-14 22:24:01","week":38}

It's convenient.\n\nLike Walmart, they developed a reputation for being cheap and continue to ride it even though they aren't anymore. If you think Amazon isn't using every trick in the book to get every penny they can out of you then you're not paying attention.\n\nThey have a profile on you. They buy information about you. They track you using cookies. Amazon probably knows better than you do what you are willing to pay for an item. There are some things you can do to mitigate this like shopping in incognito mode, do some research on it.\n\nLike every other business Amazon is not trying to sell you things as cheaply as possible. They are trying to sell you things for the highest price possible while keeping you convinced they are cheap. They do this well. But items on Amazon are not necessarily one price for everyone, or even the same price for you.\n\nI've seen lots of items where I'll look at them, then check again later and the price has gone up. It's one of many tricks they use, and they do it because it works on most people. If you browse an item, think \"that's a good price\", then come back later to buy it most people don't write it down and compare the two so Amazon makes more money.","name":"t1_cv1mlp4","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-14 23:53:10","week":38}

{"id":"cv1pp01","author":"Tom_And_Jerry","body":"Thing is, Amazon is mostly 3rd party sellers. When an item is Prime, that just means that the seller pays a premium for Amazon to box, ship and handle customer service. There in lies most of the pricing on Amazon.\n\nI'm a seller on Amazon, and most of what I do is a race to the bottom.

I ship said item to Amazon, i make my listing, then I charge the customer $7.99 for the item, free shipping. The customer may think, \"oh wow, that's a bit pricey for this item\", but when you look at the break down - I charge $7.99, amazon charges packing, labeling, and referral fees directly taken off my item at $3.87 per item sold. Then there's the $.20 labeling fee they charge me. There is more, but the long and short of it is that out of that $7.99, i'm taking away $4.12 profit. Then I have to take money away from myself. There's the restocking fee of $.87 per item I sell, so that automatically brings my profit down to $3.25, then I have to take away roughly %30 of that for taxes.

Most things on there are not directly sold by Amazon; this goes for Prime items as well. Amazon is a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers with a lot of restrictions on sellers. Because of this, it is difficult for for them to affect prices across the board. They can indirectly do this by changing the fee there charge the sellers for each item sold, which may have changed over the years.","name":"t1_cv1qrs3","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-15 01:51:31","week":38}

I'm wondering if there's a simple answer to this question;\n\nI have a corporate card that I use for work every month; average spending is about 3k.  I know for a fact that i can and will get reimbursed, even if I don't use my corporate card, in the form of direct deposit when I do my expense report.  I've got enough cash to float the apyments every month without worry; would this be a good use of a Sapphire card?  I'm interested in gaining miles so the family and I can take more trips and Sapphire seems like it offers the best reqards.  I know alot of you guys get into really strategic uses of your cards, btu I'm just wondering if this is something simple I can do to help myelf out.\n\n\nI buy from a variety of vendors, a lot of which could just go through Amazon or something.  About $600 a month of that spending is on fuel, if that helps.  I'd like to be using a separate card for this instead of my personal family use card, just to keep the accounting straightforward.

{"id":"cv1s6rn","author":"MontagneHomme","body":"They were never a viable business model with the prices they offered on the Prime service. Their tactic was to play the long game, and any savvy business man will tell you it's a tried and true method if you have the financial means for it. Corner the market by underselling, gain the majority market share, gain customers \"trust\" (read: complacency), and commence the price gouging until all investments are covered, then just maintain as much profit as you can. Simple in theory, and simple enough in practice if you have the wealth for it. That said, I still prefer it for the convenience. I'd pay more for the same service if the search engine and data were a little better.

{"id":"cv1tn8k","author":"Eisenstein","body":"I am not saying it is more or less valuable, I am saying that many consumers find it more convenient to do all their shopping on Amazon for many reasons beyond bottom line pricing.  I listed a few of these reasons that I could think of and why they would offer utility to consumers that the physical stores did not provide.\n\nOf course Home Depot can never be replaced by Amazon for a multitude of reasons, but for a one-off purchase of a consumer good Amazon can offer people a much more enticing shopping experience.  It has been shown time and time again that a large group of people will choose convenience and consistency over price if that price difference is not hugely significant.\n\nStores like home depot and walmart are so huge that many people go in there looking for something and get overwhelmed by choice overload, and the lack of floor staff and reference points for their choices leads to uninformed or impulsive buying decisions.\n\nContrarily, Amazon offers an easy way to compare products and the internet can give consumers far more information with a single google search than the staff at a huge store who are in charge of hundreds of thousands of items and probably have no personal experience with almost all of them.\n\nI hope I have made myself clear on these points as I don't want to give the false impression that one method of shopping is better than the other, just that people find value in things beyond just a cheaper dollar out-the-door price comparison.","name":"t1_cv1tn8k","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-15 03:10:41","week":38}

Evaluate the offerings and find a category that is stale and is need of reinvention. \n4. Cross reference these categories with relevant subreddit threads. \n5. Post about the product idea in the subreddit to validate the idea.\n6. Make sure enough people are interested and would purchase the product(s).\n7. Figure out how to source/manufacture the product. One way to do this would be find makers who can produce your new product idea. They might be doing it already. Check ETSY. Offer to market this new product to your customers and in exchange take a 30% commission. It could be drop shipped from the maker on ETSY. \n7. Buy a domain for $2.99 on Godaddy.com Example: tendollarstartup.com - It's available - I checked.\n8. Head over to squarespace.com and sign up for a free 30 day trial. Design a beautiful website for free using their free templates. Free 30 days to start generating revenue. Get free stock photos from https://pixabay.com\n9. Take photos of the products you sell with your iPhone. Google ways to create awesome photos.\n10. Create an Instagram account. Follow all the Instagram marketing guides you find to gain followers and direct people to the website. Same with Twitter and Facebook. Pure hustle. \n11. Hustle again. \n12. Repeat step 12.\n\nAn idea I've been thinking about is centered around subscription service. They're so hot right now!!! We've literally seen every type of product subscription but there is for sure more ideas that haven't been done. \n\nA cool idea would be a subscription box for the city you live in. People love to buy products from the city they visited, or used to live in. So if you sign up for this subscription box of let's say my city, Minneapolis you can get a few things that are made locally sent to you each month. As a resident, I would love that. As a former resident, it would be cool, and if I lived out of state and had moved away, it would remind me of home. \n\nUsing this  subscription idea you can use the steps I outlined above but the products already exist. All you have to do is convince the companies that make these products that they should let you sell them and take a commission without buying wholesale. If these are truly craft products and unique to you town, you should be able to convince 5-10 small companies to do this. No risk for you, upside for them. \n\nYou should be able to start this idea for under $5. Domain name. $2.99 Everything else is free. You can recoup the $2.99 if you sell just 1 item or 1 subscription. You can cover the cost of the square space account with just a few sales and you'll have 30 days to do that. Stand on the street corner if you have to!\n\nEven if you don't have a computer you could go do a public library and log on to the internet and do everything I've talked about. So for $2.99 you could start a business.

{"id":"cv3mjnb","author":"redcards","body":"Posting again since apparently pointing out GAAP metrics and logic is downvoted on this board. Apparently so many people on here own AMZN and FB and I'd think that everyone would like to know what they're actually buying. \n\nQuoting myself from the other month. \n&gt;AMZN is a debt and equity issuing, off balance sheet funding machine. Beyond that, who knows what they really do?\n\n&gt;They point to 17% ROIC - amazing! But what is the validity of that number? The company reported FCF of $4.6b, a four fold increase from this point last year. Their internal formula is very simple - CFO minus purchases of PP&amp;E. This is also the figure they use to calculate ROIC.\n\n&gt;Sounds great, but what about all of the operating leases?\nFCF minus lease principal repayments = $2.4b.\nFCF minus lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases = -492m!\n\n&gt;So which is the correct metric to use? I'm going with the last one. Why? Because when you calculate CFO, you add back depreciation - including capital lease depreciation.(CFA L1 stuff). So if CFO is juiced by capital lease depreciation, it would be impaired by capital lease expenditures.\n\n&gt;Everyone points to the AWS margins but I actually have no idea how profitable this business is due to how capital intensive it is, but all of the capital is being left off the balance sheet. If we capitalize 2016 lease obligations of $2b at 3x thats $6b of capital. Operating leases of $775m can be capitalized at 8x since that is probably the longer lived fulfillment centers. So that's another $5b in capital. Current assets and liabilities basically equal each other so there's no net cash. $12b in equity and $8.5b in debt and I'm assuming something like $32b invested capital.\n\n&gt;Using the same calculation method through June 2013 we get $15b invested capital - so today's capital base is basically double what it was two years ago. Equity is 35% higher over the same period and none of it is from retained earnings but instead paid-in capital.\nSo to my point, beyond issuing debt and equity, I'm not sure what AMZN does.\n\n\nAs for Facebook, my comments are in a hidden thread below but basically spending more cash than what you earn on non-revenue/profit/cash flow generating businesses is a bad strategy.","name":"t1_cv3mjnb","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-09-16 18:26:11","week":38}

She's a bit over a year old and in the 30-35 lb range (fluctuates a little), and is an epic level mutt (DNA test actually offered a refund because of how much of a mutt she is).\n\nShe had an umbilical hernia that needed to be taken care of ($600), and basic vet bills beyond that (including 3 yr rabies vaccine, other shots, flea/tick meds, heartworm meds, basic bloodwork to establish a baseline for her long term health, etc.) that come out to another $500 or so.\n\nWe boarded her a couple of times for a total of ~$300.\n\nWe got curious and did a DNA test (~$70 on Amazon).\n\nInitial setup fees were:\n\nAdoption fee: $400 (covered costs associated with initial vet bills, spay, and fostering for a few months while they placed her)\n\nCrate/bed/initial toy purchase: ~$300\n\nThe balance has been food, treats, training classes (you definitely want at least basic training so that your dog listens to you, but you may want more advanced training if your dog is particularly willful or you want to have them do agility courses to burn some energy; we took them at the local SPCA for ~$100/course, if I remember right), and some one off equipment, like a new harness when she outgrew her original one, a light up collar for night walks (I can't recommend it enough, especially if you are able to take off leash walks with your dog in evenings), a travel crate (for a flight when we relocated cross country), and a new convertible leash.\n\nAt this point, our monthly food/treat costs have flattened out at about $15-$20/month; our annual medical costs should be &lt;$500. Boarding costs are likely to be a case of beer or some home cooked food, as we now live near family and friends that can watch her, usually in exchange for us watching their dogs. We don't foresee replacing her bed/crates at this point (might look into a better travel crate for the trunk of our car, but that's about it) so those costs should be behind us. She's not too destructive with her toys, so we should be looking at &lt;$50/year for new toys.\n\nWe've spent a little extravagantly off the bat, but settled down now; realistically, you should have maybe half the first year costs we did because we had some extra medical expenses (like the hernia surgery) and we had to buy some extra items, like an airline approved travel crate.","name":"t1_cv3pkuw","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-16 19:40:36","week":38}

{"id":"cv3qww8","author":"TheRealAntacular","body":"I wouldn't say there's a specific CCC number you're looking for, but rather, watch the trend. (Non-cash) Working capital = non-cash current assets - current liabilities. When current assets go up, working capital increases, and thus cash flows out of the business. When current liabilities go up, working capital decreases, and thus cash flows into the business. The same applies for both inverse scenarios as well (i.e. current assets decrease = increase in cash flow, current liabilities decrease = decrease in cash flow). \n\nThe CCC determines how many days it takes for the firm to convert sales into cashflow. When it's negative (usually with firms that have negative working capital), it means that the suppliers (i.e. accounts payable, a current liability) are funding the business. It's essentially interest free loans. The more negative the number, the easier it is for a company to collect cashflow. DELL was famously able to make this model work, and currently AAPL has had a real negative CCC for the last 10 years.\n\nConversely, when it's a positive (or increasing) number, it takes longer to obtain the cashflow. Longer time to collect cashflow = more resources tied up in running the business. With AMZN, the CCC is increasing, meaning there's a greater drain on OCF, since OCF adds back changes to working capital that doesn't factor into GAAP net income.

I had been working on creating a belt that included a USB charger kit so that it could charge your phone while it's in your pocket, but found a project on Kickstarter that was almost identical to my design, so I scrapped it. Soon after I was with a coworker that needed a knife, and we ended up spending 5 minutes looking for one. I got to thinking \"why don't I just carry a pocket knife\" and realized I don't because I don't like the bulk in my pocket. So I put my old idea of the USB belt together with the pocketknife idea and came up with my current product.\n\n3) [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1393241265/mbelt-simple-beautiful-utility-spydercotm](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1393241265/mbelt-simple-beautiful-utility-spydercotm)","name":"t1_cv48013","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-17 03:41:43","week":38}

They generally take a more personal look at approvals instead of just looking at your numbers like a big bank would.\n\nAS for what CC would be good for you, it really depends on what your credit looks like and what spending you have.  Nerdwallet.com is a good resource to use and my go-to recommendations are Citi DoubleCash (for very balanced spending) and SallieMae BarclayCar (if your heavy into gas, groceries, and Amazon).\n\nLastly, look into putting away money for a downpayment on a house IF home ownership is something you want and you plan to stay put for awhile.","name":"t1_cv4r1x0","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-17 17:21:01","week":38}

We also set a spending limit on my Discover card (the one I use) that is manageable and an email is sent to her if it is exceeded.

{"id":"cv4thr9","author":"uxcn","body":"It depends on how you define a market participant.  Most people probably wouldn't agree on a quantifiable definition for an abstract concept like a market participant.  Although at the highest level, I tend to think of market participants as reactions to information and intended interactions with the market through orders (etc...).\n\nSo if I use my definition, the difference is in the way orders and information are handled for participants.  Getting information before other participants can be considered an implicit preference.  Likewise, if certain orders are allowed to participate in the market before others it also implies a preference.\n\nA more concrete way to think about it might be quarterly earnings.  If Amazon were to tell certain people that its Fire Phone were a nine figure write down before others, those people are given preference.

{"id":"cv4toe3","author":"evertrue13","body":"I answered your question below, but read this first. It sounds like you are/were not paying off the monthly balance on your credit cards. Whatever cards you have, you are hurting yourself by doing this. \n\n**STEP 1**: Spend only what you can pay off monthly. Ideally, spend as little as possible.\n\nThe rates on the cards you have should NEVER matter if you are responsible. Since you have paid off your CC debt, DO NOT go back into owing any amount. Do not let the interest build up. \n\nSpending money on your 30% card and 8% card should have no difference if you pay each off on time. Using a credit card responsibly is like getting small rewards for spending money normally. It punishes you if you use it irresponsibly. \n\n**STEP 2**: It sounds like you need an emergency fund, since you literally stated you need money to fall back on in case of emergency.\n\nCredit cards are a HORRIBLE first-choice emergency fund. They should be an absolute last resort in case your liquid assets aren't sufficient. Save up cash in a high-yield savings account (PF advocates for credit unions, while online accounts like Ally or CapitalOne may be simplest). The savings rate may only be around 1%, but that's better than anything else. Keep saving a consistent amount and only use it for emergencies. \n\nNow, for your original question. The rule of thumb is to leave your credit card accounts open, even if you no longer use the card. A portion of your credit score is based on the average longevity of your credit accounts. If you close a CC, especially the first one you ever had, you are cutting that average time by a lot and lowering your credit score. \n\nWhat I do is just keep any unused cards in a drawer and leave them  unused. The bank/credit card issuer may cancel an inactive card on their own years down the road, but you do not need to worry about that. \n\n**CARD ADVICE:**\n\nWhat I do is use a SallieMae MasterCard (best non-fee card with 5% back on groceries, gas, and Amazon; 1% on everything else) and the Bank of America Better Balance Rewards Card.\n\nAll spending goes on the SallieMae - rewards rack up quickly.\n\nAll recurring bills (utilities, Spotify, Netflix, HBO, gym, bikeshare, carshare) go on the BofA Better Balance - less than $100 per month total so not a big hit to the rewards. Just paying this card off in full monthly nets you $100 per year in rewards ($120 if you have another open BofA account).

{"id":"cv4ufr8","author":"compounding","body":"Amazon isn’t in the business of selling devices, they just want to make their content as available as possible to push up the value of a prime subscription.\n\nThe device that eventually wins the living room will be the device that consumers know they can go to get *all* of their content. Specs, price, or even Apple’s fabled interface wizardry will not overcome that hurdle.\n\nI think Ben Thompson really hit the nail on the head here: consumers have been willing to pay hundreds of dollars and deal with interfaces so bad they have been relegated to literally flipping through the channels one by one, or waiting for a slow scrolling and lagy TV Guide channel... but none of these streaming boxes with much better interfaces have dethroned cable boxes to become dominant because thats the only place consumers *know* has all the content. A small fraction will only care about one or two shows and one box or another will work for them, but anything that will achieve dominance among the masses has to become the go-to place for all your content, period.\n\nFrom that perspective, Xbox actually has the lead since has almost all of the services integrated together in one place along with your cable subscription.\n\nIf Comcast puts a well implemented “on demand” app on one of these streaming boxes where universal search can access its data and integrate a full cable subscription with netflix and hulu, then it might stand a chance. Even if every provider individually puts their own app out like HBO go onto one platform, that might work to end-run around the cable companies even. But all of the concern about device price and specs and everything else is totally secondary as far as actually getting control over this space.","name":"t1_cv4ufr8","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-09-17 18:47:27","week":38}

{"id":"cv4v39h","author":"DrunkFishBreatheAir","body":"Listen to other people for what to do broadly, but as far as getting credit cards, people here seem strangely pessimistic. I got the Citi Forward Card with a $1000 limit (just raised to $2000) without really any income right before I went to college, and I just got American Express's Blue Cash Card with a $4500 limit approved 5 minutes after I applied (about a 700 credit score and 10k annual income, dunno if I would've had trouble without that).\n\nI highly recommend the Forward Card. You get about 3% back on everything if you'll take it as Amazon credit, and it was suuuper easy to get approved.\n\nIf you can continue your spending as if nothing has changed, just putting it on a credit card, I don't see why you wouldn't go for as high a limit as you can get, but if you're worried you'll use a credit card as a means to spend money you don't have then start with a smaller limit. The higher your limit though the better, because if you use too high a percentage of your limit regularly it hurts you.\n\nEdit: One more thing. I don't know if this was irresponsible (hopefully people will tell me if it was) but I paid zero attention to the interest rates on my cards. I knew I would use them as debit cards and stop using them if I couldn't pay them off, so I focused on getting the best perks I could instead of the best rates I could.","name":"t1_cv4v39h","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-17 19:03:50","week":38}

{"id":"cv55gii","author":"moonoak20698","body":"My husband and I (will have been married three years in January) just switched from AT&amp;T to Straight Talk. We LOVE IT. Before, we were each on our parents' family plans and didn't have smart phones, just unlimited talk and text. \n\nTax and all with Straight Talk we pay $97.62 a month for unlimited talk, text, and data. That's $48.81 apiece. \n\nBy unlimited data, they mean you get 5GB of high speed data to start off with, and once you've gone through that they slow you down to 2G. That can be a pain, but I stream videos and am on FB constantly and have only gone over a few times. And while they do slow you down, they don't charge you extra, which I really appreciate. \n\nFor me, the only downside is that, while you can bring your own phone from any carrier you want (Customer Service will walk you through how to unlock it), they don't offer any free upgrades. So we've had to buy our phones (Samsung S4 &amp; S4 Actives) outright, which was a pretty big initial investment. Obviously they're not the newest models, but they were still around $300 from Amazon. BUT if you make them last it's not bad. \n\n As far as service goes, we live in rural Alabama, and while occasionally I'll hit patches where I don't get great service, it's places where *nobody* gets service. This summer we took a family vacation to the Ozark Mountains in Missouri and I never once had service issues. And, saying this as a person from rural Alabama, we were in the *boonies*. They operate off the same towers as the major companies, so their overall service (in my experience) is great.\n\nAlso, while customer service is based out of the continental US (doesn't bother me, but I know some people care), it has always been FANTASTIC. They're super helpful and polite. I highly recommend them.","name":"t1_cv55gii","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-09-17 23:24:00","week":38}

{"id":"cv5f80y","author":"jrossetti","body":"The software was one of the ONLY things that met policy as an FYI, and that's totes fine. \n\nI guess it takes understanding that all sellers on Amazon have agreed to at least follow their minimum requirements.  For example, you can offer a lifetime return policy, but you can't offer a 29 day one.  You can only exceed, and never reduce.  With that understanding this guy is a complete and utter asshole. \n\n\n\n1.  You can't tell people you will refuse to cancel pre-order items, much less tell them they HAVE to pay for it and then return it.  Amazon allows cancellations on pre-orders, which means so do all sellers.\n\n He'll refuse to cancel any orders even if it was seconds later and then charge you a restocking fee, which you aren't allowed to do if an item doesn't ship.  There's also no good reason to refuse to do it except to try and be anti-consumer.  There's no way he has some fancy automated system to immediately take an item that is sold, immediately buy postage, get it on the item, and bring it to the mail.  Even if there was an automated system, I can all but guarantee mail pickup is once a day and although inconvenient it's how it is.  Further, we're notified when shipping labels print as a seller and are also usually aware of when the scan is.\n\n\n\n2.  He requires that ALL returns have paid for insurance with their original packaging, and original packing materials.  Amazon requires sellers to accept returns without that stuff and does not require insurance except on items over 100 and that's a violation as well.  He can charge a restocking fees and is also the process Amazon has in place to account for those types of issues.\n\n3.  He refuse to allow returns for buyers remorse in the furniture category and he must accept returns within 30 days for ANY reason as Amazon's return policy is.\n\n4.  He will refuse a refund for shipping related reasons if it's not reported within SEVEN days and further expects them to save all boxes, damage, and such for him. Although I appreciate why, you can't require it because Amazon says customers generally have 30 days for all returns.\n\n5. You must accept returns for sports memorabilia and such as long as it has all of the same certs, items, and other items in the identical condition and he says you can't return any of them.\n\n6. This one should have been the obvious one for you though and that's concerning if you're in this sub and that's his costume requirement.  Amazon is not a halloween store.  Amazon requires sellers to accept returns for items purchased 365 days of the year, not just ones purchased in months outside of october and part of September.  \n\n7. As a buyer I dont actually have to discuss anything with him.  He can ask but I dont have to discuss it.  If I dont give a reason then he is entitled to charge me the maximum restocking allowed as per his return policy in the condition I return it.  I dont have to follow some insurance rules or provide the original cardboard wrapping that kept it closed as he's asking to.  \n\nThe ASIN on the item showed a pound (it's about a pound with all packing materials), this wasn't an FBA shipment and automated which I know what you're talking about.\n\n This was a mailed from regular third party  not FBA and it's my understanding you can include packing weight on all shipments.  No one accidentally hits 5 for a 1 lb package.  It should have cost me about around six bucks.  The rep blamed him and said she was opening an investigation ticket for it.  She also opened another one regarding his returnj policy stating it was \"over the top\". \n\nI posted wanting to make sure sellers here understood this.  Amazon is not ebay.  You really need to read about what you can do before you go adding restrictions that you dont have a nice little check box option.  If you could alter it, amazon would give you a way to do so is a good general rule.  (for restrictions, you can obviously include anything you want that's better than them)\n\nI was wrong, the intimates section meets amazon minimums too.\n\n\n","name":"t1_cv5f80y","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-18 04:08:17","week":38}

{"id":"cv5yynl","author":"thewimsey","body":"&gt; maybe it is not realistic.\n\nAs a single person with a similar take-home, I tend to spend about $300/month on spending money, which was why I thought $50/week was on the low side (although obviously there's no rule about this). \n\nSo you might try bumping it to $75 a week and see if that works better.  Relatedly, it *might* be easier to give yourself $150 every two weeks - it would give you a little more flexibility...but obviously you'll still need to pay attention so you don't blow it all on the first day.\n\nAnother thing you might start doing is to try and identify annual (or other infrequent) bills and budget 1/12 of each bill every month (for annual bills).  This will make your budget more reliable and realistic because you won't be constantly surprised by things like the $150 car registration or $99 Amazon Prime renewal or $300 semi-annual insurance premium.  Not that you couldn't pay these from savings or whatever, but unexpected expenses like this are frustrating because they keep busting your budget.","name":"t1_cv5yynl","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-09-18 18:02:25","week":38}

{"id":"cv5ztnx","author":"IronMaiden45","body":"I don't recommend a loan since your credit score may not help you obtain a decent rate and your debt to income ratio is not so great either. Pick up a second job while you work the dealership. Pay the minimum payment on the Amazon and Macy's cards. It should be about $20 to $30. Then throw them in a desk drawer and don't use them until you have them paid off. Work on putting as much into paying off the the high interest card and look into getting a card with 0% APR for x months. See if you qualify and you can usually transfer your debt off the card with as little as 3% added. This will buy you time. Then pay as much as you can and pay your rent. These days, if you want to live reasonably, a CC is a must. Then once you pay off the high interest card you should have a better credit score. Get a better credit card with a lower interest. I recommend Chase Freedom or the Discover IT card. Don't worry about an emergency fund. In my experience, I use my credit card to pay things like that since usually it's way more than what I can actually save. Then every month I pay as much as possible to my credit cards. This way you will build your credit score and hopefully earn some cash back.

{"id":"cv64ek2","author":"dataoverdose","body":"&gt; I went to Mercedes.\n\nRule #1 on how not to go bankrupt. Never go to the stealership, their prices are outrageous. Go to an independent mechanic that specializes in foreign cars. You can simply call for their hourly rate, especially for something like an oil change. \n\nI think you should keep going and try to reach 300k miles. I would rethink things if your engine lock is having problems, but you should keep up with items like: spark plugs, coils, suspension bits, belts, oil, differential fluids, trans fluids, brake parts. \n\nDealerships are there to make money, so of course everything isn't up to par - because it's not brand new. Get the print out of what you need, and consider what may be most important, and think of doing one item in the winter. Then another in the spring. \n\nDealers suggest RunFlat tires as well, and that's $400/tire, there's no way I'd ever pay that.  So you have to take their suggestions by shoving salt down your throat and in your wounds. I go to [Pelican Parts for 9/10 of my repairs.](http://www.pelicanparts.com/catalog/SuperCat/3782_catalog.htm).  You can even compare many items that are from the manufacture to an aftermarket name with 100% identical part numbers, just no MercBenz box or stick on the part. \n\nFor example: you can do an oil change, for around $50-60 by getting your own filters online from Amazon or Pelican, and buy oil when it's on sale at your local Auto store. There are always sales. I know you prob don't want to do your own oil change, as ramps or jacks/stand are needed, but that's just something to measure against. \n\nAt least - get your own ODBI or ODBII scanner for $25-50 on Amazon, and plug it in to read codes. Google your code by \"Merc Benz E320 Code #A100-4555.\" And 100% of the time, someone else out there has had the exact same problem. Many people are on the forums. And they will praise your 1998 Benz.  Many Porsche 911s are known for high costs, but if you can turn a wrench and read a DIY with minimal tools and a jack, you can do your own brakes. Dealership would charge near $2-3k while you can do an axle for under $370 - rotors and pads. \n\nIf you have the means and a Saturday morning to burn, then try to do it yourself.

I would suggest doing an individual one, a bundle of 5, and a bundle of ten unless you want to min/max then you just send in some singles and maybe a bundle of five.  Your target demographic is people with a phone as opposed ot resellers when you sell one at a time.\n\nThen they tell you where to send em, and you box em up and send em.  Youll use their label service since you probably dont have a label maker and such.  It costs .20 each and isn't a big deal.\n\nThen you sit and wait.  You'll know within a month if this is a viable solution.  since you paid nothing it's worth ruling out.  Also, find out how much these are even selling for, or similar competitor products. That flea market idea I really like if this is an item that only sells for 10-15 bucks normally. After fees and time that 5 per to a flea market guy is an incredibly good deal and instant as opposed to getting a few hundred more over the course of months that it takes to sell.\n\n","name":"t1_cv76mzr","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-19 21:38:59","week":38}

{"id":"cv7fl46","author":"alexs88","body":"Hey pal.\n\nCUSTOMS: this is why I recommend AliExpress over AliBaba for your first order.  No complicated customs stuff- you just click, and it's shipped to your door by USPS in 2 weeks.  No questions asked.\n\nTo answer your question, though, if you use DHL, they take care of all of that for you, and if customs fees apply, they pay it and send you a bill later.  I believe the rule of thumb is: under $2500 of value, no customs fees.  That is why sometimes, suppliers split a $5000 shipment up into 2 packages, for example.  I know DHL does this, not 100% sure if other carriers (UPS, FedEx, etc.) also do as well, but pretty sure they all do this.\n\nSHIP DIRECTLY TO AMAZON: I would recommend against it for your first order man.  Even if your sample was 100% OK, I'd want to make sure that what I am selling is OK.  What if you ordered 500 units and 100 of them are broken?  The return rate and complain rate will shut down your Amazon account.  It's dangerous to send stuff blind to Amazon.\n\nIf you don't live in the USA or really don't want to do this for some reaosn, you can pay inspection companies about $100-$200 to go down to the factory, in person, and make sure the product is by your specifications.\n\nI've heard horror stories about ppl getting boxes full of bolts.  Don't risk it man.\n\nREVIEWS:  Paid groups are one...but people on there buy your shit for $1 and re-sell as their own.

I use speedybarcodes.com.  It is instantly emailed to you.\n\nDO NOT go through the GS1.  It takes months and you have to pay hundreds.  A UPC code from an online retailer works just as well FOR AMAZON.\n\nI say FOR AMAZON because...\n\nIf you decide to sell in Physical stores like Big 5, Wal Mart, etc., they generally require you to have your own.\n\nBut Amazon doesn't care.  Do it the easy way, not the hard way.  I got caught up in this detail and it freaked me out for a few days.  Trust me, buy a code for a few bucks, check it off, move on, re-evaluate when you start making $50K in sales per month and want to move to brick and mortar stores :)","name":"t1_cv7kqy6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-20 05:28:28","week":38}

You can communicate directly with manufacturers, order high quantities for cheaper, customize your logo, customize your packaging, customize your colors, etc.   They do all of the labeling and packaging FOR YOU.  No need for boxes and stickers.  For example, you can make a company called \"Ambipath\", design a cool logo, and have a factory stick it on a bottle and voila, you have a line of water bottles.\n\nTo answer your question a different way: no, you are not inventing anything.  You are finding products that sell on Amazon, you are searching for factories in China that produce those products, you make a few improvements, you buy those products at wholesale prices from the factory, and you sell at resale pricing on Amazon.","name":"t1_cv7l0tk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-09-20 05:38:03","week":38}

Here is the deal: if you give your product away for a discount to get reviewed, the review MUST HAVE IN IT THE FOLLOWING PHRASE:\n\n\"I am providing this unbiased review for a discounted item\"\n\nOr else it'll get removed.  They don't F around with this.\n\nALSO, make sure no one with your same last name (family), or who has used your computer, reviews.  Theirs will be removed.\n\nTo show how serious this is, I asked a co-worker to buy and review a product at full price.  When she tried to leave a review, Amazon wouldn't let her, because they claimed to know that she was a friend of mine.  We aren't FB friends, we've never used the same computer...it's weird.\n\nI think they did this because my IP address and her IP address are the same, from logging in from the same workplace.

This is by no means always and everywhere true, Reich has only a superficial understanding of the way market structure interacts with welfare. Even with just two firms you can attain a perfectly competitive outcome, while a market with dozens of firms can see each exert some level of market power. Market concentration isn't indicative of consumer welfare, it's just the first stop actual economists take on a far more detailed and complicated set of analyses. Reich takes the concentration of web page hits as an indicator that the market should be broken up. Do we really think Amazon, Google, Netflix, etc aren't particularly innovative? Economies of scale and network effects both interact meaningfully with consumer welfare such that we can't just look at a Herfindahl score and call it a day.

Profit Bandit switched to a monthly subscription.\n\nI had no issues paying for Profit Bandit when it was a $15 one-time charge.  However, I despise the monthly payment subscription model, and when the Amazon Seller App is 100% free, there's no reason for me to pay anything.\n\n---\n\nMy theory is that Profit Bandit realized there are a finite amount of people they could sell to.  It's not like they have a game like Candy Crush where everybody likes to play it.  Most of the population has zero interest in reselling, so everyone who wanted a good scanning app had probably already paid the $15.  They needed to keep making money somehow, so they switched to the monthly model.  Unfortunately for them, Amazon is giving sellers the same capabilities for free.","name":"t1_cv848iv","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-09-20 20:31:55","week":38}
{"id":"cv84slc","author":"akarya","body":"I tried using Profit Bandit and a couple other scanning tools but found that the data was inaccurate when compared to the amazon seller app and the amazon website. I really wanted to make use of a 3rd party scanning app because of the sound notification which sped up the sourcing process but that feature is meaningless if the data it is triggered by is wrong. So I only use the Amazon Seller app despite the fact that it is a little slower than 3rd party apps but it gives me the correct information to make my buying decisions without leaving money at the stores.
