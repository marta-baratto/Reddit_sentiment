{"id":"3h9cd4","author":"throwaway15555z4","body":"I'm in this very weird situation with my debit/visa and didn't know which subreddit to ask help for, but I am sure that people here will have some helpful answers.\n\nSo I created a Debit/Visa card from Chase a week ago. Everything went fine. (I'm a Canadian citizen thats moved to the US for school). All I needed was my I-20 and my passport and proof of American address.  \n\nAfter I made this card, I made three online purchases at  A and F,  Amazon and Uniqlo. (I believe in this order). The first order went through and they processed the order and shipped the merchandise. However, the next two orders were repeatedly rejected by the stores for incorrect billing address. I was a bit confused as to why this was happening so I went online to my chase account and saw that the address my card was registered to, wasn't actually my real address. I quickly updated my card and didn't think much of it. \n\nAll was fine and dandy until I found out that while A and F thought they had received my money, Chase had not taken any money out of my account through credit. In fact, when I called Chase, they saw that I had tried to make a purchase through A and F using my Debit/Visa but it didn't go through. Therefore, A and F think that they took money out of my account and processed the order. HOWEVER, no money was actually taken. \n\nI called A and F telling them that I want to pay for my merchandise and that they should arrange a separate payment link to me. However, they told me through phone that this isn't necessary because in their system I had already paid. I told them about what the Chase person had told me through the phone and they told me to email Order Services. I sent them an email telling them of the situation saying that if they do not let me pay, I will just return the merchandise. I got a reply a few minutes ago that complete ignored my main message but instead just told me that my order was processed and should be in by Wednesday. \n\nI feel stuck and feel like I did something wrong. My question is, why did my order not get rejected at A and F since the billing address used was in correct? Amazon and Uniqlo had an automated system that just rejected my payment and told me to revise it due to the incorrectly inputted billing address. I also really want to keep the merchandise, is there a way for me to pay for it? \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated it. \n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3h9cd4","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-17 02:46:34","week":34}

{"id":"3hb5ss","author":"jshogren10","body":"**Background**\n\nGo down to --------------------- to skip intro\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy name is Josh Shogren and I am about to be a sophomore in College. I have been creating niche websites for the past year and a half, including selling a site for close to $12k. I currently have a portfolio of websites that make me hundreds of dollars each month and I continue to build new ones.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAmazon Affiliate Proof - [http://imgur.com/EuIbVHE](http://imgur.com/EuIbVHE)\n\n\nOther Affiliate Site - [http://imgur.com/9frovuk](http://imgur.com/9frovuk)\n\n\nSold Site Proof - [http://imgur.com/1w8LAkZ](http://imgur.com/1w8LAkZ)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy main area of expertise when it comes to websites is being able to rank them in Google. I utilize my private blog network (PBN) sites to rank most of my sites and in my opinion the best way to rank sites. That is if you know what you are doing. I think that investing in websites is going to be huge within 10 years and will be recognized as an actual investment strategy just as stocks, bonds and real estate are today. We are in the very early stages of websites and if you know what you are doing you can make a killing buying/selling websites.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOr you can buy and hold websites and get an incredible return on your money, especially compared to the average 8% annual return on traditional investments. I am not going to go in depth into this topic but here is an example of an average return for a website:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nA website making $1,000 a month can be purchased for $20k based on the 20x the 3 month average profit. So let’s say we buy that website for $20k and we get $1k each month in profit. That ends up being 5% return on your money MONTHLY, or 60% YEARLY. Those are insane RIO and the crazy thing is this is very normal for websites.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI have explained this to my parents for the past year or so and they always found it intriguing, but recently they have gotten serious about it after we had a long sit down talk about the potential of investing in websites. We decided that my parents would purchase the website with their money and I would run the website. We agreed on splitting the monthly earnings 50/50 and then when we well the website they get their initial investment back and then we split the leftover profits in half.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nExample, bought a website for $10k then sold for $16k. They would get their initial $10k back and then we would split the remaining $6k between us 50/50. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThey gave me an initial budget of $10k-$15k to look for a website for them to invest in. A couple days later after we talked about this, my parents told some friends of theirs and they are willing to invest another $10k in websites as well.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAll in all, I have around a $20k-$25k budget to look for a website or websites to invest in with this money. This was about two weeks ago, I have made a website purchase since then. Read below.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI ended up buying a website from Flippa that is making $500 a month from adsense. I bought the website for only $6k, which is deeply undervalued. A site making $500 a month should at least sell for $10k, so I got a steal of a deal! If I wanted to, I could hold onto the site for 3 months, make $500 a month and then sell it for $10k. I would make $4k profit + $1500 earnings = $5.5k profit in 3 months.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHowever this is not my plan, my plan is to increase the monthly earnings and hold onto it for a while. Then sell it once I feel like I have maxed out the earning potential of the site. I will talk more about my future plans for this in a minute, but first I want to talk about why I liked this site so much(aside from the cheap price).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Diversified Traffic Sources**\n\n\nThis is huge. We are all aware of how easily Google can wipe a site completely off the grid in no time. That is why it is NOT smart to rely on only organic google traffic for your site, or only one traffic source for that matter.\nThe site I bought has diversified traffic sources, the breakdown is below:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSocial Traffic - 53%\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nDirect Traffic - 25%\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nOrganic Traffic - 18%\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nReferral Traffic - 4%\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nProof Thru 2 Days - [http://imgur.com/ES2EceB](http://imgur.com/ES2EceB)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf one of those traffic sources gets wiped out for whatever reason, the site would still be fine and earn money. It might not earn as much money as before, but it would still make money and be able to be sold. The most important thing is that you can’t go from having a website that earns $500 a month to $0 overnight. Multiple traffic streams prevent this happening.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**High Volume of Traffic**\n\n\nThe site get’s on average 1k-2k visitors each day fairly consistently, sometimes even more! That is a lot of traffic which makes testing out different monetization methods a lot easier and more efficient.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nProof - [http://imgur.com/StNaAPx](http://imgur.com/StNaAPx)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Growing Organic Traffic**\n\n\nI was given access to the previous owner’s Google Analytics account before I purchased the site and one of the best things I saw was that the organic traffic has increased each month for the past year. I don’t have access to their account anymore so I can’t show you firsthand. However, you can see the growth from Semrush in the image below:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSemrush Traffic Growth - [http://imgur.com/DrGRD7N](http://imgur.com/DrGRD7N)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSemrush does a good job showing the google organic traffic growth by tracking the number of keywords that are in the top 20 of Google. You can see that the amount of keywords that this site ranks for in the top 20 continue to grow month after month. This is a great sight to see. The reason for this continued to growth is because the previous owner writes 3 new articles a week and the site ranks for a TON of long tail keywords. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Under Optimized Monetization Methods**\n\n\nGoogle adsense is one of the easiest ways to monetize any website, but there are usually better ways to do it. Adsense also makes it very easy to use other monetization methods ALONG with adsense. For example, it is very easy to use Amazon and Adsense to monetize a site without affecting the original adsense earnings too drastically. The only source of income for this site is from adsense and I think there are better ways to make money from this website. I am thinking about trying Amazon Affiliate, other affiliate’s within the niche, selling ad space and selling my own physical product.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI also think I can improve the adsense earnings because the previous owner had poor ad placement on the site. They didn’t have any ads within the content, which from my experience is one of the best earning ad placements you can choose. That alone should increase the earnings.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOne of the biggest areas where I think I can improve the sites earnings is from optimizing for mobile users. I noticed that the site only showed one ad when viewing the mobile version of the site, instead of the normal 3 ads when viewing on a desktop. This means that A LOT of money is being taken off the table by not optimizing for mobile users. This is especially true considering over 50% of the sites users are mobile. I think by changing this I can improve the earnings greatly.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Proven Track Record**\n\n\nThis site was created over a year ago and has increased traffic/earnings steadily since then. There has also only been one owner which is a good thing to see.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Relatively Safe Investment**\n\n\nSince I am using other people’s money to buy this site I want to make sure the website I am buying is as safe as can be. This means that there are no major risks or red flags surrounding the site which could possibly wipe out the earnings and traffic.\n\n\nDiversified traffic sources, proven track record, clean backlink profile and monetized by adsense all make this website investment very safe compared to normal websites that are purchased.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Goals**\n\n\nI think that I can grow this site to earning $1k+ a month consistently and my plan is to hold it as long as there is still earning potential. Once I reach the peak of earnings I will think about selling it, this will be 9+ months down the road. For now, I will testing out different monetization methods and trying to increase the traffic to the site.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Future Plans**\n\n\nFuture plans for this site will be to add 2-3 new articles each week and keep growing the organic traffic month after month. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of long tail keywords that can be turned into articles for this site. These long tail keywords may only have 50 monthly searches but when you have 100 of them it starts to add up. That’s the plan for now. I also will NOT be building any sort of backlinks to this site, instead I will let it grow naturally!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAs for investing the rest of the money (~$10k - $20k), I will be searching Flippa and Empire Flippers everyday until I find a site that I want. I am not going to rush into buying any site and I will make sure that it is the perfect site before I purchase. I truly believe that investing in websites is the future and right now the market is ripe to make a killing. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf you all want, I can come back in a month and give you all an update on the progress of the site I bought as well as if I found any other sites to buy. if this is something that you all might like let me know in the comments.\n\n\nThank you for all for reading!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Source](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/i-just-bought-a-website-for-6k-heres-why)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nP.S.

{"id":"3hdjny","author":"nofearthrowaway","body":"I built this throwaway so I could make this post.\n\nIn it are detailed records on my finances and assets as I can provide without feeling like I'm giving you all the data to steal it all away.  I'm asking you what I should do, as I recently lost my job due to some deaths in the family (I asked for time off, they refused, told me to keep working, and then closed the contract when I explained I needed time to deal with the death and used the company status as the reason) and I cant help but feel like I cant do this any more. I need help.\n\nAssets:\n\n* Mint says I have a little over $29,000 in cash in all my accounts.\n* A house worth 303k that I owe almost that much on. Looking at the numbers this is the first time it hasn't been underwater in a long time.\n* A car that is not paid off yet.\n\nDebts:\n\n * Mortgage for the house referenced above with a monthly payment of $1860\n * The car loan at 4.25% with $17,800.70 left on it and a payment of slightly under $400/month.\n * Credit card debt is much better than it was but I still have 16k on it @13.24%, I put a minimal of 400 on it and have been putting 2k on paying it down every month - 1k every 2 weeks when I got paid - up until I lost my job. At one point I had 150k of debt so I'm happy its only 16 but I still consider it a lot. \n\nOn Expenses:\n\n * Monthly expenses total a little over 5k/month before the car insurance suddenly went up, this includes a 1k stipend to my mother and disabled brother.  With the car insurgence higher my budget is $5198.75/month as they added like 200 to it.\n * I am cutting expenses where I can, constantly.  If I find something we have not used ina while I remove it, and I am always on the lookout for cheaper alternatives to things we use a lot.\n * Example: My 8k-10k/year physical book habit is now a Safari Books Subscription and a Kindle Unlimited Subscription for much cheaper; this was done before I lost my job.\n * I don't have Cable  TV at all just internet, we use Amazon Prime and Netflix. I have not had Cable TV since 2005, when I \"cut the cord\"\n\nSomebody asked for a listing of expenses so I am looking into it now... and realizing that my wife is spending money - about 100 - I didn't know about. Outside of that:\n\n* Mortgage - $1860 - We refinanced to get it down as much as possible a few years ago.\n* Car loan - $400 - To a credit union.\n* Minimal CC payment: $400, was paying 2k per month to pay it down as I hate debt.\n* Car Insurance: $350 /month - tried to get it lower but they refused.  They had reported false items against my CLUE report to make my bill go up and would not remove them. Called LexusNexus/CLUE and they say its been removed due to no response form the insurance agency but the insurance says the cost stays as far as the insurance is concerned because they are assholes.\n* Water/Sewer - $100/month - Pretty stable despite attempts to keep it cheap.\n* Food: $500 (On a special diet needed for medical reasons, cant make it go down any more) for the entire family. Low carb, high protein diet for one, other not on special diet.\n* Internet - 50$/month fr 108/Mb/sec and its needed to allow saving money on enough other things that the math says its a good investment. Also as a software guy its impossible for me to not have internet and still survive, its also helping me in my job search/sanity.\n* Netflix - $8.75 - Sanity (and documentaries, educational)\n* Power and Gas: $150/month for a house. Required, cant think of any way to get it down, I even unplug things we are not using to save a few cents.\n* Phone - $180 for 2 cellphones, required for legal stuffs I can't get into as my wife is not American by birth and it helps us with immigration if she has a phone of her own (helps prove she is not a mail order bride, is not under duress, etc).\n* Car gas - About $200 a month as I had a long commute (32 miles one way) to work. \n* Stipend to Disabled mother and brother - $1k. Not a loan, I'm never getting this money back, I'm the only person in the family able to work and they live in poverty so I take care of some food needs they cant get any other way and other things.\n\nI want to do FIRE but I have too many debts so I have been slowly chipping away at them trying to get rid of them first while still having the buffer.  I'm glad my planning worked out as we have a month or two before things get scary but to be honest, I'm still worried, and of course the new wife - we are newlyweds - is freaking out.  \n\nAny advice or changes, data you think I missed that I need to think about, etc, please let me know  want to do this right.","name":"t3_3hdjny","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-18 01:09:56","week":34}

I have a lot of cards because I was a normal guy who turned into an over-excited churner..\n\nAfter my recent acquisitions, my current spend plan is as follows:\n\n* American Express Platinum: MS via Serve for rent to meet 3K minimum spend\n\n* American Express BCP: Groceries (and gift cards for other available expenses: Amazon, gas, eating out, etc.) for CB and also to meet 1K minimum spend\n\n* Citi DoublePoints: Everything else\n\n----\n\nI mainly got the AmEx Platinum (and hopefully soon the AmEx Delta Reserve) for the benefits because I'm military and am going to pursue the waived AFs--I understand this also opens the door to many other cards as well.\n\nAside from my general CB desires, travel goals include a trip to Hawaii for one in May 2016 and possibly a weekend getaway trip for two in September 2016 in either NYC or Vegas.

{"id":"3hf9zk","author":"SpeedyBlueDude","body":"Hey r/Credit! So I was wondering if signing up for a Credit Card JUST for the bonus is a potential way to hurt my Credit Score. \n\nRight now I currently have... 4 lines of credit?\nAmazon Store Card (first place to give me a chance) \nGamestop Credit Card (was just trying to build credit lol)\nCapital One QuickSilver\nAmerican Express Blue Cash Everday\n\nAt this point, all my bases are covered. AMEX has given me a generous credit limit considering my new Credit History, and between the AMEX and Capital One, I don't need any other cards. Both give me 0%APR and both give me cash back, so I don't use anything else. \n\nEven then, I still find myself randomly wanting to open accounts, I just applied for the Amazon Visa Card, and got approved. A free $70 gift card? Why the hell not right?\n\nI'll probably never use the card, because it doesn't offer 0% APR for a set time, aside from maybe one $30 purchase a quarter to keep it active, but assuming I still play it smart and don't spend more than I can afford to repay, continuing to open up cards like this won't hurt my Credit right? Or should I be careful when I see offers and think about accepting them?\n\nEDIT: Another question... if I Just never even bother using the card, so I don't hassle with keeping another website to visit every month, what would happen? Would Chase just decide to close the account if I never used the card?","name":"t3_3hf9zk","subreddit":"CRedit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qph1","created_utc":"2015-08-18 10:46:01","week":34}

I'm 17 years old and with nice capital I'm in a good position  to get started at an early age with money that other teenagers wouldn't have. I pretty much have a golden oppurtunity and I don't want to waste it.\n\nAnyway, I've been squatting on this money for months as I debate what to do with it. I looked into guaranteed government investments however I would have to put the money away for about 4.5 years to get any 'decent' return and even then it's only about 4%, nothing in comparison to what can be achieved through other investments. The biggest trouble I've had is thinking about investing in various stocks because I see long term potential (AMZN, GOOGL), just to watch them grow before I've invested.\n\nMy question is, should I just bite the bullet now and go for it because of the rule that 'time in the market is more important than timing in the market'? I suppose we would never invest if we keep looking at what we could have made.\n\nOr maybe I'm going in blind and I should educate myself more on investing before going anywhere with this money? What do you think my best course of action is?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","name":"t3_3hfoyn","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-18 13:49:20","week":34}

More are moving to cities, driving less and relying on services like Uber or Lyft. Hell, even going on vacation my friends are more likely to use airbnb over getting a hotel. \n\nThe rise of a sharing economy is the result of millenials becoming adults without the money to spend. I firmly believe companies that are gearing toward a shared economy will benefit in the next 5-10 years.\n\n\n2) Once established in their careers, most millenials will want to settle down. But less and less are buying homes. In fact, more millenials are willing to [spend money on a car, and rent their home]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/01/20/10-new-findings-about-the-millennial-consumer/) and millenials are willing to [spend 50% more on car tech than baby boomers]( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-22/millennials-willing-to-outspend-boomers-by-50-on-car-tech)\n\nCompanies like Ford see a shift in business model, from a piece in the Wall Street Journal, Bill Ford said “forward-looking companies will redefine themselves and move from just being car and truck manufacturers to become personal-mobility companies.” They're investing in a total ecosystem of interconnectivity.\n\nI'm also planning to look into firms that supply cities with public transportation. Bus manufacturing for example, or a company like Wabtech for expanded rail use.\n\n3) Millenials want to spend their money on [brands that are socially responsible]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/01/20/10-new-findings-about-the-millennial-consumer/). From the same article it mentions they're immune to advertising. They cling to brands that do good. Two firms come to mind: 1) SBUX, has given employees countless benefits from stock options to college education. They also seem to be a great indicator of gentrification (the neighborhoods most millenials are moving into). 2) Costco - breaking your teeth in a shitty economy means you want your money to stretch and if I'm going to belong to a discount box chain, I'm not going to sams club. \n\n4) This ~~segways~~ segues (props to MBGLK) into another area of millenials spending habits. They want to shop around for the best price and are more likely to utilize online retailers. Amazon is an obvious benefactor but I'm also paying close attention to Wayfair. If millenials are saving money by not buying a home, I expect them to indulge in making their apartments nice. \n\nWhere do you see millenials spending money? What publicly traded firms do you think will benefit the most from the millenials economy?\n\nEdit: My intent for this post wasn't an investment thesis but a conversation starter. I'm sick of this sub being posts about how do I vanguard and what should I do about this. My hope was people would contribute with their own insights instead of nitpicking mine. To those that contributed to the conversation and expanded it with your ideas, thank you! \n\nI'm not an expert in this area, just curious and was excited to have new jumping off points on things to research. I hope I might have done the same for others.","name":"t3_3hfvqs","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-18 14:53:21","week":34}

{"id":"3hh37l","author":"jm1982","body":"I just saw this email from Amazon regarding selling toys during holidays. I know there might be some people that didn't get this email. I know a lot of people are planning to sell toys during Xmas/4th Quarter. \nIt seems a bit crazy that Amazon has so many rules, kind of annoying..but I guess since they are such a huge platform they can do whatever they want. \nI can see how on one hand though some sellers probably like these rules as it creates more of a 'barrier to entry' and gives sellers an advantage when not everyone can sell and compete to sell an item like they can on eBAY. \nFor people that have been selling on Amazon for a long time are these new rules? I have had my Amazon selling account for years..but it's just been to sell the occassional book or something until now..where I'm looking to ramp things up. \n\n___\nHello from Amazon Services,\n\nAs a reminder, to maintain a great customer experience this holiday season, we have established holiday selling guidelines for the Toys &amp; Games store.\n\nOnly sellers who meet the criteria listed below will be eligible to sell in the Toys &amp; Games category from November 17, 2015 through January 5th, 2016.\n\n•       Your first sale on Amazon.com must occur prior to September 18, 2015. The sale does not need to be specific to the Toys &amp; Games store.\n•       You must process and ship at least 25 orders from September 1 through October 31, 2015. The orders do not need to be specific to the Toys &amp; Games store.\n•       Your pre-fulfillment cancel rate for the period from October 1 through October 31, 2015 must be no greater than 1.75%.\n•       Your late shipment rate for the period from October 1 through October 31, 2015 must be no greater than 4%.\n•       Your order defect rate must be no greater than 1% short term as of November 1, 2015.\n\nOrders that use Fulfillment by Amazon will not be subject to the above criteria provided your account is in good standing.\n\nYou can find your cancel rate, late shipment rate, and order defect rate in the Performance section of your seller account. If your account does not meet the above criteria, we encourage you to take corrective action now to help ensure your eligibility to sell in the Toys &amp; Games category this holiday season.\n\nEligibility for selling in the Toys &amp; Games store is determined separately for each country. If you sell in multiple marketplaces, your accounts will be evaluated for each country.\n\nWe will provide final notification about your eligibility to sell in the Toys &amp; Games store by November 11, 2015. Beginning November 17, 2015, we will monitor the performance and listings of sellers who are approved to sell in Toys &amp; Games during the holiday season.\n\nAmazon Services reserves the right to cancel listings, remove selling privileges, and prohibit the sale of specific products to maintain a great customer shopping experience.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to remain eligible to sell in Toys &amp; Games throughout the holiday season:\n\n•       Monitor performance metrics and take corrective action when necessary.\n•       Utilize Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to ship products to customers.\n•       Check your orders frequently in the Manage Orders section of your account.\n•       Minimize order cancellations; only show inventory for sale that you have available to ship.\n•       Ship orders and confirm shipment in a timely manner.\n•       Ensure your seller policies are up to date.\n•       If you work with outside drop-shippers, solidify their SLA commitments for providing prompt shipping confirmation.\n\nThank you for selling on Amazon.\n\nRegards,\nAmazon Services","name":"t3_3hh37l","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-18 19:59:32","week":34}

{"id":"3hhebx","author":"Jipptomilly","body":"I have a lucrative job, and until recently I've been paying all of my SO's expenses as well as mine. She has about 35k in student loan debt. At that point I was saving about $800 per month. Recently she has received a job offer from the same place, and now I'm suddenly finding myself with far more savings than I had anticipated (anywhere from $2800 to $3500 per month). We have a joint checking account where we put all of our food/rent/bills money - and  I have a personal savings account for Amazon purchases and then my savings account for the leftovers.\n\nMy savings account is currently netting me about 1.5% APR which is far below inflation rates, so I'm losing money. I'm already contributing 6% of my salary to a 401k, and I have a Roth IRA from an old job with over 10k left in it which, as I understand it, I can take out for my first house.\n\nCurrently we are paying a total of about $1400-1500 in monthly rent including bills. From my understanding, housing prices in my area are pretty much consistent with the rest of the country.\n\nI currently have about $12,000 in savings. Including bonuses and raises, that number would be about $200,000 in five years if I don't do anything with my money and just continue to pay rent.\n\nFirstly, I'm wondering if/when I should buy a house. As I understand it, any down payment on a house makes a huge difference - so I'm wondering if I should save up to a point, and then buy a house with a ten or fifteen year mortgage. Currently I have no plans on leaving, but for all I know we may need to move in five or ten years. Would it still be financially sound to buy a house if only to sell it in a few years with 2/3rds of the mortgage left?\n\nSecondly, if I don't buy a house, or even if I do but wanted to save up first - should I be doing something else with my money other than leaving it in a savings account netting 1.5% APR? Is there an intelligent and simple way to invest without putting my money somewhere where it's stuck until I'm 65?\n\nFor the record, I realize investments are risky, but risk isn't a big deal at this point. If the 'expected' rate of return is greater than what I'm getting back then it would still be worth it to me.","name":"t3_3hhebx","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-18 21:09:39","week":34}

{"id":"3hjal6","author":"BPBryan","body":"I've been selling items on Amazon for the past 3 months and I'm at a point where I need help in evaluating my business decisions and whether to keep working hard in expanding. My business is taking items from Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Academy.com and other retailers and listing their products on Amazon. I find other sellers who are selling their products and list them at a more competitive price or allow my good selling metrics to out rank the other sellers. \n\nOverall it has been a good experience but has had some negative aspects with taking up much of my off work hours to run the business and hurting my credit score. My profits the past 3 months have been: $7, $1028, $3,240. My credit took a hit because I've been maxing out my card to make sales. I pay the card off with no interest but think it may hurt in the long run of making larger purchases.\n\nI'm registered as a Sole Proprietor. An LLC license will cost $500 per year in my state (MA). I don't have any inventory to handle so no personal liability and business loans are needed, which is why the Sole Proprietor route works best for taxes. \n\nI think this business is a good start to eventually get more cash in hand to invest in another business or increase my paltry savings and retirement from my day job. But I'm unsure how to approach longer term thinking about it.\n\nMy goal first starting out was to make a full time income $5-6K/mo but don't think this is a great way to make a living. I've been hiring freelancers to manage the business and now think it could be a good passive income in 3-6/mo where I have time to train them and put in less work on a day to day basis. \n\nWondering what others think about this business...\n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3hjal6","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-08-19 05:08:37","week":34}

{"id":"3hk24u","author":"AgentGringo","body":"Hey everyone, so I have run into some problems with my life and I am now in my “start of the career worrying problems”. I find myself always worrying about money ever since I graduated college and left home and moved across the state a year ago. \n\nA little background first (I will make things as simplistic as possible). Currently a 24yo Male. Good job with a little over a year in. Four year BA in Criminal Justice. Lived in New York all my life. Moved to Arizona day after graduation for job. No family or real “friends” out here other than co-workers. \n\nLeft college with 28K in student loans (federal). After college I found out my mother opened up a credit card in her name and my name to “build me credit” and never told me. Ended up being 3k in debt on a 5k limit (Chase Freedom). I had my own credit card from an electronic purchase when I started college and didn’t use it wisely after that. I still have about 2k on that with a 3k limit (Barclaycard US). Left college with about 5k in savings and 2k in checking. It was just enough to start a life in Arizona with rent, start up utilities and deposits. When I left college I had a credit score (Credit Karma) of 700. My monthly rent is $600. Utilities (Cable, Water, Electric, Gas, Internet) is about ~$300. I purchased a vehicle (new, I know – big mistake) in September of 2014 for 24k. Because I was not in a job for a full year, my father needed to cosign with me. My interest is 3.75%. I pay $330 a month ($30 is due to a stupid fee incase the cosigner – my father – dies then the loan is forgiven). \n\nNow we are in present time. My credit score has went far down to 660 (but a recent fico report read 620?) and some credit cards have went up. Chase – 4k/5k. Barclaycard - 2.5K/3K. Vehicle Loan – 20K. And a new Amazon card $800/3.5K. My current money situation is around 4k in savings, 1k in checking, and some cash stored away. I make about $1,600 every two weeks (some pay periods about 2k). Now, I tried going from my small town Credit Union to a new Credit Union – PenFed. They have great rates that can beat what I have now if I refinance my vehicle through them. So I started the process. Opened up a checking account and savings account. But it told me I have been declined any credit through them (I could be wrong but if anyone wants to help me more please help – just got the info today – I am very new at this stuff). So now I am kind of in a rough spot. I want to trade in my vehicle because I am young, and what young stud does not want a muscle car. I took my vehicle to the dealership and can only get 15k out of it. Also, I noticed on my credit report something that was sent to collections from a hospital visit (went to them last week and they said they never had correct info from me and would take 30 days to get rid of it from the report and they are “sorry”). \n\nSo that is about it, I worry about money every day and I know I shouldn’t do that. It causes a lot of stress. Its hard for me to make this change because my parents always try to give me money but I never took anything from them nor will I – It just does not feel right to me. I like to go out a lot and have been cutting back on that stuff, but I am still adjusting. \n\nWhat is the best way for me to: \n1. Get these credit cards down \n2. Get my credit score up \n3. Trade my vehicle (I know it may not be smart but this is a goal) \n4. Be financially stable (I do not think I am right now)\n\nIf people actually care to help me (which would be awesome!) then I can go into more detail if needed. I will also answer any questions you may have to help me get my life together!

{"id":"3hmuqj","author":"Arggghhhhhhh","body":"Around 2 years ago I decided to *go for it* and pursue something I wanted to pursue. I am too nervous to tell you the URL but it's like a niche self-help resource. My goal is to help people realize they aren't alone with some of the issues they deal with, and the response has been great.\n\nIt took me a long time, but I wrote a book. I started a podcast with the goal of promoting the book. Everything went fine with both efforts, but I'm hardly making any money. The book makes around $300/mo. I make maybe $30-50/mo from Amazon affiliate sales. Annnnd that's about it. Obviously not enough to live on.\n\nBasically, I'm putting in all this effort--which is well-received and helps people--but I'm not making enough money to keep doing it.\n\nI don't think I have the right personality(?) for making money as a solopreneur. I doubt everything I do, am depressed, and have low confidence (even though most the things I attempt end up being pretty good.) Because of this, I am afraid of everything. Some of you might be thinking, \"stop being such a wimp\" or \"suck it up\" but I just don't have that personality. We don't all have every trait we need. Sometimes I wish I had a business partner who was good at these things, but I can't afford to hire anyone.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I've got going on.\n\n* Podcast: 150 five-star ratings. Average 4k downloads per episode per month\n\n* Blog. Dozens of blog posts, 290,000 visits so far this year (avg 1,200/day), good engagement (comments on posts)\n\n* Book: In a few months, it has nearly 70 Amazon reviews, overall 4.5 rating. This might not sound like much, but it's not too bad for a first-time self-published book from a nobody.\n\n* Email list. 2,100 people emailed twice monthly, and growing.\n\n* Social media: the usual--FB, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest accounts but not impressive\n\n* Feedback: You might find this hard to believe, but I get emails and comments all the time from people telling me that the podcast or blog changed their life. They learned something about themselves that changed how they view themselves. Powerful.\n\nI tried raising money per podcast episode on Patreon but it's a pittance. I was going to write another book but the amount of time it takes is daunting, and it likely won't make much money anyway. Membership site? no way. Ads on my blog?? I thought about making an online \"course\" but I don't feel like people would sign up. Does anyone have any advice? What would you do?\n\nI feel like a failure and like I've wasted so much time. Why can't I figure this out? Other people can. I poured my heart into this and I'm at the point where I might have to give up this great resource that actually helps people....because I'm too afraid to make money. Obviously, I'm not in a very happy place right now.  \n\nAny advice? Please don't be *harshly* critical, I can do that to myself :)\n\n**TL;DR: How would you monetize a sort-of successful blog, podcast, book, and mailing list about a self-help topic?**","name":"t3_3hmuqj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-19 23:02:39","week":34}

{"id":"3hpjmz","author":"importdojo","body":"Hey guys,\n\nBack with another post on recent developments in regards to Fulfillment by Amazon &amp; importing from China. \nI've previously posted on similar topics [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/38i1yq/alibaba_hacks_the_most_efficient_way_to_find/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/). \n\nSo I am pretty sure everyone read the news that Amazon is helping Chinese factories to get their brands listed on Amazon. It’s actually old news as the Amazon team has been on the grounds in China for a few years now.\n\nEveryone is worried now which is understandable. One thing they definitely have advantage in is the price, but let me explain why that doesn’t matter.\n\nLet me take off some of your worries right now and explain why this will not impact your Amazon business in a short time period and how you can prepare to be ahead of the Chinese sellers.\n\n**Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ’s)**\nMost factories have high MOQ’s and thats often because they need to purchase a certain amount of raw material from their sub-supplier. To do so they need orders. Bringing me to the next and most important topic, taking risks.\n\n**Taking Risks**\nMany factories won’t take the risk of producing for their own stock and try to sell it trough some sort of sales-channel. They do in some cases, but these items are mostly found on Chinese websites and Aliexpress or DHGate.com\nWhen they sell on these sites, the packaging you get is probably in Chinese, as is the instruction manual.\nA factory does not produce on their own risk and try to sell it somewhere. They always need a customer behind an order. Be it a large retailer, a small time buyer from the Philippines or the occasional Amazon buyer.\nThey don’t have stock of the necessary raw material or packaging because the longer they store it, it will get smudged, dirty and might not be possible to sell it anymore. I know this because I have been to 100’s of factories in my time in China here.\nWhen you go to a factory you won’t find their own packaging or raw material on stock. They ALWAYS purchase the material once they have an order incoming.\n\nIt’s just not economical for the factory to purchase raw material on their own behalf. Margins are so low these days, they need to maintain cash flow for their customers. Sometimes they have some stock but that’s probably from a over-production or from a client who didn’t take the entire quantity. Sure some factories have good cash flow, design &amp; marketing departments and they will sell on Amazon. Those are the ones that you can see now already. But they do not posses the knowledge on how to SUCCESSFULLY sell on Amazon (yet). I don’t know anyone in China who has taken a course on Amazon selling or listening to podcasts on how to be successful on Amazon. And most factories in China just won’t take the risk of investing money into their own product to sell it online overseas.\n\nIt is not within the Chinese culture that you take a risk for something that you don’t know is going to pay off. Chinese won’t create a listing on AMZ without knowing that their product will sell.\nThey always go after the sure thing (there are exceptions of course).\n\n**Quality standards**\nWhen a factory develops a new item and they get their first order for it it is likely a “naked” item with no standard whatsoever. The factory needs to rely on each customer’s input on what the customers needs in terms of quality.\nA small importer in Thailand has completely different quality requirements than a large German retailer. The importer in Thailand may require nothing, while the retailer in Germany has all sorts of requirements that involves large investments on the suppliers side. Who do you think the supplier will rather want to work with? Exactly, the Thai importer. Because his quality requirements are low and not much effort is needed to sell the product. So many factories do not have the necessary quality standard on new products. Amazon is heavily investigating into products that do not meet current American quality standards and if your product does not comply it gets removed. There are of course established factories who have meet all necessary quality standards but they are likely comfortable selling to their existing customers.\n\n**Certification &amp; Requirements**\nI often hear from suppliers when I ask for a certification of a certain product: “you don’t need that, other customers don’t ask and we don’t have it”.\nWell excuse me but I will decide what my market and selling channel needs in terms of quality &amp; certification. Amazon is cracking down on many sellers who don’t have proper certification for their product or in most cases they won’t even allow sellers to list products without certain certifications or test reports. After all Amazon cannot afford to be sued by a customer who for example bought a plastic product that comes in touch with the skin and now the clients has a rash because the plastic is made out of waste material and has high toxins and chemicals in it.\n\n**Innovative and trendy**\nI have yet to walk into a showroom of a factory and see something new apart from the occasional exception at an established factory with retailers or customers in the West. That is after living and working here for over 10 years. There are of course suppliers that develop their own products but in many cases they miss the product to market fit. They always rely on the input of a customer on how a design of a product or the functionality has to be. I read a report a few weeks ago that quoted Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina:\n\n*“I have been doing business in China for decades, and I will tell you that yeah, the Chinese can take a test, but what they can’t do is innovate,” she said. “They are not terribly imaginative. They’re not entrepreneurial, they don’t innovate, that is why they are stealing our intellectual property.”She added teaching innovation, risk-taking, and imagination “are things that are distinctly American and we can’t lose them.”*\n\nThe quote caused some outrage around China but the majority of Chinese people actually agreed with Carly Florina and posted on Chinese forums like Weibo (largest forum in China). Saying they need to be more innovative and take more risks sometimes. They weren’t offended and I think she didn’t want to offend them, but she did point out the weakness where they have to improve. And that cements my earlier statement **“taking risks”** is simply not in their nature.\n\n**Customer Service**\nI doubt that Chinese sellers can manage the customer service from China. They would need to hire perfect English speakers and dispatch them completely to their Amazon business.\nI can tell you that if I ask my suppliers to do so they will probably ignore me. It is considered an investment “not worth it”. At least as of today.\n\n**Marketing Strategies**\nIt is very unlikely that a factory knows much about launching and promoting a product trough blogs, landing pages, Facebook promotions (Facebook is banned in China), review groups and so on that many of you have paid good $ amounts to learn.\nBut these are the channels that a new product needs when it launches or when it needs to grow. Otherwise your product just drowns amongst the competition and never lifts off to be in the top sellers.\n\n**Price Point**\nYes, they do have advantage over the price. But that is not the key issue when you sell on Amazon. When a supplier quotes you a price of 5$ his own profit will probably be less than a $. And that doesn’t really give him an edge, because YOU (the experienced AMZ seller) has years of experience, PPC knowledge, Facebook followers, mailing lists, existing products with reviews &amp; social proof etc. that the customer is willing to pay for when making a buying decision.\n\n**Legal Issues &amp; Company Setup**\nIt is not very easy to set up a company in the States for a Chinese company. To be really successful on Amazon you need a private label, have a trademark registered and a company set up.\nNot many sellers from overseas will go trough this process.\n\n**Facebook pages**\nFacebook is banned in China. Sure they can get a VPN connection and go on Facebook but who are they going to promote to?\nBuild a Facebook audience with zero friends and followers? That is going to take a long time. Are they going to post on Facebook groups like The Amazing Seller or ImportDojo to post their products?\nNo. The last time a Chinese seller promoted his product in my group I banned him. Not because his product wasn’t interesting or I don’t allow it but the way he did was pure spamming. Joined the group, no interaction at all, no feedback to other group members, simply wanting to promote his product to the group members without providing any real value to the group. So you can take one of the most important promotional tools for your new product (Facebook) already out of the equation.\n\n**Branding &amp; Packaging**\nWhen I set up [my own company](http://mandarin-gear.com) in late 2013 I had one goal. Affordable products at a great quality with excellent packaging.\nWhat Chinese lack at this moment is an eye for design and western preferences when it comes to packaging. They also do not have properly translated instruction manuals on their own.\nSometimes they use their customers proof-read instruction manual when they sell to other customers but for new items they don’t have anything. Imagine what Amazon customers think when they open the box and can’t understand half of what’s written in there? How do you think that will affect the review? That’s why, whenever you buy a product in China always try to have a proper instruction manual. [Check out my other post on this:](http://importdojo.com/private-labels-packaging-differences/)\n\n**English language barrier**\nHave you ever been on a Chinese website with English version? Yes? So you have seen the horrible grammar mistakes. This won’t change when Chinese sellers list on Amazon. Yes, they can now list their products trough a Chinese Seller Central account and it’s all in Chinese but that doesn’t change the fact that you need proper keywords and wording with excellent grammar when you want to list &amp; sell your product successfully.\n\nSuppliers simply wont be investing their money into proper English translation because they don’t believe in going the extra mile without knowing they will make a profit; so their listings will look horrible.\nWould you buy a product when you don’t understand half of the text or description?\n\n**But they already sell successfully on Ebay and provide free shipping?**\nYes, the Chinese sellers have taken on Ebay a few years ago and some are very successful. But only successful in terms of their sales and because the Chinese Government heavily subsizdes freight costs from China (China Mail).\nI would say 20-30% of the items sold on Ebay from Chinese sellers are returned or the customers are unhappy with their purchase because of the quality of the product.\n\nYou can’t refund the item to the seller, you won’t send the item back to China, will you?\nAnd even if you can, are you going to leave a positive review?\nAmazon doesn’t work like that and everyone has to pay the local shpping costs in the US. So while the Chinese seller can send in his product at a cheap rate he still has to pay the local freight costs. And what stops you from getting good shipping rates from China? Most suppliers will offer you the same rates they get when sending goods overseas.\nAlso you can’t just list everything you want (there are restricted categories and legal compliances to be met) and whenever there are returns the clients will leave a negative review.\n\nAmazon won’t hesitate to ban the sellers account immediately if the return rates are as high as 20-30%. Amazon has a strict policy when it comes to customers satisfaction and the way I see it not many Chinese factories can comply with their “basic” product on Amazon without having input from overseas buyers on how to improve the product.\n\nNow having said all that, there are suppliers out there who already sell on Amazon and there will very likely be more in the near future who are capable of all the above especially with the help that Amazon is doing in China now.\n\nBut those are are only a few and “we” all have a headstart, the understanding of the marketing, promotional strategy and how the Amazon machine works best.\n\nEventually Chinese factories will figure all these things out but I am giving this at least 5 years. Essentially what is happening now (or has been happening in the last 2 years) is that a retail giant (Amazon) is trying to teach an entire army of manufacturers why they should sell on Amazon. This is a tremendous project and will take some time. In 5 years, survival of the fittest will have set in so now is the time to step up your game and be among those survivors. One of the most important tasks ahead of you now is to master the import trade so you can compete not only in marketing &amp; sales on Amazon but also price wise.\n\n**So here are some important steps for you to remember:**\n\n* Improve your product quality based on reviews\n* Pay a little more for better quality and regulations-compliant products\n* Develop your own products and packagings and make them exclusive for you on Amazon\n* Build or grow your brand with cross product selling and larger assortments\n* Build or grow your audience (Facebook, mailing lists etc.) and be ahead of the Chinese competition\n* Build relationships with suppliers for the long term and become one of their largest customers so that they don’t have to sell on Amazon themselves\n\n**And most importantly: Learn the import/export trade from the inside out**\n\nWhat else can you do? Step up your import knowledge and learn the entire import/export business from the inside out so that you not only have advantage over the Amazon marketing &amp; sales process but also know as much about importing/exporting as the Chinese do.\n\nHappy sourcing :)","name":"t3_3hpjmz","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-08-20 14:04:23","week":34}

{"id":"3hucd5","author":"Aehs01","body":"So I'm really on the fence right now about becoming more \"self employed\" and working on freelance projects for a living vs. going back to a 9-5 job. \n\nI'll try to make a long story shorter so you guys can throw your advice my way.\n\nMy school background has been in IT, I learned it in HS and then got an associates in college, eventually landing a software support role through a guy I graduated college with. By about the 4th-5th year of making the same salary (around 42k a year) I started to get really interested in marketing online to get out. \n\nI got involved in internet marketing over 5 years ago, mostly trying all kinds of different things in my free time. I've failed in many areas, had small successes and even formed some partnerships which in most cases eventually collapsed.\n\nI got to a point with my blogging and marketing stuff I was making it a priority over my job. I ran a podcast for 2 years where I interviewed successful marketers. I'd leave work to go do interview people like Andrew Warner from Mixergy, I'd stay up till 10-11pm to Interview guys like Pat Flynn or wake up at 5:30am to interview someone in Australia like Ramsay Taplin. I met a lot of cool successful people but never found a good way to monetize it so I stopped. \n\nMy biggest success was an SEO link building service which I formed from scratch with another successful entrepreneur whom I interviewed, we pulled in over 20k of sales in 3 months. I had my first $1000 dollar day, I got to taste what it was like to make money while I was sleeping! Not by my choice the partner decided to take full ownership of the business.\n\nIt was around this time I was starting to really slack more at my job, I'd be building landing pages, blogging, learning new skills and creating courses all the while I was doing a night shift at my job 11-8. From 5-8 everyone went home so I'd use these 3 hours to work on my own business stuff.\n\nI ended up leaving that job and getting a job working for a company doing eCommerce, I eventually left about a year later for another role as a manager in eCommerce. The problem was I was still building someone else's brand, mind you both of these companies made some really bad decisions which made me want to leave and go out on my own even more. The last company custom built a CRM from the ground up which was basically the worst thing ever, they refused to dump it. \n\nIt got so bad at my last job, no one was paying much attention to what I was working on I'd simply work remotely for 3-4 hours a day at home on my own stuff, go into the office for a few hours and maybe work 5 minutes a day on there stuff. I hated building someone else's business so I spent a TON of time trying to build up work for myself. \n\nI managed to start up a web design and SEO business which has mostly landed me \"one time\" type work. I've earned about 10k since November doing it part time. I had one client even paying me $1k a month for SEO which was pretty exciting. \n\nI got laid off last month on the 17th of July, I'm pretty sure they eventually caught on to me so here is what I've been doing to bring in income:\n-Udemy courses I've built over the last 2 years~ bring in a regular $250-400+ each month without any marketing\n-Selling gigs on Fiverr earns me $50~ a month - I did also do a custom $100 project this month\n-I run a monthly podcast on a popular CPA marketing forum which I get $75 a month for.\n-Some affiliate marketing sales from blogs or youtube videos each month $50-100 usually random\n\nBigger one time things I've done since last month, having full days to work on this stuff:\n-Found a very \"part time\" role managing large businesses SEO on behalf of another company - Maybe 40 hours a month of work. I don't mind this as they are paying me 25/hr and it's only 1-2 hours each day, good experience and all remote work (no traffic in the morning!)\n-Built 2 websites for new clients $400~ each\n-Acquired a $1000 website contract for building an eCommerce store\n-Sold a business on a $50/month seo package (I made 20% commission on this so it's only $10/m for me)\n-Started working with one of the top freelancers on all of UpWork, he has given me about $250~ worth of jobs I've completed. He seems to be consistently able to get more work he will be handing me as well. \n-Moved some of my courses into other course platforms, proving to start showing new profit around $150~ a month from them\n-Met with 1 company about helping them a few hours a week with Amazon FBA, almost more of a consulting job\n-Speaking with a 2nd company about doing the exact same type of thing with Amazon FBA\n-Started working with the original SEO partner again to help with some small jobs - article writing and a landing page $200~\n\nI suspect if I keep this pace I could easily keep doing this and easily get by, I suppose just the uncertainty of not knowing I'll be receiving a set paycheck every 2 weeks scares me. I really only need to earn about $1500-1600 to sustain bills, mortgage etc. Girlfriend also works and brings in decent income. \n\nAnyone been there done this? What was your experience? \n\nTL;DR - I'm making lots of money from small jobs since getting laid off, should I just go freelance full time or get another job?

{"id":"3hvjeq","author":"[deleted]","body":"There are some good people on here.  There are some knowledgeable and helpful people on here.  You may find them.  Unfortunately there are some miserable and immature jerks on here too.  You may be lucky enough to avoid them.  You may be unlucky and unwittingly make yourself a target.  That was me.  I had fun with Reddit for the last couple of years - but this last run-in made it clear to me that I need to spend way less time on Reddit and way more time connecting with the real people in my life.  I have a serious job and a family and I've been very successful by almost any standard - and I did most of it without Reddit.  It has been a winning formula for me and although I've had some interesting and insightful conversations here, the anonymity it provides is abused too often for my liking.  So with that in mind I'm writing this more as personal therapy than anything else.  By and large, Reddit has become a time-waster for me and I need to leave it behind for good.  If you can use it in moderation great.  I couldn't.\nSo with that I'm leaving the best investment and career advice I have.  Lessons learned from r/investing, from actual investing, and from life.  If it helps you, great!  To the straw that broke the camel's back:  I hope you get the help you need.  I don't know what kind of help that is - but I suspect it is not on the internet.\n\nThe best advice I can give to you is to be humble.  Learn to be comfortable with the fact that you do not know everything.  You can be a valuable and treasured friend, adviser, coworker, manager, or employee so long as people trust that you understand the boundary between what you know and what you don't know.  The moment people in your life suspect that you may not know what you're talking about, they will cast doubt on everything you say.  The best indicator of someone who can be trusted is someone who will fearlessly say, \"I don't know the answer\" or \"I don't understand that completely.\"  That may not get you hired at Amazon.com - but it will make you a great part of any team, and it will keep you employed, and it will earn you respect.  Take the same approach with your investing.  Investing is not you vs. the market.  It is you vs. yourself.  Be fearless in accepting what you understand and what you don't understand.  If you want to try a new strategy or a new position in your portfolio, try it on a small scale and learn from watching what happens to it - and what you will learn is probably more about your personal appetite for risk than anything else.  In investing, just like in life, experience is the best teacher.\nI was on here because I wanted to learn, and I wanted to help.  After 21 years in the industry, I thought it would be fun, I thought I would make some connections.  But it really didn't do that - and I regret the time I spent on here because it took me away from my family and my job.  So for the 161,794 people on here that mean well, good luck to you.  I'm going to assume for selfish reasons that the above will help just 8 of you or so.  I'll feel good about that.  Upvote it.  Downvote it.  Do whatever Reddit does.  Enforce whatever cultural rules and etiquette seem appropriate to you.  Create and curate your sub.  But remember this - almost all the meaningful experiences you will have in life - in family, friends, business, or whatever...  Almost all those moments will be shared with people that know you by your first and last name.  Good bye.","name":"t3_3hvjeq","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-21 20:00:35","week":34}

{"id":"3hvthq","author":"AgentMull","body":"I'm wanting to consolidate all of my debt into once place and save a little money on interest while I'm at it. I'm qualified for a 7.5% 36mo, or 10.6% 60mo. There are also a small number of things I need to have done to my house that I am thinking about using a small part of the loan for, if thats even \"allowed\". I'll get into that later.\n  \nDeets: \nIncome: $60k pre-tax.I have $10,500 on a 13.3%, $3,300 on a 15.4%, and $3,100 on a 0% until 03/16. The first $2k of the debt was left over from college and I was paying it down with no problem. Then another $2k was \"new house\" purchases, which I think were reasonable at the time and I intended to pay them off quickly. Then I had a string of car-based repair emergencies before I had established an emergency fund, which have totaled up to about $5k. Then a lot of the debt was \"cash advances\" for the overdraft protection to my debit card account because I haven't been doing a good job of managing and scheduling payments to avoid overdrafting. I was constantly coming up short in my checking account by only a hundred dollars or so, and that's added up on the credit card.  \n  \nI've started trying to take more control of my finances, not spend so much on Amazon, and do a better job at budgeting. For instance Mint says I've been spending $800/mo on food (though that does have a lot of non-food purchases mixed in like paper towels and cleaning supplies at costco). I figure I can get it down to about $400/mo with little problem and stop the overdrafting. I also have a loan on my car that should be finishing in less than 2 years, so that will free up some cash. \n\nI also have a couple of things that really need to be done to the house that would be nice to pay with the loan. I need a chimney liner installed for my wood stove (the current one only goes 10' up the chimney and can eventually cause problems, like a fire). An old tree in my front yard has huge knotty holes in it, and I need to get someone to look at it and tell me if its going to be a danger to my house, and possibly deal with the tree if it is. And finally my refrigerator is starting to make noises consistent with a failing compressor, so I may be needing a new fridge soon. \n\nAfter reading through old posts I think a loan like this is right for me. I'd only pay off the two cards with interest. I was pretty close to pulling the trigger, but I can't decide on a 36mo or 60mo, or what exactly the amount should be. How do I weigh the differences in total interest paid? Can anyone give me any insight or thoughts?  \n  \nEdit: My LC account seems to have be \"locked in\" to a $16k 60mo loan, as it won't let me go back to the \"chose your loan\" page. \n  \n","name":"t3_3hvthq","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-21 21:10:26","week":34}

{"id":"3hw1yy","author":"Kipernicus18","body":"This is my open letter to the retail world.\n \nI see you failing, I see you’ve failed. Big box stores closing doors, mom and pop shops the same. Clothing stores I used to frequent closed and gone, malls where I’d spend my time and money dwindling. There’s now a for lease sign in the store window. Has been for months. I hear that spending is down, people don’t have as much money to spend as they used to. As a mid 30’s man I’ve always had some “extra” cash to spend. That’s why I was in your store! But you didn’t see that in me, instead your employees were quick to judge, quick to gauge, and very slow in providing any real service. Was it a privilege to shop at your store? Did my hundreds of dollars in cash not qualify at your store? Why was my money no good to you? You even hired security guards to further perpetuate your ignorant mindset. I walk into all of your stores and see the same discrimination. Walkers following me, security guards following me, staff following me with the lowest of intentions. Even when I’m with my 7 month old son! (the final straw). I sell cars. I KNOW the importance of first impression, first contact. It’s how I make my money. It’s why I’m writing this letter. I remember being a 13 year old and getting this treatment in the biggest of big stores and 20 years later and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars spent at your stores and you treat me the same. Oh you’re closing??? Oh no one is shopping with you anymore??? Oh you’re out of work??? Hmmm. Makes sense doesn't it? No one judges me when I shop on Amazon. No one gives me attitude. Now for the remaining retail outlets that I do still support, I support because I WANT to. I spend the extra $$$ knowing I’m supporting a business that cares. Cares about me, about the staff, about the product. I will support the business that fights for my business, who wants me to spend there and who is respectful. Again… Why didn't you want my money? How pompous? You pepper me with e-mails about sales and discounts on a daily basis, you display sales signs, pump music, and do everything in your power to get me into your store… And then treat me like a second class citizen when I arrive. Well the jokes on you. I can never forgive you for your inability to serve the common man some of his most basic needs. The lack of training your employees to be empathetic, compassionate, and engaging has turned me to on-line shopping(something I’ve been against because I support local). But I cannot support your ignorance. You’ve lost touch with the modern man/woman and we’ve lost touch with you. Good luck in your bankruptcy, good luck with your lay offs, and for those of you on the front lines who judged me with your retail superiority, good luck with the job search, it was you who turned my money away!\n \n$o $o $incerely,\n \nA man who $pend$\n​\n \n \nP.s. Thank you Amazon!!! I used to enjoy coming home with bags of new stuff from the mall, but getting my stuff delivered to my house has taken the negativity out of my shopping experiences and I thank you for that.","name":"t3_3hw1yy","subreddit":"economy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhpn","created_utc":"2015-08-21 22:10:15","week":34}

{"id":"3hwdl9","author":"Night_Changes","body":"First of all, this isn't an app that you will spend much time on, or make a ton of money each day. This is best to add to your existing Beermoney arsenal, because there are a limited amount of ads to watch per day. Hopefully more users will lead to a more steady stream of advertisers. There seem to be an average of 30 videos per day worth watching (5 points or more). A week or two ago this was much lower.\n\nThe good news is that the app is easy to use, nearly glitch-free (one glitch described below), and has a sweet referral system. The app is basically AppTrailers: you get paid a certain number of points (10 points= 1 cent, most videos are 5 points) to watch short advertisements. You need to click on each video, which is what allows the payout per video to be much higher than Perk, Swagbucks etc. Some videos will end in a simple quiz. Usually the answer is obvious even if you didn't watch the video. Usually it isn't actually to test your comprehension, more to make a point stick in your mind. If you get it wrong, you don't even need to rewatch the video, just choose different answers until you get it right. Quizzes appear less than 10% of the time for me. \n\nLike Swagbucks or Featurepoints, there is a \"pyramid scheme\" referral system. Like Swagbucks and Featurepoints, you don't need referrals to make money on this app. They just help. And if you get them, MiddasApp has a referral system unlike any I've come across before. Basically it works like this:\n\n-Each referral earns you a bonus equal to 10% of their income\n\n-Up to 5 people can use your referral code\n\n-**Each person that used your code can refer 5 more people.**\n\n-**Including the people that you directly referred, your \"community\" can include 5 referral levels**\n\nSo basically, if you are really popular, you will be getting 10% of \nThe 5 people in Level A and \n\nThe 25 people in Level B and\n\nThe 125 people in Level C and \n\nThe 625 people in Level D and \n\nand The 3125 people in Level E\n\nAlso, some valuable (as in 600 points-&gt; 60 cents) videos are locked until you have a certain amount of people in your community. The locked videos I see unlock at 3, 6, and 10 community members. So, even if every person you refer stops using the app, you can not only still get money from anyone they referred (Or further down the chain) but you will also have access to higher paying videos.\n\nThe Glitch: Occasionally, a video will end in a white screen with a gray arrow, and a yellow timer will count down from 10. It will take you to a quiz screen where the question and every answer read \"NULL\". You won't get points for this video. Just click back on the arrow. I have no clue why. I contacted the app and they said \"We are working on it\". \n\nOne glitch some have encountered trying to create an account stated \"You already have two accounts on this device\" or something to that effect. This can be gotten around by signing up through facebook, apparently. This is what I did without a problem.\n\nOther information: Multiple accounts per person are not allowed. (That's what they told me in an email, but no word on how much they care. I don't plan on it, but I'm sure someone will try making half a dozen accounts)\n\nMultiple devices per account **are allowed**. This is convenient for watching videos as fast as possible.\n\nThere is a sweepstakes option **that doesn't rip you off**. As in, a $1, 1000 point giftcards has 20 entries for 50 points each. So if you like to play the odds, they won't penalize you for it. I'm not into that but different strokes for different folks. \n\nOne thing I don't like is high payout to Paypal ($25). Amazon pays out at $1, Best Buy and Starbucks at $5, XBOX and ebay at $15, Steam at $20. \n\nLike Swagbucks, there is an option to donate to charity. \n\nAvailable through iTunes or Google Play. **US Only**\n\nThere's no referral link, only a code. Mine is **BB9XSR**. You'll be asked when you open the app to enter it for a 20 point bonus. \n\n[Apple link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/middas/id996826598?mt=8)\n\n[Android link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.devpenguin.middas)\n\nFinally: You is kind, you is smart, you is important. Don't waste your time on 1-point videos. 1/10 of a cent is not worth clicking on. There are plenty that pay higher so don't give the bastards the satisfaction of basically free advertisement. Good luck! \n\nPlease make a referral train.\n\nEDIT: Clarification regarding number of ads per day.\n\nEDIT2: Clarification on global availability, advice for getting around \"two accounts\" glitch","name":"t3_3hwdl9","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-08-21 23:34:25","week":34}

{"id":"3hx1ch","author":"99problemsCreditIs1","body":"Hi PF,\n\nShort background- I grew up in a very poor family and never really had a financial education. I made a way though, and am doing well for myself just a few years out of college.  I'm working on improving my financial knowledge now.\n\nI recently found out that my credit score is pretty poor, 645.  I figured I might as well get a credit card to improve this, even though I’m not a credit card type of person (If I want something, I just buy it instead of having a credit card middle-man).\n\nI looked at a bunch of different cards, and because of the type of things that I buy and the travel that I do, a Delta AMEX made a great amount of sense.  The free checked bag would pay for the card fees in a month or two for me, so the insurance and bonus miles perks were icing on the cake.  So, I applied for the card, and they said they couldn’t determine whether or not I could be approved.  So, I sent in work/pay information, bank statements, tax records, etc.  A month later, I called them to ask how things are going, as I’m planning a significant vacation and would love to use the card for the trip.\n\nI was declined *immediately* over the phone. It's like they had made the decision when I applied, but were just waiting for me to call and ask what was going on.  The customer service employee was really condescending and practically scoffed at me for attempting to get the card.  I was pretty embarrassed, and yet still a little confused.  I know that 645 is not an awesome credit score, but I also provided additional information showing that I make 130k a year, have 70k in savings, own my 5 year old car outright (paid cash), and have 8 school loans that totaled 35k that I’ve paid in full with no missed payments.  I’ve never made a late payment on any bill ever, and I’ve been renting $1,200-$2,000/mo for the last 5 years without incident.  There are no derogatory marks on my credit report.\n\nAfter the hard credit check from AMEX (for 24 points!), my credit score is limping along at 621, and I’m cautious about what to do next.  I’d like to get a card that’s useful for me, but I know chain-applying for cards can look pretty bad. I know I can get a really basic secure card from my bank, but I’d like one that at least has some useful perks, if possible (Like Amazon, maybe).\n\nAdvice on a good next step?  What's a realistic card for me to get, considering my situation?\n","name":"t3_3hx1ch","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-08-22 02:48:54","week":34}

I'm wanting to stay under $200 if possible. I've been doing some out of the box thinking but wanted other opinions. \n\nSo far I'm thinking about purchasing a few wooden foldout desks from [OfficeDepot](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/369009/Realspace-Folding-Tables-29-H-x/) and simply putting them into the shape of an L or a U. My room is about 17 x 14 but has an odd [shape](http://imgur.com/yHf0M58) to it. I've looked into some of the cheaper L and U shaped desks around but they seem to be cheaply made and according to reviews from sites like OfficeDepot and Amazon they tend to agree. I plan on having my full size computer on it, a 27\" and 24\" monitor but also want the room to have textbooks, notebooks, or whatever else spread out to work. I'm not looking for anything fancy, I'm looking for functionality.\n\nAnyone think my idea so far is a good one? Any input is greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: To clarify the image of my room, the very bottom has a window and to the left is a door that leads out to the patio.","name":"t3_3hxj9f","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-22 05:34:34","week":34}

{"id":"3i1kdl","author":"LumpyLump76","body":"## Different ways to use Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) Points\n\nParts of this series:\n\n- [Different Ways to use American Express MR Points](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3dwl1z/faq_different_ways_to_use_american_express_mr/)\n- [Different ways to use Citibank TYP](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3i4xif/faq_different_ways_to_use_citibank_thankyou/)\n\n\nWhile many folks in this sub spends hours figuring how what card to use where to earn the most points/miles, the more complicated part of this hobby is the redemption of those points.  Almost every day, we see people struggle with trying to use the points they've earned, and getting frustrated in the process; or they redeem the points in a way that others consider sub-optimal.\n\nThis short guide describing some of the ways you can use the Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points.  Chase UR Points can be earned via the Chase Freedom, Sapphire Preferred (CSP), Sapphire, Ink Plus, Ink Bold, and Ink Cash cards.  If you have been reading this sub, or visited various churning related blogs, you have seen people pushing the CSP and the UR points it earns.  Hopefully after reading this post, you get a better idea on whether CSP and UR points are right for your goals.  \n\n**UR Points are worth AT LEAST 1 cent per point!**\n\nLike most convertible points programs, Chase provide you a number of options to use your UR \npoints.  This include shopping with with points at Amazon, trading them for Gift Cards, transfer to partners, and Cash Back.\n\n####**Cash Back** \n\nThe Cash Back option allows you to transfer cash directly to your bank account, or get the Cash Back as a statement credit.  The rate of conversion is 1 cent per point.  To put this in perspective, the Signup Bonus for the CSP is 40,000 points.  Plus the $4000 minimum spend and the 5000 Authorized user bonus, signing up for the CSP and meeting the spend will net you $490 cash back.  This is about the best deal in terms of Cash Back from the sign-up bonus on a credit card.\n\nNote for the Freedom and the Ink Cash cards, even though their UR points are not transferrable to partners without a CSP or a Ink Plus, still has the Cash Back option.\n\n####**Shop with Points**\n\nFrom the Chase UR Portal, you can shop for Gift Cards, or Shop with Points at Amazon.\n\nIf you choose to shop for gift cards, you will find a large assortment of merchants, including  Amazon, iTunes, Nordstrom, Staples, Home Depot, etc.  the conversion rate maintains the 1 cent per point valuation, so a $10 iTunes Gift card will cost 1000 points. \n\nIf you choose to shop at Amazon, it gives you instruction on how to link your Chase account with Amazon, and you pay Amazon at checkout with points.  Again, at 1 cent per point value.  \n\nWhile these redemptions are pretty convenient, I would recommend that you take the Cash Back option, and then buy GCs at Staples or other stores directly, earning more points in the process.\n\n####**Booking Travel Through UR Portal**\n\nThe Chase UR Portal also allows you to book Flights, Hotels, Cars, and even activities using your UR points.  Chase values your UR points at 1.25 cents per point: a $125 car rental would cost you 10000 points.  So the 49000 points you got from applying for the CSP is now worth $612.50 in travel.\n\nThere are advantages using the UR Portal to book travel.  First of all, you are basically booking through an Online Travel Agent.  If you book a flight, it is as if you paid cash for the flight.  You don’t have to worry about award seat availability, and you will earn more miles for the flight.  You can also redeem for things you normally can't redeem for using airline miles, such as Car Rental or a concert.  There are also reports that the UR portal sometimes offer better deals than other sources, especially on Car Rental.\n\nThe disadvantage for using the UR portal is that you are limiting yourself to the valuation of 1.25 cents per point.  So a $300 a night room at the Hyatt will cost you 24,000 points, plus taxes and fees.\n\n####**Transferring to Hotel Partners**\n\nIf you have any of the Premium UR points cards, CSP, Ink Plus, or Ink Bold, you have the option to transfer your UR points to a number of hotel partners at a ratio of 1:1\n\n- Hyatt\n- Marriott\n- Ritz\n- IHG\n\nThis capability adds a lot of flexibility to your UR points, but the only partner that is normally worth considering is the Hyatt; this is due to the lower redemption value on the IHG, Marriott, and Ritz program.  \n\nAs an example, Holiday Inn in Burbank, CA is $175 a night on Aug 22nd, but the award night costs 30,000 IHG points.  If you transfer over 30,000 UR points to get this night, you would be getting less than 0.6 cents a point.  You would have been better off booking the same room through the UR Portal.  \n\nDoes this mean you should never transfer points to IHG from UR?  Not necessarily.  Let say you are only 2,000 IHG points short for that same night.  By transferring over 2,000 UR points, you save yourself $175.  So the ability to transfer to these programs is still valuable at the margins.\n\nLet us take a look at Hyatt as a transfer partner.  Since Hyatt’s redemption rate is a better value, transferring UR points to Hyatt to book award nights is a common use of these points.  For example, the Hyatt Regency Cambridge is $339 a night on Aug 22, but the King room is available for only 15,000 Hyatt points.  So if you transfer 15,000 UR points to Hyatt, you end up getting a value of 2.26 cents per point, which is significantly better than the 1.25 cents booking through the UR Portal.\n\n\n####**Transferring to Airline Partners**\n\nThis is where the good stuff happens with plenty of caveats.  Note that these redemptions will likely require a lot of UR points, and quite a bit of planning and research.   Again, you can only transfer your UR points to airline partners if you hold a CSP, Ink Plus, or Ink Bold.\n\nChase partners with a number of airlines, and you can transfer UR points into the program for those airlines.  When you have miles in an airline program, you now redeem the miles using the airlines award chart.  This can lead to some really good values, some awful values, but also a lot of limitations.  You have to study various airline award charts to find the best values, and then you also need to find availability of awards.\n\nUR Points can be transferred to the following airline partners:\n\n- British Airways\n- Korean Air\n- Singapore Airlines\n- Southwest\n- United\n- Virgin Atlantic\n\nSome sweet spots that are often talked about for partner transfers:\n\n- BA : Non-stop AA/AS flights under 650 miles for 4,500 points one way\n- KE : 25,000 points RT to Hawaii\n- SQ : Singapore Suites\n\n**Note:** There are literally thousands of possibilities to redeem UR points using a partner transfer.  It is beyond the scope of a post to list out all the Best deals.\n\n####**Sample Airline Redemptions (The following examples are real)**\n\n**1.** Let say on Oct 6th 2015, I want to fly from Seattle to Los Angeles. I can, transfer 12,500 UR points to United, and book a United flight for 12,500 UA miles plus $5.60 cents.  Now, just to sanity check myself, I use the UR portal, and find that I can fly non-stop on Alaska, on the same date, for 7848 UR points ($98.10).  This means if I had transferred the miles to United, I would have overpaid for the flight, and gotten less than 1 cent per point.  To get an even better deal, the same Alaska flight had an award seat available.  So if I transferred 8,000 UR points to British Airways, I could have called up BA and booked the same flight for 7,500 UR points, with 500 left over in Avios.  As you can see, the same trip can have very different costs, and different valuation of your UR points.\n\n\n**2.** For an outlier example, I now want to fly from Seattle to Tokyo on Aug 26th in Business Class.  One award I found was that I can transfer 65,000 UR points to United and book an award  flight.  The same Business class seat is sold by United for $4054, giving you a valuation of 6.2 cents per point.\n\n####**Transfer to Amtrak**\n\nUR points can also be transferred to Amtrak at a ratio of 1:1.  The Amtrak award chart has some nice sweet spots, such as 15,000 for a Roomette (2 people) in one Zone, for example, from Montreal to Miami.  Note that Amtrak is expected to revamp their award chart very soon, so research carefully, and if this is useful for you, book your award soon.\n","name":"t3_3i1kdl","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-23 05:36:26","week":34}

About 5 months ago, I got a counterfeit claim against me.  I got the item NIB from a yard sale and I am 100% certain it was real (I've seen hundreds of these items throughout my life), but I had no invoices to back me up, so Amazon removed my ability to sell that item and said nothing more.  I think a customer keyword triggered an auto message from Amazon in this case, but what's done is done.\n\n  Now, last week I got a \"new item sold as used\" violation.  I've heard about the whole \"Amazon putting returned items in inventory\" debacle and I'm confident that's what happened here (fixed my settings too).  Bought and labeled everything myself.  I emailed Amazon back (as per their instructions) telling them how I'd make sure to never let it happen again and had my remaining units of this sku sent back.  Emailed them a week ago, haven't heard anything back.\n\nAnyways, now I'm very concerned about being suspended if one more thing comes against me.  Many of these things are out of my control.  I can't control whether or not someone emails Amazon saying \"This feels fake\" when it is in fact real, but doesn't meet their expectations.\n\nI have 3k items in inventory and I'm somewhat leveraged with CC's, so getting suspended would cause me stress by having to ship everything back and liquidate items on eBay to pay my CCs.  I know CC's carry risk, but with such large growth as of late, I've been really thriving with them.\n\nAnyone have experience in how many violations result in a suspension?

Think I'm going to do something with them again this week. \n\nHard to say for this week. I need to see how the markets react on Monday. I think there may be some residual push from last week we may see stocks have a bump Monday. I think AAPL may flucate again this week not by significant margin save the end of the week: but that September announcement is coming up and I think overall, heading into that, the sentiment will be bullish though not by major amounts of 125 or 130. As things get rockier with other stocks AAPL may seem a good buy. But it seems slow burning for now.\n\nAlso got to watch the news closely if there's anything else on China. They say they won't devalue again but some analysts say they could be. \n\nAnalysts seem to be of the opinion SPY will close out at much higher number than it is now by the end of the year, so that's something to keep in mind. Lots of time left in the year but I don't think it'll be a big a gain as they think it'll be. Going to watch closely. \n\nTSLA will flucate like it always does.

{"id":"cu5dzc1","author":"laststandb","body":"First of all, the biggest debate on minimum wage centers around how it will affect employment of low paying jobs. The actual cost of living of a minimum wage increase isn't very high (I will break it down below), but the problem is if Americans start cooking more and buying more stuff from Amazon, what will happen to the retail and restaurant workers?\n\nKeep in mind this question is very controversial and there is no definite answer. Many people have opinions on the effect, and I am going to give my opinion.\n\nCertainly there will be some effect on the cost of living if we increase the minimum wage. If we suddenly increase the minimum wage to $1000/hr, prices will be raised accordingly. The real question is how much of an effect and what kind of an effect will a $10/hr, or $15/hr minimum wage have. \n\n**Goods**  \nToday we live in a global economy, almost everything we buy is manufactured somewhere in Asia and shipped to the United States. The only part of this global supply chain that would be affected by a minimum wage increase is the retail distribution to consumers. Retail margins are low enough that this cost would be passed entirely onto the consumers. \n\nIf you assume that wage costs are about 13% of total costs (http://www.bdc.ca/EN/articles-tools/money-finance/manage-finances/Pages/standard-costs-retail-industry.aspx), this would mean that you would have about a 7% increase in prices.\n\nBut the real game changer is online shopping. Unlike retail, online shopping is much more efficient with labor it uses. Maybe firms will have to pay more for package handlers and packers, however drivers and truckers earn more than the minimum wage and will be unaffected. Maybe Amazon will have to charge a few dollars more per year for Prime, but the prices of goods should remain unchanged.\n\n**Services**  \nFood preparation and service is a very labor intensive task. If you do it yourself and buy everything from the grocer, you may see the 7% price increase as noted above, maybe more for hand picked goods like fruits. However if you choose to 'outsource' your cooking and buy from restaurants the price would dramatically increase.\n\nLabor costs generally run anywhere between 25-35% of total margins (http://www.bakertilly.com/uploads/restaurant-benchmarking.pdf) even though they have some of the lowest cost of labor. This probably means that eating out will be ~25% more expensive than before.\n\nPeople will eat out less, and restaurants will close, however the luxury of eating out is not that big of a portion of CPI. The US weights eating out at 5.8% of the CPI. \n\nA similar effect may affect other labor intensive industries like Movers, Child Care, and Recreations.\n\n**Housing**  \nMy opinion is that housing costs will be unchanged, minimum wage workers represent a small fraction of the renting/buying market.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nA higher minimum wage probably will not affect the 'average american' consumer very much, especially if they purchase everything online. I went through the CPI-U and assigned arbitrary weights and came away with a 4% increase in cost of living given a $15/hr minimum wage.\n\nBefore you go out and write to your congressman how reddit told you that minimum wage increase isn't going to affect cost of living much, keep in mind the affect on jobs is unknown. \n\nIn addition, unless we elect a Democratic government in 2016, we are not going to get a large minimum wage increase for years. I think the best choice of action is to wait and see how the minimum wage increase works in Seattle so we can have some hard data, rather than random speculation","name":"t1_cu5dzc1","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2015-08-17 02:42:01","week":34}

And it's very easy to spend just a little time to reduce your grocery bill significantly, but generally not enough to flip, and if you can manage to reduce something to flip grocery-wise, you're going to have a very short window on Amazon to make a passable ROI.  Most of the deals happen at Walgreens and CVS with their store cards--Balance Rewards and whatever CVS's is called.  There are blogs dedicated to each store, though, as well as forums, so I can guarantee you unless you are first to have something at Amazon, that isn't the way you'll be making the big bucks.  The deals require multiple transactions in one visit, though the cashiers are generally savvy to it as well, so it's not a big deal.  The store managers also know it's coming, so they bulk up stock of those items.  Even in an out of the way store, you WON'T be the only one stockpiling.  \n\nThe blogs will spell out exactly how to get the deals for the least money and tell you exactly where to get the coupons and what each transaction should be, so there's minimal time involved.  It's just that the information is so readily available that you just have to be first to even have a remote shot at making money that way.\n\nThe only way to really do it is if you saved enough money on stuff for yourself--like if you had to buy some toothpaste to make another deal possible, but you don't really care about the toothpaste so you sell that.  Even then, profits will be minimal.","name":"t1_cu5falr","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-17 03:25:58","week":34}

{"id":"cu5htc8","author":"MenacingGoldfish","body":"I actually have a lot of relevant experience here. \n\nFor several months I did all my and my husband's laundry by hand in order to save on trips to the laundromat. I tried using a wonder wash machine first. The load size was too small for me, however, and there was no way to really adequately rinse laundry in the machine. (Rinsing is super important, as soap residue left on your clothes will attract dirt, making your clothes dirtier faster.)\n\nI ended up purchasing a breathing mobile washer. (Something like $25 on Amazon.) Many people use a dedicated plunger that they drill holes in instead of shelling out for this washer, but I would not recommend this. Although it works, and works much better than just swishing your clothes around in the water, the mobile washer is much sturdier, and in my experience pulls more dirt and soap residue out of your clothes much more efficiently.\n\nMany people use a five gallon buckets to do the laundry in. This works, but any size tub will work with the breathing washer, you simply move around the washer, plunging different areas of the load for a few minutes. I settled on a large Rubbermaid tote. This would allow me to do adequate sized loads for my needs. I also would use my bathtub for overly large things, like my queen sized blankets/bedding.\n\nNow on to method. I would begin by running water into the tub and dissolving any soap (I use powder) in the water. Any heavily soiled areas on clothing I would pre-treat by rubbing a fels-naptha soap bar over it before throwing it in the wash. (Less than a dollar in the laundry aisle, it's there, I promise) dump your dirty clothes into the tub, use the washer to plunge your clothes a few times so everything's wet, and then walk away for twenty minutes or so. \n\nHere's a secret to hand washing clothes. Most of the dirt comes out of the clothes during soaking time. Skipping the soaking makes your job harder.  \n\nAlso, be sure to use only a tiny amount of soap. Always err on the side of not using enough soap rather than too much. (See earlier comment about rinsing.) I generally used less than a tablespoon of soap in my tub.\n\nCome back after the soaking and plunge your clothes for a minute or two. Drain the water. Wringing out at this point can be helpful, but not strictly required.\n\nFor best results, rinse your clothes twice.\n\nFirst rinse, fill the tub. Add a few tablespoons of distilled white vinegar to this rinse water. Add clothes, plunge a few times, allow to soak, drain again. \nThe vinegar in the first rinse is important because it helps pull soap out of clothes. (I want to say this has something to do with neutralizing the basic soap with the acidic vinegar, but I could have just made that up in my head.) No, your clothes won't smell like vinegar.\n\nSecond rinse, use plain water. (If you're doing more than one load you can add soap to this water when you start the next load.)\n\nWashing clothes is easy. The real work is wringing them out to facilitate drying them. You have a few options here. First is old fashioned hand wringing. A lot of work, and my hands get tired easily. Another option is purchasing a hand wringer, but I've been unable to find them cheaply. (Less than $150) \n\nI ended up purchasing a Nina soft electric spinner dryer. It was a bit of an investment (I wanna say about $150, but I don't remember) but it made drying my clothes (even in a humid environment) possible. The spinner dryer is really light (like eleven pounds or something like that) so I could store it in the utility closet across the apartment. (I actually still use this dryer even now that I have an in house washer and dryer)\n\nNow hang up the (still slightly damp) clothes on a drying rack or on your shower rod and wait until dry. If it's winter, place your drying rack close to a heat source like a heating vent will dry the clothes more quickly.\n\nFor things like bedding, that wouldn't fit in the dryer, I put up a heavy duty bar over my bathtub (think closet bar) that I would throw the wet blanket to drain before taking it to the laundromat to dry there.\n\nIf you have any more questions, please ask. I took a long time perfecting my system. I'd love to share! ","name":"t1_cu5htc8","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-17 04:50:32","week":34}

You are entirely full of shit.\n\nSo maybe you're not talking about clothing. (although that's the only specific you actually mentioned for the \"hive mind\" which you've dropped in every one of your comments.  Are you talking about the fact that all the interviewers you had seemed to want you to be customer obsessed, demonstrate ownership, think big, etc? This is (1) Not a secret: http://www.amazon.jobs/principles (2) No different from any large company that has a published set of \"values\" and (3) a convenient way to structure a set of interview questions to avoid chaos. THAT'S IT. Nobody spends their day obsessed with these principles.  They are guidelines, nothing more.\n\nYour \"hive mind\" b.s. is SO laughable because the exact OPPOSITE is true. By structuring the company into a lot of  separate entities that are given a lot of leeway and power, Amazon's problem IF ANYTHING is *fragmentation*, **not** a hive mentality. Go to the AWS console and take a look at the wildly different User Experience and UI elements for the different AWS services. Why is it like that? Because every team is given the leeway to pick the technologies and best practices they choose. There are certainly global design guidelines but they are ultimately that - suggestions. A team can choose to overrule them if they want to, and they do all the time. For some internal frameworks there may be 2 or 3 competing alternatives playing survival of the fittest over many years as different teams choose to adopt different ones for different purposes. Again, it actually makes it hard sometimes, because there is so much choice. But that's the point...the downside is too much choice. The downside is freedom and the requirement for self-responsibility. The downside is noone ever tells you \"THIS Is how you need to do this\" instead you have to do decide for yourself, which can be stressful.\n\n\nLastly, the FUCKING hallways. You need to drop this. There are NO hallways that you need to go down to scan in an additional car reader. You simply misunderstood what you saw and you need to acknowledge that I have no reason to lie about this. I have been to a dozen different amazon buildings and have not seen anything that remotely reminds of your experience.  Some buildings you scan when you enter the building and that's it. Some buildings are shared with other companies, and the elevator is shared, so you exit the elevator into a public lobby, and then scan in when you go through a turnstile or a gate. If you then take the shared staircase, you have to scan when you re-enter some floor.  There are occasionally weird paths you can take that take you through 2 such turnstiles or gates.  That's it.  \nYou're probably not lying. You are probably mis-remembering. Which is fine.

Upper management has a vision for the organization, but it gets lost on its way down the chain.

{"id":"cu5yx7m","author":"miayakuza","body":"I worked at Amazon for about 5 years and it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  The long hours, the expectation that you will be online when you get home, managers who get away with debasing their direct reports, coworkers who will stab you in the back to get ahead and an HR department that couldn’t care less.  If you have concerns about how your manager treats you and you go to HR you will be royally fucked for the rest of your tenure at Amazon and you will be blacklisted.  That happened to me and a close friend of mine.  I have another friend who was told he was going to be fired but they wouldn’t tell him when and let him hang for a year before they did it.  I had a manager, a VP actually, who was inappropriate to everyone in the department and contributed absolutely nothing to our productivity.  A bunch of us went to HR because we felt that he was not only abusive but engaging in illegal activities with vendors and we were basically told to drop it.  About a year later he was caught forging a buyer’s signature on a purchase order in an attempt to split the payment with the vendor.  He wasn’t fired but was asked to resign.  I know a lot of people that were put on a Performance Improvement Plan for doing far less.  A PIP is the first step in getting fired.  There’s really no coming back from a PIP.  If your manager at Amazon doesn’t like you they can just put you on a PIP.  Even if you are doing a great job, they can always say you lack “leadership” qualities.  It’s so much more efficient than working out your differences. I was emotionally tortured no matter how much I achieved.  I got physically sick because of the bullying inflicted on me by my manager.  She took credit for my work. I wasn’t invited to meetings I should have been at.  She constantly criticized me in front of her boss.  She made me (and others on our team) send her emails for review and she would edit them before letting us send.  She even got others to treat me poorly.  A guy I thought was a friend started forwarding her emails that I wrote to him about how I was feeling.  I found out because he accidentally forwarded my own email to me and my boss.  He never looked me in the eye again.  As these events continued to occur I not only got sick but I lost all confidence in myself both professionally and personally.  I tried to find another job within the company but I couldn’t interview well to save my life.  During one interview I had an off the record conversation with someone again I thought was my friend about my manager and she used it against me during the interview evaluation.  And yes, I went to HR about my manager and they did nothing.  But everything worked out for the best.  I thank God that I got away from Amazon for if I hadn’t I am certain that I would have been treated poorly by a different manager and probably would have lost my mind.","name":"t1_cu5yx7m","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-08-17 17:52:53","week":34}

{"id":"cu624fz","author":"ghjm","body":"A/C for a large warehouse can be extremely expensive, because of the ridiculously large volume of air that has to be moved and cooled. Also, a large warehouse will have many loading docks with trucks backed up to them, meaning a huge amount of air exchange with the outside - so once cooled, it doesn't say cooled. All this adds up to an incredible amount of electricity, and depending on where the warehouse is located, there might simply not be that much electrical service available from the power company. I'm prepared to believe that the power bill for A/C in an Amazon-sized warehouse could exceed $50,000/month.\n\nAs a result, virtually all warehouses are non-air-conditioned. From a purely monetary perspective, the cost of an ambulance or two on stand-by is vastly less than the cost of installing and operating an air conditioning system.\n\nIn a severe heat wave, the right thing to do, and what most warehouses actually do, is to have more people work shorter shifts with longer breaks. I don't know if Amazon did this or not. I would guess they probably did. If they were still worried about their workers and took the trouble to bring in ambulances just in case, that's a good thing, isn't it? I don't think most warehouse operators would bother.\n\nThis is not to say that Amazon is all sweetness and light or that their working conditions are good or bad. I have no knowledge of that.

{"id":"cu6gcoq","author":"AnotherBusinessModel","body":"I'll tell you what I did.\n\nI had the same problem. My monthly cash flow was about 1k at the time.  So I took out a credit card (3k limit) with cash back and spent 3k on inventory. Every time I got paid by Amazon, I paid the card and maxed it out again. Two months later, my monthly cash flow was about 6k. Great.  Then I opened more credit.  Now I had 10k in credit and my monthly cash flow was 6k.  I spent the 10k and paid the cards every time I got paid.  A month and a half later my monthly cash flow was about 25k. \n\nThere is some risk with this strategy, but if you're experienced it's a great way to leverage your business.  The general gist of this strategy is to spend a little more than your current cash flow by utilizing credit.  There are tons of 0% APR cards that work great for this.  At some point, you'll need debt to grow.  I took out that 10k in credit and a month and a half later got a 14k disbursement.  Basically, your just spending your next Amazon payment before you get it. So, last week I got a 14k disbursement and paid down 10k in credit cards, leaving me with 4k.  But then I spend the whole 14k (maxing out the cards again) with the likely assumption that my next Amazon payment will be similar.\n\nThere is risk to using cards, but it's a good way to grow.","name":"t1_cu6gcoq","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-08-18 01:28:41","week":34}

{"id":"cu6i4jq","author":"xcbsmith","body":"Having paramedics ready to treat dehydration and heat stress seems like, if anything, an abundance of effort to protect worker safety.\n\nYeah, working in a warehouse is hard, hot, and demanding work. Some people don't take the necessary precautions to handle the heat, and some people are simply in no condition to handle the heat. It sounds like employees had access to water &amp; other heat stress mitigation options.\n\nSo let's review the problems with the job:\n\n1. If you don't meet performance standards, you get reprimanded. Your performance is tracked and made visible to you, with a clear set of rules (even a points system!) that allows you to understand exactly how close you are to meeting standards or being terminated.\n2. During summer heat waves, the place gets really hot. The heat index exceeds 110 degrees in some parts of the work environment. Sometimes as much as 1% of employees suffer from heat stress... sometimes badly enough they need to be taken to area hospitals.\n3. Workers who struggle to meet performance standards often worked instead of treating their heat-related symptoms in order to try to meet performance standards.\n4. New applicants were ready to begin work at any time.\n5. Pregnant women are allowed to do the job, and like their coworkers, suffer in the heat.\n6. An emergency room doctor, based on symptoms of an employee, reported an \"unsafe environment\" to regulators. Employees have done the same. Apparently no one in authority who actually looked at the environment has declared it as such, though they have recommended the workplace should be cooler and less humid. \n7. The jobs pay $11 or $12/hr.\n8. Though there are clearly permanent positions, some (now about 50/50, but at some time it might have been more) workers are provided through a temporary employment firm, and per regulatory requirement, when their temporary term ends, they cannot reapply for the position for several months.\n9. Amazon doesn't open the warehouse doors for fear of theft, but they do have fans, louver doors, and heat sensors deployed throughout the facility. They also provide cooling bandannas to every employee, and dock/trailer workers get cooling vests.\n10. Breaks and workloads are adjusted for hot days, and if the heat index gets above 115 degrees, management can close down the entire shift.\n11. There is one case where someone whose performance dropped in the heat, and was asked about the drop in performance by her supervisors. She told them it was because it was hot and she suffered from asthma. Apparently, when asked, she said she wanted to complete her 1,200-hour term. Then, one day when she wasn't feeling well (displaying classic symptoms of heat stress), she went to the restroom, and a manager asked if she was okay. When she said she wasn't, they took her, by wheelchair to an air-conditioned room, and had her examined by paramedics. It was her first time working for an employer that had medical professionals ready to assist anyone who was suffering health problems, and her conclusion was \"all you people care about is the rates, not the well-being of the people\"? Seriously?\n\nUnless the warehouse isn't meeting EPA standards for air circulation &amp; temperatures, I don't get why this is a remotely surprising portrait of what large scale manual labour looks like.\n\nFrankly, the notion that this is \"slavery\" is absurd. You could make a case that it is labour exploitation, but Amazon is hardly at the front of a very long line of employers that would meet whatever criteria one might use for this.\n\nSeriously: working a temporary job doing a lot of manual labour during a heat wave sucks. Working in a temporary job where the labour pool is vastly larger than the demand sucks. A lot of people aren't cut out for it, or aren't able to manage their health well enough in those circumstances. Though employers can take a lot of precautions (and it sounds like Amazon has), working even under a 120 degree heat index sucks --but isn't \"slavery\", and really I'm not sure why there ought to be anything wrong with it.\n\nMaybe people should be paid more, and you certainly can argue that the economic structure might ensure that they aren't paid what they ought to be. That I can understand and sympathize with. \n\nThere might even be an issue with the ISS managers not making good calls and generally not quite living up to Amazon's standards, but really, I don't get how Amazon or ISS come across as exceptionally bad employers for this type of job. They sound better than average to me.","name":"t1_cu6i4jq","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-08-18 02:22:09","week":34}

{"id":"cu6keju","author":"dmsean","body":"The idea it is slavery is obviously a hyperbole and just a pointless statement. However, maybe that's just privilege as the longest I ever had to work in a warehouse was 3 months. I was 15, I used the experience to get a job at the audio / video section of a superstore. From there it was retail computer jobs until I was making good coin in IT. A privilege I recognize, despite the work I had to do to get there.\n\nNow with that said, the only thing that really matters is are other warehouses doing a better job. Amazon is a first class \"enterprise\" with billions of dollars in value and they seem to have a horrible corporate culture, regardless if these situations in the warehouses are somewhat average. The question I would ask is it above, or below that average. I'd also argue this could be a geographical issue for Amazon. When you centralize control of certain aspects of your business you can lose a bit of touch with your base. Maybe 95% of their warehouses don't have these problems and when you are a warehouse business that number doesn't matter. However when you are a logistic business with massive PR, that 5% might hurt your overall. You should spend a bit more resources on it, and you win. I'm sure someone is crunching these numbers and I'm sure they're paid more than me. \n\nAlso, standing in line to be verified I didn't steal anything before leaving, and not being paid for that, would seriously piss me off to the point of violent revolution.

{"id":"cu6lkch","author":"dmsean","body":"Thanks for your reply. I appreciate the detail and care!\n\n1. Corporate Culture - I work in the industry. I love AWS. makes me life so easy. However, working in the industry and living on the west coast I know a few that have worked for them. Same with Oracle and Microsoft. I admit it is a bias, but if I keep hearing the same thing over and over again I cannot help but wonder. Everyone is using those jobs to get jobs they actually want. There has to be a corporate culture at Amazon, Oracle and Microsoft that is completely different than what all those people are doing, but it is elite and a small fraction of the number the companies actually employs. I think work visas add to this motto of how it is ok to dump employees unless they want to get into that elite circle. I can't say it's good or bad, it just is, but it's not for me. Way too cut throat, and I question my own government ok'ing more visas without even considering investing in more education for the unemployed youth who need to work in warehouses.\n\n2. I have very little knowledge of how amazon controls it's warehouses it seems. Outsourcing / supply chain / whatever you want to call it still has a bit of \"spread the corporate culture\" doesn't it? I watched Amazon buy a local online book store. They considered it a auxiliary of their existing business (abe books). I'd argue from what I've seen, that \"hand\" that controls their auxiliary or outsourced businesses, heh and to quote someone who worked there, \"feeds them the company dog food\".\n\n3. Living in the north west, it's always somewhat cold. I actually work in a warehouse district right now, we are moving into the downtown core soon, soon! It's been hot out lately, like so hot I had to put fans in the server room. The mattress factory that is attached to the building I work at is always colder inside than outside, and it has been hotter than normal. However, the storage of mattress at a certain temperature while they are being assembled might be more important than humans heh. \n\n4. Yah, http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-amazon-doesnt-have-to-pay-for-after-hours-time-in-security-lines/2014/12/09/05c67c0c-7fb9-11e4-81fd-8c4814dfa9d7_story.html seems it got so far as the supreme court.  I still really cannot justify it. Run cameras, run inventory. It's cheaper if you just have computers to count all of it with logistics.

As I said, I'm sure those are terrible jobs, and I'd expect they represent the bulk of Amazon's workforce.

You can trace back every aspect of the story to those realities.\n\n&gt; I watched Amazon buy a local online book store. They considered it a auxiliary of their existing business (abe books).\n\nThat's really kind of the opposite of outsourcing, and the relationship is quite the opposite.\n\nWhat you describe is really not at all different from what happens under most acquisitions of local businesses by international conglomerates...\n\nWhat you are missing though is that the perspective of control depends on your starting point. If you start from a case where they fully employed everyone in the facility, and then swapped it out to having temporary employees and their managers working under a separate contractor, you're going to have a reduction in control and consistency in culture. If you start with a warehouse originally owned by a different company and acquired, you'd see an increase in control and consistency.\n\n&gt; However, I'm not sure how standard it it, I just think it would be easier to catch the theft with checks and balances.\n\nThat's one of the checks and balances.\n\nKeep in mind, shrinkage is an industry wide phenomenon.

{"id":"cu6npyy","author":"Booby_Hatch","body":"The goal is to have a $0 balance budget.  That means you sit down at the beginning of the month and list all of your debts that are due that month.  Allocate your upcoming month's income in order of importance (rent first, groceries, utilities, monthly installments, etc).  When I do this I also have a category for other recurring debts:  For instance, say my car registration is due once per year and costs $120.  I'll put $10 per month aside for that.  Amazon Prime costs $107.22 per year so I put aside $8.94 per month.  I also have categories for cash expenses like gas for my car, dining &amp; entertainment, hair cuts, etc.  Once I have all of my categories filled up for the month, What I have left over goes into my savings.  You can use everydollar.com, though that puts tithing and your savings first (I don't tithe and savings is only realistic if your debts are paid so it makes sense to put that last).  You can also try YNAB; I've never used this but I understand you have to pay a monthly fee - you would need to verify that.  I personally use an Excel spreadsheet and it's foolproof.  No bills, whether monthly, quarterly or annually, surprise me anymore.  And I'm prepared for unexpected expenses because I've got savings that I never had before.  I wish I knew how to budget when I was young and the first one of my group of peers to get my own place.

Knocking out a few will free up cash flow and make keeping track of everything easier.  I would pay off the Best Buy Mastercard and Chase Amazon Visa asap and the they Barclay card.  That frees up $65 a month and gives you 3 less bills to worry about.  Next I would focus any extra cash on the 25.99% amazon.com as it is your highest interest rate and one of the lower balances that are charging interest.  After that choose your targets either based on highest interest rate to save in the log run or lowest balance to free up cash flow in the short run.

He says it's very good, but like you said, we don't know. I'd also make distinction between the warehouse and white-collar employees.\n\nBut I don't think even he disagrees that the company makes people work very hard. Some people are probably asked, in different ways, to work +60 hours a week and some weekends too. That's not really the issue I had with the article. That kind of behaviour is not really new and is somewhat standard in companies like Amazon, FB and Google. They are highly demanding and expect people to deliver under huge pressure. \n\nWhat I had issue with was with little snippets where completely standard protocols or situations were made seem like they're some evil Amazon secret processes.\n\nFew examples I picked quickly. The article was full of these which raised a red flag immediately. \n\n&gt; *“On Monday mornings, fresh recruits line up for an orientation intended to catapult them into Amazon’s singular way of working.”*\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes – this is called “New Hire Orientation”, or NHO. At Microsoft (referencing my personal experience), this is called “New Employee Orientation, or NEO. Every company has one, and they call it something. Here’s what happens at ours, precisely: \n&gt; \n&gt; New employees get a good breakfast (fruits, pastries, cereal, that kind of thing)\n&gt; They immediately get a laptop and backpack\n&gt; They get a “Welcome to Amazon” introduction\n&gt; They fill out benefits paperwork\n&gt; They learn a bit about the company, including our leadership principles\n&gt; They hear a story about how important our customers are, as “Customer Obsession” is widely known to be our first and foremost leadership principle\n&gt; They hear from a guest speaker about their experience at Amazon\n&gt; They get their badge picture taken, and receive their badge\n&gt; At the end, the employee’s Manager is waiting for them to welcome them to Amazon, and the new employees get taken out to lunch\n&gt; This happens from 8 AM – 12:15 PM, or 9 AM – 1:15 PM. Anyone else know of any other company that has a somewhat similar process for new employees?\n\n-----\n\n&gt; *The internal phone directory instructs colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another’s bosses. Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts, including this: “I felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.”)*\n&gt; \n&gt; We refer to this as “Anytime Feedback”, and no one “instructs” you to do anything. It’s simply there to use if you need it. And right at the top, there is a “Strengths” section, and below, an “Areas for Improvement” section. I receive anytime feedback, both positive and constructive, for the folks that work for me. I’m given feedback via the tool, mostly positive, some that addresses my growth areas, that my boss discusses with me. I can always provide it to anyone in the company, at any level. Some people never use it, and just, you know, talk to each other. Some write emails. Certainly, it is not used to sabotage others in the company, and here’s why:\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the few things the authors got right is that Amazon is a very data-driven company. If the feedback does not have very specific data, as a manager, you are trained to dig deeper before accepting it (whether it’s positive or negative), and the tool allows you to do just that: reject the feedback by sending it back for clarification. Managers are also coached on diving deep into feedback to ensure that what Jodi and David state to happen – employee sabotage – actually does not.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sample text bit is just comical: that’s there to help you in case you don’t know what to write. Conveniently, Jodi and David left out the sample text in the Strengths section, which, again, is the first thing you see on the Anytime Feedback page. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of that: “I immediately felt confident about his abilities to organize the project! He quickly mobilized the team to meet a key project milestone!” \n&gt; \n\n-----\n\n&gt; *“The company, founded and still run by Jeff Bezos, rejects many of the popular management bromides that other corporations at least pay lip service to and has instead designed what many workers call an intricate machine propelling them to achieve Mr. Bezos’ ever-expanding ambitions.”*\n&gt; \n&gt; I don’t know what the hell this even is, or where to start. What are the popular management bromides that we reject? There is no intricate machine, and I have no idea what Jeff’s ambitions are, other than to continue to grow Amazon. Most of us work here because we want to solve the world’s most challenging technology problems. We come to work, do our best, have fun, and go home. While what the authors write sounds evil-scary-bad, it lacks, you know, facts and substance.\n\n-----\n\n&gt;  *“Of all of his management notions, perhaps the most distinctive is his belief that harmony is often overvalued in the workplace — that it can stifle honest critique and encourage polite praise for flawed ideas. Instead, Amazonians are instructed to “disagree and commit” (No. 13) — to rip into colleagues’ ideas, with feedback that can be blunt to the point of painful, before lining up behind a decision.”*\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, no. Absolutely, unequivocally, no. Have Backbone/Disagree and Commit states:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\"\n\n&gt;  I bolded respectfully for a reason. We don’t rip into each other. If this happened at Amazon before, it doesn’t happen now, not where I work and worked. What this does encourage is something that I have not found in any other company, and something that has been reinforced throughout my career at Amazon.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; *“Several former high-level female executives, and other women participating in a recent internal Amazon online discussion that was shared with The New York Times, said they believed that some of the leadership principles worked to their disadvantage. They said they could lose out in promotions because of intangible criteria like “earn trust” (principle No. 10) or the emphasis on disagreeing with colleagues. Being too forceful, they said, can be particularly hazardous for women in the workplace.”*\n&gt; \n&gt; I honestly don’t understand this. One “Earns Trust” through actions, not through gender. Here's the Earns Trust of Others leadership principle:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.\"\n\n&gt; How would adhering to this work against a specific gender? How could being an attentive, respective leader, who is vocally self-critical and candid be a bad thing?? Even if this could logically happen based on gender, of all things (and I can't for the life of me rationalize how) HR is in the room for promotion and review discussions to ensure that what Jodi and David refer to doesn't happen. As a father to a single child (a daughter), who I hope one day will be the best at whatever she chooses to be, this part of the article angers me the most. I want to state that I am not disputing Michelle Williamson’s account of what she was told by her boss – what I am disputing is that it’s a widespread practice, as the article makes it out to be. As an Amazonian, this is not something I’ve ever encountered, and as a Manager and owner, I would flag comments such as the one her former boss made immediately.\n\n-----\n\nI think most important piece was that even the LinkedIn writer acknowledges that things probably were bad, but in his opinion, are not anymore. Many people agrees with this, then again, a lot probably don't. People interviewed for the NYT definitely do not, but hard to say exactly how recently they've worked there. \n\n&gt; If Amazon used to be this way (and it most likely was, as you’ll see in the quote below), from my 18 month experience working in two of its biggest product groups, that Amazon no longer exists. Last year, during all-hands, a very high ranking Executive said, verbatim:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Amazon used to burn a lot of people into the ground. This isn’t how we do things anymore, and it isn’t how I run my business. I want this to be a place where people solve problems that cannot be solved, anywhere in the world, but they feel good about working for a great company at the same time. And if you’re burning people into the ground with overwork, you’re not doing it right, and you need to course-correct, or you don’t need to be here.\"","name":"t1_cu6tbea","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-08-18 09:01:21","week":34}

There is a reason these positions are so well compensated—they are extremely demanding.\n\nThe Amazon article dealt with the work culture at corporate headquarters, and relied on dozens of interviews with mostly former employees.  How many of them were gunning for senior management positions and were passed over?  Are people more likely to be objective about why they were passed over, or are they more likely to seek out self-preserving rationalizations?\n\nI fully agree that a high-pressure environment is not for everyone, but some people truly prefer that type of environment due to the high performance it nurtures, which the article alluded to.  A harsh, strict, uncomfortable environment gets results.  I don't think it's a coincidence that Asian parents are stereotyped as being very strict and demanding while people in the US of Asian ancestry have the highest rate of graduate degrees and the highest income per capita.  Cultural attitudes, including work cultural attitudes, matter in terms of the results that the group achieves.  These challenging environments can be highly beneficial for society since they are so uniquely positioned to achieve lofty goals.

If your store's model is similar, you might transition smoothly.

See if the math works.  If Prime is cheaper, it may be a very easy decision for you.\n\nI did this recently, and after taking into account the differential between my AMEX BCP 6% back and Amazon Visa 3% back, the savings ended up being ~$4/month.  If you buy \"store brand\", you'll find you'll never win with a comparable product on Amazon, as the \"store brand\" is manufactured with an intended \"target shelf price\" that is VERY difficult for a third-party distributor/wholesaler to get close to by the time it hits a supermarket shelf.\n\nI went ahead, but not really because of the savings.  The items I get delivered were bulky.  I live in the city, so having more space in my grocery bags for produce/meat (or lighter bags to carry) is a benefit.  I'm saving a few bucks and gaining some convenience.

{"id":"cu7eg9b","author":"aerger","body":"I would say \"it depends\". My initial experience was with an item that Jet itself didn't carry, so they used a third party that shipped it--finally, 5 days after ordering--in an unpadded plastic envelope. It arrived, predictably imo, completely crushed. 11 (edit: _business_) days from the initial order, I finally had a replacement (from a different third-party, that actually used a damn box). It took a lot of shouting via Twitter. I got a lousy $5 off my next order (that I used on the re-order right away).  \n\nThat said, I still got it eventually, probably faster than Amazon's free shipping, and paid a lot less. But the experience wasn't the greatest. I understand that they've basically just opened shop, so there's that. I do wonder if they can sustain themselves with their current business model; they eat the difference between their website pricing and whatever the third-party shipper charges. In my case, they spent $40 or so on me, before shipping, on a $100-ish item.

{"id":"cu7h7ex","author":"stckfigure","body":"I've placed, I believe, four orders with Jet now. I was a beta tester, but not otherwise affiliated. Here's my experience. Since discovering Jet, I have cancelled my Amazon Subscribe and Save shipment for the past two months. The prices are almost universally better, especially as the orders get bigger. That's the model they're using; you're effectively saving money because you order more stuff and it doesn't cost as much per unit to give you \"another one\". You can sometimes get discounts for things that save them money, like waiving returns (they still cover damage, more on that later) and paying with credit cards that have lower processing costs. They've had exceedingly responsive customer service, and I've been very impressed with that so far (to be fair, I'm also universally impressed with Amazon's, and let's be honest, Jet is competing directly with Amazon here even though they're pitching themselves as an online warehouse store like Costco).\n\nHowever, there's a fair bit of downside. Early on, the interface for pricing was substantially better than it is now. I know why they changed it; it's set up now in a way that encourages you to spend more, psychologically, because it's overemphasizing the savings. You don't see a \"per unit real cost\"; you see the \"original cost\" of the thing, and then you see a giant purple \"TOTAL SAVINGS\" number that grows as you add more stuff. The psychology of course is \"I'd be a fool not to add more; look how much more I save!\" and the interface really plays into that. This is fine, but really annoying when you're trying to price-compare. There's basically no way to predict what something will cost, and - since Jet doesn't control a large chunk of their inventory - no real way to future-predict either. \n\nTo go along with this, they have some extremely frustrating (or just plain weird) inventory issues. There are gaping holes in places you'd expect inventory. Sometimes they'll only let you order a certain number of an item, and it's almost certainly because that's just how many there are. This is fine, of course; no one expects infinite inventory, but there's no indication about it until you just run into the wall. It also means the pricing is weird sometimes... for example, regular Life cereal costs about twice as much as cinnamon Life cereal (same size box), for no good reason. \n\nAlso, their packaging sucks. I mean, really badly. Amazon's isn't great for groceries on S&amp;S, but Jet's is worse. The first couple orders I got stuff from various dropshippers, mostly Walmart and Vitacost. The last couple have all been from Jet. Boxes come squashed almost universally. That said, when one of my boxes contained a bag of flour which had torn open, Jet replaced it free of charge, didn't ask for me to return it, and the new one was at my door overnight. They did require photographic proof (Amazon often just refunds the cost of the item, no proof needed, but I call this a wash. I've had a busted jam jar from Amazon and that was way more annoying to clean up).\n\nAll that said, I'm still a Jet customer, while it's free. Will I join in for $50/year? Probably not, unless they fix the inventory issues. That's my biggest problem. I'm savvy enough to deal with the wonky way they present pricing, and I think you could probably make a full time job out of min-maxing their engine. The UI needs work, there's no doubt about it, but it's a new company and it has excellent people in charge with a lot of e-tailer experience (diapers.com). But the inventory problem is real, at least for me where my primary purpose is to get bulk groceries. I doubt I'd bother buying any of their other stuff unless it lined up with when I was ordering a grocery package anyway. JetAnywhere (or whatever it's called) isn't super useful for people in this group because we're all probably maximizing our cashback portals in better ways, but it's a nice addition that could help keep things simple. \n\nIn short, I'd say I'm a cautiously satisfied customer, but I really wanted Jet to be a game-changer and so far, it's not.\n\nHappy to answer questions.","name":"t1_cu7h7ex","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-08-18 22:48:28","week":34}

{"id":"cu7pr0z","author":"tellman1257","body":"*PASTED:*\n\n**Why did Google create Alphabet?**\n\n**What are the benefits of having a separate overarching holding company?**\n\nQuora User *[&lt;--THE ANSWERER IS ANONYMOUS, AS IS THE FIRST UPVOTER]*\n\nUpvoted by Quora User, Software Engineering Manager @ Google • Shreyes Seshasai, Worked for Google at various times between 2007-2010. • Yair Livne, Director of Data Science at Quora\n\nAlphabet Inc has a lot of parallels with how Berkshire Hathaway is structured and just like Warren Buffet, we now have to think of Larry and Sergey as investors, not entrepreneurs per se. Looking at them in this new light gives some ideas of why this was done.\n\n1. **Freedom of capital allotment:** Larry and Sergey now act as money managers and have larger freedom to assign substantial capital to any business they choose. Under Google, they would be subject to shareholder questions like \"Why invest in Calico (a life longevity company)  when it has no demonstrable impact on ad revenues?\" or \"Is Project Loon (balloon based internet) really strategic to Google?\" As shareholders of Alphabet, you are trusting their judgment as money managers and not as operators of any particular company.\n\n2. **Taxation benefits:** Under the new structure, Alphabet Inc. does not engage in any business operation, which enables the holding company to reduce the responsibility of owning a business. Alphabet Inc has no manufacturing, no products and no services. This allows it to maximize the profits and minimize taxation liability because the dividends it gets from subsidiaries are not taxed (if ownership &gt;80%).\n\n3. **Risk mitigation:** New structure means that any individual company does not bear liabilities of other companies. This means Google Inc does not bear any liability for potential moonshot projects like Google X that might have substantial losses. Google Inc., becomes a predictable business with predicable growth/ revenues.\n\n4. **Google Inc escapes quarterly scrutiny:** Alphabet might not choose to declare the P&amp;L accounts for Google Inc.,  in depth.\n\ne.g Amazon did not explicitly mention the revenues and expenses of AWS as a business line until Q1 '15. We had to make assumptions/ predictions. Investors think that AWS can be highly valuable as a standalone business, which means that Amazon stock as a whole is undervalued.\n\nIf this is true, that means as a company, Google has\n\n1. More freedom for R&amp;D/ risky projects\n\n2. Not to worry about quarterly results or shareholder perception.\n\nEdit: As new details emerge, here are the current \"portfolio\" companies  of Alphabet and the people leading them\n\nhttp://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d3784880834f3c40498dd4e2e881710b?convert_to_webp=true\n\nUnknown: Deepmind, led by Demis Hassabis\n\nLooks like moonshots such as Project Loon and the self driving car are under GoogleX for now. Maybe, they will be spun out as separate companies once they are ready for commercial launch.\n  \n380,575 views • 6,352 upvotes • Written 9d ago\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cu7pr0z","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-08-19 02:44:53","week":34}

Complete idiots sell on Amazon.  Why would you hand that job to someone else?  \n\nIf you're like me and you live in a small town, this could be a great start to getting into the business.  Hell, I had no idea how to build a webpage, I took a job building two for $500 apiece, them fully understanding that I was interested in learning this and that they were getting a spectacular deal (compared to the 5-10 grand offers they had gotten) and that they could veto the site and pay nothing.  The experience not only gave me a portfolio, but allowed me to confidently build sites that can rival the expensive ones.  \n\nWhat's so hard about maintaining a Facebook presence and contacting former Amazon buyers and offering a discount if they would leave an honest review...or just making 10 accounts and reviewing the item yourself? (we know they all do it.)\n\nWhen it comes to optimizing product description, you can learn that just by observing.  \n\nBottom line is, if this is along your aspirations when it comes to what you want to do, jump on the chance, thank them for the opportunity, and make it clear that you'll have to research it.  If they're wanting a monthly or daily thing, tell them to give you a week to study, and then use the week to learn everything you can about what you need for the job.\n\nI've always been a techie guy, and people just pay me to fix their shit, but it's not uncommon for me to have to learn to do what I need to do for one of my customers.

If your widget has a lot closed and not that many currently active, look at how quickly the are selling.

For example: if 200 of your widget closed RECENTLY at a good price and there are only 10-15 active. Dont try to be the bottom price. Price midrange.

Once you have your content built for your pitch, you can post them on all social channels as well.

If I were you, I would be looking for 10 - 15 solid \"yeses\" through this process.  Meaning if you had the stock, they would buy right now.\nMy recommendation would be to systemize the process.  Document the questions you are asking and the responses you uncover.  Create a couple different formats of your pitch, asking the same basic questions.

I find myself always worrying about money ever since I graduated college and left home and moved across the state a year ago.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; A little background first (I will make things as simplistic as possible). Currently a 24yo Male. Good job with a little over a year in. Four year BA in Criminal Justice. Lived in New York all my life. Moved to Arizona day after graduation for job. No family or real “friends” out here other than co-workers.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Left college with 28K in student loans (federal). After college I found out my mother opened up a credit card in her name and my name to “build me credit” and never told me. Ended up being 3k in debt on a 5k limit (Chase Freedom). I had my own credit card from an electronic purchase when I started college and didn’t use it wisely after that. I still have about 2k on that with a 3k limit (Barclaycard US). Left college with about 5k in savings and 2k in checking. It was just enough to start a life in Arizona with rent, start up utilities and deposits. When I left college I had a credit score (Credit Karma) of 700. My monthly rent is $600. Utilities (Cable, Water, Electric, Gas, Internet) is about ~$300. I purchased a vehicle (new, I know – big mistake) in September of 2014 for 24k. Because I was not in a job for a full year, my father needed to cosign with me. My interest is 3.75%. I pay $330 a month ($30 is due to a stupid fee incase the cosigner – my father – dies then the loan is forgiven).   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Now we are in present time. My credit score has went far down to 660 (but a recent fico report read 620?) and some credit cards have went up. Chase – 4k/5k. Barclaycard - 2.5K/3K. Vehicle Loan – 20K. And a new Amazon card $800/3.5K. My current money situation is around 4k in savings, 1k in checking, and some cash stored away. I make about $1,600 every two weeks (some pay periods about 2k). Now, I tried going from my small town Credit Union to a new Credit Union – PenFed. They have great rates that can beat what I have now if I refinance my vehicle through them. So I started the process. Opened up a checking account and savings account. But it told me I have been declined any credit through them (I could be wrong but if anyone wants to help me more please help – just got the info today – I am very new at this stuff). So now I am kind of in a rough spot. I want to trade in my vehicle because I am young, and what young stud does not want a muscle car. I took my vehicle to the dealership and can only get 15k out of it. Also, I noticed on my credit report something that was sent to collections from a hospital visit (went to them last week and they said they never had correct info from me and would take 30 days to get rid of it from the report and they are “sorry”).   \n&gt;   \n&gt; So that is about it, I worry about money every day and I know I shouldn’t do that. It causes a lot of stress. Its hard for me to make this change because my parents always try to give me money but I never took anything from them nor will I – It just does not feel right to me. I like to go out a lot and have been cutting back on that stuff, but I am still adjusting.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; What is the best way for me to:   \n&gt;   \n&gt; 1. Get these credit cards down   \n&gt; 2. Get my credit score up   \n&gt; 3. Trade my vehicle (I know it may not be smart but this is a goal)   \n&gt; 4. Be financially stable (I do not think I am right now)\n&gt;   \n&gt; If people actually care to help me (which would be awesome!) then I can go into more detail if needed. I will also answer any questions you may have to help me get my life together! Thanks all!  \n&gt;\n\n----\n\n^(I am a bot.

I eat very healthily and am very active (running, powerlifting, hiking) and I haven't noticed any change in performance on Soylent. It has all the vitamin, minerals, and amino acids you need, which you won't get from relying heavily on any one food as others here are suggesting. (I tried eating mostly rice, lentils, and vegetables for a week and started feeling terrible. Turned out I wasn't getting enough methionine -- who knew?)\n\nHowever, Soylent is more expensive than anything you'll cook for yourself. When I had less money and more time, I relied heavily on an Indian cookbook that taught me how to make delicious, easy meals out of rice, lentils, and chickpeas, which are all super cheap. I'm a fan of Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save. I recommend learning to cook some easy meals. It may take a lot of time at first, and you may make a lot of meals you don't like, but the effort pays off in the long run.\n\nHere are some highlights from a spreadsheet I keep on the macronutrients in the food I buy. Keep in mind that these are the cheapest options from several local stores, so you would probably pay more if you do manage to get to a grocery store.\n\n**Soylent: $0.50 per 100 calories**\n\nTypical loaf of bread: $0.20 per 100 calories\n\nPeanut butter: $0.11 per 100 calories\n\n**Oatmeal: $0.10 per 100 calories**\n\nTypical cereal: $0.20 per 100 calories\n\nBananas: $0.15 per 100 calories\n\nTypical non-berry fruit: $0.67 per 100 calories\n\nNuts: $0.50 per 100 calories\n\nEggs: $0.20 per 100 calories (historically, higher now)\n\nTofu: $0.23 per 100 calories\n\nBuilder bar: $0.42 per 100 calories\n\n**On-sale pasta: $0.04 per 100 calories**\n\nTypical pasta: $0.09 per 100 calories\n\n**Brown rice from Amazon: $0.07 per 100 calories**\n\n**Lentils from Amazon: $0.09 per 100 calories**\n\n**Canned chickpeas from Amazon: $0.27 per 100 calories**\n\nTypical vegetable: $1 per 100 calories, varies widely\n\nStore bagel: $0.37 per 100 calories\n\nIHOP meal: $1.20 per 100 calories\n\nMeal almost anywhere else in Cambridge, MA: &gt; $1.25 per 100 calories\n\nFrozen meal from Trader Joe's: $0.50 - $0.75 per 100 calories","name":"t1_cu9h7yy","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-20 16:17:20","week":34}

Bought it, installed it.\n\nThen my electric company found out and threw a hissy fit.  Tankless heaters create a higher \"Demand\" at a given moment.  In other words, they save a lot of energy over time but they use a lot of energy in the now.\n\nThis technically isn't a big deal except that electric companies wire to residences under the assumption \"Neighborhood A has this many houses and will probably average X amount of KWH so we'll install power lines that can handle X.\"\n\nThe electric company essentially threatened to turn off my meter if I didn't install a tank or pay to have my whole neighborhood upgraded to handle my new \"demand.\"\n\nMoral of the story: Don't tell your electric company, you'll be fine. Pick whichever one matches your needs.  Check out the EcoSmart line on Amazon. \n\nEdit: The system I bought uses 7KWH at full strength.  That is only slightly higher than a tank heater filling up after a shower.

People get confused about this sometimes (*and manufacturers like to put little threatening sounding labels like that on there*) but once that product is bought/sold and you legally own it you can sell it to whoever the hell you want and you aren't breaking any laws.\n\nNow, the problem that can come into play is when retailers/wholesales/manufacturers agree not to carry a product that was SKU'd for Store A (Walmart in this Example) at Store B (Amazon). You'd normally never see this in IRL retailing except places like Marshall's which basically built their whole business on selling remainders from others but you do online. \n\nYou know how much Amazon gives a fuck? They don't. Especially when it comes to Walmart. It's their #1 retailing competitor.

{"id":"cu9y806","author":"jguser1","body":"There's a lot of mixed advice here, so let me just say what my experience has been having owned two (First one's heat exchanger froze, so replaced with a newer model with freeze protection).\n\nGo gas and not electric, as often the electric models require such a massive electrical draw they may require an upgrade to your electric to handle and are also more expensive to operate, if you can even find one sized large enough to heat water for a house. \n\nI hired a plumber to move the water lines, and install the larger gas line for the first tankless I purchased, but I hung it on the wall and installed the venting. That model required stainless venting, but I don't recall what class it was. I paid about $1200 for the heater, and probably another $1,300 for the plumber. My only problem with that Bosch model was that you'd get cold water if you didn't run the hot water consistently (like when doing dishes and the water is off/on/off/on). \n\nThe heater exchanger on that one froze in the middle of a WI winter, so I replaced it with a top-of-the-line Rinnai (bought from Amazon), which included an air intake surrounding the exhaust. I did all my own plumbing for this one, and also installed a 3 gallon tank water-heater right after this unit to prevent the cold water sandwich I had on the old one. Gas company adjusted the gas line and did the hook up for about $100. \n\nI love having a tankless, although I doubt I'm saving much money by having it. The benefits are back to back to back showers any time of the day, with no waiting. The unit is large enough to support multiple taps being open, or multiple showers going on. I have limited space in my basement, and this thing just hangs on the wall taking up a limited amount of space. I've heard having a high end tank water heater can replicate a tankless's ongoing hot water, to a certain extent, and that's definitely a much cheaper option. \n\nThe Rinnai model I have requires specific PVC vent material, which is larger than what your existing water heater has most likely. I had to run a special condensate line too, which wasn't hard, and comes out of the bottom of the heater and runs to a drain.\n\nI wanted the most efficiency and the highest capacity, so I went top of the line. It was only a few hundred dollars more compared to other models from Rinnai, so I figured I'd make the investment up front.","name":"t1_cu9y806","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-08-20 23:24:31","week":34}

{"id":"cuav11z","author":"Lyle_the_Crocodile","body":"1) A lot of estate sales are basically just mobile antique stores. They don't exist to provide us income, they exist to maximize their profits. Most of the time, they do this extremely well. Show up at the end of the day on a Sunday, and look around. Most things (even the things that you think were overpriced) are gone in most cases. There are some estate sale companies that overprice and never sell anything, but those don't last long. They aren't subsidized by endless donations like Goodwill or Salvation army... they have to sell or perish. Many people buy things at estate sales for close to, or more than FMV.\n\n2) If you were confident that no one was going to buy it at $500, you shouldn't have needed to hide it. Sellers on here complain non-stop about shitty eBay/Amazon buyers, and buyers who think they can game the system because they think they're special snowflakes. That's you now. You're attempting to scam this mom and pop company out of $400. Remember this when you get your first bogus return.\n\n3) $500 is a reasonable price for that item. On Amazon, it's $579. If I was in the market for it, and I saw it in the ad, I would have gone and bought one at an estate sale rather than ship one for amazon. If I was going to haggle on the first day of a sale, I'd offer maybe $400. This is all from the perspective of someone who wants to USE it and not sell it. There's nothing wrong with offering $100, but if I were you, I'd be more tactful about it. First day haggling doesn't usually work at estate sales, unless you're buying a massive amount of stuff.\n\n4) As a rule of thumb, the best two times I've found to go to an estate sale are exactly when they open (you're more likely to find mispriced stuff before anyone else), or later in the day on the last day when they're trying to get everything out of the house (they're more likely to bargain with you).

You can set it to \"Search on Not Found\" or \"Search on Buy\". I usually have it set to Search on Not Found, because waiting for it to load on Buy slows me down.

I usually find that if it isn't in the database, it isn't on Amazon either. So I don't have a compelling need for the unlimited plan.\n\nIt's important to note that *research* is not included in your live search number. For instance if I'm looking at an item and it's not showing any FBA sellers, and I think that's bogus, then I can click the FBA column and it will take me to the FBA-third-party sellers. This doesn't count against my live search, and if I'm taking my time, I do this a lot.

{"id":"cub3g3z","author":"tinkersdamn","body":"Yes your understanding is correct but the example you've shown has other implications.\n\nskyvo direct \"owns\" the buy box, but another FBA seller can take it. Only Amazon gets undisputed ownership of the buy box. This means that whenever Amazon isn't in play, the buy box is up for grabs (and you'll have to look up what the current strategies for getting the buy box are; I'm not up on them). This means that YOU could be grabbing 90% of the sales.\n\nSecondly, skyvo-direct only has ONE of this ridiculous CD, so as soon as it sells, the buy-box will ALSO be up for grabs. You don't even have to fight for it!\n\nThirdly, because you have no other FBA competition, if the salesrank is good enough (ie, you expect it to move rather quickly) you can price very aggressively. I find that FBA buyers are fairly price insensitive, so I'd probably price it at $28 or more. \n\nI'm not familiar with the CD market, but I know I can definitely do this for books-- they can be selling for a penny, but if I have no FBA competition, I'm pricing at 29.99. What I do is set up my repricer so that if it hasn't sold after 3-6months, then I gradually start stepping down the price.

There's spare bedrooms, lots of bathrooms, a huge kitchen, game room, big backyard with a lake plus small dock and the house is set up for events like these with an additional lot for parking.

Hashtag for people posting on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook will be posted in nice big letters. \n\n\nFamily members have chipped in here and there to help with some stuff and we're saving most of our budget for the Honeymoon in Kauai. We also set up a Honeyfund account to help with that in lieu of presents. We've been living together for 10 years and really really don't need any stuff. Just having a fun, memorable night with the most important people in our life is the main point.

{"id":"cub74e8","author":"lachrymoseqq","body":"In my opinion, the easiest way to cut down on the cost of the wedding is to invite fewer people. Our wedding was only 8 people plus the two of us. We invited our immediate family only - parents, siblings, and siblings' SOs. We had a separate wedding shower with extended relatives, and we celebrated with friends separately as well (barbecue in the backyard). Personally, mixing family and friends wouldn't have been all that much fun anyway... \n\nOther ways we cut back: bought a used wedding dress, used a suit that I already had instead of renting a tux, had the wedding party take photos, didn't have live music, had my wife's father make the floral arrangements/bouquet, ate in the venue's restaurant during their normal hours instead of a private plated dinner or buffet, got gourmet cupcakes instead of an actual wedding cake, and I got a cool but inexpensive tungsten groom ring on Amazon. It also helped that we had my great grandmother's ring, which my wife was really pleased with after a $30 rhodium dip. \n\nI don't regret any of it for one second. Everything was perfect, and the wedding cost under $3k total. An added benefit of a low-budget wedding is that if not everything goes perfectly, it's not like you spent the equivalent of a down payment on a house. This translates into an overall low-stress event, which is much different than a lot of the high-budget weddings I've been to. It's painful to see someone drop 5 figures on a single-day event when they don't even seem to be enjoying it.

{"id":"cubay4g","author":"wanmoar","body":"You'd think someone like you, that purports to be in the industry would know but okay.\n\n1. Scarcity of listings for a desired industry or investing thesis. Example: want a pure play on electric cars, there's only 1 stock, Tesla, a bet on eye wear and opticals? 1 company, Luxxotica, Canadian finance? 7 stocks. Chip makers? Only 2 now. E-commerce? Amazon and not much else\n\n2. Regulated Monopolies and Oligopolies: companies in an industry that has its profits regulated but is also a monopoly/oligopoly will attract a premium because of the downside protection even though that won't show in the beta. Examples include banking and insurance in Canada\n\n3. Lots of money floating around: spare capital must be put to work, the investment funds that can justify (or can legally hold) excess cash are few and far in between. Say you have an economy where savings rise faster than or at the cost of consumption, earnings power for companies would remain the same but investment managers would have more money to invest. By default, more money would flow to all assets and separate price from value. If you think this is an improbably scenario, you should know that this is exactly what has been happening in the US since 2008. Incomes have been rising/recovering but consumption per capita has not followed the rise. People are, for the first time, choosing to save and invest proportionally more than before\n\n4. Need for income and safety. Flight to safety is a known and common reason for why some stocks hold value or attract a premium. It's why consumer defensive stocks have managed to do so well recently, it's why Costco trades at a premium and why wal-marts price moves will always stray from the moves in its earnings.","name":"t1_cubay4g","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-08-22 02:28:02","week":34}

You don't need a PP account at all, and if you have some kind of problem with the merchant, you do a chargeback on your CC just like any other site.  If anything, this should be *preferable* to other sites because the merchant isn't handling your credit card information at all.

{"id":"cucpnd1","author":"szabohaslam","body":"I'm a designer, based in Sheffield. I'm currently on my fourth campaign (Citee map t-shirts if you're interested: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/szabohaslam/citee-fashion-city-maps-printed-on-t-shirts). All of my projects are print-based, so I can only cover what's worked for me in my area of interest.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCompared to some Kickstarter projects I've seen, mine are only modestly successful - but I'm more than happy with what I've achieved. My first two projects were supported by a little coverage from a handful of supportive bloggers, but none of my projects went viral - and I've never paid for an advert. About 75% of the funds to my latest project have come from the network I've built - it's only been on one blog so far. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI'll start a thread on this once I have enough comment karma, but for now I'll cover a few essential pointers.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Have a good product or service.**\n...that people want. It sounds obvious, but Kickstarter is awash with failed campaigns - some of which I can't tell who the product is meant for.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Tell a story.**\nIt's not enough to have a good product. You need to make it personal. Who are you? What are your skills and experience? How did you come up with the idea? Why do people need this? Why should we trust you? People like to know what they're investing in and, if you can engage with them at an emotional level, you stand a good chance of succeeding.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Build and maintain your network.**\nYou don't necessarily need 60k followers on Twitter, just a few supportive people who will lend a hand. Reach out to journalists who you think will be interested (do your research), and be nice to them - they're doing you a favour by covering your project. Talk to people who engage with your campaign and thank everyone who shares it. If you get a lot of sales leading from a blog, offer them something in return (maybe write an exclusive article or send them a gift). If you find you have repeat backers, reward them with something. Show people that you're grateful for their support, and they're much more likely to come back in future.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Find a champion.**\nI was incredibly lucky with my first project: two prominent musicians liked what I was doing and shared my project across their networks - reaching exactly the sort of people I needed. Your champion could be a journalist or a niche blogger; they'll add credibility to your campaign and help reach your audience.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Listen to your audience.**\nEven the difficult ones. ESPECIALLY the difficult ones. Sometimes you can stumble across a great idea for an additional reward to your campaign, or correct a mistake in your pitch, if you open dialogue with backers.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSuggestions on price can be tricky. You need to make sure your prices are competitive, but don't enter into a race to the bottom: there will always be someone willing to sell products cheaper. You can't compete toe-to-toe with Amazon or Society 6, so don't even try. If people like your product and your story, they will support you; if not, they will go somewhere else. That's life.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Don't worry about haters.**\nYou can't please everyone (nor should you try to). If someone mails to inform you your work is rubbish (I've had this more than once), politely thank them and move on. If someone tells you they've seen something similar on Amazon at a cheaper price, encourage them to buy it - and move on. Don't waste time engaging people who are only interested in arguing with you.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Post updates.**\nThis builds trust, which is important if you experience delays during fulfillment. If you plan on running more than one campaign, you have to make sure you build a good reputation: I've been pretty shocked by some creators who don't fulfill rewards for several months, but won't offer a refund or explanation. If you want to build trust, don't be that guy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy third campaign had a protracted series of issues that began when a supplier ran out of stock. That held up my printer, which in turn held up my box manufacturer, and before long I was a few weeks behind schedule. I would've had a lot of angry people if I hadn't kept everyone informed. Some backers asked for refunds, which I wasn't obliged to give - but I granted without question; the delays weren't my fault, but I felt keeping people happy was more important than keeping their money. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**What I would do differently.**\nLots of things! My experience with bloggers and journalists has been mixed: I don't know whether my emails aren't pitched correctly, or whether most people simply aren't interested - most don't reply so I've no way of knowing.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo far I haven't taken out any adverts, mainly because I can't afford them. I have a feeling a well-placed ad would go a long way, but it's risky: if it doesn't work, my profits are diminished (or completely wiped out). I'd love to hear from anyone who had some success on this point.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFeel free to ask anything.

Just have to underlist your item's condition, make sure all original accessories are there, and the item is working. \n\nLike you said, all it takes is a customer claiming something is counterfit or used when the item is supposed to be new for you to get a policy violation, with no proof required from the customer. It's a pretty big flaw within Amazon, but there's not much we as sellers can do about it right now. \n\nJust keep running your business as clean as possibly and maybe layoff the \"second hand\" sources for a while and only sell new in box items.
