{"id":"3oekoj","author":"Ctrap33","body":"I recently came up with what I thought was an original idea for a product for use in a home kitchen.  This product is a kitchen tool that is pretty simple as it performs only one task.\n\nHowever, today when doing research, I came across the exact product that I was thinking of buried on the back pages of Amazon.  Initially discouraged, I am still thinking of pursuing it by improving the existing product.  At the very least, I now know that a market exists for my product.\n\nThe existing product has generally negative reviews because the tool requires an extra time consuming setup step (5+ minutes) before it can be effectively used.  Thus, it is more or less useless as there are other tools that accomplish the desired task much more quickly.\n\nThe goal I wish to achieve, therefore, is to improve this product by designing it such that it eliminates this existing time consuming step.  I believe I could improve this product by changing a few materials and critical dimensions.  Thus, my new tool would reduce the desired task length from 5+ minutes to under 10 seconds.\n\nMy concerns with this endeavor relate to patent infringement.  Particularly, I am not sure whether the small changes I make would be sufficient enough to classify this new tool as an improvement to the existing product.  I would image so, but I just don't know.\n\nI am therefore seeking advice, hopefully from someone who has tackled a similar endeavor, on improving an existing product.  I can find many articles about creating and patenting a new product, but none that I find adequately address the specific problems encountered when improving an existing product.  Any helpful articles, advice, or warnings are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.","name":"t3_3oekoj","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-12 04:33:29","week":42}

{"id":"3oezq1","author":"sham_shoe","body":"I have too much Amazon credit already, so I decided to test the award ticket refund method to see if it was working again. Good news: airline credit from Amex and refunds from United have both posted for me for an upgraded award ticket with close-in fee that I booked and canceled on the same day on 10/7.\n\nThere are slight variations depending on which airline you choose; I chose United. Dig through FT for data points if you're looking to do this with other airlines. If you're not familiar with the method, it looks like this:\n\n1. Book a one way United award flight less than two weeks out. Incur a $75 close-in fee on top of regular ticketing fee of $5.60. Select a seat upgrade of choice for an additional seat upgrade fee.\n2. Wait until you receive a confirmation code.\n3. Observe fees listed separately in pending status on card transaction log.\n4. Cancel within 24 hours of booking. Check to make sure every fee gets refunded, as well as the award miles.\n5. Wait a couple of days for fees to post.\n6. Wait a couple of days for Amex airline credit to post.\n7. Wait a couple of days for United refunds to post.\n\nEnd result converts the airline credit into straight statement credit, without restricting the amount to MPX or United Gift Registry. One caveat is that United doesn't always automatically refund every single fee, so you will potentially need to call in and convince them to honor their [policy](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/reservations/refunds/refund.aspx#tabs-4) on Booking Service Fees:\n&gt;Reservation booking service fees and close-in booking fees for award tickets are refundable only if you cancel your reservation within 24 hours of purchase. If you have purchased a ticket from United in the last 24 hours, go to Manage Reservations to cancel your reservation or contact the United Customer Contact Center for assistance.\n\nCheers.\n\nTL:DR; get Amex airline credit as statement credit by posting and refunding refundable incidental fees.\n","name":"t3_3oezq1","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-10-12 06:53:30","week":42}

So over the course of last summer, I proceeded to max both my card and PpC out ($1500 total), slowly started paying those down.\n\nIn August 2013, I attended college for three weeks before dropping out (papers and everything), but the college said I didn't drop, so lo and behold, another $820 to worry about. Even though I had proof, they wouldn't wipe that and I ended up having it sent to the Attorney General earlier this year.\n\nIn February of this year, I also got three accounts via Chase: checking, savings, and their Amazon card. But at the same time, I also opened an Amazon Store Card. By August I was nearing $5000 in debt. Not good for a minimum wage employee.\n\nI got a $4000 loan from my current bank, paid off both Amazons, the college debt, and my little credit card, and am whittling down Paypal Credit's balance as we speak while building a safety net for a return to college.

{"id":"3ombq6","author":"zai614","body":"Let's say I want to buy $25 worth of food from Taco Bell. I'm trying to figure out which way would save me the most money (so which cash back would give me the best discount). Here are the three scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. I use Blue Cash Preferred by AmEx at a supermarket like Kroger and get a $25 TB gift card get 6% cash back but there's also 6% tax (Kentucky Sales Tax). | Total Spent 25+sales tax (which would be 1.5) = $26.5. | Total Cash back = 25x6% = $1.5 | Final Total = 26.5 - 1.5 = $25 (Total Spent - Total Cash Back. So this is how much i technically spent) | ***Unsure of this, but if i go to taco bell and lets say use all $25 in the TB gift card (before tax) would i technically be spending the $25 gift card + sales tax? (which would make my Final Total 26.5)\n\n\n\n2. I use Chase Freedom which has 5% for Amazon purchases this quarter so I buy a $25 Taco Bell gift card from there. (I believe there is no sales tax for these) | Total spent $25 | Total cash back = 25x5% = $1.25 | Final Total = 25 - 1.25 = $23.75 | ***Same with this scenario, I use all $25 in the TB gift card (before tax) and spend $25 gift card + sales tax (which would make this Final Total 23.75 + 1.25 = $25)\n\n\n\n3. I go straight to Taco Bell and buy $25 worth of food with Chase Freedom (so the regular 1% cash back)  | Total spend $25 + sales tax (1.5) = $26.5 | Total Cash back = 25x1% = $0.25 | Final Total = 26.5 - 0.25 = $26.25\n\n\nI was trying to do some critical thinking during my lunch break so i hope all that made sense. But if my calculations are correct, would using Chase Freedom for a $25 gift card from Amazon be the best option in terms of saving the most money? (at least for this quarter)\n\nEdit: wasn't aware gift cards aren't taxed thanks for letting me know. But i guess that changes everything.\n\n1. With Blue Cash Preferred (6% cash back at Kroger) | Total Spent = $25 | Total Cash Back = $1.5 | Final Total Spent = 25 - 1.5 = $23.50\n\n\n2. With Amazon (5% Cash Back with Chase Freedom this quarter) | Total Spent = $25 | Total Cash Back = 1.25 | Final Total Spent = 25 - 1.25 = $23.75\n\n\n3. Straight from Taco Bell (1% cash back with Chase Freedom) | Total Spent = $25  | Total Cash Back = $0.25 | Final Total Spent = 25 - 0.25 = $24.75\n\n","name":"t3_3ombq6","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-10-13 20:46:24","week":42}

I'm primarily considering two different options - although both are pretty vague, however, I will definitely consider any other ideas (if anyone has any).\n\nThe first option, is, as annoying as they are, creating a similar site to \"Buzzfeed\", \"uni lad\" etc. The biggest issue with this is getting the initial (first 10k or so) followers on facebook - would £500 even be enough to cover this?\n\nThe second option is jumping on the Amazon bandwagon, although similarly to above, is £500 enough. Another potential issue is that I'd be looking to do it in the UK (with the market being far lower than the US), and the initial time frame required (to get products shipped from China etc.) is greater than the first option.\n\nWhich option would you lean towards?

{"id":"3oqxzr","author":"treeunit","body":"Source: https://www.lucidpress.com/blog/2015/08/27/5-growth-principles-small-businesses-can-steal-from-startups/\n\n\"A startup is a company designed to grow fast,\" says longtime startup guru and investor Paul Graham. Growth is the one thing that sets a startup apart from any other company in the world. But that doesn't mean that startups are the only companies that can grow at a rapid pace.\n\nBecause startups are hyper-focused on growth, SMBs can learn a lot from them. Try applying these 5 growth principles to start seeing more rapid growth.\n\n\n**1. Incentivize sharing**\n\n70% of people trust brand recommendations from their friends, but only 10% trust advertising. That means that people talking about your business is 7x more impactful than any advertising your company is doing. So how do you get people sharing your brand with their friends? People won't share your brand out of the goodness of their hearts. There is always a reason or an incentive for them to share. You'll have to get creative with how you want to incentivize your customers, but let's see how it's done in the startup world.\n\nRobinhood is a startup that allows you to trade stock for free on their online platform. They had 500,000 people sign up to use their product before they even launched because they offered early access to the app for people who got their friends to sign up too.\n\nYou're probably familiar with Dropbox, a service that stores your files online and allows for easy sharing. They offered .5 GB of free storage for every friend that signs up based on your recommendation. It's tactics like this that have helped Dropbox achieve a $4 billion valuation.\n\nHere's another example: Square Cash, an app that makes it easy to pay your friends, gives $5 to you and to a friend when they try the app.\n\nI recommend that you think about services or good that your business is uniquely positioned to offer. The offer should be attractive enough that people will take you up on it, but not so generous that you'll be losing money in the long run.\n\n**2. Act big**\n\nIf your business is online, you can act bigger than you really are and attract more customers. If you act like a big deal, people will treat you like a big deal. Fake it till you make it? Yeah, it's a real thing.\n\nYou can spend relatively small amounts of money to look just as big as (or bigger than) your competitors. Think extremely well-designed website, professional packaging, invoices, etc. Future customers who visit your website don't know how big you are, and won't have any reason to doubt that you are big and important.\n\nTake a look at what the websites of even the smallest startups (2 - 6 employees) look like:\n\n[piapp.co](https://piapp.co/)\n\n[inkodye.com](http://www.inkodye.com)\n\n[seed.co](https://seed.co/)\n\nOne caveat: Successful is a great look for small businesses. Arrogant and distant is not. In your quest to look big, don't forget the importance of maintaining connections, delighting your customers, and apologizing when you screw up.\n\n**3. Progress indefinitely**\n\nThe world is constantly changing, and so are all of the world's successful businesses. It's easy to stick with what you know best, but small pivots in your business model can mean big growth.\n\nOne company that wasn't afraid to act on new insights? Amazon.\n\nAmazon started out as an online book store, expanded to books and music, and then eventually became the global e-commerce giant they are now, selling everything under the sun.\n\nAnother example is Buffer, whose blog has been insanely successful at generating traffic over the last few years. But just last week, they [announced that they're changing the direction of the blog](https://blog.bufferapp.com/pivot). Tampering with your recipe for success can be terrifying. However, if you've done your research and you're acting on sound principles, don't be afraid to try something new. It just might be the next big thing.\n\n**4. Appeal visually**\n\nNowadays, people like (pretty) pictures more than words. It's true that there is more visual content online now than ever before, but it's easy to forget that this trend is likely the result of changing consumer behavior.\n\nBecause people are increasingly sensitive to visual content, you can appeal to more people, (and thus grow faster) if you put an appropriate focus on compelling visuals. Brands that have visual appeal, that create visually appealing content, will appeal to more paying customers.\n\nTo understand the visual message that your brand is sending, find out what type of feelings your customers associate with your brand. You can do this with an in-person focus group or an online survey (we love Qualaroo for on-site mini-surveys). Once you understand how people outside of your office perceive your brand, you'll know how to invest in additional visual content.\n\n**5. Utilize disruptive technology**\n\nGain a competitive edge by using better technology than your competitors. Like every competitive startup that uses disruptive technology to solve their problems, you can too. There's no shortage of ever-progressing business tools to help you work smarter, faster, and cheaper.\n\nSo how do you find disruptive technology to turbocharge your business?\n\nSearch for lesser-known startups that solve your problem on [Angel List](http://www.angel.co). See if anyone else has answers on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/).\n\nRecently I was feeling very unsatisfied with traditional e-commerce shipping solutions, so I searched shipping startups on Angel List. In moments, I found tons of useful services like [Shippo](Shippo).\n\nI hope this post has inspired you to break out of the small business mindset. Technology is your friend, and startups are great at utilizing tech to grow their businesses. Follow in their footsteps and sure you're sure to discover great things!","name":"t3_3oqxzr","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-14 19:36:25","week":42}
{"id":"3ordqi","author":"Im_Fine_And_You","body":"Glove guy update: I got some **solid** advice from my fellow redditors about how to start selling the work gloves that I have. It’s not sexy like a lot of new startups, but with the potential margins being basically 100% profit I am determined to sell these gloves if it’s the last thing I do.\n\nHere is what I have done so far. I have not made a sale yet, but I am learning a lot about what it *really* takes to make money in ecommerce. \n\n**WEBSITE**\n\n- First I built a [website](http://bulk-work-gloves.myshopify.com) using Shopify. This generated small traffic after I posted a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3muy7h/i_have_a_large_surplus_of_work_gloves_that_i_want/) here on /r/entrepreneur, but the shelf life of that traffic died down steadily after a week as was to be expected.\n\n**AMAZON**\n\n- Next up I decided to list the gloves on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s?marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;me=A1E5WLEHKK0FPH&amp;merchant=A1E5WLEHKK0FPH&amp;redirect=true). Most of the gloves did not have a UPC code, so I used the “sell yours” feature on Amazon to avoid buying UPC codes, and I was able to get most of the gloves listed this way.\n\n- Our store has been live for about a week. We have the cheapest prices (because I checked) and I have not made a sale yet, but I understand that the particular market is saturated so I am trying to be patient.  \n\n**OUTREACH**\n\n- Among different suggestions /u/BomberR6 suggested that I reach out to jails / correctional institutions. It took me some time to psych myself up to make the cold call, but I ended up speaking with 22 correctional facilities in my state. I got the okay to send a digital catalog to 9 of those recipients, but have not heard back from any of them yet. **TL;DR jails have state contracts that dictate who they can buy what from making it pretty hard to get a foot in the door.**\n\n- After this, I polished up my pitch after and have sent about 100-125 emails to potential buyers (mostly non-profit, community-based organizations) in my area like: river cleanup crews, homeless shelters, humane societies, and community garden projects. \n\n- I have 15 prospective buyers I am in conversation with via email currently.\n\n**FLYERS**\n\n- We have an eBay store that has done well for itself over the years in certain categories (work gloves not being on of them) so as of next week we will be including a postcard size [flyer](http://i62.tinypic.com/2r3l46r.jpg) in our outgoing packages to drive traffic to our glove website, which has essentially become my side hustle.\n\nTL;DR Trying to sell something that isn't sexy isn't easy, but there's money to be made so I am going to keep trying.","name":"t3_3ordqi","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-14 21:18:57","week":42}

{"id":"3ou587","author":"fieryred29","body":"It's been awhile since anyone has posted a good rundown of the top rewards cards to this sub, so I attempted to put one together: (http://imgur.com/fr4yoE5).  (NOTE: this was previously written as a blog post, but /r/personalfinance doesn't allow linking to blogs so I'm posting as all text here to spark discussion.)\n\n---\nEven though credit card rewards have been improving since they were scaled back in the wake of the financial crisis and 2009 CARD act, not all rewards programs are created equal.  In this roundup, I take a look at nine of the most popular rewards cards on the market in 2015.  I used various blog posts as backup to calculate a value for non-cash rewards and I added in the cost of the annual fee (up to $95 in some cases) to calculate an effective rewards rate for varying levels of annual spending, which I use to rank the cards.  One notable exception: I didn't take into account signup bonuses for the various cards.  Although these bonuses can be significant and are a focal point for some card rewards enthusiasts such as the members of [/r/churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning), when evaluating a card's long term potential these one-time perks usually don't need to be part of the equation.\n\n\nBecause cards now offer such widely varying cashback levels for different spending categories, I looked up the most recent [Department of Labor data](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm) for average household expenditures by category and picked out the categories where I thought consumers were most likely to use cards, coming up with an annual spend amount of about $24k for the average \"mass market\" cardholder.  I added a multiplier to categories where I felt a higher-spending demographic would have an increased spend, such as 1.3x for general spending, 2x for retail, 3x for restaurants and 4x for travel, while cutting gas expenses in half since these cardholders can likely afford to live closer to their jobs.  This worked out to about $40k per year for so called \"mass affluent\" cardholders.  Finally, I doubled all mass affluent assumptions to get to a roughly $80k per year spend for an \"affluent\" demographic.\n\n\nNow, the results.  To cut to the chase (or should I say Citi), the overall best card in the roundup was the Citi Double Cash card.  It earns an effective 2% cash back on all categories without restriction or annual fee, which gives it the top ranking in terms of effective rewards rate across all demographic bands.  The rest of the cards in the roundup earn between 1.02% and 1.93% cash back depending on your annual spending level.  Interesting takeaways include the fact that often-overlooked annual fees make a big difference, and individual categories with high rewards rates rarely amount to much when you consider the fact that those high rate categories typically only represent a small portion of the annual card spend for an average consumer.  \n\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred card's increased rewards rates of 2.50% cash back on restaurants &amp; travel and 1.25% on everything else (if you redeem your points for travel rewards through Chase) makes it look like one of the best in the roundup until you take into account the $95 annual fee and the typical spending mix, which drops the effective rewards rate down to a measly 1.02% for mass market cardholders.  Even with a much higher level of spending like $80k/year, the effective rewards rate is still only 1.47%.\n\n\nWith the Amex Blue Cash Preferred card you’re getting 6% cash back on groceries, but the average American household only spends 17% of their budget on groceries ($4094/year).  If you buy food from non-grocery retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or convenience stores (not to mention eating out in restaurants), none of it is eligible for the higher cashback rate.  Even if you think the card makes sense for you because you buy a lot of groceries exclusively from grocery-only stores, Amex has conveniently capped the category limit at $6,000/year.  For mass market cardholders, you’re looking at a total of 2.09% cash back on $23,488 in total spending and when you consider the fact that the card has a $75 annual fee, the effective rewards rate drops to 1.77%.\n\n\nIn sum, the best card in the roundup is the Citi Double Cash card.  Its 2% cash back on all categories without restriction or annual fee gives it the top spot in terms of effective rewards rate across all spending levels.  The card isn't without some caveats though, as you first earn 1% cash back when each billing cycle hits, and then another 1% cash back when you actually pay the bill.  The Fidelity Amex is a close second.  Although its cashback rate of 2% is equal to the Citi Double Cash card, the fact that it requires a Fidelity account and Amex is less widely accepted than MasterCard puts it slightly below the Citi card.\n\n\nRankings for individual cards (by effective rewards rate for cardholders who spend $24k/year): \n\n    1. Citi Double Cash\n    2. Fidelity Investment Rewards Amex\n    3. Amex Blue Cash Preferred\n    4. Capital One Venture Rewards\n    5. Sam's Club MasterCard\n    6. Amex SPG\n    7. Capital One Quicksilver\n    8. Chase Freedom\n    9. Chase Sapphire Preferred\n\n\nI wanted to rank the cards independently, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that a mix &amp; match strategy can be used to get even greater rewards.  For example, using the Amex Blue Cash Preferred to get 6% on groceries, the Sam's Club MasterCard to get 5% on gas, 3% on restaurants/travel and the Citi Double Cash to get 2% on everything else achieves a higher effective rewards rate than using a single card for spending across all categories.

Customer called upset.  Comcast's installer ran the MAC, the database came back as stolen.  They embarrassingly accused the customer, threatened criminal charges, and confiscated the modem with no proof or paperwork.  They even took the battery that was in it, which he purchased separately.\n\nI talked him down for about an hour, gave him a full refund, explained where we get our goods, and we left the phone call on a good note.  We agree that Comcast is the bully. (No surprise here)\n\nNo trouble with other brands such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Centurylink.

We thought, why not - try to do something we both have a passion for. We knew going into it we were going to automate the process of creating 1,000's of products from Amazon onto our site - which is exactly what we did. So in a sense, it's not like every other affiliate site out there, because of the automated items. \nWe just launched the site this past week and we had been working on and off for the last couple months. Our future plans for this site and going forward might mean creating a subscription service to monetize our site even more. Not exactly sure where to go from here. I think the biggest struggle when creating something like this is to set time aside and just do it. What took us two months to build should've taken us a couple weeks - max. I think that's the whole process of learning though. It will get faster every go around. Please feel free to critique the site http://dragonballmerchandise.com/ . There are still a few features that need to be added - subscription service and fixing the contact page - along with a few others. \nSide Note: I realize these sites do not monetize well but I think part of it was just the learning process in building it and what steps to take next, so we can build from it. \nThanks","name":"t3_3p0j0h","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-16 19:32:10","week":42}

Ok, so the actual discounts are £6.01 and £12.01 respectively because it tracks as a penny code on the receipt, but who's checking? \nThe reason for the discount was because the voucher was very time limited - 2 or 3 days after the newspaper was printed.\n\n\nThis particular toy store had about 200 packets of Lego marked down from £6.99 and £7.49 to £1.49 per pack. They still sell on Amazon for between £2.49 and £6.99 depending on the character.\n\n\nSo I bought about 120 packs of about 5 or 6 different characters. These were at least £4.79 per pack on Amazon - anything less and it's not worth my time because of FBA fees and commission.\nI asked the cashier to split the transactions so that I could use both discount vouchers (Which could only be used once).\n\n\nSo the total for three transactions was about £170.

{"id":"3p97gx","author":"longtailwriting","body":"This post is just to show my experience for those interested in trying out fulfilled by Amazon. I am only 18 days in (Started Oct 1st) and am still far in the red. I am starting with books.\n\nResearched in this forum and online. Figured out the most popular products for this venture:\n\n* Bluetooth scanner\n* Sealing bags with suffocation labels (To build sets)\n* Packing Roll (bubble pop stuff)\n* Tape Gun / Tape\n* Weight Scale\n* Full sheet labels to stick on boxes\n* Dymo 450 Turbo Label printer + Labels (Works with Firefox &amp; Inventory Lab)\n(I already have a lot of boxes)\n\n* Inventory Lab Subscription ($50/month)\n* Amazon Pro Subscription ($40/month)\n* FBA Android App Scanner (ASellerTool’s) ($10/month)\n\n(I already have Quickbooks online and business license for my state/city)\n\n(After I gain enough momentum, I’ll use TaxJar to collect out of state tax and get business licenses for those states. I’ll also apply for a reseller cert so I can avoid paying local sales tax.)\n\n\n\n**Total cost of setup:**\n$340\n\n\nI then went to Goodwill/Value Village thrift stores. Each visit I spent about $15. I am estimating a potential profit of $20/hr and most my books are sub 1 million in Amazon sales rank.\n\n\n**Total cost spent on books:**\n$170\n\n\n**Here is the timeline I experienced-**\n\nOctober 3rd purchase book ($2.99) [Sales Rank: 681,338 in Books]\n\nOctober 5th prepared books for Amazon (Shipping cost $2.47 for this book. Only 3 books in box)\n\nOctober 8th dropped box off at UPS (Renton, WA)\n\nOctober 15th books arrived at Amazon (Whitestown, IN)\n\nOctober 16th book entered into Amazon’s system\n\nOctober 17th book sold ($20)\n\nAmazon pays out every two weeks. Estimated transfer to my bank account scheduled for October 27th.\n\n**Fees on book**\n\n-$1.04: Amazon Pick and Pack\n\n-$0.88: Amazon Weight Handling\n\n-$3.00: Amazon Referral Fee\n\n-$1.35: Amazon Variable Closing Fee\n\n-$2.47: UPS Inbound shipping to Amazon (Shown above)\n\n-$2.99: Cost to buy book (Shown above)\n\n\n-$11.73: Total costs\n\n\n$20 - $11.73 = $8.27 profit (41%)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Helpful tips I’ve found (may not be right for everyone):**\n\n* If selling books at thrift stores, volume may be low. If it’s low, setup Amazon to only ship to one distribution center. (Cheaper and easier; but not setup by default)\n* Don’t get business license/tax paperwork right away. Wait until several hundred dollars starts flowing in.\n* Don’t skimp on tools. Make things as easy as possible. (That’s what FBA is all about!)\n* Learn what sells. Don’t be a slave to the scanning tools. There are many times when the scanners can get in the way. (Calibrated wrong, can’t find the item, UPC doesn’t exist) Beyond this, if you learn what sells, you can move faster than any scanner. (You still want to have the scanner to verify though)\n* Sales rank is very important. Often times this is more important than potential profit.","name":"t3_3p97gx","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-18 20:38:03","week":42}
{"id":"3p98hr","author":"[deleted]","body":"My parents are like the classic stereotype of baby boomers. Spend spend spend, mortgage, loans and keep spending. Jobs were better back then but growing up they constantly had to have new cars and larger and larger homes. Lavish vacations, new clothes, cable with 1500 channels that no one watches. Going out to eat all the time. The end result? They are still working well past retirement age to be able to keep doing this lifestyle. \n\nI am pretty close to them and share a lot of my stuff to get advice. They were pretty successful as far as material items and going out and doing stuff. \n\nI've been subscribed to the Early Retirement theory since college. But it seems like most of the material is written for people who make 6 figure incomes as programers at Amazon or Google. You know like figure out how to live on $20,000 a year and take the rest of your $100,000 a year income and put it into index funds, drive a beat up old car that gets good MPG, never go out to eat, buy stuff at the thrift store or free on craigslist. Retire in less than 10 years. \n\nI could do that except I don't make six figures, not even close. For me its closer to retire in 30-40 years even with those cut backs. Add in an insane amount of student loans for what turned out to be a useless college degree and it feels like it won't ever happen.\n\n\nSo my parents argue that I wouldn't be able to enjoy life with out ultra excess materialism that they do. I guess you can tell by the way I worded that I don't agree with them. But its a constant issue thats constantly talked about every time I spend time with them. \n\nLatest example, I bought a high mileage  4x4 pick up truck for under $10K I financed the loan at a low interest rate (3%). I was planning to pay the entire thing off in less than a year so I wouldn't have to worry about the payment and then it would just be payed off. The truck was so cheap that I figured it wouldn't take that long to pay off. I was talking to my dad about it and he started criticizing me about wanting to pay it off quickly. First he didn't like the idea that I bought a used truck, but his advice was to just pay the minimum payment for the life of the loan since it was so cheap. I have gap insurance if it goes underwater in the case of an accident, which its probably underwater the second I drove it off the lot. But.. Its a similar argument with how I live my life.\n\nParents advice:\nStudent loans, why pay that off early, drag it out to the end with the payment. Car loans, pay the minimum, keep financing everything. Get a house with a mortgage and don't try to pay it off early, theres no point. \n\nAccording to them all that money saved by not paying things off early can go to other things. It makes life to uncomfortable to try to pay things off and there is absolutely not point in doing it. They say my life will suck to much and I am being irrational about wanting to pay things off. \n\n\nBut listen to Dave Ramsey, Mr. Money Mustache and every other financial Guru, they all say, pay cash for things (something my parents are against) and pay off loans ASAP. \n\nThe thing is I've seen my parents live really good lifes, with lots of nice things. According to them I'll miss out on having a \"life\" by being so frugal. They thought it was stupid.\n\nWhats your comments and advice?","name":"t3_3p98hr","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-18 20:45:17","week":42}

They are already written, so go ahead and publish them, and while you are waiting for the royalties to roll in, you can pursue whatever moneymaking ideas you choose. You have nothing to lose by publishing them, and everything to gain. Once you publish them, get your friends who already know them to write reviews on Amazon and you are already more than halfway to success.\n\nHowever, always remember this: the key to making a lot of money is multiple streams of revenue. Find several ways to make money, not just one. That way if something crashes, you have money coming in from other directions and you are never completely out of money.

Amazon's customer service is, as most people know, pretty top notch. Also, they're a huge corporation with nearly-infinite resources.\n\nBut like you said, people don't realize they're buying from a nice lady in her living room, they think they're buying from an infinite well of money.\n\nAs a result, people who I think might ordinarily never take advantage of a small business think they're \"just\" scamming off of Amazon. When you go on Amazon, you become part of their customer service structure... which drives some people crazy. If there's a question, the customer is right. If the product \"didn't show up,\" they send a replacement (and charge you for it). We usually do that too, but for some reason, more people's orders are \"lost\" when ordered from Amazon (despite their volume being less).\n\nSome people are outraged about the injustice of that.\n\nThis morning, someone contacted me on one of our merchant-fulfilled items saying it never showed up.

{"id":"cvx95y6","author":"ryanmercer","body":"Because it's true. Advrtiser rates are wayyy down for banners and other stuff. Unless you plan on selling product directly through blog posts (like Amazon affiliate links \"hey I do such and such which this blog is about, well when I'm doing such and such I found this wizzbang realy speeds up my time during this step, here's a link to go buy it on Amazon if you want!\") then it's just not realistic. \n\nYou'll either need to\n\n- Somehow discover a topic with a massive demand (that's going to get tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of uniques a month ASAP so highly unlikely).\n\n- Find some up and coming hobby/niche that doesn't currently have a presence (possible, not probable).\n\n- Find a topic that's going to have sizeable cost per click for banners (terribly unlikely).\n\n- Find a topic where you'll have a very loyal core audience with money to spend and start pumping out premium/aid content like books to sell to these ~~idiots~~ readers.\n\n- Start a bunch of shitty/spammy blogs with truckloads of affiliate links doing little more than finding currently top-selling or about to launch products and write shitty articles across dozens of domains adding to the worthless content on the web hoping someone will google \"best photography software\" and find your site like 41341 other sites 'reviewing' the best photography software with affiliate links to go purchase photography software. \n\nBlogging for a living is dead unless you already have a well established blog. Even then revenue is way way down. Take any topic and google it + blog and you'll find tens, hundreds, or hundreds of thousands of blogs about that topic.\n\n\nYou are far better off finding a hobby you like (and are good at) and blogging about your experiences in said hobby, trying to build a modest number of readers and honestly review any products or services you use while doing that hobby in hopes of getting the occasional couple of bucks off of say amazon affiliate sales (up to 10% of an order). I have one blog post on ryanmercer.com that makes me 2-3$ a month off of affiliate sales. I had issues sleeping due to PTSD a few years ago and found a few supplements/compounds that drastically helped, when I did CrossFit for a few months I experienced similar insomnia and dug that trick out and it worked to so I wrote the post. Once or twice a month someone will find it, click through and order something on Aamzon (usually the two products linked in the post). \n\nI rarely link to products for sale on ryanmercer.com as it's not that kind of blog, it's just 14 years of my random thoughts/ramblings/musings/observations. If you were doing a blog about a hobby of yours and were occasionally mentioning products and linking on amazon or via other affiliate programs \"this product was decent\" \"this product sucked\" \"this product was fantastic for my hobbything\" and had a readership you'd realistically be able to generate some extra cash each month (ideally enough to subsidize your hobby entirely). That's far far more realistic than making a living wage for a family off of a blog these days.","name":"t1_cvx95y6","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-10-12 21:31:22","week":42}

{"id":"cvxey6y","author":"BigSpooky","body":"I wouldn't call that article a \"debunking\" of his interview.  Chanos is a truly brilliant investor.  I know for people who have not been around a while he might seem like *just another hedge fund asshole* but thats about as far from the truth as you can get.\n\nHis point about TSLA/BMW is that there is an inflection point of story vs growth that TSLA is going through.  Up to roughly now its been a story stock - trading on a vision of the future and a great product and a charismatic leader.  But in the next couple years they are trying to transition to a \"real\" company with scalable production and profits and taking marketshare.  When that happens, irrespective of the results, the metrics used to value that company vs its peers change.  In this case that will manifest with metrics like \"price/cashflow\" or \"ROA\", metrics used throughout the auto industry.  EVEN IF TSLA is able to scale to its 500k/year production targets the stock is expensive because the metrics relative to their competitors will change.  If you put TSLA into a RelativeValue screen against other auto companies its a joke.\n\nThere is an alternative to this - remain a story stock forever!  Amazon for example has effectively decided to push out that inflection point well into the future, with the results being the comparisons to the rest of their retail peers arguably not meaningful.  I suspect in the end this is what TSLA will attempt to do as well, when the complications of running a scalable global business get in the way of a good story.\n\nRegarding SCTY, their biggest outstanding issue is their 2019's with a coupon of 1.65% but a current yield of 7.98%, so I don't think Chanos is that off saying \"about 8%\".  You need to use the current yields, not coupons. [Here is a screenshot showing the issues.](http://i.imgur.com/YSzf1Yu.png?1)  The reason why he is comparing this to subprime is because SCTY business model basically requires (at least as I understand it) that their financing rates remain low, the collateral is of poor value, and subject to pricing of markets they have little control over (power costs).  ie, if for whatever reason SCTY financing rates went to 10%, their business becomes increasingly unprofitable (or they raise prices making the end product less desirable).  So given where we are in the credit cycle, is this a good time to buy into a business that needs consistently low rates to work?\n\nI don't have a position in any of these stocks fwiw.\n","name":"t1_cvxey6y","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-12 23:50:28","week":42}

On the other hand, this new project will definitely allow Facebook to monetize Messenger and compete not only with Amazon but also with Ebay.

People have been fired for that here before.\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't mess with anything, I just realized the traffic wasn't passing, probably by design, and said something about it because most companies don't block that traffic and I thought it was interesting,\" I retorted, kind of annoyed at his response.\n\nTwo days later I got that phone call from my friend.  When I called my boss, they refused to talk to me period and hung up on me.  I called my boss' boss, and he wouldn't talk to me, either.  Finally, I called the IT company that hired me for the contract work (it was supposed to be contract for three months then full time) and they told me that I was banned from their building or network for bragging about how I was hacking their firewall.  True fucking story.\n\nI had just gotten married and moved into a new house three months before.  Unemployment wouldn't give me a dime because of the reason I was fired, and because it was considered a contract position and so doesn't count for employment (I left a much lower paying but steady job before the wedding.)\n\nThere were a million red flags at that job.  On my first day there, others told me to get out as fast as I could.  I lasted just over one month before this incident.\n\nI hand delivered letters to the network admins when I showed up to return my company issues laptop, begging them to check my computer and the network logs for any proof of the accusation...insisting that I did nothing wrong but the security personel out front threw the letters in the trash can right in front of me and said the admins were busy.\n\nThe rep from the staffing agency said he tried to call back on my behalf and was told whether I did anything wrong or not, talking or implying I wanted to break through their security would not be tolerated in any way, shape, or form.  It was the other guys word versus mine about what was actually said, and no one who could do anything gave a shit about what I had to say anyway.\n\nFor the first two months of my marriage, I was unemployed and we almost ended up homeless.  I got a much lower paying level 1 tech job at the company across the street (Amazon), but it was great.  Amazon is an amazing company to work for, and I was eventually promoted and moved.  I learned an insane amount more and made more there by a year into the job than I did at the other place, plus real benefits.  Amazon was really great to my family and I.\n\nNow I work for a web development company as their customer service manager, using a lot of the tech but mostly the customer service skills I honed at Amazon.  It's a sweet gig and I'm really happy.\n\ntl;dr - Fuck Volkswagen.  I giggled like a little schoolgirl when this emissions scandal broke loose.   This dishonest is not an isolated incident with them.  Dishonesty and corruption is the normal in that organization and I am so glad it's finally being brought to light. \n\n","name":"t1_cvzbzr1","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-10-14 15:01:05","week":42}
{"id":"cvzc0kj","author":"Apispetal","body":"I hate to say this but a few more months of rent-free living and $300 savings isn't going to make a massive difference here.  You are in full blown crisis and have been for several months with little action taken.\n\n1) You need to complete the paperwork for food stamps TODAY.  Do not let another day go by.  You should take some time today to call and get the open hours of every type of food bank, church, and open kitchen possible.  You should be able to get plenty for 2 adults where your food costs are minimal, if any at all. They may also help you with hygiene items as well -- Deodorant, TP, toothpaste, pad/tampons etc.    \n\n2) You need to call about SSI/SSDI today as well.  Time is not on your side and you and need to do anything and everything you can to try to fast track this.  Once you are on SSI -- Depending on where you live you would have medicaid for insurance. Most medical care will have a co-pay of a dollar or two. Prescriptions usually have a similar co-pay. Food - you will get some amount of SNAP.\n\n3) You need to try calling HUD and see if you can get into a disabled \"independent living\" apartment with subsidized rent or Section 8.  I'm going to be honest -- With you disabled, thousands of dollars in debt, and her working mostly un-skilled low income labor jobs the little cabin with sustainable living is a pipe dream.  You should focus on getting yourselves in a safe, reliable shelter.    \n\n4) You mentioned cleaning supply costs -- I'm assuming this is for cleaning houses?  She should not be providing her own cleaning supplies.  This should be provided by the homeowner or employer.\n\n5) Your medication costs are high - Ask your pharmacist who the manufacturer of the medication you take is.  Contact them and see if they offer a free or reduced cost drug program.  You may be able to look them up online but even if they don't have one listed online contact them directly and see if they have started a new program.  Also call your DR up and let them know you are in desperate need and can they assist with medical co-pays, free samples, anything.  \n\n6) You should be careful about getting married -- with her being able to work it could mess up any benefits you could get being disabled.    \n\n7) You mentioned selling crafts and paintings online -- Unless you have a highly skilled talent most people that make crafts and sell rarely break even, let alone make a profit.  You need to track any expenses here and if you're spending more than you make selling you should probably quit or greatly reduce until you have more money coming in.  \n\n8) Working from Home -- Since you are at home with internet you should try finding any surveys you can take for small gift cards, free samples etc.  Don't pay to take anything -- There are survey sites that may take lots of time to fill out for tiny $ amounts but you need anything and everything.  Also check out Amazon's Mechanical Turk -- The tasks can be tedious and the pay very low but it could help a little.  \n\nThese should only be done after you have gotten the ball rolling on the rest of the big items.  \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: Word","name":"t1_cvzc0kj","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-14 15:01:57","week":42}

This subreddit was made about 4 years ago, and subreddit names can't be changed. We know it's a good place for trading things that aren't exactly gift cards, but just digital items, so the general rule of thumb we go by is that if there isn't a better subreddit for it (like a digital game code), then it's usually ok to trade here. I mention the name of the subreddit, because we are also generally welcoming of things like coupons. /u/Entroduction might want to chime in on this, since he has had some great items that he's traded on GCX that weren't technically gift cards (Under Armour coupons come to mind), but were still very much welcomed here, as long as there wasn't a better subreddit for them.\n\nJust looking at the first couple of pages of the sub right now, there are posts for [nakedwines.com vouchers](https://redd.it/3omqbk) and a [Bing Ad credit code](https://redd.it/3omqx2). And actually, I remember you offering an [Amazon Web Service code](https://redd.it/3juuhe) a little while ago. Are these things technically \"gift cards\"? Eh, kinda. But are they welcome here? Sure! It's not unprecedented for us to take a post down for offering something that is better suited to not be traded here, but in this specific case, it was fine.\n\nRule 6 is primarily just so there isn't any cash laundering going on here, with PayPal, Google Wallet, bank accounts, and prepaid credit or debit cards being the *only* things involved in a trade here. If you have any suggestions of how to clarify that in the detailed rules wiki, let me know. We're always open to suggestions.\n\n&gt;MS does not even offer support for XP, and you ask $20 for it. I mean, are you serious?\n\nIn the future, bearing in mind Rule 12, just try to refrain from being too aggressive when commenting on another person's post. Reporting it is just fine, and if you want to leave a comment, just don't question what they value their item at. If they value it at $20, they are free to do so. A friendly PM to the OP saying something to the effect of \"just a friendly suggestion, but you might not get that much for that item, and I wanted to let you know in private instead of commenting publicly and potentially interfering with anyone else's valuation of your item\" would do the trick.\n\nHope that all makes sense and clears things up for you.","name":"t1_cvzf1oe","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2015-10-14 16:37:04","week":42}

{"id":"cvzmrgj","author":"BigSpooky","body":"stock down != cheap.  The takeaway from the presentation is that management fully acknowledges the competitive threat of the *changing retail landscape* and sees that customer experience is important to maintain their market share vs online.  This results in at least a multi-year investment phase targeting higher wages, customer service, checkout speeds, produce freshness, stocking levels etc.  This comes with a substantial decline in margins.  The question to ask before saying the stock is \"cheap\" is what are the long term implications to the retail business model?  WMT has been running for years at about 5.5% operating margins.  If they need to drop that to 4.5% or 3.5% in order to maintain marketshare, is the stock really cheap?  It seems unlikely that the competitive pressures from online will diminish.

{"id":"cvzxdam","author":"DessieDearest","body":"Greetings! I made an account just to respond! I too am in he military and after 3 years of my service and 2 remaining have decided to become involved with real estate investing. It's just me, and I have no partners. I became involved with a very very systemized company that works all over the country to teach the ways of real estate investing. I've only been involved for a few months but am already about to launch my first marketing campaign and start making offers! I'm looking into options for my GI bill since I don't think I'll use it as my estimated income is going to be well into the 6 figure range. I do live in the DC area where I plan on crushing it and flipping or wholesaling 10-18 houses just next year! A great book to look at is the E myth for real estate investors, written by Than Merril (who also happens to be the CEO of the company I'm learning from! I learned this after I had bought the book on Amazon), Paul Esajian, and Michael Gerber. The company that teaches me is amazing with hundreds if not thousands of learning materials online and coaching calls twice a month. But the most important thing I've learned from them was not to just think, but to also do. Put the systems in place and follow them! I'm barely 21, but am going to be going strong by thre end of the year. If I can do it, so can you. I literally just joined Reddit, so I don't know how anything works like messaging, but there you go! Also, flipping houses is NOT a hobby. It's a business. And I create steady jobs for contractors, improve neighborhood values by fixing their eye sores, help families out of financial situations like pre-foreclosure and I create a win-win everywhere I go. Also, after these next few months I'll be able to remove myself from my business using the systems in place to hire other people to work for me, including my sister. So my business will continue to work and I can be off exploring the world and doing what I want (you could spend time with your kid!) the market is great everywhere, you just have to know the systems. All the naysayers on here are technicians, which is fine for them. But if you want to be an entrepreneur like a real estate investor, you can think like them or listen to them. What do they know about real estate investing and flipping homes? You wouldn't ask a Carpenter about dentistry, so go find someone already involved with real estate investing. They're EVERYWHERE, and you can work with them. There is no competition, just people to give and receive deals from. \nEnd hopefully helpful rant! :D","name":"t1_cvzxdam","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-14 23:56:17","week":42}

Don't spend more than $5-$10 on a used one. You can get a new one from Amazon for $20-25. The 3 quart size has been perfect for my personal use.\n\nIf you have access to a Sam's Club membership, you can buy 6 pounds of frozen chicken for ~$10 and ginormous bags of rice and beans for quite a bit less than the smaller bags from regular stores. If you don't have a membership, check Groupon and Living Social, they typically have a membership special (I got mine for $48 for a year of their 'gold' membership-you get 1% back or something like that on purchases under gold-and that came with a $25 gift card and about 20 bucks worth of free food, so it was basically free in the end).\n\n6 pound bag of chicken easily makes me three crock-pots worth of food. Add in some canned tomatoes, some hot peppers, a can of beans, some tasty spices and a bit of water. Cook on low while you're at work, come home to a big pot of delicious. I then use Minute Rice, scoop out all of the chicken, add in a couple cups of rice, leave it on High for about 30 mins and have awesome chicken and rice and 3-5 days worth of leftovers. Your meal cost will run about $1.50-$2 per and you'll be stuffed full of food that's not only delicious but actually healthy.\n\nSick of chicken? Grab a pork 'picnic roast' (it will be the cheapest cut of meat in the pork section, $1.50 a pound or so). They're tough if you cook them in an oven, but slow roasted they just fall apart. Protip: don't use BBQ sauce with a high sugar content, it will taste slightly burned after 8+ hours in a slow cooker. Or get a nice jerk sauce and splurge on some pineapple.\n\nAlso remember that tortillas are dirt cheap and you can turn any of the above meats into tacos with a bit of veggies (I like Wal-mart brand pico de gallo) and a 79 cent container of sour cream (and maybe some guac in those $5 for 6 snack packs, or buy an avocado and just put some fresh slices on there).\n\nWant desert? $5 in apple pie filling (2 cans), $2 spice cake mix and $2 worth of butter (two sticks) in the slow cooker on high for 2 1.2 hours and OMFG.\n\nI can eat amazing food out of my slow cooker for about $15-25 a week.","name":"t1_cw00nnc","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-10-15 01:16:56","week":42}

Hourly vs flat rate? What about recurring income?  \n  \nCreate documentation for yourself, policies and procedures. Sure, you know how to perform maintenance on a PC, but putting it in writing creates a standard for your business. And if you ever have to call in, or flat out hire, someone to pick up some of the workload you'll already have a standard to go by.  \n  \nSelect a couple of manufacturers to work with for equipment: a budget home desktop/laptop, high-end home desktop/laptop, small office desktop/laptop, the road warrior's laptop, different printers, home/business networking, etc. Having standardized equipment you work with makes it easy for you to know what you're dealing with and lowers your hands-on time investment when it comes to deployment/support. Establish actual partnerships with these manufacturers; you'll get better prices shopping at NewEgg or with Amazon Prime at first, but nurturing a vendor relationship will pay off way more in the long run.  \n  \nKnow how to say No. Remember that chasing money can leave you losing it rather than gaining it.

My boss bent over backward to keep him happy and on board. Three hours of travel time and a half hour of \"negotiating\" (which I always added to the bill afterward and got reprimanded every time) was time that could have been billed to multiple local clients.

They provide a really good service to society and that is a good online marketplace and very good shipping. \n\n- This stock currently only trades this highly (As does Tesla, Netflix etc) because someone else is always willing to pay more for it a few months down the line\n- Eventually there will come a point where the promises/visions for expansions are going to hit a wall and be difficult to deliver (See again: Tesla)\n- The stock will face a 'correction'\n- People who paid $300 for a company will no longer want to pay $300 for a share of company that doesn't make that much revenue \n- I'm not saying you won't be able to make money on it in the short-term, just long term Amazon has a lot to deliver based on its current stock price and it's track record has not suggested that it has the power/managmenet/insight to do so\n\nHope this helped, and remmeber just my thoughts!","name":"t1_cw0r6dk","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-10-15 18:08:42","week":42}

So in your case, you hit the new tab and it says \"This break brought to you by Kit Kat\". Add a link to click through to their website and that's probably what triggers a transaction with the advertiser.\n\nYou could go with a freemium model though those are generally annoying as well. Some examples are: 1.When you create your account, you can only take five minute breaks. If you pay a fee, you can choose when you start each break how long it will last. 2. For a fee you can receive stats i.e. how many breaks you take per day and how quickly you actually start working again.\n\nYou could show a series of AdRoll type ads when the page is opened that displays Amazon listings of items they can buy based on their past search history.

It's still \"affiliate\", but not in the traditional sense that you have an offer sitting on a network waiting for affiliates to apply to and promote. \n\nI'd love to give you some happier advice on this, however this industry is pretty much dead beyond the major programs (Amazon) and private deals. I'm not saying it can't work, I just personally would look at growing through other means.

{"id":"cw1yrt3","author":"NotRonJeremy","body":"Yeah, my card isn't really designed to appeal to churners (although I can think of some ways they could try to game it).  The target audience would be more people who like to gamble and/or have gambling problems.\n\nOnce a month they'd login to the site to see if they \"won\" by clicking on each transaction with some animation revealing the result.  Each transaction would be one more chance to play, which would encourage them to use their card more frequently for that reason.\n\nA better system would be to have them play for prizes with set values, but the problem then is people would just buy a bunch of $1 Amazon gift cards as a cheap way to get more chances.\n\nAnother potential improvement would be to have more levels (say, 60% chance of winning 0.5% cashback, 25% chance of winning 1.5% cashback, 10% chance of winning 5% cashback, and 5% chance of winning 15% cashback), but then you'd get people returning on all the purchases that only hit 0.5% cashback, which probably isn't the result you want.\n\nWith both the original levels I proposed as well as the longer list I just gave the card would earn 1.925% cashback on average, but it would be easy to play with the numbers to get a higher or lower overall result.","name":"t1_cw1yrt3","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-10-16 18:11:58","week":42}

{"id":"cw2rpug","author":"BurritoBiscuit","body":"Keep in mind that you will be losing money when starting simply because you have to spend that initial money to get wares to Amazon, especially when going through the FBA route. \n\nThe idea is to take that loss into account when pricing your items. Estimate fully how much it will take to put X items into Amazon for FBA, the full cost it takes you to obtain those X items, fees for the transaction, and that's your baseline. You can't sell lower than that. Then I would recommend looking for alternatives for that item, if there are any. If someone is selling them cheaper with Prime enabled, then either reduce your costs or find something else. Between those alternate costs and your baseline is where you have to find a point that moves your wares and also nets enough to make your effort worthwhile.\n\nLike /u/nomadentrepreneur says:\n&gt; If it doesnt work out, so be it (thats where testing is important!) and its time to select a different niche!\n\nDon't anticipate selling a large amount of whatever it is right off the bat.

I do best when I daytrade options and scalp 20-100%, closing the position out in a day. But I went under $25k on a couple bad AMZN, GOOG, and GPRO trades in August by veering from my strategy, then violated PDT restrictions not once, but twice by closing multi-legged spreads and not realizing it blew all my DTs in a day. Should have just bought and held FB or some shit and waited out the 90 days, but nah, was determined to get back to my $25k, so I kept trying to buy options for swing trades only to get slowly drained. However, I grabbed the opportunity to go long the S&amp;P 500 near the lows, thanks to my proprietary YOLO modeling system providing a series of confirmations.

{"id":"cw4djqb","author":"2OQuestions","body":"It's easier than being a full time flipper. Look around your house and list 5 items you don't care about on Amazon.\n\nStart with cheaper things to build up feedback. Read up on stuff, but don't expect yourself to be an expert at everything. You can find boxes and packing material for free at many places, or just save what boxes you get from buying stuff online. \n\nYou probably won't sell all the items the same day (unless you price super-low just to build feedback - no guarantee it will work). \n\nList a few more items if the first few didn't stress you too much. \n\nYou are an expert at something. Almost everyone is. People you know probably come to you with questions about some topic or another. That's the easiest way to figure out one niche of yours.\n\nWhen you do your regular shopping, pay more attention to things you think are deals. Between the Amazon seller app (Free), camelcamelcamel.com (free) and this sub (free), you should be able to figure out if something really is a good deal.\n\nI have certain guidelines to keep things low-stress for me: I don't buy anything that is superfragile (candles in glass jars, decorative figurines), things I know very little about (designer clothes/shoes/bags), or large things that take up a lot of space if they don't sell right away. \n\nI started a few years ago just flipping books. I read so much it was a way to create more space on the bookshelves. It turned out to be so easy that I'd pick up extra copies of certain books here or there if I knew they were expensive. \n\nMy husband added software, DVDs, and games to our store.

{"id":"cw4e6r8","author":"Spythe","body":"I don't think anyone should get an Amazon Pro Account right away, learn the process and get some sells under your belt before you jump on a Pro Account. Unless  you're selling more than 40 items a month, you're actually losing money on having a Pro Account. You get charged .99 for every item that sells on a normal/non pro account.\n\nBluetooth Scanner is also not needed, I have over 1000 items in FBA and sold over 600. Never used a Bluetooth scanner, just my cellphone for listings. \n\nAmazon Seller App is more than enough for scanner(at least starting off) and its free(also tells you the prep requirement and if the item is restricted under your account). If you're really into books I would suggest getting a PDU scanner at some point. I still don't have one but plan on buying one in the future.\n\nIf you mainly do books having a Pro Account makes scanning books a little more exciting. Constantly seeing -.50 to 1.50 can be pretty disheartening. Anyone that went from non pro to pro knows what I'm talking about.\n\nHmm the helpful tops should be changed to opinions.\n\n* If selling books at thrift stores, volume may be low. If it’s low, setup Amazon to only ship to one distribution center. (Cheaper and easier; but not setup by default)\n\nThis one really depends, it cost .30c for a 1 lb or less and goes up. \n\nYou can find out here https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201233560\n\nAlso you will be shipping items to a distribution center which then get shipped out to other places which will really slow down how long it takes til the listings go active.\n\n* Learn what sells. Don’t be a slave to the scanning tools. There are many times when the scanners can get in the way. (Calibrated wrong, can’t find the item, UPC doesn’t exist) Beyond this, if you learn what sells, you can move faster than any scanner. (You still want to have the scanner to verify though)\n* Sales rank is very important. Often times this is more important than potential profit.\n\nI see a lot of people constantly repeat this but most people still don't know how to correctly break down a sales rank. AND even then there is no rule/way to determine what is worth buying, what will hold in rank, or the amount to invest in it. There is so many different situations just solely using sells rank isn't a sure fire way of knowing if something will sell or not. Its a really good indicate but nothing is 100%.\n\nSIDEBAR;  These are all just my personal opinions from my experience on FBA so take with a gain of salt.","name":"t1_cw4e6r8","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-10-18 23:08:18","week":42}
