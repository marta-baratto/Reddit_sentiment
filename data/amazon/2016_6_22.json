{"id":"4lnt8y","author":"MisterKeeks","body":"I'm an experienced eBay seller, but I think I'll be getting into Amazon soon as I am probably going to purchase several hundred books. I have several questions. \n\n1. I want to sort through these books to determine which I will be keeping and which I will recycle. I have a USB barcode scanner. Is there a way for me to scan each book and see the price and sales rank without having to use a mouse for each book? I see scanning listing software, but I'm not sure if there is anything that will let me bulk scan books to see prices/information on them.\n\n2. How do you decide between FBA and MF? I'm fine with shipping books for MF, however, I don't know how you determine if it should be fba or not. I imagine that fast sellers go FBA? I believe I will be selling mostly textbooks if that makes a difference.\n\n3. Is media mail OK or not for MF. I'm familiar with all the other shipping methods, but I've heard media mail is unacceptably slow.","name":"t3_4lnt8y","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-30 05:55:58","week":22}

{"id":"d3p5vmg","author":"kidfay","body":"It's capital intensive to build a warehouse and distribution or logistics system. (I think it was the combination of interstates and trucking taking off along with computers that enabled a company like Walmart to get intensive logistics.) Lots of capital required means we'd expect there to be a small number of companies operating in that industry.\n\nOnce you build the Amazon warehouse near a city, it's more or less the same cost to run whether you ship 100 items or 100's of millions per year. So you build the warehouse and aim to sell the 100 million items out of it. \n\nIt's like a car company--getting the design of a car, making all the parts, and setting up the assembly line is the expensive part. After that, it's a matter of cranking out as many cars as possible to get the economies of scale in buying raw materials and so on. So that leads to there being only a handful of companies in the car industry. If you could design and 3D print your own car, that'd take out the capital intensive part of making a car and \"car shops\" would start popping up in towns and the \"ideal\" size of a car company would start to shrink.\n\nWhat you wrote a comment back was like that technology will trend all industries toward having one big uni-corp. I'm not sure about that, that wiki article I linked to said that being capital intensive is what drives big companies in an industry. Sears back in the 1800's managed to be the Amazon of its time with only a catalogue and [rooms full of people](http://www.officemuseum.com/IMagesWWW/Sears23_Making_a_Record_of_the_Customers_Order_OM.jpg) taking orders instead of a website.\n\nA case I've thought about is barbers. There isn't much capital involved so there isn't a force driving consolidation. Yet it seems like chain and franchise shops are popping up and the number of standalone barbershops is going down. There are other issues businesses deal with like risk and compliance and even just simplicity I suppose that play into the decisions people who want to go in the hair-cutting business make. Or it could be people with capital want a place to put it but don't know anything about cutting hair so they get into the franchising of barbershops.","name":"t1_d3p5vmg","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-05-30 16:26:17","week":22}

{"id":"d3pd8tw","author":"whyteanton","body":"I missed my Goodwill's Saturday 50% off spectacular somehow. Just slipped my radar with family stuff. Whatever.\n\n* I just went today and picked up a Zojirushi rice cooker for $6.50. It's not a fancy fuzzy logic model, but they go for $70 new. I'm keeping it as my old cheap one from college is really small and doesn't work well anymore.\n\n* Picked up a Washington Capitals vintage blue starter jersey, very high quality and excellent condition for $10. Sold listings are between $50-$100. Too bad the hockey season is over I think? I don't really know what hockey is. \n\n* Spent $5 each on two NIB board games that should sell for $35 on FBA.\n\n* A sweet and complete Dunkin Donut's thermos from the 80s for $1 at a garage sale! Should get $20 or maybe I'll keep it.\n\n* Paid $0.25 for a 15 inch tall ceramic christmas tree (vintage). It has no base, but I'll get a base on etsy and sell it for $60+ unless my wife sees it and then we keep it.\n\n* Picked up 5 Safety 1st Pro-Grade window security locks for $2 each. They're gated on FBA unfortunately, but they sell pretty regularly on eBay for $10-15 each, so that's cool.\n\n* I got kinda lucky on video games at yard sales. Nothing epic, but I paid about $30 each for two ps2 slims and a black gamecube (with box). The systems also came with about 20 games total. Almost all of them garbage, but about 8 of them should sell for $10-25 on FBA. Quick BOLO! NFL Street games for the PS2 are sports games worth picking up for resale! I almost didn't even scan them since they're sports, and NBA street resale is worthless, but NFL Street 1 and NFL Street 3 used are going for $15 on FBA and new like $60.\n\n* Grabbed a vintage Hobart Kitchenaid for $20. I stupidly paid $15 for a dough hook for it since it only had the regular attachment and the bowl. I'm into this thing  $41 now but it works well and sold listings on eBay range from $60-150 so I'm crossing my fingers.\n\n* Picked up a Warren Vinneau Burl wood art piece for $4 at Goodwill. Condition isn't as good as I thought it was in the store, but I should still be able to get $40 for it. If it was in great condition it'd be more like $100\n\n* I sourced a business phone on eBay which seemed underpriced. I paid $30 and it's going for $60 on Amazon with no FBA offers. I'll throw it on FBA at a $100 and lower the price until it sells.\n\nGood week!

This is because as your inventory increases, your sales will increase as you have more chance to link up with the needs of individual buyers. If you \"lower your standards\" and buy more books in the Acceptable category, you run the risk of negative feedback, which can harm your metrics to the point where you lose your selling privileges forever (especially when you are just starting out, and haven't built up a buffer of positive feedback to protect you.) If by \"lowering your standards\" you mean buying long-tail, niche-interest books, that's a good business plan but they are much harder to find and sell more slowly (most sellers aim to have a mix of both long-tail and short tail.) If you mean purchasing books with low prices, the Amazon fees will eat a big chunk of your profits and mean you are spending a lot of time sourcing to not much benefit.\n\nDepending on what your sources are, 5000 books is a respectable amount, especially if you are working solo and are not outsourcing book-sourcing to others.

{"id":"d3psmpx","author":"VibratingHamster","body":"You don't get charged interest if you pay the full balance each month. \n\nI'm a student who based my credit card choice off the following factors:\n\n1. Interest rate - higher interest rate is usually the only option if you are establishing credit. Make sure that the interest rate is a \"set rate\" that does not change each yr (specified in the contract). 0% interest the first year is nice as well. But if you pay it off in full each month, this is just a fail safe.\n\n2. Anual fees - if they have a ridiculously high annual fee (for example $150/yr) don't go with that company. What exactly are they charging that for? It's not standard so it better have some bells and whistles.\n\n3. Theft protection - 0 liability if your card gets stolen. Very important... believe it or not that isn't standard across the board yet.\n\n4. Credit score reports - some credit cards give you free credit scores that are useful for monitoring your credit. Just be aware that although it's tempting to constantly check, each time you do it is a soft hit on your credit and lowers it a few points. \n\nWhy is this important? Because canceling credit cards also damages your credit. It's better to have it and not use it than to cancel something you signed a contract with because you are abusing it. Always make payments.\n\nMy recommendations for someone starting college: \n\n1. Amazon rewards visa (% off purchasing and accumulative points, great if you buy on Amazon frequently)\n\n2. Capitol one Credit Card (about 23% interest rate so it's steep but they are incredible at monitoring your credit and giving you credit reports, 0% interest the first year, no fees)\n\nAlso check with the bank you have your checking with.

{"id":"d3qfdce","author":"BobbyTrosclair","body":"Amazon feedback is rare. The eBay community gives a lot more feedback.\n\nIf you are selling FBM (doing the shipping yourself), negative feedback is unfortunately more common than positive, as people will ding you for taking too long to ship (when you shipped in time, but you were shipping from Florida by media rate mail and the buyer lived in Alaska. Not your fault, but they will ding you anyway.) FBA sellers (who store and ship their inventory at AMZ warehouses) get much less negative feedback because Amazon takes the hit on any shipping related issues and will remove any negative feedback for that. They will also remove feedback that is just about the product (e.g., \"This book is poorly written!\") or if the neg feedback is about price (\"I can't believe the seller wanted $5 for this book!\") whether you are FBA or FBM, so always ask. If you list condition accurately,  neg feedback for books on Amazon FBA is comparatively rare, compared to other products (like electronics).\n\n(Positive feedback for the contents of the book itself (\"This is an amazing book about surfing with monkeys! The author really knows his stuff!\"), isn't automatically removed, however, and counts towards your positive feedback score. I get these pretty often, and always welcome them.)\n\nDon't even bother selling books in crappy shape. If the binding is detached from the spine, if the book smells like a smoker owned it, if there are weird stains inside, pass on buying it. If you discover this after you already bought the book, have a box beside your desk to toss it into to donate it or throw it away. The small profit you make from selling it will not be worth the neg feedback risk.\n\nSo how to get more positive feedback on Amazon, whether you use FBM or FBA?\n\n1) Really good customer service. Grade your books conservatively, and if in doubt, grade your books down a level. The buyer who buys a book described as Very Good in your listing but receives a book that he feels is in Like New condition is much more likely to give you positive feedback. Make sure your books are in the best condition possible (labels removed, bookmarks removed, etc.)\n\n2) If you are FBM, consider upgrading shipping if you are shipping cross-country or OCONUS.\n\n3) If you ship FBM, include a nicely-worded flyer asking politely for feedback, and explaining clearly how to do that. Give an email address to resolve any issues (outside the Amazon email system) tp head off any problems. (You can't include flyers if you ship books through Amazon FBA, it's a big Bozo No-No and you can get dinged by Amazon. If you seal your books in plastic and tuck it inside where Amazon won't see it, you might get away with it but I wouldn't recommend it.)\n\n4) If you ship FBA, use one of the feedback solicitation services. I use Feedback Genius and my positive feedback rate shot up pretty high. There are others that are also supposed to be good. They send a templated email out when it leaves the AMZ warehouse (which asks them to send feedback when it arrives), and another saying it should arrive today (and asking them to send feedback). People seem to like the reminder (\"I should look outside my door today, the email says the package is coming\") and see it as a service instead of dunning them for feedback. It still won't be a high level of feedback (people are lazy), but it's much better than if you don't use it and will act as a buffer if you get bad feedback. \n\nI worried that it would trigger cranky people who don't like being asked for feedback to give me neutral or negative feedback, but that has never happened. You also have to be observant about never sending out marginal condition or poorly described books. If you don't want your service as a seller to be judged on any book you send out, or if you would be disappointed if you received the book as a buyer, then don't list it.\n\n5) Odd tip: Sell religious books. Whatever your feelings about religion are, I've noticed that a good 40% of my positive feedback comes from buyers of religious books, and much less than 40% of my inventory are religious books. Religious people seem to be far more likely to take the time to say thank you / good job.\n","name":"t1_d3qfdce","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-05-31 16:50:46","week":22}

{"id":"4lyznw","author":"Tyshizzle","body":"Hey everyone. So my wife and I are really in a financial pitfall these days and I'm hoping to begin digging us out, but I'm wary to not fall deeper. I've browsed for a while and couldn't find a straight answer for our situation. \n\nOur credit card debt is out of control. I don't have the details at the moment, but the short story is we have about 9 separate revolving accounts, and all of the interest rates seem outrageous (14-20%). We have never missed a payment on anything in our lives, but our credit score is low because of a low debt to income and virtually no available balance. We stupidly used credit cards to escape the small town we lived in, and have relied heavily on Amazon credit for even food at times.\n\nWe are now making decent money, but our rent keeps climbing and we can only afford minimum payments on the overwhelming debt we've grown. I'm thinking there is a solution that would result in a lower interest rate and less payments heading out. I want to pay down the debt as soon as possible but I'm not sure what the best path would be. We've explored the snowball and avalanche methods to repay the debt, but by the time the minimum payments are made, we're searching couch cushions just to survive.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.

Are there complaints I can file with FTC, FCC, etc.?\n\nNormally, I would just search for another ISP or just use my phone as a hotspot(I sell on Amazon, which is why I need the internet), but the house is in a rural area where CenturyLink is the only available ISP and phone service is abysmal.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nEDIT: So there seems to be some responses with mentions of deeds and estates. My mother did not have a will for what its worth. I had agreed (verbally--no papers, yes I am stupid) that I would relinquish rights to the house so long as everything stayed kosher. Last year, the bank tried to foreclose on the house. We filed a successful injunction because they had not gone after the life insurance policy that we directed them to. My brother and his family were unable to make payments which is why they no longer wanted the home.\n\nThis put me in the position to either take over payments or sell. As it stands we (my brother and I were able to get free legal aid--albeit is limited) have an agreement between the bank's lawyers and ours to give me time to unfuck what my brother has done to the home and to sell with us (\"the heirs\") receiving any difference between the life insurance covered portion and selling price of the home. \n\nSo with all that:\nTLDR-- I honestly don't know who's name the home is in.\n\nEDIT #2: Obligatory RIP Inbox. Only took 5+ years. Thanks for all the replies, they have been really helpful. Sorry I am only updating now, but my workweek is Thursday - Sunday and I just haven't had the time.\n\nTo update: After getting some advice from on here I went ahead and filed a complaint with the FCC on Thursday. Friday I received an email from the FCC saying that the complaint request has been sent to CenturyLink and they will be contacting me soon and CenturyLink would be required to respond to them within 30 days as well. The email didn't mention anything else of importance.\n\nNow that I've got to enjoy my personal 'Saturday' I plan to give CenturyLink another call tomorrow. Per the advice of /u/chb1000001 I will be recording the call. I did think it was odd that the CSR was so open with giving me other people's info without any assurance of who I actually was. I will also check and add a link to VA recording laws for everyone's reference in my next update.\n\nI will continue to try to respond to comments as this progresses as well.\n\n","name":"t3_4m7q1z","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-02 17:32:44","week":22}

Keep in mind we do not list this brand online for now, except of our own company website.  \n\nI am really struggling to make a decision right now. One of the main issues is losing control over my pricing. Since we distribute to beauty salons and beauty schools, we try to get prices standardized for everyone. \n\nAnother issue is the payments which aren't super fast. As of now, are cash flow situation isn't all that great, and I would be scared this could make it worse.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to know what you guys think and if any of you have had experience with supplying Amazon.

{"id":"4m95a0","author":"qzapmlwxonskjdhdnejj","body":"First off, my native language is not English so excuse me for that.\n\nMy reason to write this guide is that I was a college drop out, and over the last couple of years I tried a lot of methods, and gathered a few that actually worked. I put those together in a private subreddit and got a lot of replies of people that wanted to join and actually used the methods to succession. (/r/frikkensaved).\n\n\nAt the moment I make a couple of thousands every month just repeating a few steps. Since I am going on a vacation for a while I figured I would give back to this community that learned me a lot about beermoney in various ways and how to use this to my advancement. Below here is a detailed guide gathered from 4 of my posts on /r/frikkensaved that got me to the point I can actually lazily chill in my chair and browse Reddit all day.\n\nBefore you take any assumptions please read the whole post. \n\nI will prove each and every step and guide you thro it.\n\nThese methods are build up on getting referrals.\n\nI honestly do not believe in doing surveys myself. It is boring, and I feel myself irritate me more and more after disqualifying surveys.\n\nOn the other hand someone else always lurked me in and got a fat check at the end of the month referring those people to surveyssites, shopsites etc.\n\nAt the moment I refer thousands of people to various sites and all that goes pretty much within a few clicks and a few keystrokes.\n\n\nFirst of you need a site that gives you a good amount of cash for referring people.\n\n\nI personally use www.gifthulk.com\n\nThe site is very clear for other users, simple and offers a nice initial reward for every person you sign up. \n\nIt also cleans all the people that are not making them money or will be disqualified for surveys.\n\nThey offer a reward of 10 cents for every user, and 50 cents for everyone reaching a certain amount on the site.\n\nThat is 60 cent in total but from experience I can tell you not everyone will reach that. For reference check this for example http://puu.sh/pemKe/33abdfbf87.png Only two reached silver level and earned me 60 cents instead of 10 cents.\n\n\nI use this site for a few months now and so far this is the one that converts the best. If you prefer another site that is also possible but make SURE people will not dislike how your site looks.\n\nNext thing we do is advertise our referral link.\n\nThis is the part most of the ones who tried before who read this will get stuck. Luckily I had some tricks up my sleeve. \n\nYoutube is one of those sites that actively tries to find visitors for your videos. Tag them correctly, and people will find them organically. Basically free advertising!\n\n\nHow are we going to game that as easy as possible?\n\n\nFirst off we need to make a video, it can be as low effort as you want, but using a voice will DEFINITELY improve the conversion rate (conversionrate = people that viewed minus people that did click).\n\n\nYou basically NEED every click because from there they will figure out the site and make YOU money. So think of the youtube video as the frontdoor to the site. \n\n\nHow will we get those conversions you ask? Go to the store page of the Gifthulk store or the store of the site of your preference. (from here on I will only use Gifthulk to cut down on text).\n\nAs you can see there are many rewards to choose from. \n\nMost will think that the best way to promote is to promote with the Paypal cards or Amazon cards. Wrong!\n\nMost people visiting Youtube and actively looking for sites to get stuff are in my experience teenagers. Guess what teens do?\n\nPlay games, pretty much all of them do in some degree.\n\nIn my case I started promoting Free Minecraft, Free CSGO skins etc etc.\n\nHow do you promote those cards in a way that actually works?\n\nFirst you got to think about what these kids are looking for. \n\nThey will never search for Surveysite to get Minecraft giftcodes.\n\nThey will search stuff like How to get free Minecraft Premium,\n\nFree minecraft now and that kind of things.\n\nWe game on that. So now we know what to target, you can do this for anything, any product. We just use Minecraft in this example because I got good results with it.\n\nNext step is making a youtube video.\n\nGet your alternative Youtube account, (Eventually you can scale this with earnings, and just outright pay people to do this whole step for a few cents. more on that later)\n\nYou got multiple options here. Some convert better then others. \n\nYou could use paint and just quickly get the point across in a few seconds like shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhEXxpT6jvk (turn volume down)\n\nOr could go like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gMepqHlSAs\n\nOr this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8CyXe7ozsw\n\n\nThe first one has the most conversions.\n\nUpload the video, use a good title and insert some tags you \"borrowed\" from a popular video with the same searchtags.\n\n\nAfter that make a blog on Blogger.com and a make short article with a short description and the link to the video on youtube. For some reason this can help (Backlinking I bet). Free views are free views and if you are lucky someone skips the youtube and goes straight to the search results on page 4 on Google and finds your article.\n\n\nNow we are going to boost the youtube video. More views and likes make your video more trusted. Perfect for new people visiting your video and perfect for the clicks. Lets be honest here, you rather click on the link of a video with a few thousand views than the one with 2 views.\n\n\nFrom here you get two options again. \n\n\nThe first one is the free option and perfect for trying, the next one is for when the revenue starts dropping in. I personally use the second one but that is because i use pure profit and I can pretty much not make any loss at all.\n\n\n1st free option you have.\n\nHead over to http://www.addmefast.com and make an account.\n\nAfter making your account make yourself comfortable with the site and try to make as much credits possible. This might take some time.  \n\nAfter that click on \"add my site\" and allocate credits for your youtube video. You can choose to get youtube views and likes.\n\nThere are more sites like this. Feel free to share some in the comments.\n\n\nSecond option (paid one)\n\nI use a fiverr like marketplace where I just pay someone to increase the views with bots because that goes way faster and I want to keep everything as passive as possible.\n\nCant beat a service that delivers thousands of views for a dollar.\n\nJust buy the service, give the link and come back a few days later to thousands of views. I personally use this one http://a.seoclerks.com/linkin/440860/youtube/418934/Fast-3100-3200-Retention-Youtube-VIDEO-Views-Improve-SEO-Ranking\n\nThose guys deliver around 3200 views for a dollar.\n\nThis is the first step to making passive income. From here those videos will easily and slowly make you cash. Invest the earnings into making more videos and getting more views on the uploaded videos you have and you have the first revenue stream up.\n\n\nNext step.\n\nFirst off sign up to https://userscloud.com/free366021.html\n\nOr use https://userscloud.com/\n\n\nAfter that move over to Google and look for interesting downloads.\n\n\nWhat helps for me is looking in game or hobby fora for what people need.\n\n\nThere is always something to be uploaded, knit patters, Open-source games, (actual) free Music, Ebooks, Guides, Maps, Programs and more. Having google analytics can help to determine what words people search for more and what files to spread.\n\n\nAfter that open any Image editor and make a few images which shows the program/map/whatever and show the name of the file.\n\n\nHead over to youtube and click upload.\n\n\nClick add slideshow and add all the images in the correct order.\n\n\nBelow in the description you put the filename, link to the download and instructions if they need to install anything or unpack anything. So any special instructions, make it clear from the start. People arent always the smartest and you can loose downloads that way.\n\nHot downloads can earn you A LOT of money. \n\nEvery thousand downloads can earn up to $15 dollar and the platform itself is very good to use.\n\nIf you get a good source of files not a lot of people have you can also upload it to a blog. This joke of a blog (seriously it is very ugly) http://freemcplugins.blogspot.com/ had more as 28K views and more as 60K downloads. With an average of $10 dollar every thousand downloads you can see I make a lot of money when you realize I have hundreds of these kinda blogs set up already.\n\nNow you have all these blogs and videos set up, but the money does not flow that fast in yet. This will take time but we all want to see profit NOW.\n\nWe will now reach the last step.\n\nIf you followed all the other steps to the note and worked hard and got work up you will see results in the few coming weeks.\n\nThis last step is way trickier because you are working with humans again.\n\nThis one is a whole lot trickier then the earlier one.\n\n\nYou are not beating an automated system now but try to get your stuff up high in forums with brutal admins and competition.\n\n\nIm not the first one to figure this one out, but Im nice enough to tip it out because it is very profitable.\n\nFirst off Ill show an example again.\n\n\nhttp://puu.sh/lCbKs/c039eb29f3.jpg\n\n\nWhy is this horrible piece of text a big money maker?\n\n\nIts pretty easy, I picked the right target audience again.\n\n\nIn this case I'm on a forum with a lot of kids, and fact, kids like money and bright colors. Not an audience I like to target or interact with but it is one that can earn me cash. Part of being a cool successful internet-marketeer means talking like an idiot sometimes to fit in.\n\n\nThis can be a very valuable way to make money.\n\n\nSome forums use a bump system. And some use an anti-leech system. You gotta reply before you can see the content.\n\n\nYou can see where I am going with this probably.\n\n\nMake a guide appropriate for the forum, in this case it was a Skriptkid site so i used bright colors and advertised how much moneys I was making. I shared some information and turned it in a small guide to passively earn some money. They are content, I get referrals.\n\n\nWith the bumping system you stay on top and get free referrals.\n\n\n8 full pages with replies and when it gets slower I bump it again.\n\n\nhttp://www.puu.sh/lCcdP/35d74c5728.jpg\n\n\nThis method could use some work, and I need to get working on a list where you can bump money making methods easy.\n\n\nIn this case I used ****forums. (censored because it is public)\n\n\nHope this helps /r/beermoney.\n\nIt did for me so far. Feel free to share your insights.\n\nThis guide took me a full hour to edit for /r/beermoney.\n\n\nI am also available on Discord.\n\nJoin this channel and ask for my name.\n\nI can chat and I have a microphone. Feel free to ask more information.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/012xjQHgY019XAl8u","name":"t3_4m95a0","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-06-02 22:14:41","week":22}

{"id":"4mgn0w","author":"alekspiridonov","body":"To keep myself accountable in my potential venture I decided to keep a log of things that I've done. Some of this work has been done a while ago, but I was going over one of my spreadsheets and realized that I've begun to forget how I arrived at certain things. This is my effort to document the work that I do.\n\nThe past three days, I have been primarily focused on documenting any market analysis.\nSo my question for you guys would be: is this OK for a rough market analysis? Is it possible to get a better estimate? How good of an estimate do you really need?\n\n***\n\nBut where are my manners?\n\nHi, I'm Alek. Some time ago I was watching an episode of Tested on YouTube, where Adam made a holster for his multitool out of sheetmetal. I thought \"that guy is right! I am not a fan of the nylon sheath at all. I bet I can comeup with a better alternative like he did.\"\n\nSo, I made my own holster and got it 3D printed. It's also mass manufacturable out of plastic. I decided to look online to see if other people did something similar. It turned out that they too thought that a better holster can be made and some even made their own as well.\n\nSeeing how there might be a potential market, I decided to polish off my design and a month of revisions later (modify it, wait for 1 week's lead time from 3D printer, repeat), I felt like I had something that was \"just right.\"\nWhile I've been prototyping, I also had the part quoted by a tool and die manufacturer so I knew the mass production costs. I got a rough estimate of packaging costs. Freight to get the product dropshipped from injection molding shop to the packager then to distributor. Eventually I had enough information to piece together a reasonable price.\n\n \n\nOnce I had that, I wanted to work the other way around. Before I started with manufacturing and then started adding markups for myself and distributor. This time I wanted to start with a consumer price and work back towards an acceptable range for manufacturing costs. Plus I wanted to know, just how many customer might be out there.\n\n\nFinally, we get to the market analysis stuff I initially mentioned. I'm a nerd, so I actually kind of enjoyed researching this information and compiling it. Won't blame you if it's not your cup of tea and quit here. Here go the last two entries in my log:\n\n***\n\n**2016-06-01**\n\nStarted listening to \"The Personal MBA\" by Kaufman on Audible on my way to and from work, and then in the evening when I'm too tired with the entrepreneurial venture. More difficult to focus on while driving – demands more attention than a typical book. Fairly thought provoking as it's easy for your mind to fly off on a tangent as you think of applications or day dream or fantasize. Worthwhile to set it to 0.75 speed.\nGot an Office 365 Business account. Don't forget to expense the $99!\nDecided to quantify the market for Leatherman Wave multi-tool in an effort to quantify the potential market for the holster:\n\n \n\nStarted by reading about the company. Leatherman Tool: 500+ employees according to their website (≈525 according to Wikipedia). Oregon company. Shop employees probably make in the 20k-50k range. Office employees probably make 40k-60k. Glassdoor has some salary postings. Engineer: 49k-93k. Admin: 55k-60k. Maintenance Tech III – Hourly: $26-$28/hr. For company labor cost estimate, I will guess $40,000 per employee on average. That's $20M on labor alone. 60,000 sq.ft. facility. US manufacturer. I'll start with assuming that typical sale price of their product breaks down to 20% distributor's costs and markup, 15% margin, 10% overhead (facilities and such), 30% labor, 25% material. Based on 30% labor cost in product and $20M total labor expense estimate, it should mean about $66.6M revenue. Searched online for \"leatherman revenue\". Top hit: \"hoovers.com\", Revenue and Financial Reports: Revenue of $80.9M. Fundinguniverse.com: \"Sales: $100 million (2000 est.)\" Bizjournals.com: \"capable of generating around $60 million in annual revenue.\" So, $67M is a fair estimate of sales on any given year.\n\n \n\nLeatherman is popular for their multi-tools, so I'll assume that it makes up 90% of their revenues or $60M. They also have about 36 different multi-tools, so I will have to come up with a way to estimate the ratio of Wave sales versus total multi-tool sales. Step 1: Fire up Excel and list all the multi-tools with their prices. Step 2: grab total number of reviews (Leatherman website and Amazon.com) for each multi-tool. Hopefully, the weights that can be calculated using {contribution / sum of contributions}, where {contribution = # of reviews * product price) are somewhat proportional to the ratios of the individual product sales to the total. Of the 36, certain items got combined due to similar names. Some got deleted due to low popularity. In the end, data based on reviews posted on Leatherman website was discarded as it had significantly fewer reviews and may be more subject to noise.\n\n \n\nThe table below shows the estimated yearly market size based on $60M multi-tool annual revenues. The wave may be a market of up to 150k units. 10% penetration into the market with a $1-2 margin, would result in $15k-$30k profit, which might be worth pursuing. Other notable conclusions based on these estimates is that there may also be a market for Skeletool and Wingman accessories, as those product may also have significant sales figures associated with them.\n\n***\n\n| **Product**              | **Approx Price** | **# reviews** | **Contribution** | **Sales Ratio** | **Revenues**    | **Units sold** |\n|----------------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| **WAVE**                 | 95           | 2721      | 258495       | 19.7%       | $11,843,344 | 155,833    |\n| **REBAR**                | 65           | 529       | 34385        | 2.6%        | $1,575,401  | 30,296     |\n| **SURGE**                | 100          | 850       | 85000        | 6.5%        | $3,894,405  | 48,680     |\n| **MICRA**                | 30           | 1048      | 31440        | 2.4%        | $1,440,472  | 60,020     |\n| **JUICE S2**             | 65           | 170       | 11050        | 0.8%        | $506,273    | 9,736      |\n| **WINGMAN**              | 40           | 1945      | 77800        | 5.9%        | $3,564,526  | 111,391    |\n| **TREAD**                | 190          | 109       | 20710        | 1.6%        | $948,860    | 6,243      |\n| **JUICE C2**             | 60           | 25        | 1500         | 0.1%        | $68,725     | 1,432      |\n| **SKELETOOL (RX,CX,SX)** | 80           | 2593      | 207440       | 15.8%       | $9,504,181  | 148,503    |\n| **STYLE CS**             | 24           | 718       | 17232        | 1.3%        | $789,510    | 41,120     |\n| **LEAP**                 | 50           | 42        | 2100         | 0.2%        | $96,215     | 2,405      |\n| **SUPER TOOL 300**       | 85           | 712       | 60520        | 4.6%        | $2,772,816  | 40,777     |\n| **OHT**                  | 85           | 254       | 21590        | 1.6%        | $989,179    | 14,547     |\n| **JUICE XE6**            | 100          | 58        | 5800         | 0.4%        | $265,736    | 3,322      |\n| **RAPTOR**               | 70           | 660       | 46200        | 3.5%        | $2,116,724  | 37,799     |\n| **MUT EOD + MUT**        | 170          | 510       | 86700        | 6.6%        | $3,972,293  | 29,208     |\n| **SIGNAL**               | 100          | 49        | 4900         | 0.4%        | $224,501    | 2,806      |\n| **CHARGE TTI**           | 170          | 775       | 131750       | 10.1%       | $6,036,328  | 44,385     |\n| **SQUIRT ES4**           | 37           | 309       | 11433        | 0.9%        | $523,820    | 17,697     |\n| **SQUIRT PS4**           | 37           | 1176      | 43512        | 3.3%        | $1,993,569  | 67,350     |\n| **CHARGE AL**            | 140          | 73        | 10220        | 0.8%        | $468,245    | 4,181      |\n| **JUICE CS4**            | 84           | 73        | 6132         | 0.5%        | $280,947    | 4,181      |\n| **CRUNCH**               | 110          | 259       | 28490        | 2.2%        | $1,305,313  | 14,833     |\n| **SIDEKICK**             | 50           | 1059      | 52950        | 4.0%        | $2,425,985  | 60,650     |\n| **SUPERTOOL 300 EOD**    | 100          | 46        | 4600         | 0.4%        | $210,756    | 2,634      |\n| **CHARGE ALX**           | 145          | 148       | 21460        | 1.6%        | $983,223    | 8,476      |\n| **STYLE PS**             | 28           | 569       | 15932        | 1.2%        | $729,949    | 32,587     |\n| **FREESTYLE**            | 45           | 146       | 6570         | 0.5%        | $301,015    | 8,362      |\n| **Z-REX**                | 25           | 54        | 1350         | 0.1%        | $61,852     | 3,093      |\n| **REV**                  | 35           | 66        | 2310         | 0.2%        | $105,836    | 3,780      |\n\n***\n\nAdditional thoughts after research: Leatherman did make a plastic holster for one of their products (RAPTOR multi-tool, which looks like a pair of scissors that typically get packed into medical kits for cutting clothes on an injured person or to help tie an improvised tourniquet). I wonder if they did the design themselves. If I get noticed and they felt like it, they could crush me. But still, to be seen as competition by a company that big would be an accomplishment.\n\n***\n\n**2016-06-02**\n\nMarkup.  Knowing that Amazon’s markup is typically 10-15% based on their fee structure (plus shipping fees in FBA), I wanted to know what were the typical markups of other retailers. Found a nice article (http://blogs.marketwatch.com/great-columnist/2012/10/15/retail-markups-and-the-power-of-amazon/) which summarized exactly what I wanted to know.\n\n***\n\n| Amazon             | 15% |\n|------------------|------|\n| Costco             | 10% |\n| Wal-Mart           | 32% |\n| Target             | 46% |\n| Staples            | 41% |\n| Dick’s             | 50% |\n| Macy’s             | 80% |\n| Nordstrom          | 67% |\n| Nieman Marcus      | 65% |\n| Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond | 81% |\n\n***\n\nI primarily want to sell on Amazon, however I want to keep open the possibility of selling at a big box store. The accessory might seem at home in a Dick’s store or at REI (55%-75% markup, according to one forum poster who was accidentally given a price sheet by a sales person). So what should be the base cost of the holster sold via retailers? I started with a range of consumer prices that are slightly below market price (≈$10) down to “priced to sell” ($7). Table below has these prices listed across the top, markups on the left, and the corresponding cost to retailer in the rest.\n\n***\n\n\n| **Markup\\Price** | **$9.99** | **$8.99** | **$7.99** | **$6.99** |\n|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **15%**          | $8.69 | $7.82 | $6.95 | $6.08 |\n| **25%**          | $7.99 | $7.19 | $6.39 | $5.59 |\n| **35%**          | $7.40 | $6.66 | $5.92 | $5.18 |\n| **50%**          | $6.66 | $5.99 | $5.33 | $4.66 |\n| **75%**          | $5.71 | $5.14 | $4.57 | $3.99 |\n\n**Cost to Retailer/Distributor as a function of Sale Price to Consumer and Retailer Markup**\n\n***\n\nThe values in the bottom two rows are probably fairly safe values. So $3.99 – $6.66 range is now used to determine manufacturing cost at various manufacturing markups. All business costs are assumed to be in the cost, so that the markup is profit.\n\n***\n\n| **Markup\\Price** | **$6.66** | **$5.75** | **$4.75** | **$3.99** |\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n| **10%**          | $6.05 | $5.23 | $4.32 | $3.63 |\n| **15%**          | $5.79 | $5.00 | $4.13 | $3.47 |\n| **20%**          | $5.55 | $4.79 | $3.96 | $3.33 |\n| **25%**          | $5.33 | $4.60 | $3.80 | $3.19 |\n\n**Cost to Manufacture as a function of Sale Price to Distributor and Manufacturing Markup**\n\n***\n\nOnce again, probably should go with the bottom two rows: aim for $3.19-$5.55 total cost to manufacture if you want to sell in $6.99-$9.99 range with OK margin for yourself.\n\n\n\nToo long of a rant?

{"id":"4mhxoi","author":"goosefoot33","body":"Hello PF! Frequent lurker, second time poster.\n\nI have just received a notice in the mail from Chase that my Freedom credit card is being closed when my card expires next month. This account is my oldest by far- this account started as a Buy.com credit card back in 2005, when I was 19. I am now 30, and my next oldest open account is from around 2010 I believe.\n\nAfter spending 20 minutes essentially pleading on the phone with a rep, and then a supervisor, to keep my account open, they said there is nothing they can do and it will be closed, final decision. The reason they are closing it is because of inactivity, as I have not used it for 12 months. This is understandable, coincidentally enough, I pulled this card from my file cabinet just last week with the intent to use it and not lose it!\n\nWhen asked what happens when I use the card and have a balance on it when they go to close it next month, the rep said that the account would be closed, and that I would be able to pay against it, but not charge anything else.\n\nThe main reason I want to keep this card is because of its age, and the effect it will have on my credit score. I'm not someone who constantly grooms their credit score, but I keep tabs on it (currently 780-805). The reason my credit score/history makes a difference right now, is that I am in the market for a second (rental) property. Once this card is canceled, my credit age will drop drastically, from an average of ~8 years down to ~2 years.\n\nTo the credit card experts- is there a way to appeal their decision, and keep this account open? Can I write a letter to someone either at Chase or another agency that would be able to leverage their decision? I will have no luck calling Chase back- they were hesitant to even let me speak to a supervisor on the phone yesterday.\n\nI've done a bit of research on the web, but there isn't much to read. There are people in worse positions than myself, where it was their main card that earned them a decent amount of points/rewards. If it makes any difference, I have one other Chase CC (Amazon), and my mortgage is through Chase.\n\nTL;DR: Chase is closing my oldest account in a month- do I have any way to reverse their decision and preserve my credit history/age, and score?","name":"t3_4mhxoi","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-04 13:30:29","week":22}

{"id":"4mn2jl","author":"emsai","body":"Long story made short,\n\nCouple years ago I've finished my first book, but still haven't found a way to promote it. I've been thinking around for a very long time, probably for too long.\n\nMy aim is NOT to make money (I don't care about the revenue it brings, have other options to make a living) but I am definitely interested in making it available to as many people as possible. I fully believe in the change it brings, and testing among friends and acquaintances appear to show that there is indeed value and it could be a successful book. (got very good feedback)\n\nBook subject: It is a \"self-help\" book (although this naming is maybe just the best approximation) about finding happiness, creating success with a focus on reality creation and its mechanisms, and re-balancing our life. A lifetime of personal research is included in the book, and how it impacted my life is also presented. Writing it was extremely difficult for me (I was no writer but had to become one), but I'm very happy about how it went. I always felt I have a mission to write it, a mission I must fulfill. \n\nQuestion for you: **How can I promote this book without spending a fortune?** Side note, again I'm not really interested in making money from selling it; breaking even or close would be great. Here is what I've thought so far:\n\n- To offer it as a Pay-What-You-Want model, price 0 included\n- I'm also considering adding as a free ebook on Amazon; what do you think? I wonder how it would be perceived as value in this case. Side note if I use the .99 option on Amazon (or similar), but in this scenario I am not sure if I can still \"sell\" it on my personal website. Will someone please enlighten me on this.\n- I've also registered the domain to match the book name (probably a good idea in the long run)\n- FB ads/Bing ads. Still it could be really expensive. (Adwords ruled out, far too expensive)\n- Reaching out to other bloggers, influencers, reviewers...  - Frankly I have no idea where to start.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated...

{"id":"4mnq5l","author":"09Klr650","body":"After switching credit unions a few times in the last decade and opening Amazon and a Frontier credit credit card accounts I have several credit cards that are really not used that often. I know that closing them can negatively affect my credit score. Anyone have experience with this? And is there any other downsides (other than the lack of available credit of course) to be aware of? \n\nBasically I usually carry about $3k in debt (I know, shame on me) and this will change my available overall credit from around $35-40k to $25k. I believe my current credit score (as of last month when I opened the Frontier account) is around 730. Not all that great in my opinion and I would rather not cause it to drop that much more. For the moment I have just been sticking the unused cards in my safety deposit box. \"Out of sight, out of mind\" and all that.","name":"t3_4mnq5l","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-05 16:57:26","week":22}
{"id":"4mnsh2","author":"arrogantfool","body":"Last year I made a blog about refrigerants that brings in about $300-$450 a month in the peak months of summer. Overall, last year was about $2,000 brought in and this year will probably be about $4,000. There is no expense to this site except hosting. All traffic and income is organic.\n\nSince March I have been reinvesting my earnings from the refrigerant site over to a new website. It is a video game website but different than most. Instead of reviews, impressions, or walk throughs this site exclusively shows short stories or memories from video games. \n\nSay, for example you have some very fond memories of playing World of Warcraft Burning Crusade with a group of friends. Or, you and your significant other bonded through a Mario Party game. Whatever the game, whatever the story, as long as it is a unique and genuine story it will be featured on the site.\n\nFast forward to when the site is mature you could select the World of Wacraft tag and read fifty to sixty stories all from the World of Warcraft. Each story would be seven hundred words or greater as well. SO, you could spend hours just reading up on people's experiences from the game.\n\n**Here's how I'll make money from the idea:**\n\n* Most of my money from refrigerant is from Adsense as I get about 1,000-1,500 views per day. I plan to use the same strategy for the gaming website as well.\n* The other portion of my income would be affiliate marketing through Amazon and E-Bay. (The same as my refrigerant site.) I could provide links at the bottom of each post to the game, merchandise, or whatever.\n* As the site grows I could also start creating E-Books for a category of games. (Stories of Gaming - FPS Games - Volume 1) This could be expanded out as well so that there are thirty to forty books out there all with ten to fiteen articles each.\n* I could also see charging others to post their articles, YouTube channels, or ads to my site. A featured YouTube section, or something like that could be provided for X amount per month.\n\n**Expenses**\n\nObviously, I can't write all of these stories due to time constraints, and the fact that it would be a boring site if only one person was writing. I have commissioned over fifty articles so far using my refrigerant income. (I have 69 published articles so far.)\n\nAs the site grows and as my refrigerant site grows I plan to invest more and more until I can publish multiple stories a day. I'm hoping in a year or two that I'll have over one-thousand posts and stories to share with the world.\n\n\n\n**So, What are your thoughts?**\n\n\n","name":"t3_4mnsh2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-05 17:12:43","week":22}

I'm a Gold Member (redeemed over a certain amount of money or something like that. And my account age.) so I get access to instant PayPal cashouts for my Cash balance (there's a Points and Cash balance. Cash can be made into points or withdrawn to PayPal, Check, and such. Cannot be done the other way around. Points can only be used for purchases from Amazon items and gift cards).\n\n**instaGC** - Also has offers and surveys. I try to do the ones from their AdWall offer wall. Their surveys can pay a lot ($0.50-$4) but you don't always qualify. Also any offers that give you around $2.25+ when completed will have those points frozen for 7 days (that means they credited just fine but they do that to prevent losing money and such).

I was planning on opening a bunch in her name, closing those accounts, then opening up in my name. Wash, rinse, repeat with the intention of the 18-24 months rules between various cards will have been taken up in that time. I went to open a chase card in my name and was declined. I'm thinking it was because of the 5/24 card rule. I can't think of another reason. Stated income was &gt; 100k, my credit score &gt; 780(over 800 based on CK). I haven't opened 5 cards in my name in the past 24 months, BUT I was added as an authorized user on my wife's chase cards. I thought I remember reading that chase will count being a UA on somebody else's card will count against 5/24. Is that correct? Long story short, is there an **easy** way to obtain how many cards you've opened in a given time period? I know you can get your credit reports from the big 3 and decipher the long drawn out reports. I do already have 2 Chase Freedom's, a Chase Slate, a Chase Amazon, and a Chase Mortgage. Maybe too much credit with them?\n\n**TL;DR:** \n\n1. Does being a UA on somebody else's chase cards count towards \n5/24?\n\n2.

(I max this out every year - easy to buy gift cards)\n* 20% bonus if you have 20 or more transactions on your card in a month (making groceries at 2.2x)\n* MR points earned are transferrable to airlines. This is huge - typically no annual fee cards do not let you transfer to airlines directly (e.g. Chase Freedom cannot transfer to airlines unless you have Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Ink Plus). Almost all of the transfer partners are also at 1:1 points. They often also have transfer sales, where 1 MR point is worth more than 1 airline point.\n\n\n11,000+ MR points | Spend $1000 in 3 months | 10,000 bonus, plus 1000 points minimum due to your spend at 1x\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:\n2x points | Earn 2x points at US supermarkets/groceries. Easy to buy gift cards as well. | If you max this out at $6000, it is 13,200 points. This is 2x at grocery stores, plus 20% bonus.\n20% bonus | 20 “swipes” a month get you this 20% bonus | The best way to earn the 20 charges per month this is at a grocery store self check out — you can do this easily by yourself with multiple swipes. Alternatively, you can buy $0.50 Amazon credit to send to yourself.\n1:1 points transfer to many airlines | Now this is **GREAT**. Many transfer partners and different airlines | Another **HUGE BUT UNDERSTATED BENEFIT** is that almost all of the points transfers are **INSTANT**. Other cards often have some delays, but here the transfers are instant in 95% of cases. So if you see a good points fare, you can transfer immediately without worrying about availability disappearing in the next 1-2 days. Check out the transfer partners for more details.\nUnlimited 1x | This is pretty standard | Spend as much as you want, and get 1x MR points.\nNO ANNUAL FEE | Now this is **GREAT**. Good way to continue your credit line | Open the card, and keep it forever so you can add to your average age of accounts. This is also a good card to start your relationship with American Express as it is easy to get approved\nEntertainment Access | Pre-purchase tickets to some events | There are some card members-only events, and pre-purchase offers to some broadway shows, concerts etc. I was recently able to buy some concert tickets at a pre-sale in this way!\n\n\nIt is also a good way to maintain your MR points if you cancel high-annual-fee cards but still want to keep your transferrable points. If you have other Amex cards, you can close those and keep this card and safely maintain your MR balance.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and hope it works out for you!\n\nPlease note that the best sign up offer bonus ever has been 25,000, but I am not sure if that is still available - I have not been able to see it - it last appeared around 6 months ago.

{"id":"d3sgtb2","author":"zakmustapha","body":"Congrats on getting your site up. However, I'm sure you know that this isn't even the beginning. I mean, I really *hope* you do.\n\nYou see my friend with Amazon around, consumer demands have skyrocketed. The number of people who have prime memberships are extremely high. And people with prime memberships would rather order fishing items from Amazon since they've already invested in the membership.\n\nIt's hard to snatch consumers from Amazon just to offer them a tiny portion of what Amazon offers. You need to think of this very carefully... \"why would people bother with my site when Amazon offers the same or similar products as mine?\" Seriously think about this. Your success depends on it. If you can't think of a good reason, then game over.\n\nAnother thing is, Amazon's listings are much better designed, more descriptive and they contain customer reviews that influence customer buying decisions (there's a study/survey done on that). \n\nIf I was a beginner then I'd be confused. I don't know if what you're offering is of high quality or not. I want the best of the best. And I want you to guide me. This is where you gain an advantage over Amazon. (Yes, I've just answered the question for you).\n\nAmazon cannot direct a beginner to purchase the best fishing products. As a beginner I don't even know what I need to buy. I don't know what I need to catch my fish, why I need it, how to use it... I know nothing. Amazon can't tell me... but YOU CAN! \n\nI'd like to know what brands exist too. Can you become an official supplier of reputable fishing brands? Can you put their logos on your site to build credibility? \n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\n* Create a blog where you'll educate beginners, intermediates and advanced fisher people.\n* Create sections (with links in the menu) such as \"Beginner\", \"Intermediates\", \"Advanced\" and then list the appropriate products/blog posts in each section. This will give each group a tailored experience. Why? Because you're an expert and you're educating the consumer and telling them what to buy, especially beginners. Beginners are your friends. For example, on the Beginners page you'll clearly sum up what the product does in just a few words because frankly (as a beginner) I don't know what I'd use your products for. Then for intermediates and advanced you could have a brief description that explains the main benefit of one product from another (strongest rod, lightest rod) or have goal based descriptions (catch sharks, catch sardines or whatever goal a fisher would have). Yes, that could mean you need to create individual descriptions for each product 2 or 3 times... but I would start off with beginners and work my way up. btw these are just ideas, you need to think of ways you can give each customer segment (beginner, intermediate, advanced) a tailored experience. Whether you decide to offer products at the bottom of blog posts or on a page or both...that's up to you.\n* With regards to your logo, check out Upwork, 99designs or designcrowd. \n* Your tagline... \"Everything Fishing, delivered quickly and affordably!\" *Affordably?* do you really want to compete on price? *delivered quickly?* isn't that what people expect now especially with Amazon around? So yeah, please change it to something that stands out more. Maybe you could be the \"best\" or \"premium fishing products seller\" or \"We'll Show you the Best Stuff for Fishing (through your education and blogging etc)\"... I don't know, you can think of something, I'm sure you get the point.\n* Think of how you're going to get traffic. None of the hard work on the site and logistics will do you any good if there's no one visiting your site. (Maybe try, guest blogging, fb ads, google ads, influencer marketing etc)\n* Think of how you'll convert traffic to email subscribers (yes, you need to start building an email list if you're not already).\n* Think of how you'll convert email subscribers to paying customers.\n* Here's an idea I just thought of. You could create a free email course on \"how to start fishing\" or \"How to catch your first 50 fish in 14 days even if it's your first time\" or whatever for beginners. Then in each lesson you could recommend specific products they need to do X. By the end of the course, they'll have a list of all the things they need plus an education on how to use them and when. Congratulations.. you've just turned a total rookie into someone who knows how to fish AND because you've done that they're likely to buy the fishing equipment from YOU. You've essentially made your own customer by turning someone who was interested in fishing to someone who knows how to fish and what products to pick. Otherwise that interested person would have bounced right off your site (like I have and probably most people who check out your site from reddit) just did because we know nothing about fishing and a page with products doesn't mean a thing to us unless you educate us. \n* Put some famous brand logos on your site. Or famous news sites/blogs where you've been featured to boost credibility and trust.\n\nAnyway, that's my feedback for you.

{"id":"d3sm76i","author":"OBotB","body":"Are you set on her not returning to work? I love my kids and would do anything for them, but even when it was costing as much/more than I was earning in daycare it was a preferred place for them to be (after 6mo's for my first, after 2mo's for my second). Yes it is expensive, but if you find a good one they grow and grow with friends (go with a preschool style daycare, not a bunch of random ages in someone's house), yes she will miss him/her but then you get them at the end of the day and have that extra energy to play and teach and spend time with them. Our kids love us, but they really love going to school, following their structure, getting to play with their friends, doing the activities, playing somewhere other than home, and it really helps with the routine. It would pay off in the future (when the kid(s) go to school - it is very hard to get back in the workforce after an extended gap) it also protects your family if you should ever lose your job both in salary and in health insurance options. Plus they will get their \"sick\" done early (build up the immune system) rather than when they hit school and it makes a difference.\n\nKids are expensive (not sure why you would get a child care tax credit? If a parent is unemployed you usually don't get those), do keep an eye out for consignment sales for kids clothes. If you have Amazon Prime use Subscribe and Save with Amazon Mom for diapers. If she is able to breastfeed that will help keep feeding costs down for the first ~year. Insurance will pay for one pump. Otherwise formula is ...(never bought it, not bothering to Google) I think some of my friends said it's a jar per week of powdered formula ~$30ish? If your child has dietary sensitivities add to that.\n\nKeep that $10k in case there is a medical emergency prior/at/just after birth. Insurance is great to have but doesn't cover everything (I want to say anesthesiologists, circumcision, plus deductible and percentage of hospital cost - for your first child I strongly recommend a hospital over a home birth).\n\nChecks? Why are you still buying checks? Pay your bills online/autodraft. Make sure your Life insurance will meet your needs or if you need to bump it up. \n\nYou have Netflix, Itunes, Playstation Plus, I don't know what Visa Infinite is, nor PVR rental, plux $100/mo fun money. Cut back on entertainment. Drop your Cable TV (I assume at $128 you have internet plus tv) down to over the air, get an antenna. Keep your internet, keep Netflix and if you decide to get Amazon Prime keep it (it has music, movies, apps, fast shipping (if you choose slow shipping on some things you get a $1 credit for digital/app purchases), etc. plus that Amazon Mom program where with it and Subscribe and Save you get 20% off diapers if you set a subscription) but otherwise find some free/cheaper fun/entertainment, start saving that money.\n\n$500 on Groceries per month for two people seems rather high, maybe cut back on meat/prepared foods a bit? If you aren't stuck in a plan get a cheaper cell phone plan.\n\nYour healthcare will go up when you are a Family rather than Self + Spouse.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have better advice, I'm just looking at your take home and optional expenses, and lack of saving and it's making me cringe. (I'm a big saver, but you say you just finished paying your debt so I will assume that is why you don't have more) If it were me I would personally, as said above, cut all the fun/entertainment spending besides Netflix and picking up Amazon Prime, I would plan on going back to work after maternity leave, I would budget out groceries and meal plan and slash that monthly expense.","name":"t1_d3sm76i","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-02 04:41:42","week":22}

I usually use up the card as much as I can until it has a few dollars left. Then add the leftover balance to your Amazon account.\n\nAnother option is to buy a money order from Walmart and then deposit it to your bank. Fees vary but is generally around 70 cents. If the fee is 70 cents, you'll have to buy a money order for $104.54 so it adds up to $105.24.

{"id":"d3sw0kd","author":"azarata","body":"So you have $3466 p/m in income and $1582 in those expenses at the top of your list. You have $956.20 for the minimum payments of your debt, which brings you to $2538. So you've got $928 of money to play with.\n\nBudget out that money. You obviously need food to live and to feed your daughter, and that should be a priority. You should be frugal about it though; no eating out, cut out all extraneous expenses like alcohol and expensive meat, buy generic brand, buy everything on discount, and look for coupons. Cook every night and limit your meat dinners - meat is expensive, though chicken can be cheap and is good for you. Go look at /r/EatCheapAndHealthy for some ideas.\n\nLook at your phone plan too - $150 a month for a phone plan seems very expensive. If you can, downgrade and get something cheaper; when you're working with &lt;$1000 per month of discretionary income, $50 or $100 makes a massive difference.\n\nAs for your debt, that personal loan is an enormous albatross around your neck. The size and interest rate on that loan mean that you need to reduce that as much as you can, as soon as you can. You might have to get to work on a calculator but its entirely possible that putting every spare penny into the loan will be better for you than paying off the deferred interest cards. In any case, pay minimums on all of the credit cards and put every last spare penny into that loan. You might want to work out the difference in paying off the Amazon card in particular first compared to the loan though.\n\nThe main idea is to be systematic. Don't put money into your debt willy nilly as you are right now - its inefficient. The personal loan is paramount, but the other cards you could probably choose whether you pursue the avalanche or snowball methods.\n\nAnd yes, your bank accounts aren't going to go up this year, and probably not next year either (without a definitive boost in income). That's not to discourage you - its simple truth, and motivation. Make a budget, stick to it, and though progress will probably be slow in the beginning, know that you will come through this and out the other side. Every loan and card you pay off will be a victory.\n\nEDIT: Something you may wish to consider is putting a little bit extra onto one of your credit cards and using it as a de facto emergency fund. I feel like in your situation that putting aside $1000 for an emergency fund is something that is very close to prohibitively expensive. You do, however, need access to some money or credit in case an emergency does occur. I would stress that with your situation you *really* don't want to have to tap into more credit, but life happens and you do need some way to deal with a situation if it does come up.","name":"t1_d3sw0kd","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-02 11:26:19","week":22}

It is great to hear of these experiences from people who found Discover to be valuable.\n\nWith two Chase Freedom cards, I already have $3000 at 5x for the Amazon, gas, and restaurants quarters. Discover's $1500's would makes that $4500, which would be higher than my natural spend for those categories in the quarter, unless I MS.\n\nI suppose the question then in terms of Discover 5%(+5% bonus) vs Chase Freedom's 5x is if you value the 5 UR per $1 at the 5x category at $0.05 or greater than $0.1. If you value the 5 UR at greater than $0.1, then the Freedom category spend makes more sense than the Discover 10%. For me, this is often the case.\n\nWithout the extra 5% at the end of the first year bonus in those categories, I would think the UR route is a no brainer, as you can always cash out the 5x UR at 0.01, which is the same you would get using Discover.\n\nOf course, this assumes that the Discover and Freedom categories are overlapping. \n\nI actually think 1x spend (uncategorized spend for all your cards) may be more useful on Discover (if you aren't working toward minimum spend on another card)?\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps the most significantly, as you said, the Apple Pay deal and Discover Deals also changes the equation. The above is more for thinking about if you want to get the Discover now (without the apple pay promo) with the 10% cb or stick with Freedom's 5x","name":"t1_d3swg7u","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-02 11:52:39","week":22}

If you get CSP, you have 2 cards left. If it were me, I would NOT get either Freedom, especially if you plan to downgrade the CSP after one year. Here's why:\n\nGetting either Freedom, which have 15k bonuses, means giving up a 50k or more bonus. Assuming 50k, that's a 35k point difference. With the Freedom Legacy, it would take over two years to make up for this difference, assuming you can get $3,000 of bonus spend on it each year (maxing out grocery and Amazon). With the FU, it would take $70,000 of spend for that extra 0.5% to make up for the lost 35k in points. And that is just for a 50k bonus; 70k bonus would of course be much higher.\n\nPeople need to get this. That is NOT worth it, unless you are keeping the CSP and big-time into MS. Now that 5/24 applies to cobranded, for *most* people it would be far better to max out 5/24 with big bonuses. The Freedoms are no longer worth it.

{"id":"d3t3vr5","author":"eabyars","body":"This is not actually true. Bank of America figured out a work around for the Dodd-Frank legislation (which protects only against one-time charges) by qualifying charges using stored credit card information as \"recurring charges\". Other banks have now followed suit. So, if you buy something through PayPal, Google Pay, Amazon, or any other site that uses stored account data, they can legally process the charge on a negative balance and slap you with the fee for the \"convenience\". This is obviously bullshit because a vast majority of charges now take place within these services where they do not fall under the Dodd-Frank protection. For instance, I took every precaution against \"overdraft protection\" when I set up my account with BofA. However, when I was binge watching a show on Amazon, EIGHT separate charges were processed in the red and incurred EIGHT $25 fees. When I called to straighten this out, I was told the above ONLY after I requested escalation twice and spoke with a senior manager. This rep informed me that in order to truly protect myself from these fees I needed a special account which (SURPRISE!) costs $5/month no matter the balance. I don't understand why more people aren't talking about this, but I can't figure out how to spread the word.","name":"t1_d3t3vr5","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-06-02 16:25:13","week":22}

{"id":"d3t8esk","author":"villagecrier","body":"First thing I would look at is whether you have any options to refinance the debts. Can you take out a home equity line of credit? Can you take out any more credit cards with 0% and transfer balances to ease the interest rate? Have you tried contacting the creditors and asking for a reduction in the interest rate? The worst that happens is they say no. They will likely say no but it is worth the phone call to ask. \n\nSecond look at ways to improve your available cash. Is overtime an option? Second jobs available? Could you trade down your car? Can you trim living expenses? Drive less, cut down the phone bill, trim grocery costs, use coupons, grow high yield fruits/vegetables in the backyard, etc. Do you have stuff in the house you could clean out in a garage sale or resell shop? \n\nAre you receiving child support? If not, why not? If you are, have you looked at an increase recently? Did the child's mother contribute towards the surgery? If not, you may have some options to seek repayment of at least some of that expense. Your state's child support agency may help you obtain support/increase support for free. Even an extra $100 per month could be significant here. (I assume the mother is still alive but you two are split. My apologies if she has passed away.)\n\nAs others have said the target here is generally to pay down highest to lowest interest rates and pay the minimum everywhere but the highest priority debt.  I think paying off the Amazon card makes sense if you'll get hit with huge interest payments on a small amount otherwise. \n\nI would consider prioritizing the loan below all cards without a 0% promotion. There are three reasons why:\n\n1. Paying off the other cards will be an emotional victory for you which will help ease the stress of your situation and give you some emergency credit in the event something catastrophic occurs.\n\n2. Paying off the other cards will give you a better credit:debt ratio which may free some opportunities to refinance the personal loan with a new loan.\n\n3. In the alternative you may be able to transfer some of the balance out of the personal loan to one of the completely paid off credit cards to reduce the interest rate in pieces. Look at whether your cards have promo interest rates for balance transfers that you could take use in this situation. Even taking the  interest rate from 33% to 19% would be a meaningful reduction. \n\nIt's a strategy that really only works if you can use your other cards to transfer meaningful sums out of the loan and/or refinance that debt at some point. You may want to talk to your bank about where you need to be in order to refinance that loan so you have a target.

But that also involved taking a huge risk as that was a totally unproven and uninvented space at the time. To put it into perspective, he was developing this online bookstore before Internet Explorer. Meaning, he saw the importance of the internet before Microsoft did and built a business around it. It's hard to appreciate in modern times how innovative and risky of an idea that was in that time frame.\n\nSecond, he expanded it to cover a wide range of products and a third party marketplace which turned it, essentially, into the one stop shop for almost anything and one of the largest retail companies in the world. Again that may seem obvious in retrospect, but how many bookstores do this? It wasn't obvious. While this was happening, a lot of innovation that made them beat out the competitors is hidden behind the scenes here like their efficiency in warehouses, shipping and taxation/finance.\n\nFrom there, arguably his greatest insight came up. He asked all of the staff to recreate their entire infrastructure as standalone commodity services. This was unprecedented at the time, but set the groundwork for Amazon to be years ahead of Microsoft who was years ahead of Google in the cloud computing space. The jump from retail to being (to this day) the biggest cloud computing company was a brilliant optimization and complete innovation as, back then, cloud computing as we know it wasn't a thing.\n\nThose are the biggest things I can think of, but there are a lot more. Like how Kindle was successful not just because of e-ink, but also because they created notification services for customers to pressure traditional publishers into releasing electronic versions and created their own self-publishing business, which both encouraged the transition to e-books and in format that Amazon had exclusive control over.\n\nAll in all, Bezos has repeatedly proved to be a very innovative thinker and definitely earned his place.

{"id":"d3tlfs3","author":"GeneralRevil","body":"OP, please add credit limits, and I'll go even deeper into my third method for you:\n\nI can think of a few ways for you to proceed from here. For all of these, budget, cut your lifestyle to the bone, and see if you can't get overtime, or work a part-time job. /u/danyun1 showed you that you can be done by August of 2018 if you don't do anything. Use that to keep yourself motivated. You need to survive two years and you'll be home free.\n\n* Option 1: HELOC\n\nI don't know how much equity you have in the house and if anyone will lend you anything. If you can, pay off as much of the personal loan with the HELOC as you can. Then, call all your remaining cards, tell them you're having trouble making payments and see if they can't lower your interest rates. If there's anything left over of the HELOC, pay off your cards starting from the one with the highest interest rate (with your new renegotiated rates). Also note that your bank might demand that they will not give you the money directly, but rather pay off your debts for you. That will work just fine for you.\n\n* Option 2: Fix your Credit score and Refi.\n\nIf you don't have enough equity for a HELOC to do you any good, Renegotiate your card interest rates as in option 1. Pay minimums on the personal loan, overpay the credit cards so you're below 80% utilization on all of them. Then, overpay the one with the highest interest rate until your credit score improves that someone will give you a personal loan with a better rate than the one you have now. Refi your personal loan and as many of your credit cards as you can under the new personal loan. You should hopefully get a rate in the teens. Then, pay off your remaining cards and attack the new personal loan with a vengeance.\n\n* Option 3: Super avalanche\n\nI was going to write a post on her describing the super avalanche debt payoff method, but I figured that the only kind of person that this would apply to was someone who was financially savvy, comfortable with using credit cards, but didn't use them to incur debt, and then hit a huge bump in life and got stuck with lots of debt. That seems to describe you pretty well.\n\nNote: Do not cut up your cards! \n\nThe usual basics: Call your credit card companies and ask for lower rates. Budget and cut spending as much as you can.\n\nCalculate: How much of a cash E-fund do you need? (1 mortgage and car payment if you think your job is secure. 2-3 if you have reason to worry about losing your job. Add debt minimum payments as well if you don't want to default on those if you lose your job). Keep this number as low as possible. Any money added here is money that's not servicing your debt. I'd recommend putting in $1358.87 (mortgage, car, minimum on the AMEX)\n\nCalculate: How much of an emergency credit line do you need? (2 months of your other living expenses, plus something like needing new tires). Know that number, and make sure you keep that much credit available.\n\nPay: If you've already made above minimum payments on the Lowe's and Amazon cards, go ahead and pay them off as you have scheduled. Getting charged back-interest is never fun, but the personal loan is accruing interest at a higher rate. If you've only overpaid them for a month or two, cut your losses and make minimum payments on them.\n\nCheck: Barclays is a credit card, not a store card. That should be a 0% promo period, not deferred interest right?\n\nPay: Minimum payments on all your credit cards.\n\nPay: As much as you can on the personal loan.\n\nSoft balance transfers: This is the part where the avalanche becomes the super avalanche. Whenever your available credit goes above what you wrote down as your required emergency credit line, make a purchase using your card (with the lowest rate that has credit available) instead of using cash. Then, devote an equal amount of your cash into paying off your personal loan (or one of the deferred interest store cards).\n\nFor example: You calculate that you need $2K in an emergency credit line. You check your available credit (not counting store cards because you can only use them in their corresponding stores) and see that you have $2100 available credit. Charge your next $100 of purchases (cell phone bill, groceries, gas, etc.) to your Chase card. If you have less than $100 available credit on you Chase card, max it out, and then use your BOA until you get back to $2K available credit. Then, take that $100 cash that you would have spent on groceries and put it towards your personal loan.\n\nWhat happened?: You just indirectly performed a balance transfer. You took $100 of your 33% debt and moved it to your 19% card.\n\nWhat will happen?: As you continue doing this, you will move your debt to be in the most interest advantageous position possible. Each month, you make minimum payments on all your cards, some of that goes to interest, some of that goes to principal. You're taking the amount that went to principal and \"moving\" it to apply to the personal loan principal instead. Eventually, you will pay off your store cards, max out all your other credit cards except the AMEX (which will be your emergency credit card), and make even larger payments on the personal loan.\n\nWhen you pay off the personal loan: You can switch to the regular avalanche method to pay off your cards, or you can continue using the super-avalanche to speed up payments on you highest interest card.\n\nIf Murphy throws you another curve ball and you lose your job again: You have cash to pay your mortgage, car payment, and minimum payment on your emergency credit card (to keep it active). You have the emergency credit card to pay your other bills as they come up until you find another job.\n\nLet me know: If you need me to clarify anything in this post.","name":"t1_d3tlfs3","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-02 22:48:51","week":22}
{"id":"d3tmh2t","author":"PresNixon","body":"So two years ago, that's when I was getting the things like Credit One and First Premier (predatory cards, unless you pay them in full to avoid the interest).  About six months after that I got some cards that I still have - an Amazon store card and a Walmart store card (no Visa or MC, just flat out store credit).  \n\nI let those linger for another six months, then I got my first \"real\" credit card - A Barclaycard.  Around that time I had to cancel my First Premier and my Credit One card, because they were about to charge their \"annual fee\" and start the \"monthly fee\" as well.  \n\nAbout a year and 3 months from the start of all this, I got a Capital One Quicksilver card.  It had my first \"real\" limit, of $3000.  After six months of on-time payments, I got an automatic bump to $3500.\n\nRecently, with my score on the rise, I applied for all the nicer cards.  I got an NFL Card (not really nicer, but does have an $8000 limit), an Amex Everyday card w/ $1000, a Chase Freedom Unlimited card with $3000, a Chase Slate w/ $3000, and another store card with $6500.  \n\nMy goal, as always, is just to pay off everything at the end of the month.  The Chase Slate card was a balance transfer from a larger purchase I made with the idea of getting a ton of rewards points, then sliding over to a 0% for 15 months card w/ Slate.  I'll have that paid off in about 6 months or so, which was by design and well budgeted for.\n\nSo the short answer to your question is, about 1 year 10 months.  I waited until Credit Karma gave me the \"very good\" odds of approval.  And as soon as I was approved for one, I just kinda' kept going.  It's going to lower my average age of credit, but that's already the worst thing on my report with only 3 years.  I figured I'd get it out of the way now, so I have time to show responsibility with this level of credit before I try to purchase a house.","name":"t1_d3tmh2t","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-02 23:12:37","week":22}

You can get to Amazon levels of the robots bringing the items to the pickers, but as soon as you have to unwrap a pallet and put something on a shelf you need a human.\n\nRobots can do constrained repetitive tasks, like flipping burgers, extremely well.

{"id":"d3tye6j","author":"Hexaplorer","body":"Unless you have a contactless card you don't need to worry about having an RFID shield in the wallet/bag. Your info can't be received by an RFID skimmer without your card transmitting the info from an RFID chip. \n\nAs far as bags go, I prefer Travelon East/West Hobo. Steel cables inside the strap so someone can't cut it off you in a hurry, wire mesh in the fabric so they can't slash your bag passing by, clipped zippers so they can't unzip your bag without you noticing, a carabiner on the strap so you can loop it around your chair when sitting down to eat and no one can snatch it without taking the chair (and you) with it, that particular one does have a pocket with an RFID shield for a few cards and a passport just in case you've got RFID stuff you want in there. \n\nIt's not the most stylish thing out there, but it'll keep your stuff safe from thieves (muggings aside). It's got a decent amount of room inside too. Look up Travelon's stuff on their site for more options- but don't buy it from them, Google search merchants with the bag you want and then use a portal to get some extra cash back (e.g. ebags usually has a cheaper price and a cash back deal via the portal). If you need it yesterday then Amazon usually has their bags on prime.\n\nAs far as cash and cards go, I bring two wallets each with a set of cards. One wallet stays in the hotel safe, the other goes around town with me (take one Visa DC and one MC DC and divide them up between your wallets). Take 1 day's worth of cash with you and the rest leave in the hotel safe. I hate using the undershirt wallets because they annoy me, so I just use a nice wallet that is large enough to hold currency of various sizes. \n\nI take my passport with me around town- in Egypt they suggested I take it in case we were stopped and they asked to see our visa or ID and needed the original, in Japan to get the tax waivers you need to show your passport, in France sometimes they ask for your passport for tourist discounts and such like for the Tourist Navigo cards. The point is that it may be good to keep handy for various reasons. I keep a color photocopy in the safe (of the info page and any visa stickers they placed in there), and take a picture of them so I have an electronic copy in my phone.

The reason is we perceive (especially in today's world with Amazon Prime) shipping as something that does not add value and therefore should not have a cost associated with it.  Additionally, when we receive the product, we attach a monetary value to it and we are satisfied with that as it is a tangible thing that we can see.\n\nAnecdotally, I have to catch myself while shopping on Amazon if something is not on Prime, I find myself looking at a widget available from 2 sellers, each with equal seller ratings.  Seller #1 sells it for  $25 with free shipping.  Seller #2 sells it for $15 + $8 shipping.  Instinctively, I find myself wanting to purchase from seller #1 because \"FREE SHIPPING\", but I force myself to buy from seller #2 because it is cheaper overall, and even though I know it is cheaper and it is the right thing to do, I will sit there for several minutes arguing with myself that the \"free shipping\" option is not as good a deal.\n\nThe exception to this would be if you are charging a flat delivery rate whether you order 1 product or 10 products, then a delivery fee might be a better perceived deal.","name":"t1_d3u0bsx","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-03 05:11:21","week":22}

{"id":"d3u476b","author":"Leonid99","body":"There are (at least) two aspects, technological and legal.\n\nIt might be not obvious for a non-technical person, but the problem they are trying to solve is amazingly difficult. They need to match millions of clients with millions of cars. The cars break down, the clients change their minds and cancel the rides. The cellular coverage is spotty, the GPS in a built-up area works like shit. Geographical algorithms are notoriously complicated -- the app needs to tell you when your ride will be here, and suppose there is a river between you and the driver closest to you, and there is a traffic jam on the only bridge and, because of the GPS, they don't even know if the driver took the turn to the bridge or not, and the next U-turn is 10 miles down the road. All this needs to happen really fast, at the order of magnitude of single milliseconds. They need to maintain huge datacenters in multiple locations, which is amazingly expensive (real-estate, servers need to be bought, fixed and upgraded, electricity, air conditioning). They also deal with payments, which means that their systems need to be really secure and comply with different data security regulations in hundreds of jurisdictions.\n\nThese problems are so difficult that there are only a handful of companies worldwide that tackle them (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix and such), sometimes even none. That means that they need to invest in solving these problems from scratch instead of hiring people who already know the right answer. An average software engineer costs 150-200k a year, they have several hundreds (maybe even thousands) engineers and have been for years.\n\nAnd then there are legal problems. Taxis is a highly regulated industry. It's also very lucrative for the cities where the taxis operate. To become a taxi driver you need to pay for both a special kind of driver license and a license to operate a taxi in a given city. I read somewhere that a price for a taxi \"medallion\" in NYC is close to 1 million dollars to be paid to the city. Uber are trying to claim that they are not taxis, it's just people driving other people around, and hence they don't need to pay all this. Cities sue Uber for operating taxis without licenses. Ubers operate in hundreds of different jurisdictions all around the world, so they need to litigate and employ lawyers literally everywhere.","name":"t1_d3u476b","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-06-03 07:07:22","week":22}

{"id":"d3ukgp7","author":"imjustmatthew","body":"I have this problem and am also cheap. My solution was to get 2 box fans and the correct size of 3M filtrete filters from Amazon, then duct tape the filter to the intake side of the fans.\n\nFor this to work you need to run the fans as intakes and then open a couple windows as exhausts (in engineer speak you're created a positive pressure inside the house using the filtered air). Ideally put the fans in the bottom part of downstairs windows and open the top half of some double-hung windows upstairs so you can also make convection work for you.\n\nOn caveat: you will loose ~50% of the air volume (mass flow rate) from the fan by adding a filter. Box fans are not made to push air through things like filters. This means you may need to run the fans at a slightly higher (and louder) setting to move the air volume you want. It's still going to be cheaper than using the A/C, but it may mean you put the fans in places like a living room or kitchen and make the bedroom the fanless exhaust window.","name":"t1_d3ukgp7","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-06-03 17:36:40","week":22}

{"id":"d3uky7p","author":"longtailwriting","body":"**warning: I am going to give a bit extra info here! These are my numbers. They may not be your numbers**\n\nMy account: About 70% of my SKU's are used books (617 SKU's total). I have about 337 active SKU's right now. I try to sell sub million unless the profit margin is really good. Amazon rank isn't everything, because a 4 million book can spike to 200k  (or lower) with just one sale. My floor is $7.99 per book. Anything lower than that and I feel like I am losing money. (That's around $4.4 after fees, $1.5 to ship to FBA [labels, box, shipping fee] , $0.75 average to buy book, $1.15 gas/software/etc... leaving me with a $1. Fantastic profit margin, but a tiny sale) Most of my books generally sell for $10-$15.\n\nFor me, I would estimate 40% of everything I send in sells in the first month, 7% every month after that. So, the ideal would be to ship 100 books to FBA at the same time. However, if you can't do that, perhaps use the 7% marker?\n\nFor example, using the 7% after the first month marker, 50 books per month would have you at 40 sales in about 1.25 years. What does that reveal? Books are a volume game. I would recommend getting a handheld scanner (I have a bluetooth scanner myself). I can go to Goodwill outlet, scan a couple hundred books in an hour, and whittle that down to 22 books per visit. Go once per week, that's 88 books a month, or selling about 40 things by month 2 or so.\n\n**Again. These are my numbers.

One weekend I made myself get together my first shipment, which was about 30 items in 4 boxes. I think by starting out small, I reduced the chances of error.\n\nWithin a few days of my shipments being checked in at the various Amazon warehouses, I started getting sales, which was very gratifying! And the sales were items that I had not had success selling on eBay.\n\nI guess my advice as an FBA noob is to read/watch Amazon's tutorials and instructions and make sure you understand their product labeling and shipment labeling rules.

{"id":"d3urld1","author":"TheAnimus","body":"&gt;  there are some legal discovery processes that eliminate junior lawyers.\n\nNo they reduce the workload.  I'm not aware of a significant decline in junior lawyers.\n\nThe other problem with AI, I always use self driving cars as a good example, is edge cases.  I live in London, it's a busy city with roads that are too small.  Some fuckwit parks a van sometimes just on the corner where our road joins the main road.  This means you've no visibility onto the main road.  This makes turning into the road unsafe.  This example might not ring true if you are used to roads in Florida, but in the narrow built up streets of a european city it does.  The analogy is you can't safely pull out into the road.  You can slowly nudge forward, but there is little you can do until you are blocking at least part of the road.  This is technically illegal, but everyone does it, you couldn't get onto the main road if you didn't.  Writing an AI that could manage that is a very hard task.  By comparison driving on a motorway is easy.  But without that edge case being solved, I'm still going to need a meatbag to drive an Uber for me.\n\nThere is an 80/20 rule in engineering, AI is no different.  You aren't going to get a sudden 100% reduction in the number of lawyers.\n\nMeanwhile we've whole new industries that didn't exist in the same way before, industries that are growing, mostly service based ones.  Myself I think of how many 'services' I would use in a day 10 years ago vs now.  The smartphone has made my consumption of them so much easier.  It's not that Uber is taking jobs away from taxi drivers, but I'm making more trips than I previously ever did.  Amazon delivering something in an hour, or even just later that day, I'm consuming more things than I did before, and it costs me less money because of the efficiency gains.\n\nAs an example of automation I think Amazon are a posterchild, the money I save using them over the old shop that might have employed more people, I use to buy more things, other services, from other people too.\n\nThere are so many things that are very hard to close that 80/20 problem on, that change will happen slowly, and we will be having opportunity for employment in the new areas, whilst we wait for the 80/20 in that area to close and so forth.  It won't be until AI and automation are creating the new things almost entirely that there is a problem.  That day might come, but as it does come 'wealth inequality' will become less meaningful.  I've a £45 travel smartphone, it's got the same features as my £400 normal use phone, just a little bit *better*, there isn't one thing my expensive one can do that the crap one can't.  Sure the screen isn't as nice, the touch response is a bit frustrating, but the point is the efficiency gains have made the functionality gap almost negligible.  As we have more automated, more efficient services, this will have the same effect on poverty.\n\nThink of some dickensian description of poverty.  Now think of what poverty is today in London.  Someone who is technically still in poverty will have food, water, shelter, tv, internet with it's unparalleled knowledge that even the wealthiest elites couldn't have before.  As we ebb towards a fully autonomous society, this kind of inequality trend I hope will continue.  The person who is poor has a Blu brand phone, that does everything the more expensive one does, *sort of*.","name":"t1_d3urld1","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-06-03 20:10:14","week":22}

You get those customers through organic traffic, i.e people already searching and browsing on Amazon, or through search engine marketing (your customer will Google search for those key words I mentioned befoare - and Amazon has pretty good SEO so those links will get seen and clicked to your Amazon product page)...  \n\nIronically, if you want to \"move\" the customer base, that will be quite hard to beat the Amazon SEO rankings you worked so hard to perfect. A better strategy is to generate a completely different customer base for your site. \n\nFor example, let your products keep selling on Amazon and consider that customer base A. Next, build your Shopify (or whatever ecommerce) store at nickmaddoxsenzyautodetailproducts.com and generate a completely new customer base for it. You can do this by creating helpful free content (YouTube videos, blog articles) to attract customers, or through advertising on Google AdWords or Facebook Ads, etc. There are many other ways to generate traffic.

Marvel (aka: That big ass company called Disney), however, will sue the crap out of you.\n\n5. You're better sourcing directly.

In the case of FB the revenue, profitability and growth are all great. But when you compare them to similar tech companies with a market cap like theirs, you see how crazy the premium you are paying is. They'd have to continue growing everything like crazy for a very long time simply to justify their current valuation. There is no way you could make a reasonable case that they are undervalued, so there is no edge there, in my view. UA (Under Armour) is a similar story. AMZN as well but with them, you can buy in to their narrative of plowing all their profit back into growth and the numbers start to look favorable.

They double the cash back you get in the first year, so it's effectively 2%. There are also categories every quarter that get 5% (10% the first year) and the categories are quite good (restaurants, grocery stores, gas, Amazon.com). At the end of the first year you can sign up for a Double Cash if you really want 2% forever or you can even sign up for another Discover It.\n\nYou should also consider cards with a sign up bonus, since even a $100 sign up bonus requires you to spend $5000 on a 2% cash back card (none of them have sign up bonuses) just to make $100. Chase Freedom is an obvious one that comes with a $150 sign up bonus after $500 spent in the first 3 months, and Amex Blue Cash Everyday has a $100 bonus after $1000 spend and gets 3% at supermarkets.\n\nCSP gets a lot of mention because of the high sign up bonus and the high value per point you can get on travel redemptions. This sub is mostly focused on travel redemptions due to the high value you can get from points, but it can also require a lot of planning and research. The cash back game is a lot simpler, you basically need the Double Cash for anything that gets less than 2% cash back, the two 5% cash back cards (Discover It, Freedom), and maybe a few other cards that get 3% cash back (Blue Cash, Costco, etc).","name":"t1_d3vbo9x","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-06-04 04:47:28","week":22}

{"id":"d3vph9s","author":"redddit_rabbbit","body":"You have a lot of good financial advice in this thread. If you wanted to avoid things like HELOC and taking out new lines of credit (neither of which are bad ideas, but both of which can be daunting if you feel like you're drowning in debt), this is still doable. You will be at it for a couple of years, and it is going to be daunting, but it is very doable. Here's my strategy:\n\n\nAs others have mentioned, pay the minimums on your cards and pick one debt to focus on at once. When I started paying down my debt, I was doing the same thing that you were--it didn't occur to me that by focusing on one debt at a time, I could actually free up money in minimum payments. So, pay your minimums.\n\nYou should start off by paying off that Amazon card. It is your highest card interest rate and that deferred interest is scary. You also cannot sustain putting every dollar you have toward your debt--you have to be able to eat. So I am going to take $200 a month out of your extra debt payment. You also need to follow the advice of others in this thread--cut coupons, cook cheaply, no eating out, etc. Look to cut the phone bill. Make that non debt payment go as far as you can. But back to debt payment:\n\n\nYou should put your extra $390 in debt payment (henceforth known as EDP) toward your Amazon card for the next three months, in addition to the minimum payment. Poof! Done with card one! Adding the minimum Amazon payment to your EDP, we get 415. It is now August.\n\nAugust: Time to pay off your Amex. You now have 415 of EDP, added to your minimum of 126. That's 541 toward your Amex. This will take you about 5.5-6 months to pay off. Let's be conservative and say it's now February. You have an additional 126 to put toward your EDP, which is now, you guessed it, 541.\n\nFebruary 2017: Time for the Barclays--we want to avoid that deferred interest. Your EDP plus your minimum payment is 596. This is going to take about 6 months to pay off completely, but we're going to take a break for a month then get back to it.\n\nMarch 2017: Pay off your Lowes card with your EDP of 641.\n\nApril 2017: Back to Barclays! Keep paying it down. This brings us to July, with a new EDP of 596.\n\nJuly 2017: Capital One time! Your EDP plus minimum is 746. Your current Capital One balance will be about 6600 at this point. That's ok! Look at how much EDP you have to throw at it. Capital One is going to take about 9-10 months. This brings us to April 2018.\n\nApril 2018: New EDP: 746. Time for BofA. Total BofA payment of 771. Your balance at this point is going to be less than 3000, but lets call it 3000 to be conservative. Under 5 months to pay this down! Let's say we can move on in August.\n\nAugust 2018: New EDP of 771. LAST CARD. Time for Chase! We're looking at a balance of about 4100. Payment of 800 even. Six months! By January 2019 you will have no credit card debt, and only one debt left.\n\nJanuary 2019: Save this month's EDP, plus $200 of next month's. You now have a $1000 emergency fund.\n\nFebruary 2019: Throw everything you have at your personal loan. You will have your entire payment of over 1300. Pay it down, pay it down, pay it down. The end is near, and you WILL make it.","name":"t1_d3vph9s","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-06-04 15:52:19","week":22}

Not to sound arrogant, but when I made the announcement to colleagues that I was leaving the industry I am in, I received multiple job offers across the US. It was quite nice to feel loved, but I decided I would never be happy in any of them and would waste away.\n\nLike you, I was nervous but determined to make it work. The steps I took were these and I hope they can help:\n\n* Opened a fake LinkedIn account and used it to search for and view profiles of people at companies and in the industry I would like to work for. Made notes of their skills and highlights and combined the common denominators as skills I should develop or highlight on my resume.\n* Used the above to transfer skills from my old résumé to the new one (by the way, people freak out if you use the accents in résumé and it actually was a key element having an interview offered).\n* Contacted friends/family/anyone to explain what I was doing and ask for advice. I landed my job via this network.\n* Ask for advice. Just no strings attached advice and, in turn, offer help/assistance as you transition and get connected. Networking.\n* Lucrative careers don't just drop into your lap and you need to work hard to get the job that will set you up for that. If you define lucrative as Amazon or Google, be prepared to work long long long hours in a very competitive environment.

Back in the day, you could get almost everything with free two day shipping no matter what. Now, a large chunk of inventory isn't eligible, a lot of stuff that is eligible has restrictions, and almost every \"prime eligible\" item is sold at an upcharge.

{"id":"d3wkt3x","author":"Greg_allan","body":"That's a subjective and general statement. The working class includes more than manufacturing jobs. I often find a similar irony among people who oppose free trade. They all dislike free trade because it outsources jobs and leaves people unemployed due to the recently outsourced jobs. But, if you ask most of them where they buy a lot of their goods they will say Amazon or another online distributer. They forget that the internet is responsible for major job losses in retail stores. And even when I explain this irony to people they brush it off by saying it's easier and cheaper to buy online.  No one cares about all the retail jobs that were lost because those people can find work elsewhere in different fields. But back to your point that \"the working class\" doesn't like free trade, I'd have to disagree with that. My girlfriends dad is a plumber/handyman, which I'd say is a typical working class job.

{"id":"d3wtagr","author":"zipadyduda","body":"First suggestion, unless you have some trick up your sleeve, you have better chances of a successful startup if you are selling items that are more expensive. The reason is that you will have low traffic and a small budget for adwords, facebook marketing, etc. You have to be laser focused and extract maximum cash from each and every transaction. \nDo the math, say you make $15 profit on each sale. You need to sell 70 a week just to keep eating at taco bell and crashing on your mom's couch. These kinds of trinkets are great for an appetizer or dessert, but not a main course. You could use it as part of a longer game to develop a customer base to which you can eventually sell more expensive items, but I think that's backwards. \nAlternately, if you have a good supplier, you might be able to get enough customers by selling this stuff on Amazon. But that's a different game then what we are talking about I think. \nFor a great example and case study for selling stuff in your niche, follow these guys. http://whippingpost.com/\n\nAlso, your photos are not good enough. They are good, like a C+. But you have to realize that everything online now is at the highest level. If they are not an A+, it's immediately recognizable if not subconsciously. People can't touch your products, the photos have to inspire the imagination by telling a story of touching them.  Refer to the whipping post example. Many of their photos include men's hands touching rugged stuff. If they had photos at the level of yours, they would be out of business fast. The products look like stuff you get at a swap meet for a dollar. I think you might have a hard time selling those for that price, at least the way those photos you have now make them look. \n\nYour copy also is way sub par.

{"id":"d3wvvxu","author":"Murphy1d","body":"Some people will tell you to try [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). I tried it, and didn't like trying to budget on a monthly basis. I worked better on a bi-weekly basis, or each paycheck. So I decided I work better with excel spreadsheets. It was simple, I listed down the first column all the names of bills/ food estimates/ entertainment est./ Gas est./ annual taxes/ monthly subscriptions/ holiday &amp; vacation costs/ etc.  Then listed across the top of the rows all the pay dates I had over the next 2 years. Then I plugged in all the bills based upon when they would be due (will I pay out of bi-monthly Paycheck 1 or 2, do I have to save a few bucks each month to prepare for a tax bill, or annual Amazon Prime subscription in Feb?). This of course coincided with the due date of the bill. Then I plugged in a \"sum\" formula that added all the bills up each payday. Then I plugged in another formula right below it that said \"I have X$ per paycheck, minus Y$ of bills, what does that leave me this paycheck?\" Once I did this it changed my whole view. I immediately saw where I was spending too much, and where the yearly bills kept blind-siding me. I saw where, if I paid $25 Bill A early on THIS paycheck I could have an extra $25 on the NEXT paycheck which I could combine with that paycheck's \"extra money\" into a savings account, and I can budget for that NOW. I would go back every few days and update the actual costs during the week (I may budget $80 for 2 weeks of food, but spend $95). Each time I would update with actual $$ I would see how close to zero my money WOULD be in the next week, and how far off my estimates were. SO I stopped doing stupid things, and started seeing where I could actually save a little (now 10% of each paycheck) and still be OK. Soon I had enough to protect me when accidents happened. Now I am much more comfortable and out of the weeds (as it were).  ","name":"t1_d3wvvxu","subreddit":"FinancialPlanning","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwze","created_utc":"2016-06-05 17:23:58","week":22}

If I remember correctly 1 in every 10 clicks will have the amazon affiliate ID changed to the developers to help them earn from it too.\n\nOnce you have earned a little from the site you can go on codecanyon.com and look at the custom scripts on there that can do it for you but they are paid and prices vary depending on the functionality you want.","name":"t1_d3x9o0r","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-06-05 23:28:15","week":22}

What most international workers seem to be doing now to get cash is buying PSN and Xbox cards to resell because those can be bought with Amazon credit.
