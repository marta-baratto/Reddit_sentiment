{"id":"46z1fo","author":"Keyare","body":"We've opened up our arms and accepted Bitcoin as the de-facto emerging currency of the future.\n\nThe past two months have seen a radical transformation in our software and identity. We've completely stipped down and redesigned our code, our purpose and with the launch of the new Syscoin 2.0 \"Shade\" wallet in the next few weeks we are reshaping ourselves from a simple 'altcoin' to a Bitcoin enabling suite of applications complimented and powered by the SYS token. \n\n\nRather than building a \"walled garden\" and forcing everyone to use SYS to appreciate the fruits of that garden, we've enabled buying and selling within the SYS decentralized marketplace using Bitcoin. Dust amounts of the Syscoin token (SYS) will be required to fuel the network and enable advanced features but most purchases can be made directly using Bitcoin. This insulates merchants from possible volatility in SYS price and brings incredible value to Bitcoin users. Based on service utilization SYS fees may be burned rather than returned to miners- actively decreasing the SYS supply as marketplace usage increases.\n\n\nThe new Syscoin 2.0 wallet features a built-in decentralized marketplace anyone can use to buy and sell goods and services without moderation, political interference, downtime, requiring hosting or even a 24/7 internet connection. If you, your business or friends have services you'd like to offer in exchange for BTC/SYS/USD/etc those services can be offered, advertised, resold (if enabled) and procured all using the Syscoin marketplace. Syscoin 2.0 also offers fiat-price pegging based on current exchange rates. Now you can list your good or service priced in USD/EUR/GBP/etc and know that upon sale you'll recieve enough SYS to convert to the desired amount of fiat currency. Additional advanced services such as Aliases, Escrow, Certificates, Encrypted Messaging and Price Pegging are now included but are currently only available using the SYS token. Enabling these advanced features for Bitcoin are part of our post-hardfork plans.\n\n\nFuture plans also include e-commerce plugins for major platforms such as Shopify, Magento, Opencart and PrestaShop as well as integration options or import filters to use with eBay, Etsy and Amazon. Support for additional altcoins will also be examined, and we'll be rolling out additional wallet design improvements and mobile experiences as well. \n\nSyscoin is very similar to another open-source decentraized marketplace project called OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar is a peer-to-peer service like bittorrent. With OpenBazaar your computer is required to be online 24/7 or another node with a cache of your items must be online - if not, your items are not visible for sale/purchase. Because the implementation is p2p based rather than blockchain based, the anti-forgery mechanisms provided by the blockchain are not present in OpenBazaar. Some features such as encrypted messaging and escrow work differently in Syscoin as compared to OpenBazaar as they're secured by the network consensus mechanism within the Syscoin network.\n\n\nSyscoin is an open-source blockchain based application. Every Syscoin transaction, listing and encrypted message is persisted on the blockchain regardless of your connection to the internet. All information is secured using SYS pub/priv keys and ECIES encryption by default. Syscoin does not have private funding like OpenBazaar; instead we have passion. We have been building this as a product for the last two years for free. You can't invest in OpenBazaar, but you can invest in Syscoin!\n\n\nThe Syscoin 2.0 hard fork is slated for the beginning of March. Maximum coin count will drop from 2 billion to 6.68 Million. For clarity we are referring to them as SYS1 and SYS2 but the new token will continue to be traded as SYS. Current SYS1 holders will have little to no issues switching to SYS2. Current wallets will be compatible with SYS2 and there will be no time limit on conversion. Exchanges will also automatically convert all SYS1 to SYS2. We are working with exchanges to help them through this process. The conversion will operate on a simple ratio; 1 SYS2 per every 299.4 SYS1. The fork will also switch Syscoin from a Scrypt algorithm that is merge-mineable with Litecoin to a SHA-256 algorithm which is merge-mineable with Bitcoin (larger network, more security and stability). This gives our network much more bandwidth and scalability into the future.\n\n\nMore information at: http://syscoin.org/syscoin-2-0-february-interim-update/","name":"t3_46z1fo","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","created_utc":"2016-02-22 04:53:15","week":8}

SpotBot tracks Amazon spot instance prices and provide alerts based on high and/or low thresholds, e.g.  \"Bid Price Alert: 15 minute low of $0.314400 greater than $0.20 for us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1d,us-east-1d\"\n* TL;DR: A side project to take a Slack Bot I wrote for my own use and offer it as a service, everything works, but the project is on hold while I get to cruising height with my primary startup.\n* After having some Amazon AWS Spot Price pain in another project, I thought I would take the Slack Bot I created to monitor prices and make it available as a subscription service. My first version was a simple bash script run on a chron job that worked well for my needs. My plan was to offer a single alert for free, then eventually offer more services for a small subscription.\n* I had some great feedback from other AWS powered startups and even an offer for a testimonial just based on what I had done for myself.\n* I put together a mailchimp sign-up form and grabbed [spotbot.io](https://spotbot.io), then I ported the backend to python and redis both to hold subscriptions and (eventually) cache prices to reduce the back-and-forth to AWS. My idea for the MVP was to take subscriptions via MailChimp and just manually add each subscription  to the system rather than spending time building a UX that could handle all of the complicated options.\n* I put the static site up using Netlify and ran the backend on the same Digital Ocean server that had been running my bash script.\n* Meanwhile... My primary startup, [Bright Canopy](https://brightcanopy.com) consumed more and more of my time with crises timed with uncanny accuracy to kill my interest in adding another project to the mix, until I had to abandon SpotBot and focus on BrightCanopy. So I'm off doing BC work right now (which predictably, immediately calmed down again), and this side project is on hold for the moment. You can see the source [on GitHub](https://github.com/ScriptGadget/spotbot) I'll probably return to it when I can to give it the time it deserves. If there's someone who wants to take it over, I'm open to that too. It's still a pretty cool way to solve a real problem.  \n* Lessons Learned: Startups take alot out of you. Two at a time sounds possible, but it really isn't if both are in the early stages. \"I have to work on SpotBot\" just wouldn't have been a valid excuse for neglecting BC, so I couldn't go there. Also, scratching your own itch is fine, but once it's well and truly scratched it's harder to get motivated to add features you don't personally need. This likely wouldn't have been a problem if I had started with five paying customers.\n\n---\n\n**/u/bhearne**\n\n* \"Create an online marketplace for services targeted at expats and digital nomads. When arriving at a new place where you don’t speak the language it can be really difficult to get settled in.

Still working out some issues now that there's more \"real data\" and hoping to have the windows client pushed out in the coming weeks.  \n*​ Interest is really strong, although there are a few comments here and there indicating that the marketing pages could use more work (people don't understand what it works with - i.e. almost everything). Because it's an installed app, people are also having trouble completing that step after signing up,  so the next phase will also include better walkthroughs on how to get started. So that first-run experience is proving to be very crucial.  \n*​ 6 weeks is incredibly short, although it has been really motivating. Although I wasn't ever \"field of dreams\" naiveté, I was hoping for better responses to some of my marketing efforts. I was certainly naive about how long it would take me to make the content. I'm just beginning to go full-steam on content marketing and other channels to bring in future customers.

{"id":"47a17t","author":"pandabeards","body":"Hi /r/frugal! I've been lurking for a while, but this will be my first post~ I'm currently paying a little over $100 each month for 1gb data and unlimited talk+text with Verizon, which includes the $35 device payment. I've got another 20 device payments to go after this month's, and there's nothing more that can be done to lower my bill (to the best of my knowledge)—and while they'll allow paying off the device entirely, they do not allow paying down the balance left.\n\nThe bill is insane. I love my phone and the service+coverage, but it doesn't make sense with my budget. So, I've been doing a little research, and I think I may have come up with a plan to save me about $70 a month after an initial investment.\n\nStep 1: I cancel Verizon, and I'll have to pay the remaining device balance + cancellation fee (700+300?). Pretty steep, but bear with me.\n\nFor those keeping a tally, that's (100x20)-(700+300+30x20)=400, or (monthly VZW x months until the device is paid off) minus (device payment + cancellation fee + the monthly cost over the same months of a T-mobile plan I'll cover in step 4). That's a savings of $400 over two years.\n\nStep 2: Sell the phone. I think I could get $550 for my iPhone 6s+ 64gb grey either through Amazon or locally through craigslist etc. Then, I'd move on to... \n\nStep 3: Buy the OnePlus X for $200 (and the t-mobile sim/plan bundle and pay about $30 a month for unlimited text, 5gb LG data, and 100mins talk—this is the plan I refer to in my math below step one).\n\nSo, updated math: ((100x20)-(700+300+30x20))+(550-200)=$750 saved over 20 months.\n\nThis may not seem like much to some, especially with the initial investment, but I'll be able to pay that sometime in the coming months without hurting my budget or any savings. Here are the benefits I think I've found:\n* 4gb more data per month\n* The OnePlus X allows for either two sim cards or 1 sim and one mSD, up 120gb maybe? This would be killer for me; I eat storage with music and productivity apps.\n* I would be paying $70 less a month, and this is SO much better for my budget.\n\nThere may be some things I'm not considering, like the cancellation fee with Verizon may be a little higher, there are some sales taxes and possibly additional fees left unaccounted for. Still, that may only drop the overall savings down to $600, and that's not bad. And over the following year, when the phone would have been paid off with Verizon, I would save $420 and have more data.\n\nAll of that said, there are probably things I'm not considering, maybe some additional fees or things that could prohibit the entire endeavour. Still, does this seem like a sound plan? Have any advice?\n\nEdit: Updated characters used in the math; the asterisks formerly used just italicized bits, heh.","name":"t3_47a17t","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-02-24 02:30:27","week":8}

{"id":"47genj","author":"mjeff611","body":"A few weeks ago I discovered a product on clearance at a local store.  Turns out the item was selling for a pretty significant profit on Amazon so I sent it in.  After my supply ran out I looked around to find another source but I also realized that this product had a duplicate listing on Amazon.  The main listing, with the lower (more favorable) ranking, better pictures, and more information sold for the price you would pay for it at the store.  The second listing sold for a few times that price and still had a decent sales rank.  \n\nSo I ended up buying a bunch of these items and sending them in and they all sell out pretty quickly.  I just placed a re-order when I got a return request (I don't know the reason why yet) and it had me worried so I checked out the two identical listings.  Turns out the Lower Sales (which sells for less) ranked item is the item I am selling.  The listing that I am selling under is actually for a smaller quantity.\n\nThe smaller package size is no longer sold (per the manufacturer) which is probably why it went on clearance.  I'm concerned that this could result in returns or negative action from Amazon but than I'm not exactly sure why.  At the end of the day the listing is identical except for a small weight description at the bottom of the details.  And if anything the customer is getting more of the product than they thought.  The packaging is exactly the same only a larger size (about twice as big).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

{"id":"47gfsp","author":"humanscience","body":"We submitted this post to /r/Investing back in September, but we're still looking for more parents!\n\nHi /r/Investing,\n\nThis is Lauren Min and Lawrence Williams, two researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We would like your help with a research study on college savings. For our research, we are recruiting people who are interested in opening a 529 College Savings Plan but have not done so yet. We will ask you a few questions, and ask you to visit the website of a well known financial institution to learn more about their 529 plan.\n\nFor participating in our research, you will be entered into a raffle for a $25 Amazon e-gift card. Our survey should take 5-10 minutes, plus any time you decide to spend on the external 529 website--how long you spend on that website will be up to you. The odds of winning will be 1 in 50, or better.\n\nUnfortunately, our budget is not unlimited. Once we reach 300 started surveys, the survey link will deactivate. We will update this post to let you know when the study is dead. Winners will be notified within 24 hours after we close the study. At the end of the survey, we will redirect you to a different survey (to preserve anonymity) in which we will ask for your e-mail address. If you are a winner, we will e-mail you with details on redeeming your e-gift card.\n\nWe ask that you only take this survey if you meet the following criteria:\n\n1. You are over the age of 18. \n2. You are a parent to a child 3 years old or younger. \n3. You have some interest in opening a 529 College Savings Plan but have not done so yet.\n\nHere is the link to the survey:\nhttp://leeds.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4ORwlIwvDoBCvyZ\n\n","name":"t3_47gfsp","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-25 02:26:19","week":8}

{"id":"47guct","author":"datetodoor","body":"Hi guys. I started Date to Door through this sub about a year ago. After generating decent side money, I decided to sell the business so I could move on to something else. Several of you guys, along with my wife, convinced me to keep it instead and try to grow it this year. \n\nDate to Door plans creative date nights and curates all of the materials needed for the date night in one box. So essentially, we are a subscription date night box company. I started out planning a new date every month. This got old pretty quickly. I couldn't hold inventory because every month was changing. That led to pivot number 1.\n\n\nOk, so it wasn't much of a pivot as much as it was a big improvement in my sanity. I decided to create a fixed number of date night boxes and number them 1-N. Everyone who orders for the first time gets Box 1, then Box 2, then Box 3. Now I can hold a lot of inventory for Box 1 and less inventory for each box along the way.\n\nPivot number 3 happened yesterday and I'm looking for validation from you guys. As an additional revenue stream, I opened up a shop on my website for people to go and find date night supplies on their own - http://www.datetodoor.com/spa-night/ Each link is just an Amazon affiliate link. The questions I have for you guys are as follows:\n\n- Do you think this is a good idea to add on to the site? Does it fit in?\n\n- Is this an appropriate use of Amazon Affiliate links?\n\n- Lastly, do you think the stuff on each of the shop pages are decent enough? Am I missing anything or should I drop some stuff?\n\n\n\nThanks for the help everyone!","name":"t3_47guct","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-25 03:55:00","week":8}
{"id":"47gv5r","author":"melissamonte","body":"This is a long one but I think it's a great resource I wanted to share. I realize it's slightly different from the posts on this thread as all of those seem to focus on one specifically per post. But there's just a wealth of info here. I didn't take the time to add all the links from the original post but you can find the [Original post with links here](https://getlenny.com/50-ways-to-make-money-for-less-than-500/)\n\n1. Sell Custom Goods on Etsy\n\nNowadays, you can sell just about anything on Etsy, a website designed to allow creators and designers to share their artwork with the world. If you have a talent, it can probably be showcased here. One great example involves etching , but you can also sell woodwork, clothing, graphics, books, and games.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nAnything that can help you create your masterpiece. If you etch, you should find an affordable Cricut, as well as Glass Etching Adhesive. If you design clothing, you’ll need to look for fabric and sewing materials. When in doubt, you can usually find everything you need at Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores or Michaels Craft Stores.\n\n \n\n2. Create Custom Book Bags\n\nLet’s zero-in on a specific creation, for just a moment. You’re in college, right? You need to make money, but you don’t know where to start. Why not utilize the people around you? Designing custom book bags is a fantastic (and cheap) way to earn cash. All you need is a creative eye, and enough time to bring your ideas to life.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nIf you want to make quality book bags, you’ll need a sewing machine (which can be found on Amazon in the Arts, Crafts &amp; Sewing section), as well as some canvas fabric and thread. Again, you’ll find many of your necessities at local craft stores.\n\n3. Fix Broken Phones\n\nYou know how heartbreaking a broken phone can be. Why not get into the business of fixing them yourself? You’ll be hailed as a hero on campus, and you’ll make plenty of extra cash from the ongoing stream of business.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nFirst of all, you’ll need to read this article about fixing iPhones. There’s more than enough information there to get you started. Secondly, you’ll need to buy a Pro Tech Toolkit, a 54 Bit Driver Kit, and a Magnifier Table Lamp. And, finally, you’ll want to invest some time into learning the craft by practicing with friends and family.\n\n4. Design T-Shirts\n\nThis idea involves entrepreneurial talent and a decent level of design skill. You can help promote causes, design t-shirts for local bands and student groups, and showcase your favorite memes. College students are always looking for ways to express themselves. Why not help them along?\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nObviously, you won’t be able to make these t-shirts in your dorm room. You’ll need to outsource that work to another company, like Teespring or Zazzle. It’s up to you to design the shirt, place the order, and make the delivery. You can also develop stickers for student groups by utilizing Sticker Mule. Market yourself with business cards from websites like Vistaprint.\n\n5. Become a Content Writer\n\nHundreds of websites need content for their pages, and you can be the one to supply it. With a little bit of research and a working computer, you can write thousands of words a week and get paid handsomely for it (depending on your client).\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nTo get started, you’ll need an account on a freelance website like Upwork. Then, you should take a Udemy course on generating website content, just to get familiar with the tone and quality that’s going to be expected of you. Other than that, starting a career in professional writing is fairly inexpensive and material-free.\n\n6. Refurbish Furniture\n\nHave you ever seen an old piece of furniture that you thought you could improve? With a little bit of elbow grease, you can turn someone else’s trash into your treasure. And you don’t necessarily need to dig through garage sales to find a subject. Using websites like Craigslist, you can easily locate unused items and refurbish them. It’s almost like flipping a house.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nIt’s impossible to tell exactly what you’ll need, since there are so many different styles of furniture, and even more ways in which they can be altered. But it’s a pretty safe bet that you’ll need basic tools (a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, etc.), paint or varnish, and an electric sander. You can find most of these things at The Home Depot or Lowe’s. You’ll also need a large workspace, such as a garage or a backyard.\n\n7. Walk Dogs\n\nYou probably thought about walking dogs as a teenager but, now, you have the ability to take it to the next level. Pet owners are far more likely to trust their dogs with an adult than a preteen, and that gives you an edge. If you market yourself correctly, you can turn dog walking into a full-time, under-the-table job.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nMarketing is the most important part of this equation. You’ll need a website, which you can create through WordPress or Weebly. You’ll also need business cards and flyers (again, Vistaprint is a great resource), as well as a travel water dish and a few toys.\n\n8. Start a Babysitting Service\n\nAgain, parents are far more likely to trust their children with an adult. Not only \n\nthat, but an adult with a certification in CPR. You can start a babysitting service for next to nothing and, if you enjoy spending time with kids, you won’t be anywhere near as miserable as you would be working in an office. Also, tax-free work. Can we even argue with that?\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nStart out by making a profile on popular babysitting websites, such as Care or Sitter City. You’ll also want to create a professional website, business cards, and flyers. Finally, you can choose to bring toys or entertainment supplies for the kids, but many parents supply those for you.\n\n9. Become an Airbnb Host\n\nDid you know that you can rent out your home, or a portion of your home, through Airbnb? That’s right – you can make money on empty space alone. You don’t even need an entire house or a room to rent. Believe it or not, there are plenty of couchsurfers that take advantage of Airbnb on a regular basis.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nFirst, you need to make a profile. Take tasteful pictures of the space you’re going to offer and come up with a colorful description. The area should be well-decorated and cleared of any personal items. When the guest arrives, you’ll need to provide basic amenities (toilet paper, towels, blankets, lighting, etc.) and enough food for breakfast.\n\n10. Review and Test Games\n\nIt might sound too good to be true – but you can actually get paid to test video games. Check out an awesome tutorial here for more information. You should keep in mind that this method of making money will feel more like an official job, with a regular paycheck coming from a specific company. You can find positions on websites like Indeed, and there’s a ton of information online. Time has a useful article on the subject, as does Business Insider and Game Testers.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nBecoming a game tester and reviewer doesn’t involve a lot of monetary investment. But you’ll need a decent resume, a list of experience, and a website (if you really want to make an impression).\n\n11. Tutor Students\n\nIf there’s a subject that you know quite well, but notice other students struggle with, consider becoming a tutor. You can do this at the college level, as well as the high school and grade school levels. If you plan on becoming an educator, this is an especially rewarding experience.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOther than the usual marketing tools (resume, flyers, business cards, etc.), you’ll need to take advantage of flashcard applications such as Quizlet. You’ll also need basic school supplies, such as a calculator, a notebook, pencils, graphing paper, and a computer.\n\n12. Manage Social Media Accounts\n\nFar too many businesses want a strong social media presence, but don’t have the knowledge or the drive to make it happen. In order to satisfy their needs, many companies turn to college students to handle their social media accounts. Don’t believe us? It’s actually more common than you think.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nStatistics are the name of the game, in this business. You’ll need an account on Buffer to help analyze the amount of traffic your social media pages receive. You should also invest your time in an Upwork account, as many businesses hire through that platform. Other monetary investments could include business cards and a professional website.\n\n13. Make and Sell Custom Jewelry\n\nIf you’ve got a knack for creating your own jewelry, turn it into something more than a hobby. College students love unique, thoughtful pieces that aren’t generic or common. Take advantage of the environment surrounding you. Or, you could sell your work at flea markets and local events.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOther than renting out space for a booth at festivals or events, you’ll need to invest in basic materials. You can use a range of different items to make jewelry, so it all depends on your preferences. As we said earlier, Michaels and JoAnn Fabrics are fantastic for affordable, in-style craft supplies. If you plan on shipping your work to customers, you’ll also need boxes and labels for shipping purposes.\n\n14. Clean Houses\n\nAnother one of those preteen \n\njobs, turned professional. Make flyers and offer to clean houses for a fair price. The bigger the house, the more you make. You can also offer to clean dorm rooms for your friends and classmates. Imagine what college students would pay to have someone else take care of their dishes or dirty laundry!\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nYou’ll need cleaning supplies, such as all-purpose cleaner, window cleaner, dish soap, rags, wood cleaner, and air fresheners. You don’t necessarily need to bring your own vacuum, mop, or broom. Most households will provide those things for you. You might also find that making an account on Angie’s List is a useful way to generate clients.\n\n15. Become an Uber or Lyft Driver\n\nIf you feel comfortable driving strangers in your car, this might be a viable option for you. Not only do you get to meet interesting people, but you get to make money in the process. Both Uber and Lyft pay their part-time drivers up to $35/hour, and you don’t have to worry about awkwardly asking for tips.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nFirst of all, you’ll need to be twenty-one. That’s the biggest requirement. After that, you’ll need to obtain a four-door car with at least five seatbelts \n\nthat’s less than twelve-years-old. You can check out more information on that here. When it comes to upfront costs, you’ll need pack plenty of water bottles for your guests. You’ll also need a decent navigation application (we highly recommend Waze, which is free). Want to learn more? Uber has an awesome and complete guide here.\n\n16. Knit or Crochet Beanies and Hats\n\nCollege students love homemade clothing. You can develop a total monopoly in this niche by knitting or crocheting stylish beanies and hats. And, when you’re starting out, you can even have your friends wear your creations as free marketing sources.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nLuckily, knitting and crocheting doesn’t involve expensive sewing machines and equipment. You’ll need a set of patterns, a box of yarn, a basic set of supplies, and a decent needle set. After that, your business should fund itself. As usual, we recommend Michael’s and JoAnn Fabrics for your crafting needs. But you can probably find a few local shops, as well.\n\n18. Sell Custom Cutting Boards\n\nIf you’ve ever been interested in woodwork, this might be the perfect job for you. Cutting boards are unique and fun to make, and college students never think to buy them until they see them. They’re also fairly affordable to build, in comparison to other wood-related crafts. You’ll need your own space for this job, though, so this particular moneymaker might be best for a commuter student. A dorm room just isn’t going to cut it.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nAside from a workshop area, you’ll need an electric sander, stencils, and a wood burning tool. Michaels has a fair inventory when it comes to woodwork, but you’ll also want to check out The Home Depot and Lowe’s for heavier equipment.\n\nCutting boards aren’t your thing? Sell coasters to the sororities. I heard house moms hate water stains…\n\n18. Make Leather Cuffs\n\nLeather cuffs offer a unique style that only college students seem to understand. If you love crafting but also live on-campus, this low-stress method of earning some extra cash could work for you. Rather than making a series of jewelry options, you’ll be able to focus on one, specific item. If you’re not sure where to start, you can check out an interesting tutorial video here.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nYou’ll need, of course, leather. You’ll also need a leather burning tool, adhesive snaps, and a leather cutter. If you need start-up materials, Artbeads is an online platform that has an entire section set aside just for leather jewelry supplies.\n\nIf cuffs are too big for you, trendy wrap bracelets never go out of style.\n\n19. Create Surprise Balls\n\nIf you’ve never heard of surprise balls before, you’re probably going to fall in love with this money making venture. Made of brightly colored paper, surprise balls are full of streamers and prizes such as puzzles, rings, jokes, whistles, and stickers. These unique gifts are perfect for birthday parties and large events. If you have the right connections, this fun business can take off pretty quickly.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nFirst, you’ll need to read a few tutorials on how to make surprise balls. We’ve found that Not Martha and Honestly WTF are quality resources. Most websites agree that you’ll need multiple colors of fine crepe paper, confetti, ribbon, glitter, glue, and an assortment of candy or toys. If you’re located near a party store, this is going to become your hotspot for supplies.\n\n20. Develop a Digital eCourse\n\nFar more complicated than crafting surprise balls, making a digital eCourse involves patience, dedication, recording, scriptwriting, and research. While you don’t necessarily need to purchase supplies right away, you might spend two or three months crafting a quality product. If you’re not sure how to get started, Teach Good Stuff, Freelance to Freedom, and Problogger offer instructions on eCourse creation.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOnce you’ve written and established what you want to teach in your eCourse, you’re going to need to record your content. That’s going to involve a high-quality webcam (we suggest Logitech) and a microphone (we suggest the Snowball). Once you’ve finished, you’ll need to publish your work. Learning Revolution has some great information about that portion of production.\n\n21. Work for Fancy Hands\n\nFancy Hands provides US-based assistants for the self-employed, large company executives, and other business owners who need help managing their time and responsibilities efficiently. If you work well with organization, phone calls, appointment-setting, and other secretarial duties, this is a straightforward telecommunication position that can work for you. You can find more information here.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nThe materials you’ll need will depend entirely on the client you’re working with. You’ll need a smartphone, for sure, to help with prompt communication (we suggest an iPhone, but you can also use an Android). You’ll also need a laptop or desktop computer that can easily connect to a WiFi hotspot. Employers may have you download different applications or purchase additional materials, depending on the work they have you doing.\n\n22. Use TaskRabbit\n\nDo you enjoy running errands? TaskRabbit will connect you to households in your local area that need assistance with grocery shopping, medication pickup, cooking, cleaning, and more. The only downside? TaskRabbit is currently available in nineteen cities, including New York, Portland, London, LA, Houston, and Phoenix. If you aren’t located in any of these cities or suburbs, you’ll be limited to virtual tasks (which are typically very similar to Fancy Hands jobs).\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nYou won’t need much to get started with TaskRabbit, other than a full tank of gas and a professional outfit. Any costs you incur for shopping will be reimbursed by the household, and you’ll be paid an hourly wage that you set when you create a profile. Check out more here.\n\n23. Help Other People Move\n\nIf you have a large car or a truck, this is an easy way to make money. You can also offer labor, rather than transportation, if you don’t own a moving-friendly vehicle. Moving companies are, generally speaking, overpriced. If a household can hire an outside company or individual to help them move without paying an arm and a leg, they will. You can be that person.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nObviously, you’ll need to market yourself with business cards, flyers, and a website. You’ll also need heavy-duty gloves and moving blankets (if you own the vehicle being used). You should also plan on using a fair amount of gas between trips.\n\n24. Try Fiverr Jobs\n\nSimilar to Upwork (which we introduced earlier), Fiverr connects freelancers in various categories (such as Graphics &amp; Design, Digital Marketing, Writing &amp; Translation, Video &amp; Animation, and Music &amp; Audio) to employers who need work completed. If you’re successful in any of these niches, you should consider making an account and getting started immediately.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nFortunately, you won’t need anything but a service to offer and an idea. Fiverr has no basis of commitment, no memberships, and no hidden fees. You’re able to keep 80% of each transaction you complete. However, you should keep in mind that Fiverr sets base fees for their workers. For example, if you market yourself in the Writing &amp; Translation niche, you won’t be able to charge more than $5 per job, unless you add extra services for the client to purchase (which can add up to $25 per job).\n\n25. Sell Used Items Online\n\nThis can go above and beyond selling old items that once belonged to you. You can also collect items from your friends and family members, recycling centers, or classmates who might consider trashing them instead of reselling them. Read a great success story here.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOther than shipping supplies, you’ll need a first “wave” of items to sell. From there, you can grow your collection through marketing and communication. Amazon and eBay are both online platforms specifically utilized for the sale of new or used items. It would be in your best interest to sell through one of them, since they’re both wildly popular with consumers.\n\n26. Become a Personal Shopper\n\nIf you love to shop, this job is perfect for you. Despite the stereotypical personal shopper positions, you won’t necessarily be shopping for the clothes of rich, old ladies. Personal shopping has really taken a turn in the past decade. Read more about it here and here. \n\nEntrepreneur also has a wonderful article about starting a personal shopping business.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nOther than a full tank of gas and a measuring tape, you won’t really incur any costs when you start this business. You may choose to spend money on a professional website, business cards, or flyers. But you can also place an advertisement on Craigslist for free. Since personal shoppers can only handle a limited number of clients, it won’t take long for you to get comfortable in your work.\n\n27. Be a YouTube Video Blogger\n\nIf you have something to say the world, start saying it. Because, eventually, you can be handsomely paid for it. While you won’t start out making money, you’ll be able to reap the benefits of advertising once your channel reaches a certain number of subscribers. Google will directly pay you a portion of their income from ads placed on your videos. How do you think YouTube stars survive without day jobs?\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nLike eCourse production, you’ll need a webcam (again, we suggest Logitech) and a microphone (another quality option is the Yeti). The rest of your starting materials depend on what you want to do in your videos, and how you want to market yourself. This is a far less professional platform than, say, Facebook. The most important thing is that your video is interesting and creative, not expensive.\n\n28. Try Affiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing is a performance-based form of marketing, in which a business will reward you for each visitor or customer brought to their website because of your personal marketing efforts. For example, YouTube stars that receive money from advertisements placed on their videos are actually taking part in an affiliate marketing program.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOnce employed by a business, you can start marketing to your followers through a social media scheduler and advertisements. You should be smart and creative about your efforts, because affiliate marketing is hard work. While there aren’t any upfront costs to get started, you’ll need to spend quite a bit of time pushing the product before you see any payoff.\n\n29. Blog!\n\nIn the same way that you can get paid for advertisements on YouTube, you can get paid for placing advertisements on your personal blog (assuming your traffic statistics meet Google requirements). This isn’t going to happen overnight, so you’ll need to spend several months (or even years) building your brand, story, and website. The more you post, the faster your blog will grow in followers.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nFirst of all, you’ll need a website. This can be created through WordPress or Weebly (which we discussed earlier), or you can utilize Squarespace. The most important part of the process will be purchasing your own URL, which is vital to making a quality blog or website. The more popular your blog, the more return you’ll get for your investment.\n\n30. Create a Niche Marketing Website\n\nSo, how do you make money from a website without waiting months or years for your traffic to be high enough? You create a niche marketing website. This is basically a website that utilizes SEO keywords to place your link at the top of the Google search page. Even though your website won’t actually offer or sell any products, it’ll be visited so often that Google will pay you hundreds of dollars each month to place advertisements on your page.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOther than starting your website, which can be done through a horde of different resources, you’ll need to spend hours each week creating useful content for your page. Choose a smart and thoughtful set of keywords that have proven popular through Google and incorporate them six or seven times in each article you produce. Within five or six months, your website will earn you a decent amount of traffic and income.\n\n31. Flip Websites\n\nBefore we talk about flipping websites, you need to check out Flippa, the most popular place on the internet for doing so. You’ll learn quite a bit just by checking out their page. Flipping websites \n\ninvolves buying and selling domains for a profit. Basically, your job is to purchase the website of a company that wasn’t so great to begin with. Start an AdWords or AdSense campaign, upping the value of the site, and then sell it for far more than you bought it.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nFirst, we suggest reading this tutorial on how to flip websites. Then, you’ll need to pool together enough money to make your initial purchases. Similar to flipping houses, you need to be smart about your decisions. Some websites are beyond help. Others have potential. It’s up to you to pinpoint the difference between the two.\n\n32. Become a Window Cleaner\n\nIf you like cleaning, but aren’t prepared to take on an entire house, consider cleaning windows. Most homeowners hate cleaning windows because it involves going outside and thoroughly washing each pane. On homes with many different windows, this can be a challenge. You can really make a market for yourself in this business, with recurring customers and references.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nAccording to Great Day Improvements, the best window cleaning solution involves a spray bottle filled with fifty-percent distilled vinegar (white) and fifty-percent tap water. In addition to your spray, you’ll need a backpack, a ladder, a series of rags or squeegees, and other necessary cleaning supplies. To market yourself, make flyers and business cards to pass out throughout your neighborhood.\n\n33. Be an Independent Make-Up Artist\n\nHave you been doing your own make-up since you were thirteen? Do your friends struggle to get the same professional results? Do you know the best products to purchase for a reasonable price? This is probably the job for you. You can make money by doing make-up for classmates, friends, and family. References come quickly when you do a quality job, and you’ll make a name for yourself right away.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nThis is going to be a bit more expensive to start up than several of the other business ideas presented in this article. Why? Because quality make-up isn’t cheap. For many individuals, that’s why hiring an independent make-up artist for special occasions is more affordable than purchasing their own supplies. And, for independent make-up artists, that’s why it makes sense to purchase supplies for many different individuals. Read a great article about how to get started here.\n\n34. Style Hair\n\nDo you have a knack for hair styling? Trusting someone else with their hair, especially for special occasions, is a hard thing for most people to do. You’ll need to be patient, understanding, and smart about how you decide to work. You also need to be willing to work with the design ideas that your clients have. If you can manage all of that, this is a great start-up business that could, potentially, pay the bills.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nHair styling is, typically, a very expensive business to start. You’ll need a set of curling irons, flat irons, styling products (hairspray, conditioner, shampoo, etc.), scissors, and an area where you can work. The amount of money you need to invest depends entirely upon where you want to style hair (at the homes of your clients or in your own space) and whether you want to offer haircuts or simply styles for special occasions. Read more here and here.\n\n35. Write YouTube Product Reviews\n\nYes, you can get paid to write YouTube product reviews. But, how? First, you need to make a Fiverr account and offer reviews for $5 each. Then, you’ll create a video of your honest review and post it to your channel. The more of a following you create, the more businesses will pay for your reviews.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nYou’ll need a webcam and microphone (we’ve already suggested Logitech and the Snowball), and a place to record. A huge bonus of this job? Free products. However, you need to make sure that businesses are aware of your intention to create an honest review. Your channel won’t be credible if you only offer positive reviews.\n\n36. Start Your Own Delivery Service\n\nHave you ever wondered why fast food chains don’t offer delivery for their products? Most people assume that, since orders are so cheap, it wouldn’t be worthwhile. But, imagine making an independent service that delivers any fast food orders (Wendy’s, Arby’s, McDonalds, Taco Bell, etc.) for $5 each. Customers will reimburse you for their food, plus $5 for your time and gas. In fact, here’s the story of a millionaire CEO who did this same this in college.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nYou’ll need a car and a full tank of gas. You’ll also need Venmo, so you can accept payment from your customers. We also suggest a website, business cards, and flyers.\n\n37. Create a Bootcamp at a Nearby Park\n\nIf you love to run, jump, climb, and jog, you can actually make money by forming an outdoor bootcamp in a local park. By running your own workouts, you can help adults and teenagers get in shape. You’ll also feel better about yourself, in the process!\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nYou’ll need basic workout equipment, such as cones, weights, tires, jump ropes, hula-hoops, or anything else you might use to create an obstacle course. Read more information on how to get started here.\n\n38. Design Graphics\n\nBloggers love graphics, but they hate creating them. Therefore, they sometimes turn to an outside party to design something for them. If you enjoy working with graphics and have a creative eye for marketing, this is the job for you.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nIn order to make quality graphics, you’ll need to download Adobe Illustrator. This is usually fairly expensive, but the student edition is just $19.99 a month and includes a handful of other applications. You can also use a sketch application on a Mac computer, which is cheaper and usually has the same effect. We also suggest Graphic River credits, which will save time with pre-made vector graphs.\n\n39. Start a Party Supply Delivery Service\n\nStudents haven’t created this service yet, and we’re really not sure why. Imagine being at a party. You run out of chips. The last thing you want to do is run to the store for chips, so you call a party supply delivery service and pay them a small fee to bring the chips for you. Yes, you can actually make this service available on your campus by marketing yourself, filling up your gas tank, and running around town.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nYou’ll need gas, which we mentioned above. You’ll also need to create a Venmo account, where you can professionally accept payment for the service you’ve provided. Keep in mind, you’ll need to make sure that you aren’t delivering anything that has an age limit (for legal reasons). Unfortunately, this means you can’t purchase beer or cigarettes.\n\n40. Paint Menu Boards\n\nMenu boards are what customers see when they first walk into a business. The point of a menu board is to draw passerby into the store or restaurant by making a good first impression. Fortunately, this works quite well when the board is thoughtfully and tastefully designed. Unfortunately, this works quite poorly when the menu board isn’t professional in presentation. You can design these boards for local businesses, and offer your painting services as an incentive to bring in customers.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nFirst of all, you’ll need to market yourself online. You’ll need to get in touch with local businesses and reach a fair wage for your work. You’ll also need a slew of paints, chalk colors, stencils, and other design aids to help you get the job done. Check out some great ideas here. You can also view the work of local San Diego artist Art by Autumn for inspiration.\n\n \n\n41. Be a Secret Shopper\n\nAlso known as “mystery shoppers”, secret shoppers are hired by outside companies to determine how good (or poor) the service is in specific restaurants, grocery stores, and retail stores. Not only will you get to visit new places, but you’ll get to report your findings and get paid for it. Be wary, however. Many “outside companies” are scams. You need to make sure you’re working through a reputable service. Read more here.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nSecret shoppers don’t need much money to get started. You’ll need a full tank of gas, a notebook, and a pen to keep track of your reports. That’s about it.\n\n42. Sew Dorm Décor\n\nCollege dorm rooms have a tendency to look boring, undecorated, and unloved. You can change that by designing quality dorm décor that helps students feel at home on campus. Start by creating designs for your own dorm. Then, as your visitors see what you’ve done, ask them to refer you to their friends and classmates.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nYou’ll need a set of trendy fabric (check out some awesome samples here), a quality sewing machine, and some amazing design ideas.\n\n43. Sell Class Notes\n\nThere are many things that aren’t “okay” in college. Writing other students’ papers, doing homework for your friends, cheating on tests, and copying answers are all “wrong” acts. However, there’s nothing inherently wrong with sharing class notes. Everyone misses class sometimes. It helps them to know what’s going on while they’re gone. So, why not sell your class notes for a reasonable price?\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nYou’ll need to store your notes on a computer, making them easier to read. You’ll also need to create online flashcards (again, Quizlet is great for this) for your customers to use. Once someone “buys” your notes, give them access to a locked Google Document and send them the URL to the Quizlet page.\n\n44. Buy Storage Units\n\nHave you ever seen Storage Wars? In the popular television show, bidders try to purchase abandoned storage units. Then, they attempt to flip the contents for cash. Most of the time, bidders were successful in earning their money back and maintaining some kind of profit. If you have the time and energy, this start-up business is fun, interesting, and has the potential for huge payoffs.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nYou’ll need a full tank of gas to attend auctions. You’ll also need start-up money with which to bid. Other than that, you may need to rent a trailer to move the contents of a unit to another location. And, of course, you’ll need a location to store or sell your findings.\n\n45. Become a Campus Brand Ambassador\n\nBrands are constantly looking for ways to break into the millennial market. If you have great communication skills and a large social circle, this could be right up your alley. Many of these positions are performance based, offering commission and bonuses. With a little willingness to talk to strangers and a charming smile, you could be making friends and money at the same time. Check for listings on popular intern sites such as InternMatch, Internships.com and InternQueen.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nNot much is needed to be a brand ambassador, and if there is, usually the company will supply these to you. A clean shirt is recommended and see if the company can provide some swag to make your job easier.\n\n46. Start Landscaping and Lawn Mowing\n\nOn hot summer days, homeowners don’t want to go outside and mow their own lawn. They would much rather pay a teenage boy twenty dollars to do it for them. But you aren’t a teenage boy. You’re old enough to make sure the work is done correctly, and that gives you an edge. You can also do extensive landscaping – something that teenagers rarely offer.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nAs always, you’ll need to market yourself with a website, business cards, and flyers. You’ll also need gardening supplies (Lowe’s is a fantastic resource for this equipment), shears, and (potentially) a lawn mower. Many homes, though, will provide a mower for you.\n\n47. Shovel Snow\n\nEven more than they don’t want to venture into the heat, homeowners don’t want to venture into the cold. And, while long grass doesn’t stop cars from going down the driveway, snowstorms do. This means that, in the winter, you can make plenty of money by shoveling snow for your neighbors, friends, and family. Since the season is long and weather is unpredictable, some months will be heavy and other months will be light.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nAll you need to make a quality snow-shoveling business are a few decent shovels, a handful of business cards, and a single-page website explaining what you offer.\n\n48. Wash Cars\n\nSome car washes aren’t as quality as car-owners would hope. There’s nothing like washing a car by hand, but that isn’t really offered anymore. Or, is it? By starting your own car washing business, you offer a service that most people can use. Without having to leave their home, car owners can have a clean car that hasn’t been unnecessarily damaged. You can also offer interior cleaning, for an extra cost.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nJust as you’ll need when you clean homes, washing cars will require basic cleaning supplies (soap, sponges, buckets, etc.). You’ll also need an interior vacuum, towels, access to a hose, and weather that doesn’t get in the way of your job.\n\n49. Review Applications and Resumes\n\nYou live on a college campus. The students around you are desperately filling out applications and creating resumes. Whether or not these applications and resumes paint the best picture of the individual, however, is a different story. If you’re interested in PR, or you just enjoy helping other people with their resumes, this could be a great position for you. And you can make a ton of money from the right clients. People are willing to pay if it means they’ll get hired.\n\nWhat materials you’ll need:\n\nWriting and editing jobs really don’t cost much in the way of start-up fees. However, you will need profiles on websites such as Fiverr and Upwork, and you’ll need to keep those profiles as up-to-date as possible. We suggest making several resume examples, and writing a few blog posts or articles about what companies are looking for in a potential employee.\n\n50. Offer Editing Services\n\nAgain, you can access the world of writing and translation through Upwork or Fiverr, both of which will allow you to offer editing services for a set price. On Upwork, you apply for jobs that are specifically posted. On Fiverr, clients will contact you based on your promotional post. Be specific; what do you enjoy editing? What experience do you have?\n\nWhat materials you’ll need: \n\nOnce again, writing itself doesn’t cost additional start-up money. You just need a computer, a WiFi connection, and a stable place to work. We also suggest a printer and a red pen for serious editing jobs, such as college essays or novels.\n","name":"t3_47gv5r","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-25 04:00:08","week":8}

{"id":"47knpe","author":"poseidonoftea","body":"Excuse me for the generic posting if you see these on a daily basis, but why not have a little discussion on what your core portfolios look like. I'll start it off.\n\n- AMZN: Dominance in web services and online retail. Growing entertainment services. Growth potential from their R&amp;D for better delivery methods. Web services should continue to grow in importance too.\n- GILD: Wanted to capture a little biotech. This is the only one on this list that I'm not well-educated on.\n- GOOG: They own the most important platform in consumer computing: the browser. They dominate mobile, and they might come out dominating virtual reality and augmented reality too. They dominate AI research, which is my favorite field of growth in the next 10 years. Their robotics branch makes headlines occasionally, including just in this past week. Their services are ubiquitous, and their leadership is solid.\n- LMT: They build the F-35. No division is more important for future combat than aerial attacks. They're heavily contracted for space enterprises. They're working on mobile fusion reactors. They have the famous Skunkworks division for R&amp;D. \n- MU: Great value at $10/share. DRAM is losing profit margin, but 3D NAND is next in line.\n- NVDA: My favorite chip manufacturer because of the massive parallelism and its applications to AI, which again is the biggest growth opportunity in tech for the near future, that I see.\n- RKDA: Low-priced firm that has tons of IP for agriculture. As water becomes more expensive, as farmland loses fertility, this is the kind of company that will reap the rewards. The IP appears to be consistently high-quality and thus is a major steal. \n- ROK: My best way to capture machine automation. When we talk about machines taking jobs, Rockwell is arguably the world leader for industrial applications. They do some specific AI-related things, but I think they also benefit from other companies pitching into AI growth, as their products will go with ROK's products.\n- RTN: Aerial combat is the most powerful and easiest way to kill. Politicians get to keep their noses clean from maintaining presences in countries, and they get to do the dirty work. RTN supplies the missiles that help make this happen. They also make drones, and they do a million other things. All-around, diverse military contractor.","name":"t3_47knpe","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-25 20:06:08","week":8}

The company lost $580 million, or $5.44 per share, in the quarter compared with a loss of $159 million, or $1.50 a share, for the same period last year.\nUber \"has reportedly raised over $10 billion in capital since it commenced operations at progressively higher valuations, in some cases exceeding $50 billion in value,\" Lampert wrote. \"At the same time, it was recently reported that Uber is losing over $1 billion a year in China alone.

{"id":"47ltug","author":"suckinonmytitties","body":"So I graduated last summer with my doctorate in physical therapy. My total in loans is $156,000 (116,000 in federal public loans and $40,000 in private state loans). This cost is for 3 years of undergraduate and 3 years of graduate school. My other debt is $1,000 on a credit card (which I paid down from $3,000 over the past 3 months).\n\nMy current income is 65,000 per year in salary at my job I started 4 months ago, plus 1,500 in other income (Airbnb and dog sitting).\n\nMy current emergency savings: 3,000 (my goal is about $6,000)\n\nMonthly expenses:\n\n$1,000 rent (expensive but it's in Brooklyn)\n\n$150 for my share of utilities (electric, cable and water)\n\n$300 for groceries and resteraunts \n\n$50 alcohol \n\n$20 Barkbox subscription\n\n$50 pet food and supplies \n\n$30 metro card \n\n$50 entertainment (music show, movies, etc)\n\nThis allows me to pay about $2000 per month towards my loans and I am using the Avalanche method to pay off the higher interest private state loans first while the public loans sit on IBR with a $0 monthly minimum payment.\n\nWays I am saving: I am currently on my parents health insurance, I walk 30 minutes each way to work, I frequent retailmenot.com for coupons, and I use /r/giftcardexchange for 10-15% off my Amazon purchases. \n\nSo what I want to know is if my budget is good and if I've basically screwed myself over with these loans or if it is manageable.

{"id":"47m71k","author":"GCXmods","body":"Hey everyone. We wanted to make a post with some announcements for the community here, and get community feedback and answer any questions you might have. We apologize for the wall of text, but we hope you find this post as informative as possible.\n\n___\n\n#Moderator Account Compromised - Updates\n\n##Background\n\nCompromising accounts is a tactic we have seen attempted several times to gain access to this subreddit, in order to circumvent the subreddit's age requirements. We have seen this both on accounts that have never been used on GCX before, and on accounts that are active on GCX. (These accounts are unbanned when the actual owner of the account can get verification from the reddit admins that they were not responsible for what happened.)\n\nRecently, one of our moderators had his account compromised by a brute force attack, and the hacker used the mod status in a way that has never been used before to scam several users here, basically saying \"oh I'm a mod, you can trust me, even though you don't have Rule 5 approval to trade,\" which is not something the mod team here does.\n\n##Moderators are not above the rules on GCX\n\nEach subreddit is different, but this has always been the policy here on GCX. We have mentioned it a few times in previous mod posts, and we've enforced this on ourselves behind the scenes, but now we're putting it in writing in a more official place (the rules wiki). We're not expecting any more moderator account hacks, but it's just good in general to have it in writing that the moderators are not above the rules in this community.\n\n&gt;Please note that moderators are not above any of the rules in this subreddit. For the purposes of getting approval to trade when necessary, a different moderator must be the one to approve the other moderator to do a trade. For example, Mod A needs to approve Mod B's $100 trade. Mod B can't approve his own trade\n\nWe put this at the top of the detailed rules wiki **[linked here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules)**\n\nThe reddit admins are aware that reddit moderators' accounts are being targeted, and recently made a post about it on /r/modnews. **[The post is linked here.](https://redd.it/46c2wv)** We're hoping that the admins will provide **ALL** reddit users, whether they are moderators or not, better ways to keep their accounts safe. We highly recommend commenting on that post and *politely* giving *constructive* feedback to the admins. Clearly something needs to be done, and sadly, us moderators don't have the ability to make reddit-wide security upgrades. The mod team here has strengthened their passwords, and verified email addresses for backup. **We encourage you to do the same, whether you're a frequent trader here or not.**\n\n##Transparency: Details and Screenshots\n\nWe had to lock the previous two PSA posts - something we've never done before, and hope we never need to do again - about this issue because people who were affected were making comments with their own personal information that needed to be kept private per reddit's rules (not GCX's rules, *reddit's* rules), and sent to the modmail. Similarly, the moderators of /r/beermoney removed a post regarding this issue because it was spreading misinformation. We are grateful to them for putting a lot of thought into their decision to first allow that post, and then to remove that post when it started causing more harm than good.\n\nWe did not, nor would we ever, ban anyone for discussing the hack; users have a right to discuss what transpired. However, what we did not want was misinformation to spread because, at the time, we had very little evidence to counteract it. Now that we've gathered all relevant evidence and can show what happened, how it happened, and what we will do to make sure it doesn't happen again, we can share it on this post, in which all members of the community will have their voices heard.\n\nThose who have been here for a while know that we're pretty big on asking for community feedback (look at /u/GCXmods submission history), which is what we're doing right now. We just didn't want anyone to think we were trying to sweep this under the rug. Quite the opposite - we were trying to fix this, then gather as much information as possible to make this post to the community.\n\nHere is verification from the reddit admins that it was indeed a compromised account, and not just a moderator going rogue: http://imgur.com/n9bsNdh\n\nIf anyone wants to confirm this for themselves with the reddit admins, feel free to message them at /r/reddit.com. They get a lot of modmail, so include the permalink to the above screenshotted thread in your message to them, so they can reference that thread for context as to why you are contacting them: https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/514hnb\n\nWe know that for those who were affected, this ultimately doesn't matter, because they lost money either way, but we wanted to be as transparent as possible about what happened.\n\nNo one had their flair changed. No one was banned, or unbanned. None of the rules, trading guides, or other safe trading resources were altered. 11 people were contacted, and 4 were scammed. We have been in communication with all of those affected by this in private, and are still working through that.\n\n##A Message from the GCX Mod Team\n\nWe're extremely upset that this happened (a useless platitude, we know, but the truth), and highly appreciative of how understanding people have been, especially some of those who were affected by this. We understand that it's pretty easy to see moderators as just rule makers and enforcers, and for many subreddits, that's all they are - and that's fine, because that's all they need to be. But we think most people would agree that things are a little different here. We're human too, and we have lives outside of reddit, but we care so much about this community that we gladly volunteer our own time to keep strangers on the internet safe. Moderating and protecting this community is extremely labor-intensive, and it is not something that we do for money, fame, reputation, or anything like that. We just genuinely care about building a great community where people can safely trade gift cards, and we're glad that most people can see that in how we do things around here.\n\nWe'll open the floor here to any questions about this, but just to address some things right off the bat, if you are wondering what we are going to do about this, the rest of this post is about a few things that we are going to try out with the goals of increasing security and usability even more for this community.\n\n___\n\n#January 2016 Town Hall Results\n\nIn the January 2016 Town Hall **[linked here](https://redd.it/426ux1)**, we got a lot of great feedback, and based on that, we have some tweaks for this subreddit that we want to try out and see how they go. We want to thank everyone that chimed in there, as well as those that messaged us in the modmail.\n\n##Rule 2\n\nWe're just going to say it. We hate Rule 2 - **[linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_2._active_redditor)** for reference. We hate that scammers have made it absolutely necessary. We know that most of you reading this don't have to deal with it much, because, well, you're here, but it is incredible how many people do not read the rules before using a subreddit. It's a pain for both the rulebreaker and the mod team to have to deal with a Rule 2 ban. It's also worth noting that repeated violations of trading with people who have inactive accounts is not allowed, also per Rule 2.\n\nA lot of people gave us feedback on Rule 2 in the town hall. We incorporated all of it, especially [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/426ux1/january_2016_town_hall_open_floor_community/cz9dkbh), and here is what we are going to try out.\n\nAccounts under 14 days in age that try to post or comment will still be banned (with the possibility to be unbanned, of course), because that's just an objective rule violation. But for the rest, posts and comments from users under a certain threshold for account age, or karma, or total number of posts and comments will be removed. A comment will be left on the removed submission with a link for the user to message the modmail and ask for approval to post or comment. Then we can look at their account and make a decision on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIf they are not meeting the requirements of Rule 2, we will tell them to wait until their account is more active, but not ban them (unless they are really, really inactive). If they are active enough, their submission will be approved. This will cut down on the number of bans necessary for this subreddit. We will also be purging the Universal Scammer List of many (but not all) GCX Rule 2 violations to make that more usable as well. Maybe we'll make a separate list of banned users per Rule 2, but at the end of the day, the community just needs to enforce the GCX Golden Rule (and all of the rules).\n\n##Eligible Trading Items\n\nWe're glad that people want to use this subreddit as much as possible, but we also want to have items that are best traded on another subreddit, *be traded on that subreddit.* There has been a need to clarify whether certain digital items, prepaid cards, and other \"grey area\" items can be traded here or not. To be clear, we're not looking to rain on anyone's parade, and we're certainly not going to ban anyone solely for posting something here that is best posted on another subreddit. We just wanted some better definition to this, and based on the community's feedback, here is what we are going to try.\n\nAll of this will be handled on a case-by-case basis, since there is no way to definitively draw a line on what the definition of a \"gift card\" is. In general, if there is a better subreddit for trading the item that **you** [H]ave, then it should be traded on that subreddit. For example, if you [H]ave Steam Games and [W]ant Amazon, even though Amazon is obviously traded here, that kind of trade is more suitable for /r/SteamGameSwap, since their mod team can handle it better.\n\nRule 6 still forbids cash for cash trades here, but we will edit the rule in the next few days to give some more details on what is and isn't suitable to be traded here. (We're not anticipating having to ban anyone for this kind of thing, so this post will serve as the announcement.) We will also be updating our sidebar with some additional trading subreddits for items like WoW gametime, and other \"grey area\" items.\n\n##General Security\n\nWe are working on updating the GCX Safe Trading Guide to be a more step-by-step approach to trading - like an instruction manual. The main focus for the changes will be encouraging traders to ask for and provide proof of origin of the gift cards they are about to trade, before the trade is done. We are also going to encourage people to take more care when determining whether they/their trading partner will use the Friends and Family or the Payment for Goods and Services options on PayPal. We're also working on beefing up AutoModerator to automatically remove more Rule 2 violations, as mentioned above.\n\nWe have also been discussing privatizing the subreddit - some options include making this subreddit private, making this subreddit private only for a few hours at night (when the moderators and most community members are asleep) which effectively makes it open and closed like a brick and mortar store, and making a separate private subreddit while maintaining this one as an open subreddit. Our conversations are really preliminary at this point, and any suggestions or feedback about this are welcome. If we get a lot of people in favor of this, we'll have a separate post dedicated exclusively to this topic.\n\n##More Moderators\n\nWhile we're giving these changes a try, we also wanted to extend the invitation to the community for anyone who wants to help moderate this subreddit. We have a lot of helpful users here, and any help we can get, from a moderator or not, is always appreciated, and benefits the community as a whole. We're often asked what the \"qualifications\" are for being a mod here, and like most things here, it's taken on a case-by-case basis. We don't really have a set criteria. If you're interested, and you haven't messaged us already, please **[use this link to send a message to us at /r/GCXSuggestions,](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGCXSuggestions&amp;subject=)** so we can keep the modmail separate and as organized as possible. \n\n___\n\nThanks for reading, and as always, trade safely.\n\n~Your GCX Mod Team\n\n##The GiftCardExchange Network\n  \n***[GCX Safe Trading Guide](https://redd.it/2gig0n) | /r/GCXrep |  [GCX Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules) | [GCX FAQ Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/faq) | /r/GCXSuggestions | [Universal Scammer List](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalScammerList/wiki/banlist) | [Message the GCX Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/messaging_the_mods)***","name":"t3_47m71k","subreddit":"giftcardexchange","subreddit_id":"t5_2s989","created_utc":"2016-02-26 00:32:20","week":8}

{"id":"47mvvm","author":"eynonpower","body":"My wife and I have had an Amazon Visa for around 3 years.  We started off using it for gas, groceries and maybe a few other things and we pay it off at the end of the month.  We would get a decent amount of free money to spend on Amazon.com.  For the last year or two, we use it for almost everything now.  Coffee, dining out, paying some bills, clothing etc....  At the end of the month we're usually paying out ~~$3500-$5000.~~ $2500-$5000.  The $5k coming around xmas time.   \n\nWe were doing awesome except back in December we must have messed up and were off in a big way.  We got the bill and we owed about $1000 more than we figured.  Fuck....  So we looked over every charge, and it all looked right.  Didn't see anything suspicious or that we thought was fraudulent.  We ate it and paid it.  We let it completely clear in January and just used our debit card.   We've been using it now in February but are nervous.\n\nWe normally do is our monthly budget.  We take that and then in my wifes purse, we keep a piece of paper with what all the money in the checking account is for.  So, say my biweekly gas is $110.  I fill up for $25, so we take that from $110 down to $85.  We then write Amazon - $25.  We keep $1k in the checking account at all times.  So we'll add up all the debits and credits and it SHOULD come out to roughly $1k give or take a few dollars.  What worries us is that we did that, and it worked out.  No idea where our fuck up was.  January was fine without using it, and so far so good this month.  We have done that for years and it hasn't failed.  It was clearly user error somewhere.\n\nSo for those who use some type of reward card, how do you balance it to make sure you don't mess up?","name":"t3_47mvvm","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-26 03:19:11","week":8}

I've been an engineer for 10 years, (almost 30 now), excellent  salary (10k+/mo), plenty of savings(100k+), and I'm at a point where it is starting to look attractive to buy a house. My one problem is that I've never had a credit card or any kind of debt, and have essentially no credit score - Heck, last I checked some of the credit reporting agencies didn't even know where I lived. My mortgage advisor recommended that I start building credit now to prepare, and run the check for a mortgage in 2-3 months, so here I am. \n\nMy main goal is to build credit as quickly as possible (though I understand that time is a component of building my score), avoid the mess of hidden fees and byzantine restrictions I've heard plauge people before with credit cards (though maybe that's not an issue if you don't keep any kind of balance), and if I can get some cash back on things like gas, restaurants, and the odd Amazon order then so much the better.\n\nI've already done some research and it seems like most of the advice for 1st credit cards and building credit is geared towards students or people who are just starting to get financially stable. Should I still start with applying for a secured credit card, or is it possible I could get approved for something more favorable? I'm hesitant to apply for something like Chase Freedom, Amex Blue Cash, or the Amazon card since I'm aware that applying for a credit card can hurt my score.

I'm not really sure what information is true and what is just speculation, so I'd really appreciate it if someone with a bit more insight could answer my questions:\n\n1) Is there a lower limit for the price of your item that has to be reached in order for reviews of items bought at a very low price to be marked as 'confirmed purchase' (i.e. selling a 20$ product at 1$ while using a launch service)?\n\n2) Are rankings influenced by the price of the product when it was sold?

It's come to the point where this woodworking hobby of mine is bringing in so much money that I need to make it official and register it and whatnot.\n\nTo my understanding, you can write many things off on your taxes -- all the expenses to your business such as gas, materials, overhead, etc.. However, can I just skip all of that, opt out to charging my own customers sales tax, and pay the sales tax on everything which I already do?\n\nMy logic is that the government won't care either way -- as long as they get their tax money in the end, it doesn't matter how. \n\nAlso, would I have to charge sales tax only to those who live in the same state in which my business is based?  (There are plenty of websites from which I buy that don't charge sales tax, for example, and they obviously aren't based in my state; I don't remember ever paying sales tax on Amazon.)\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nEDIT: To add to this, if I have to pay two different types of sales tax as well as a separate income tax at the end of they year, how does the government expect me to survive when they take so much of my hard-earned money?","name":"t3_47qf5n","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2016-02-26 19:25:07","week":8}

A buyer bought a Xbox One controller from me 28 days ago. They requested a refund and return on the item. Messaged Amazon and was told it is because they said it didn't come with a mic. No Xbox One controller comes with a mic.\n\nI'm talking with the chat rep and she pretty told me that I will only be reimbursement or compensated if the item is damaged. So I'm pretty much out of $45 and have to sell it used assuming it works. Selling it used would mean I'm losing even more money. It's just apart of the business but still annoying.\n\nLove FBA but I don't feel at ease anymore until those 30 days pass. I never had this issue with FBM. Buyers would message me about an issue, I'd explain how to fix it or if features never existed and it'll end there.

{"id":"47v0tm","author":"jwriv4","body":"I have Amazon Prime and I have been experiencing slower and slower delivery times lately. For example, I just placed an order for two items, both marked Amazon Prime.\n\nThe order was placed on Thursday, Feb 25. Both items were Amazon Prime. Today is Feb 27 and neither item has shipped as of yet. One item says the delivery estimate is Monday Feb 29 (+ 4 days), and the other item says the delivery estimate is Wednesday March 2 (+ 6 days).\n\nIs the Amazon Prime guarantee two day SHIPPING or two day DELIVERY? Is there any guarantee as to how long they take to ship the order? Because the items are always sent two day DELIVERY, but often times it takes them +-3 days to get around to shipping the order.\n\nIn addition, I was wondering if weekend days were excluded from these delivery guarantee dates. I've looked everywhere and I can not find specific information.\n\nI used to live in a major metro area, and I would always RECEIVE my packages within 2 days. I was getting deliveries on Saturdays and even on Sundays- routinely. Now that I have moved to another city, I never have deliveries on Saturday or Sunday, and like I said- the packages are not even leaving the Amazon warehouse for several days. \n\nSo, either I am getting ripped off by paying for my Amazon Prime membership, or I was pampered at my previous address and have gotten accustomed to receiving my packages much faster than I needed to.\n\nIf Amazon is not holding up their end of the bargain, what are my options?

{"id":"47z7k3","author":"joeyoungblood","body":"Week 2 is up: [Weekly Web Opportunities - Week 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/498hla/weekly_web_opportunities_for_entrepreneurs_week_2/)  \n\nHi there /r/entrepreneur long time lurker, sometime commentor here\n\nI've been building websites and buying and selling websites and domains since 1994. I really enjoy reading in this sub and thought I'd stop lurking and start contributing. So for the next few weeks each Saturday I'm going to discuss the wide world of websites for sale, the opportunity they present or even one's I think you might want to avoid. \n\nI'll be using mostly Flippa but I might also examine Digital Point, AfterNIC, GoDaddy Auctions, Name Pros, and other places where web businesses, websites, and apps are being sold. I have zero affiliation with all of the prior mentioned places. I'll also mention if I'm bidding on the sale or not.\n\n**Business:** Nerd Armor    \n**Type:** Website  \n**Business Model:** Drop Shipping Retailer  \n**Listed on:** Flippa.com  \n**Listing type:** Auction  \n**Current Price:** $1,050  \n**Days til end:** 9  \n**My Thoughts:** This is a gorgeous site built on the Shopify platform that comes with zero inventory. The developer put work into the name which I think is pretty great, Nerd Armor, blending both the reality and fantasy that many geeks live in. The site also has a pretty slick logo and just a great overall feel. I ran a t-shirt company from 2002 to 2004 called Shirt Propaganda, making and selling your own shirts is a tough game and it only got tougher with sites like Cafe Press, Zazzle, Shirt.Woot.com, etc... I'm not normally a fan of drop ship retailers because of the lower margins, and most often I would avoid a t-shirt retail business because of the volume of competition. However, this site caters to nerd / geek culture and that has a lot of upside. With a brandable name and Marvel and DC duking it out for box office, TV, and Netflix views I see this site as a solid play for someone into the culture and with the marketing know how to make it work.  \n**Verdict:** **Buy** - If I had time to make this work I'd pay about $3,500 for it. There is just a lot of upside and a lot of value in the work already done. Unfortunately it's outside of my current core competency and business focus.\n\n--------\n  \n**Business:** CheapTonight.com  \n**Type:** Website    \n**Business Model:** Ad supported, hyper-local  \n**Listed on:** Flippa.com  \n**Listing type:** Auction  \n**Current Price:** $200  \n**Days til end:** 6  \n**My Thoughts:** I really hate the word cheap. To me it automatically reduces the value of your product or service and attracts only the worst consumer. That being said after I looked into the market for this, I think it could really take off. Groupon / Living Social coupon sites were nice but they started off pretty heavy handed with business owners and the deals were unsustainable. Cheap Tonight could be a welcome alternative allowing business owners more flexibility to list whatever they want, or it could just be your own foray into a few hyper-local markets. Also millenials are really into this kind of temporal thing. Think Hotels Tonight, SnapChat, etc... They want things on demand and are ok with them being gone. If you're in a large metro area this is probably a good play for you, especially if you already own a blog about the local area or any kind of news service.  \n**Verdict:** **Buy** - Unfortunately the site isn't very aesthetically appealing and will require a lot of work to get adoption. In the right hands it has potential. Hotels Tonight is valued at $299 million. I dont think this site and concept has that kind of upside but it could definitely be worth more if more development work was done and a few large metro area markets were penetrated. For a site in this condition with the amount of work that needs done I'd probably be willing to pay about $2,000 but I'd try and keep it below $1,500. Bonus: the domain \"DealsTonight.com\" is not in use, but also not currently for sale. \n\n----------\n\n**Business:**  IBartendNow.com  \n**Type:** Website  \n**Business Model:** Digital Item Sales / Education  \n**Listed on:** Flippa.com   \n**Listing type:** Auction  \n**Current Price:** $16  \n**Days til end:** 23  \n**My Thoughts:** The site is hideously ugly and gives me a bad feeling. I'm super incredibly suspect at their claims of it making $1,636 / month. I found it hard to navigate the site and hard to make a purchase to the point where I had to ask the seller how to purchase. That being said more and more millennials are desperately looking for jobs and extra income and that trend is not likely to decline no matter who gets elected president in November. Personally I'm about the free flow of information and there are a ton of bartender how to videos on YouTube as well as a popular Facebook page the TipsyBartender.  \n**Verdict:** **Do Not Buy** - This seller might actually be making what he claims, but it's unlikely to continue selling at the pace given the ever changing nature of online education. There's also little room to do something new in content marketing to appeal to people who might be want to be bartenders. You'd also need to rebuild this whole site from scratch as it's a beat up old html only site and appears to have a lot of bugs in the code.  \nnote: I bid $10 on this auction becuase I wanted the domain name, I'm already outbid and unlikely to rebid for reasons stated above.\n\n----------\n\n**Business:** Paintball-Stuff.com  \n**Type:** Website  \n**Business model:** Amazon Affiliate Retailer  \n**Listed on:** Flippa.com  \n**Listing type:** Auction  \n**Current Price:** $40  \n**Days til end:** 5  \n**My Thoughts:** This is an affiliate retailer in an industry that has been losing interest for years and shows zero signs of recovery, paintball. I'm not sure why Paintball has been a down industry, but if Google Trends is right the sport and even casual use of this equipment is in it's death spiral. That's the bad news, the good news is that even as it continues to die the industry still has more interest than Disc Golf, Scuba Diving, and Beer Pong - and all of those industries are making those involved a decent amount of money. Sure this is just a paintball affiliate stor, but if you bought it and wanted to get into ecommerce there's a good amount of money left that you could capture, go ahead and look at the online paintball shops, there's only a few sites that I would say are doing a great job. I would think you'd need to really know a lot about this industry or enjoy it yourself to make it work though.  \n**Verdict:** **Buy maybe** - What the heck a maybe? Yeah, there's a lot of downside to this, a sport in a nose dive of interest, a drop shipping site, not the greatest domain name, and a lot of work to position yourself. That leads me to the upside. Nice sports tend to really enjoy a website catering directly to them. I have a client in such an industry and he's one of the largest online retailers in it and he's got a pretty nice house, car, and made a decent living to provide for his family. The other thing is that as Paintball's popularity wanes the big guys like Walmart and Amazon will lose interest and allocate fewer resources to it allowing their affiliates (like this one) to pick up sales volume. If you can get involved in this area and provide decent customer service this could easily turn into a win.  Let's assume you read this far and you're into paintball, you want to start an ecommerce site, well here's one that's 75% done with product you might be able to snag for about $150. The domain isn't the best, but I discovered a decent on that matches the top query in this space pretty well that's available: getpaintballgear.com.   I wouldn't put a ton of money into this as it's doubtful that Paintball's popularity jumps back up any time soon or even levels off if the trend that's been happening for a decade continues.\n\n------------\n\nIf you guys like this I'll keep doing it and mix in apps and other things as we go.\n\nmods: I did not link to the sales pages as I didn't want this to be considered spam, however, I would love to include them for conversation reasons if that's ok.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the kind words everyone. Glad you like it, while the GF is getting ready to go out I decided to toss another one your way.\n","name":"t3_47z7k3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-28 01:22:03","week":8}

Apparently, current Freedom holders will be grandfathered in.

What's unclear right now if the 1.5% will be actual cashback or valuable URs that can be transferred to a CSP or Ink Plus account then transferred to partners. If it's actual cashback, this is garbage, but if it's transferable URs, it's a big change.\n\nSome may prefer the 5x categories, and some may prefer the 1.5x on every purchase.

You should get a 1099-K in the mail if you got more than $20K and 200 transactions.  \n\nPayPal also has fairly decent reports, under activity, just hit payments received and 2015 and you'll see all your payments.\n\nIf you were paid through Amazon, as opposed to just getting giftcards, they'll 1099 you for that amount as well. (I sell on Amazon, so this is a thing for me)\n\nIf you sold through Steam, THEY'LL 1099 you.\n\nSo, the first question is - what papers did you get in the mail?\n\nThe next question is - what is your profit?  You are essentially self employed, and therefore can deduct your computer, internet and other stuff dedicated to getting this income.\n\nNext - how much do you have in the bank?  Because if you MADE $100K, you're gonna owe the IRS a good 25% of that.  Why?  Because you didn't pay your quarterly taxes did you?\n\nAnd if your state has income tax, you have to pony up to them as well.\n\nThe good news is you'll probably get a free pass for your first year, but son, it's time to face the fact that you are gonna owe the feds $25K per $100K for last year and  that you better be socking away 25% of everything you earn this year for your quarterly taxes.  \n\nWhy? Because you have to pay your medicare and social security taxes yourself, since you have no employer!\n\nSo, frankly you need to keep very very good track of every dime going in and out via each method and pay your quarterly taxes. Also, you probably want to see a CPA who knows self employment stuff.\n\nNow, what can you do to salvage this?  Well, as a self employed person THIS year, you can set up an IRA equivalent and stash significant amounts of that money.  However, then it's locked up in an IRA.  \n\nAs for saving for school, you just need to sock the money away.  If your state has a particularly nice 529 plan deduction that improves your state taxes, you can actually set one up with yourself as a beneficiary.  But then it's locked up for tuition.  If you are in, say, CA, this doesn't help you on your state taxes.  However, if you are in say, Oklahoma, which will let you deduct $10K from your income, thus greatly reducing your taxes.  Otherwise, just toss it in a CDs or a savings account.\n\ntl;dr - you're gonna owe big time for last year.  You need to start paying quarterly taxes this year.  You need to keep immaculate records.

These are not institutions that are going to flight from Netflix, which besides Amazon is the single stock with the best balance of growth potential and legitimacy in the entire market\n\nBut beyond all this the issue is that you're advising shorting the stock now, today. So it's at $90.  You think there will be a \"big selling off\" - to what? What's big?  Shorting costs money every single day you do it.  Let's say you \"big\" to you means 20% that's a decent return on a short.  That would be $72.  So you're suggesting that NFLX will trade at 54% of its high.  That it's going to lose half of its value on no catalyst.  That people should just take on all the costs of shorting, with a stock that trades up and down $10-$20 a week on no information - today, don't wait until near earnings, don't use options, just short the stock outright today on February 22?

Most have a 20-25% APR meaning you are looking at 2% of your balance being charged every month if you fail to pay it off. This can hurt if you carry a $1000 balance and get hit $20 of interest and only pay the minimum $25. Before long you owe far more than you make a month and will require a major lifestyle adjustment.\n\nHowever, if you are smart using a CC can have plenty of benefits.\n\n* If someone steals my CC and charges stuff I am not immediately impacted. If someone steals my debit that is money that I not longer have to pay rent, gas, food, the CC. Of course you are not held liable in most circumstances but there is a turn around period before the bank gives you the money back in you debit account wheras the credit card will generally freeze whatever is in dispute.\n\n* If you get a credit card with good rewards you can make a little bit of money on the side. The wife and I both have Amazon Chase cards and generally make $70-100/month off of them. We pay them off so we aren't charged interest and at the end of the year we have almost $1000. Of course this isn't much at all but neither was putting pocket change into a container.\n\n* There are also a lot of benefits like extended returns and such that credit cards offer that very few people know about.\n\n* Finally you can build credit which can make things like buying a home or car far easier.","name":"t1_d0949go","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-22 10:28:19","week":8}

{"id":"d09g6c5","author":"fludru","body":"I do pretty well with Amazon purchases by watching deal sites and tracking prices, and micro-managing my subscribe and save orders.  For most groceries, I rely on a grocery store that delivers, but I can save a lot if I buy in bulk from Amazon instead.  It works well if you tend to need the same kind of things a lot.  I also save tons of money on medical supplies on Amazon - it's criminal how much they are marked up elsewhere, especially locally, and my insurance doesn't cover any of them anyway.  So Prime is a no-brainer for me.  \n\nIt all depends on your lifestyle.  For me, being disabled, it's a pain to get out and it's also expensive unless I can find a friend to take me (caregivers cost like $25/hr).  I realize that's atypical, but there are a lot of people out there besides just the home bound, who benefit from online shopping - either for convenience, or the shipping to your door (not everyone has cars).  Amazon is consistently cheaper than most other online options, their site is easy to navigate, and the free streaming doesn't hurt either since I find cable or satellite TV too overpriced to bother with.  \n\nThe only thing about Amazon I don't really see the appeal of is Prime Pantry.  By all accounts I should be an ideal customer since I'm already reliant on groceries being delivered, but their prices are high and their selection very limited.  The grocery chain I use isn't the least expensive by any means (Hy-Vee) but they beat Prime Pantry across the board, even on delivery cost ($5 an order, or if you order over $100, it is free).

I'm willing to go that low because of how little effort and time is spent on each item for FBA. These are primarily books, but they've been a constant source of sales, and they help pad out my FBA shipments of RA/OA items.\n\nI don't bother with anything that will sell for less than $25 on eBay (unless it's a bulk purchase and I only have to photograph/list once, then I'd consider it), assuming I'm paying $5 or less to obtain it. I figure that I'm at absolute most spending 30 minutes on one item on average (clean, photo, list, pack and ship), so $15 minimum profit for 30 minutes of time is OK with me right now. As I continue and am willing to spend more to make more I expect I'll be looking for bigger profit/hr spent and my minimum selling amount on eBay will rise since I am not planning to do this full time.\n\nAt the moment I don't have interest in selling something that isn't at a minimum doubling my initial investment.\n\nBut I also haven't found anything that's the kind of steady daily sales you're talking about.

{"id":"d09m36i","author":"polishdan","body":"You might want to check out /r/churning's side panel for the Useful Links &amp; Tools wiki they have. There's a link in there for current credit card offers. That'll get you a scope of the best sign up bonuses and a general overview of what cards they prefer.\n\nThat being said, it's a question of what type of rewards you want. Do you want free flights, hotels, rewards or just looking to get cash back for everyday expenses?\n\nIf it's the latter, Chase Freedom and Discover it have 5% quarterly rotating cash back categories [this year for Chase it's Q1) gas station Q2) Grocery Stores Q3) Dining/Bars Q4 of 2015) Amazon; for Discover Q1) Gas stations/bus/train Q2) Dining and Movies Q3) Home Improvement and Amazon Q4) Amazon +TBD]. Discover also doubles your earned cash back after a year with them as a one-time bonus (effectively 10% cash back). Citi also offers a no-limits 2% cash back card on every purchase. No annual fees for the three so it wouldn't hurt to get both Chase and Discover if you're responsible.\n\nIf you're more interested in earning some free vacations while spending money you would be spending anyway, head over to /r/churning and read their intro wiki. Then fall down the churning k-hole while sipping on champagne in first class.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe bonus of these rotating category cards is that if you keep proper track of your finances and have a good idea of what you'll be spending on months from now, you can often leverage the star child of American Capitalism: gift cards. Since you can pick up various gift cards at gas stations, grocery stores, Home Depot, Amazon, etc., you can buy them in advance at a location that counts towards your 5% category and save them for use during the other three quarters of the year.\n\nFor example: I like to go to Starbucks and read for a couple hours after work to decompress. This adds up to $45-60/mo (I know, not the right sub to admit this). But this quarter I get 5% at gas stations, so whenever I'm at one where they sell Starbucks gift cards, I buy all of them until I reach $500 (that's the limit my budget will allow for my bank account to take the short-term hit). With Discover, that's a $50 savings over the year ($500 - 25 (5% back) - 25 (double bonus at year end)) on money I would have spent anyway.\n\n","name":"t1_d09m36i","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2016-02-22 20:28:56","week":8}

{"id":"d09ywt3","author":"gotthelowdown","body":"&gt;I was wondering if anyone has experienced with content sites. How much would you expect from ads?\n\nYou reminded me of one of the first AMAs I ever read:\n\n[\nIAmA guy who owns a website publishing business, works from home, and earns $600,000 - $900,000 per year. AMAA about online business.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dqq2o/iama_guy_who_owns_a_website_publishing_business/)\n\nNaturally, be wary. Could be a scammer. But the thoroughness of his answers gave me the vibe he was legit.\n\nQuote:\n\n&gt; CPMs vary a lot depending on many factors. In a month where we've made a lot of direct sales and the ad networks are performing well they can be up around an average of $5.00.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we haven't sold many direct ads and the networks are performing poorly it can be around $1.50 - $2.00 CPM, occasionally even lower.\n&gt; \n&gt; We use Google Ad Manager (recently renamed to DART for Publishers).\n\nI'd go for niches where advertisers are already spending a lot of money on ads, buying leads, etc. Companies will pay a lot more to get their business in front of a user who's shopping for insurance vs. shopping for books.\n\nPersonally, I think it's a tough game to monetize content sites with ads unless you have a ton of traffic. Ad rates are pretty low. Unless you're talking about really high-end products.  I remember one example of a guy who wrote about home theater systems. Most of his money was from Amazon affiliate commissions (which is usually notorious for being low). Much higher price point than talking about smartphone cases, for comparison.\n\nGood luck.\n","name":"t1_d09ywt3","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-23 01:26:26","week":8}

{"id":"d0a1eax","author":"preferred_lie","body":"I received the same message when selling another nest product. I think it's definitely legit so I wouldn't just ignore it. That being said, if you only have 1 more for sale, I would leave it up until the deadline given in the message (maybe even lower the price to get it sold quickly). \n\nI'm not an attorney or expert in this area so I would recommend doing your own research if you plan to continue selling nest products but this was what I found in my research.  What this attorney is accusing you of is not selling the product but interfering with the contract nest has with its dealers. Tortuous interference is an intentional tort meaning you would've had to have known of the contract between nest and the distributor. Since you likely didn't know, you would never lose in court. Now that you know about the contract, I think it's a different story. The first sale doctrine allows you to sell the product however you can't sell it as new because you purchased it as the end consumer, not a reseller. If it was sold to you to resell, then you in fact interfered with the contract nest has with its distributors and are guilty as charged. The likelihood of nest actually suing you in slim to none if you are just selling a few units. If you are selling hundreds, I would expect them to take action if you don't stop. \n\nThe fact that Amazon hasn't restricted them is irrelevant. Nest is under no obligation to have Amazon restrict the product. Even if they did, I'm not sure Amazon would verify each seller with nest before allowing them to sell. If I were nest I would do it anyway to save on attorney fees as I'm sure they get a bill every time this attorney sends one of these threatening letters.","name":"t1_d0a1eax","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-23 02:27:32","week":8}
{"id":"d0a23za","author":"ilovetmobile","body":"So this probably isn't something that will work for everyone, but I won $5000 and spent most of it-then panicked and saved $400 (to begin the painful journey of covering in my mind what was a possible $1,800+ tax penalty) for the supposed tax penalty I thought would be 30-40%. It was not, it was only 15% because it was reported on a W-2G. Having to prepare for the worst, showed me how much I could be saving, and has encouraged that good habit. \n\nI have a $500 line of credit on my checking account that is always in the back of my mind as \"extra money\".  It receives a $100 payment every two weeks from my checking account automatically. \n\nI'm really good about paying bills but not actually saving money. \n\nLately I've been using Robin Hood (stock trading app) to hold my legit savings because of the time barrier (approx. 1 week to withdraw) that it creates, and dabble in stocks. \n\nEssentially, I'm borrowing from a line of credit to save and auto-paying it back down. So far, I've been able to save $1,400 in two months that otherwise would have ended up spent, by effectively creating a \"savings bill\" that I have to pay into. \n\nI'm looking at continuing with stocks, as it can easily fetch $20 per trading day. I'm also looking at Capital Gains in the light that I can make $1,800 this year and fully forfeit my tax refund before being required to pay. If I make more, I'll establish a deposit-only account to put 50% of the proceeds into, for tax time. 50% of any profit will either get put back into stocks or used to pay off debt. My goal is to outpace my interest rate on two credit cards, and drop a large lump sum at the end of the year. My goal is to add $100-200 to the pot by pulling from the line of credit after auto payments hit each month, but it will get paid ultimately before accruing any interest. \n\nThis method works for me because I know to a penny how much I have and usually spend it all. The automatic payments, credit line and trading account tie my hands so I more or less have to let the process work-and my bank account takes no visible hit for it-and I only see my trading account increase in value. \n\nI've also gone into stores (Petco, looking for a cat fountain dish) and used Shopsavvy to scan the barcode, then placed an order for that item on Amazon from within the store. I usually save 40%-and get the item the next day, walking out of the actual store empty-handed. \n\nI re-negotiated the cable and cellular bills, saving $1040 over the next year. \n\nBecause any trades I do can incur losses, and my goal is to improve personal finances, the money saved on cable, the cell phone, the cat dish-all equals gains or offsets losses. Personal finance and trading share the same balance sheet in my mind. \n\nThat's my process of saving money. I'm also paying off the nickel-and-dime stuff to improve cash flow and go after the big bills (snowball). It may not work for you. Use at your own risk.  No warranty is expressed or implied.

{"id":"d0ac60y","author":"im14andwutisthis","body":"My favorite personal favorite site is [SurveySavvy](https://www.surveysavvy.com/?m=6766539&amp;c=120) | [Non-ref](https://www.surveysavvy.com/). Unfortunately, their surveys are infrequent, but they're usually pretty high-paying, they rarely disqualify you, and when they do, it's only after you've answered a couple of questions. They also have a really great referral system (Thanks!). You can get a payout at anytime, but it's by check, which some might find mildly inconvenient.\n\nWhile SurveySavvy is my personal favorite, [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/refer/69Xlsxdowpb8Bp7beZcPOw/) | [Non-ref](https://today.yougov.com/) probably better fits the profile of what you're looking for. YouGov has pretty frequent surveys considering how valuable they are. I get an average of 3 or 4 a week. However, I chose to download their extension (which also awards you a few bonus bucks), and you may not get surveys as frequently if you don't download it. Another con is that the payout minimum is pretty high. They payout with Amazon, Walmart, AMC, and many other giftcards, but you need to collect at a minimum 30,000 points (~45 surveys which take 4 to 15 minutes each) to get a payout. Not only that, but 30,000 points will only get you like a $25 AMC gift card. For a better prize, you need to rack up 60,000 points for something like a $50 Walmart gift card, or, better yet, 100,000 points for a $100 Amazon gift card. All that aside, 4 to 12 minutes for a survey that valuable is about the best you can find on the market, and the survey frequency is equally as good.\nUnfortunately, the best survey sites are going to be invite only or ones that aren't advertised. So be sure to try your luck at getting invited to Pinecone whenever they're accepting invitations.\n\nLastly, I recommend you browse this sub for other survey sites that might be good, but I can't recommend myself. Search for the sites people recommend, look at the all time top posts on this sub, and check the Most Common Beermoney Sites.\n\nEDIT: I have one last site to recommend: [Innopoll](https://www.innopoll.com/). Again, this is one of those very infrequent but very solidly paying survey sites. It also only works with Paypal. It's unique in that all you have to do is sign up with your email and maybe give some brief profile information. Once that's done, they will never contact you or spam your email account unless they have a survey to offer you, and you won't have to keep track of their website. Once you complete a survey, they'll automatically send money right to your email, so be sure to link up your email that's connected to your Paypal. They will occasionally disqualify you from a survey, but only after you've answered a few questions, and you'll still get a small monetary compensation.\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_d0ac60y","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2016-02-23 07:41:08","week":8}

You can sign-up for Credit Karma and/or Credit Sesame for free to get an idea of what your credit score looks like. Most the cards I'm going to mention, and most cash back cards in general, are best applied for when your score is 700+. I'm going to assume you realize that you should never carry a balance, never charge what you can't already afford, etc.\n\nThe Chase Freedom, Discover IT, and U.S. Bank Cash+ are all good general 5% cards. \n\nFreedom:\n\n* 5% categories that change each quarter (groceries, restaurants, movies, gas, Amazon, etc.)\n* 1% on everything else\n* $150 worth of cashback/points bonus for spending $500 on it in the first 3 months (occasionally offers $200-250)\n* Additional $25 after adding an authorized user and using that card (Chase only requires name/address for authorized users so you can use a variation of your own name)\n* 15 months no interest intro promo\n* No Annual Fee\n\nIT:\n\n* 5% categories that change each quarter (groceries, restaurants, movies, gas, Amazon, etc.)\n* 1% on everything else\n* Cash back gets doubled at the end of the first year (So essentially 10% for the first year)\n* 12 months no interest intro promo\n* No Annual Fee\n\nCash+:\n\n* lets you choose two 5% categories each quarter (clothing stores, department stores, movie theaters, electronic stores, fast food, etc.)\n* lets you choose one 2% category each quarter (gas, restaurants, or groceries)\n* 1% on everything else\n* $25 bonus when you wait and redeem at least $100 cash back for the first time\n* 9 months no interest intro promo\n* No Annual Fee\n\nThe American Express Blue Cash Preferred is a great gas/groceries card. \n\n* Gives 6% on groceries (first $6k), 3% on gas, and 2% at department stores.  \n* 1% on everything else\n* $150 in cash back bonus for spending $1,000 in the first 3 months (occasionally offers up to $250)\n* 15 months no interest intro promo\n* $75 annual fee, but if you spend enough on gas/groceries it more than pays for itself.\n\nThe American Express Blue Cash Everyday is a decent gas/groceries card with no annual fee.\n\n* Gives 3% on groceries (first $6k) and 2% on gas and at department stores.\n* 1% on everything else\n* $100 in cash back bonus for spending $1,000 in the first 3 months (has offered $250 before)\n* No annual fee\n* 15 months no interest intro promo\n* You can get the Preferred and then downgrade to this card before the second annual fee if you don't spend enough. The $50 difference in bonuses makes the potential loss minimal.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire preferred has a great sign-up bonus but probably isn't the best for a first card.  I'll tell you about it anyway, though.\n\n* 2% on restaurants and travel\n* Can either be redeemed for statement credits or if you redeem through their travel portal you get an extra 25% boost.  \n* Points/cashback can also be transferred to travel partners for even better value. \n* $500 worth of cashback/points after spending $4k in 3 months (best bonus they've offered... but only worth it if you already have that much in expenses coming up anyway)\n* Additional $50 after adding an authorized user and using that card (Chase only requires name/address for authorized users so you can use a variation of your own name)\n* $95 annual fee that's waived the first year (if you don't travel, this card is best used for it's bonus and then closed before you have to pay an annual fee)\n* You can also apply for this and the Freedom in the same sitting and only incur a single hard-pull/inquiry on your credit report. In addition, your Freedom cashback/points can be transferred to this card to be used on travel expenses through the portal (25% gain) or then transferred to travel partners.\n\nThe Citi Double Cash or Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature both give 2% back on all purchases if you don't want to mess with categories.  \n\nDouble Cash:\n\n* 2% back on all purchases... no limits. (1% when you charge it and 1% when you pay it off)\n* 15 months no interest intro promo\n* No annual fee\n\nRewards Visa:\n\n* 2% back on all purchases... no limits.

{"id":"d0aq64i","author":"omelettedufromage","body":"Strangely enough, this coincides perfectly with an extremely long stretch of the worst Prime delivery times I've ever seen.  Two-Day is now 5-Day and Next Day is rarely even an available option any more... and *this* is the time they think it would be best to push people into buying Prime? Going to be a lot of disappointment there. \n\n**Edited for some clarification since my mailbox is blowing up:**\n\nThe office to which I have things shipped is just south of Baltimore (not rural whatsoever).  It is a 15 minute drive to an Amazon warehouse.  The location also qualifies for Prime Now (albeit the 2hour delivery radius rather than 1hour).  I am 10 minutes from a major UPS hub and 5 from a major Fedex one. My location is not an issue.\n\nFurthermore, this is not just a couple of one-off issues.  Last year we spent close to $13,000 with Amazon and in the past, had Amazon packages arriving almost daily.  I'd guess about 80% of our orders we shipped Next Day.  So far this year we've only been able to place a dozen or so orders because projected delivery dates have kept Amazon from being an option (and even times where projections are good, we sometimes end up with delays).  Something undeniably significant has happened to the Prime service since the new year.  I keep saying that I'd gladly pay hundreds more for the Prime service we had 5 years ago.","name":"t1_d0aq64i","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2016-02-23 17:39:14","week":8}

{"id":"d0asbug","author":"frenchpressgirl","body":"$1k/month for groceries for 2 people and a small kid is a LOT. We're in a high COL area and we spend about $800/month for 3 people. Ideas:\n\n- Make a meal plan for the entire week before you go shopping. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks. Do not shop hungry. Do not buy things that are not part of your meal plan.\n\n- Meat is expensive, and veggies are good for you, so eat vegetarian and/or vegan 1-2x/week. My decidedly carnivorous SO loves \"[big veggie bowl](http://ohsheglows.com/2014/01/06/the-big-vegan-bowl/).\" \n\n- Buy cheap cuts of meat for the slow-cooker. Visit /r/slowcooking for ideas. Bonus: save time on dinner prep in the evening! Anything involving pork butt is tough to screw up. [Here's](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/10031990774/slow-cooker-kalua-pig) a favorite at our house -- it's actually slow-cooking on the kitchen counter as we speak! :)\n\n- Check out Costco, Boxed, or Amazon Subscribe and Save for bulk products (dish soap, pet supplies, TP), but only the things you know you'll use.\n\n- Remember frozen veg: often cheaper than fresh, keep in your freezer better than fresh ones keep in your fridge, and typically frozen at the height of their freshness.\n\n- Trader Joe's Dark Roast is fantastic and it's only $5/12-oz can. It's all we drink in our high-coffee-consumption house.\n\nBest of luck!","name":"t1_d0asbug","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-23 18:27:18","week":8}

{"id":"d0at97x","author":"lvhardware","body":"Lots of parroting of common advice (no one will sign your NDA) and also horrific anecdotes (your idea will be stolen). In practice, I think the most common truth is somewhere in between. In general, most people are *not* looking to steal your idea--competent folks generally have their plates full and unless you've already sunk a ton of work into the idea and developed it they won't be in a good position to evaluate it anyway. A good idea generally is the result of some unique insight into a market or problem hence most others won't see its value because they don't have your vantage point. Can ideas be stolen? Sure. I think it's a tired meme here, but \"execution is everything\" has some merit. I have seem average ideas do extremely well with great execution and wonderful ideas fail with bad execution. But it's not everything. To pull an example close to my experience: many people have built 3D printer companies, but only a few have been extremely successful, and some of those in spite of poorer execution than the competition. Their vision and insight (idea) was an important differentiator. I'd mark it roughly as 70% execution and 30% vision; but those are pretty much made up, what matters is that you can't hit it big without both.\n\nAn important thing to look for is alignment. If you're hiring people to help you, are their goals in line with yours? If you hire a possible competitor, do they really want to help you out? If they're super honest they'll just turn you down. Otherwise they might make your product and you're happy, but now they have tons of info on you and they can just improve their products to be better than yours. They haven't stolen your idea or acted unethically, but you still end up in a position that's not-great.\n\nNow that I've waxed philosophical, here's the nuts and bolts. You are at stage 0.5. You have an idea and some conception of how it would work and be made. Stage 1 is getting actual designs, stage 2 is proof of concept and prototyping, stage 3 is testing (user and/or technology), stage 4 is manufacturing, stage 5 is sales/launch. This is super rough and there are tons of confounding factors like crowdfunding, outsourced development, pivoting, changes and feedback, etc. \n\nIn general what you need to do to get from Stage 0 (idea and research) to 1 is to create digital models of the product. Keywords here are mechanical and electrical CAD, embedded systems, Solidworks, Autodesk Fusion 360, 3D modeling, drawing, and drafting. Depending on complexity and your skills, you can do this yourself or hire an engineer. You might find help at the local hackerspace/makerspace. A multitalented engineer (from said hackerspace or a freelance site), could get you a rough alpha or proof of concept. But as you move up the production ladder or add different fields (mechanical, electrical/embedded, software) you'll need more and more specialized help and a larger team.\n\nStage 1 to Stage 2 your existing help should be able to walk you through this. Keywords: 3D printing, Rapid prototyping, 3dhubs.com, Stratasys Redeye, McMaster-Carr, Misumi, imaterialise, shapeways, ponoko, techshop, inventables carvey.\n\nStage 2 to Stage 3 is on you. You should know your customers and how to get useful feedback. Keywords: user testing, user experience, interaction design, ergonomics, experience design, customer development\n\n3 --&gt; 4 you will want to decide to manage the manufacturing yourself, hire a consultant, or use a CM (kind of in-between). This is the part where tons of people currently have problems. One of the main things to understand is that manufacturers are like computers: they are set to build exactly what you tell them to. They don't (and can't) learn exactly what you want to have built, so you need to be able to communicate explicitly. Keywords: DFMA, GD&amp;T, contract manufacturer, alibaba, sourcing, mfg.com, CNC, machine shops, product design, product development\n\n4 --&gt; 5 your main concern is logistics and delivery, along with sales and marketing. The main keyword here is Third Party logistics (3PL). This is what Amazon FBA is. Beyond that, too many keywords.\n\nIf you made it this far, congrats! Feel free to PM me, as my company helps inventors and startups with product development and manufacturing. Our focus is mechanical design and micro- to medium-volume manufacturing.\n\nGood luck!","name":"t1_d0at97x","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-23 18:47:44","week":8}

That's incredible considering whatever the conversion rate is, and the posted rates for referrals according to flyertalk are anywhere from the $100-$300 range.  Compare that to a marketplace like eBay or Amazon that would be lucky to earn a few dollars per sale net costs.  His costs for advertising, writers, and webhosting aren't going to be that high considering his ROI.  This is like making huge rips from selling expensive mattresses or washing machines, but without the need to hold any inventory.  Nice gig if you can get it.  Plus he's stated he negotiated his own rates with banks (read: HIGH), and it would cause a shit storm for all the little blogs if they were to learn what he makes.  Small blogs are probably making much smaller commissions and have to take whatever scraps the banks offer them.  \n\nHe mentions a eight million point balance for awards, mainly from advertising expenses.  So that's highly indicative of a multimillionaire.  It wouldn't make sense to have thrown millions on advertising if you were only personally worth $100k, let's say.  \n\nHe talks about how the $30k trip was a splurge, but totally worth it from a notoriety standpoint.  It advertised his site and was shocking enough to be written about by news outlets.  So it helped him get his business to the next level.  Again, perfect kind of expenditure for a multimillionaire, total foolish waste of money if he was only worth six figures.  He doesn't strike me as a fool with his money, but a guy working within his large budget.  \n\nI think it's safe to say he cracks a million a year, plus whatever bankrate bought him for.  I doubt bankrate would be that interested if his business was only worth a quarter million.  It would have to have grown to a certain size and maturity to make it attractive for a buyout.

For some years the categories will align, but usually the category separation is pretty good.\n\nIf you do a ton of grocery shopping, you should actually add the Amex Blue Cash Everyday instead of the Everyday card - it offers 3% and 2% on groceries and gas, respectively.\n\nNeither the Discover IT nor BCE have annual fees.\n\nP.S. Closing the other two cards isn't a big deal for you in the long run.

I didn't see any of them available on Amazon or ebay at the time, so I don't know what their current price is, but they were originally $250 coffee makers.  It doesn't do a *lot* more, but it does have a filter in it, and it makes three different sizes, and has a temperature setting.  Also when left on, it will make a second or third cup almost instantly, instead of having to wait for it to cool off and re-heat.  The coffee is also stronger, woo.\n\nOutside of thrifting, when I buy things I want, I check to see if they make a good flip also.  So I'm occasionally buying like 5 of something that I want, and selling off 4 of them.  \n\n","name":"t1_d0b8wq6","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-24 00:33:25","week":8}

{"id":"d0bcsz3","author":"ChurnerMan","body":"I've always planned on the Amazon gift card thing but never needed to do it.\n\nI skim slickdeals every day and during the holidays watch it closer. It seems at least once a year there's a deal that just makes you want to use every credit card.\n\nFor example in late 2013 there was a deal on a site called yub where if you spent $2 on your linked card at Starbucks they would give you a $10 Amazon card. Before I realized I had linked all 8 of my credit cards at the time and a couple of my debit cards to a dozen different accounts. Since you could only link your card once this was perfect use for all those cards. Btw you could load $2 to a Starbucks gift card to trigger the deal.\n\nAnother I've found useful is adding AUs on any card that doesn't require SSN. So if there was a Groupon deal or whatever you know have a card in your mom's name or sister name to place an order for them too. Since some AU cards have the same account number as the main card holder you may need to use a card from a different bank that you may never use otherwise.\n\nAlong these same lines on seldom used cards you could have the billing address be an old address just used for scaling online deals.","name":"t1_d0bcsz3","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-02-24 02:10:11","week":8}

It is basically a lot of work to make transferable Ultimate Rewards points that give discounted travel, and it only makes sense to go full in if you plan to spend a lot of every year traveling, or you are unemployed and are doing it for cashback at a fairly bad $/hr.)\n\nIf you are grinding MS on cards to get their normal multiplier (rather than doing MS to get a signup bonus) then you want cards with the highest earning multipliers. Ink+ gets 5x at office stores, Freedom gets 5x at revolving quarterly categories like gas stations, Amazon, and other things.\n\nIn the optimal case a person would MS the full $1500/quarter limit on the three Freedoms, getting them 90k UR per year. In reality it's hard to do this, because some of the categories can be things that are hard to MS. Then they would also MS the Ink+ for $50k, getting them another 250k UR. MS typically costs around 1-2%, so all of that would cost $680-$1360 to do. The resultant 340k UR is worth $3400 in cash, or hilariously high values if you transfer them to airlines and book first class tickets. Like possibly $50k or more.\n\nFor you, a normal person who does not MS, you should just keep the CSP and use it any time you rent a car or buy a plane ticket or eat at a restaurant, and ignore the idea of grinding MS. Though if you don't use your Slate much (and hopefully it has no balance on it) you could consider changing it to a Freedom and using it for gas or Amazon in relevant quarters, and transferring those points to the CSP to use them for things like Hyatt award nights or United award flights.\n\n","name":"t1_d0bekkt","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-02-24 02:51:03","week":8}

KMI+, or KMI WS, is basically one gigantic call option contract which is equivalent to making a little deposit to reserve the right to buy shares of KMI at $40. (Warren Buffett owns shares of KMI; it's a very, very popular oil stock and has one of the biggest monopolies on oil pipe movement throughout the US.)\n\nThe idea is that you want KMI to fly way above $40, so that you can exercise the ownership you have of KMI+ to buy KMI at $40 (yes, you would need money to dish out for that purchase later too), then sell it at whatever its high price is (like say $60 or some sky-high area). I'm not sure of what the conversion rate is.\n\n[Look at where KMI is now](https://www.bing.com/search?q=kmi) (use Bing for Amazon credit, haha). That's why KMI+ is so dirt-cheap; there's little suggested chance of KMI going to $40 by its expiration. Yes, the entirety of KMI+ is on a time limit and will expire on May 2017 (the ticker will cease to exist and if KMI&lt;$40 by then, your KMI+ investment will be gone). It's literally nothing more than a bet, basically that oil prices will return back up before then.","name":"t1_d0bo23n","subreddit":"RobinHood","subreddit_id":"t5_2uud8","created_utc":"2016-02-24 07:09:14","week":8}

{"id":"d0bpwuk","author":"Lyrrad0","body":"When I moved from Canada to the US last year, I just cashed out most of my savings and converted them to USD.  However, whether this is the right decision for you depends on several factors.\n\n* Are you going to stay in the US for the long term?  The longer you plan to stay, the more funds you'd probably want to convert.  For reasons I describe later, you probably don't want to invest it in Canada if you're moving to the US.\n* Will you need these funds in the US?  For example, if you need to make a deposit on an apartment, or need money to live on before you get paid, or have an emergency fund, then it may make sense to convert more funds.  In my case, I ended up paying more than $15k in relocation expenses before my first paycheck/reimbursement, so having a large amount of savings was a great help.  You'll probably spend less since you're moving a smaller distance, but having the funds available will probably give you some peace of mind.\n* Do you need the car? If you need a car, then purchasing one in Canada might be a better option.  However, look out for regulations that may prevent you from exporting or registering it, or additional taxes or fees that may be applied.  If you're buying a new car, make sure the warranty will still be valid in the other country.  It may be better to get a cheaper used car in the US rather than potentially purchasing a more expensive new one in Canada.  Depending on the area in which you'll be working, you may want to consider balancing living within walking/biking distance to work (and potentially higher rents), vs the time and expense of commuting.\n* You have access to many of the same funds in both countries and I'd recommend becoming knowledgable before coming up with an investment plan.  Taxes may become a concern if you have investments in the country that you're not currently a resident of.   Some investments are covered by a tax treaty between the US and Canada, while others are not, and the different tax treatment may make it necessary to hire an (expensive) tax professional to handle these situations.  I personally attempted to avoid this by cashing out my Canadian investments before moving and later investing them in US accounts definitively covered by the tax treaty.  This way, no matter what country I'll be in in the future (between the US and Canada), I'll have a relatively simple return.  If you have income or certain kinds of property in both countries, your tax returns can become very complicated.   Note that investment costs can be much lower in the US, since there are index funds available for significantly less than what you'd pay in Canada.  Keep in mind many Canadian brokerages also won't want to keep your account open if you're a US resident. Similarly, you may restricted from your US brokerage account if you move back to Canada.\n* You may want to keep CAD for some expenses.  For example, a Netflix account costs the same number of US or Canadian dollars each month, so you'd prefer to pay in Canadian dollars.  Currently, the content that's available depends on your physical location and not the country that your account is based in.  If you get a Costco membership, it's cheaper to pay $55 or $110 CAD than $55 or $110 USD (though some states don't tax membership, which reduces the savings, since HST applies to the cost in Canada).\n* If you're unsure if you want to convert your money, you could also get a Canadian credit card that has no foreign exchange fees.  It may be difficult to get a US based credit card when you first move if you don't have a US credit history.  I know the Chase Amazon.ca card doesn't charge forex fees, which makes it a decent card to use internationally.  If you eventually want to get a US based card, you could look into an Amex Global Transfer to exchange your Canadian Amex card for a US one, though I believe you have to have your Canadian card for at least a year before doing so.  Some Canadian banks have US affiliates that can use your Canadian credit history as well.\n* While you're still a student, you may want to apply for an unsecured line of credit in Canada.  It seems like US banks charge fees for this product, while they are free in Canada.  Personally, I've used them as a free chequing account, since some banks (TD, for example), allow you to keep a positive balance.  While not a true emergency fund, it could give you flexibility in some situations.  I'd advice caution with this, if you don't believe that you can handle this account responsibly.\n* If you do plan to convert a large amount of money, look into lower cost methods of exchange.  $17k is probably above the level that Norbert's Gambit would work to save you some money, though it may not be worth the paperwork in opening up a brokerage account if you don't already have one.  Paying an extra 1% exchange cost would cost you $170.\n* Consider opening accounts with a US bank affiliated with a Canadian one before you go. For example, I opened a TD Bank USA account, which allowed me to do free wire transfers between my USD accounts in both countries.  TD's US branches are mainly on the east coast (but you can open an account over the phone), but another Canadian bank may be a better choice for you.\n\n","name":"t1_d0bpwuk","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-24 08:29:37","week":8}

Denver  \n6. Portland, San Fransisco, mostly domestic flights, possibly Hawaii  \n\n**My Goal:** I recently accepted a new job that will include monthly travel, sometimes internationally. I will generally be responsible for booking my own travel, which the company will later reimburse. I want the best possible card to maximize my rewards on these purchases for my own benefit. Churning is definitely an option, and you are the experts, but my preference is a long-term card that will let me build up miles/points.  \n\n**Current Cards:** I have a deliberately chosen set of cards that I use for my daily purchases: AmEx Blue Cash Preferred for groceries (6% cash back), MC Barclaycard SallieMae for gas and Amazon (5% cash back),  MC Citi DoubleCash for everything else (2% cash back). Currently, I would use my DoubleCash card to purchase travel, but I'm sure there is a better option.  \n\n**Requirements:** I need a card with the best rewards for travel purchases. I've seen plenty of cards that reward regular purchases with travel miles, but I want one that I can specifically use for purchasing airfare and hotels. Interest rates are irrelevant because I will be reimbursed for my purchases by the company and immediately pay off the card. Annual fees are acceptable if the benefits outweigh the price.  \n\n**Rewards:** I generally prefer cash back rewards (as you can guess from my other cards) because of the spending flexibility. I understand that I will get more bang for my buck on these purchases with travel rewards though. It would be nice to use the miles I'm earning on vacations and trips with my SO (companion tickets could be excellent). I fly out of Denver, so I will likely be flying United and Alaskan Airlines most of the time (Frontier is the cheapest, but their service and nickel-and-diming is terrible). I'm tall, so cards that might get me upgraded seating would be nice. There is not a particular hotel chain that I prefer.   \n\n**Cards I am looking at:**  \nChase Sapphire Preferred: Could be a solid choice. The 50k point bonus after the first 3 months is tempting, and should be attainable. The card rewards travel and restaurant purchases with 2x points. There is a possible benefit of avoiding foreign transaction fees. Chase offers 20% discounted travel if booked through their Chase Ultimate Rewards program, but I have never used that.    \n\nUnited Airlines MileagePlus Cards: There are a few choices, but their Explorer card looks like it has the best rewards, similar to the Chase Sapphire Preferred card above.  \n\n**Other cards:**  \nI have done some research into airline and hotel specific cards. They seem like they could be worth it, but would restrict my booking choices. Does anyone have experience with United or AA rewards programs or cards? Maybe a Hilton/Marriott/IHG card? Would there be a benefit to having separate cards for airfare and hotels?  \n  \nI've tried to provide all relevant info, but let me know if there's something I left out. What cards should I consider?  \nThanks!","name":"t1_d0byasl","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2016-02-24 15:39:14","week":8}

{"id":"d0cvtsz","author":"godiebiel","body":"n a world plagued by low productivity, inequality, negative interest rates and deflation, the idea that something as simple as a physical cash ban might magically turn things around is, understandably, a tempting proposition.\n\nFurthermore, there are many convincing arguments for why this would be the case.\nMost simply, cash is the means by which the criminal and tax-dodging grey economy get to have their cake and eat it: i.e. retain a right to claim the fruits of a collaborative and productive society supported by a social welfare system funded by taxes, without having to contribute their share of the bill (or in the case of the criminal element, despite actively disrupting the collaborative structure). Without cash, then, crime doesn’t pay, because there’s no way to protect the proceeds of a criminal lifestyle. As a consequence, the argument goes, criminals would simply pack it in.\n\nOn a nerdier finance level, banning cash seems a neat way to break through the zero lower bound. If there isn’t a bearer cash-out option, after all, everyone’s current liquid wealth becomes subject to an equal amount of tax whether they like it or not. More pertinent still, unless a person is prepared to transfer their cash to productive ventures (with some personal risk), everyone’s risk-free liquid capital turns into a depreciating asset. And that, in turn, sends a larger message to society that if you’re not prepared to take risk or pay your taxes, you don’t get the right to long-term par value protection for your wealth. In other words, keep what you need for consumption’s sake in liquid form, but be forced to share some fraction of it with the wider welfare state or — if you have more than you need — get a move on with investing it in our collective future prosperity.\n\nPut that way, it’s fair to assume the productive and tax-paying members of society would see logic in a cash ban.\n\nBut perhaps things aren’t as simple as that.\n\nTo wit, see the latest thoughts from Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, on why it isn’t necessarily all about the Benjamins. On the matter of eliminating high-value notes from society to reduce crime and tax evasion, Colas notes:\n\nCriminals always find a way. Cigarettes were the primary currency in the U.S. prison system until most states passed bans on smoking over the last decade. Now, inmates use everything from prepaid debit cards to postage stamps to foil envelopes of mackerel as currency.\nChina’s largest banknote is worth 100 RMB (about $15), which should make the country largely immune from the ills caused by high denomination bills. Interestingly, Larry Summer’s own missive about the perils of the $100 bill notes that “China… has made attacking corruption a central part of its economic and political strategy”. Yes, there are no doubt $100 bills circulating in China but even the Sands paper only cites one example of a corrupt official found (in 2014) with a large quantity of $100 bills. Clearly there is more to corrupt behavior than the existence of high denomination bank notes.\nA Boston Fed study published in 2014 found that 5% of American consumers have a $100 bill in their wallet or purse. They tend to be more affluent than the average consumer (no surprise). To put that 5% in context, it amounts to 12 million people carrying $100 bills every day. And since we doubt criminals answer Fed surveys we assume that those 12 million people are all law abiding citizens using their currency for legitimate reasons. Bottom line: real people use $100s too.\nConsequently, he says:\n\n“…the argument that eliminating the $100 will automatically reduce crime is, at best, suspect.”\n\nOur own posts advocating official emoney argued that expanding the central bank balance sheet to everyone would be an elegant way to overcome the safe asset shortage problem, as well as a good mechanism for reducing panic associated with par value destruction and for introducing negative interest rates to the system.\n\nBut this assumption was based on a major oversight. An e-money float — even a central bank or government one — still has to be invested in something if it’s to retain par value for society. Consequently, just providing an official e-money float is relatively meaningless unless underlying investment action is also taken. But there’s a good reason why central banks tend to outsource the job of capital allocation to a combination of the private and public sector rather than do it themselves directly (it’s never a good idea for one entity alone to make allocation decisions).\n\nOn that basis, if we were to provide everyone with access to the central bank balance sheet, chances are that without underlying reinvestment the scale of the negative interest rate needed to keep society ticking over would be so extortionately high that it would put people off from keeping their wealth there in the first place.\n\nPrivate sector par-value protection alternatives would spring up in no time and do so, we imagine, in both electronic and bearer form. Some would be effective. Others would be nothing more than pyramid schemes. At first the unreputable value-destroying schemes would lose out to the reputable value-creating ones. But in time, however, the pressure to allow for par value entry-and-exit between systems for the sake of commerce and trade would encourage greater interoperability between the systems, the mutual sharing of risk and thus the reemergence of cartel-like central bank institutions. Back to square one.\n\nAnd the same, of course, can be said of bearer value coupons representing illicit value. (Note the rise in black-market circles of the use of electronic gift vouchers and private sector coupons/points as a replacement store of value for paper cash.)\n\nIn that regard, the coupon most likely to triumph as a worthy alternative to cash should be that which promises the greatest liquidity, the greatest transferability and the greatest purchasing scope. For now, at least, the only thing stopping super e-retailers like Amazon from displacing central banks as society’s preferred money issuers are the strategic actions they take to make their coupons less desirable as money: gift voucher expiries, non-transferability of value and in many cases specified redemption terms (vouchers for specific items, rather than store-wide optionality).\n\nSadly, where there are expiries or limited terms, there is always scope for middlemen to intermediate such hurdles. Hence, even if your voucher isn’t transferable chances are the underlying item you’re redeeming is, meaning you can still be instructed by third parties on what to redeem on others’ behalf in exchange for a fee or a reciprocal right to draw on someone else’s voucher in the future.\n\nWe see this already emerging by way of the rise of reciprocal store-of-value networks like bitcoin and the ‘mutual aid’ social financial network of MMM, but also with the rise of professional reshipping agents.\n\nIn short, it’s hard to imagine how banning cash or instituting an ‘e-money-only’ economy could tackle the underlying challenge society is really facing: the lack of an incentive to act productively in the first place and an oversized black-list of parties which the remaining productive element is supposed to ostracise from civil society even whilst living right next door to them.\n\nMeanwhile, as Colas also observes, there are a number social benefits which could be entirely eliminated if large denomination bills were to be banned outright. Two of the most pressing being:\n\nThe $100 bill is an extraordinarily efficient tool in advancing American interests, at home and abroad. It costs about $0.12 to print a new $100, or $1,200 for every million. Now, if you just hand them out randomly (as apparently was done in Iraq), you won’t see much benefit. But in a crisis – and there is always one brewing somewhere – $1 million dollars may be the difference between safe passage for the men and women of the U.S. military and disaster. In my book, that’s reason enough to keep it around in some form.\nThe $100 bill is an outpost of privacy in a world that seems more starved of that right every day. In that respect, the current debate over high denomination notes is very much on-theme with other issues that dominate the headlines, from Silicon Valley’s data encryption practices to government surveillance to how much information you put on your Facebook page. All of which means we haven’t heard the last of this debate.\nThe first might seem a frivolous or exaggerated benefit, but it actually runs to the heart of how civil societies have always defended prosperity. Namely, when it’s too costly for your society to go to war or the enemy is too fragmented, or one’s own people need protection, whilst outside of your jurisdictional control it sometimes pays for a nation state to cut deals with the very pirates or predators who would otherwise destabilise your nation’s prosperity and order.\n\n","name":"t1_d0cvtsz","subreddit":"Economics","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1s","created_utc":"2016-02-25 05:04:12","week":8}

After the 1st 2 years, you need to spend a minimum of $1,250 annually at grocery stores just to break even with the $75 annual fee.\n\nAfter the 1st 2 years, the 6% back will actually be 4.75% when you consider the annual fee if you spend the max of $6,000. It will be less if you spend less.\n\n$6,000 x 6% = $360\n\n$360 - $75 = $285\n\n$285 ÷ $6,000 = 4.75%\n\n","name":"t1_d0cy2ib","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-25 06:15:23","week":8}

This is a tip we mention in Rule 8:\n\n&gt;No more than two posts per every 24 hours. One post for one type of trade, one post for another type of trade. (\"Type\" means the [H]ave and [W]ant items.) Don't post for the same type of trade twice, and don't try to get around this rule by deleting a previous post. Note that changing the asking price slightly for the same type of trade, or posting about two different gift cards from the same company does not count as a \"different\" trade.\n\n&gt;Pro tip: leave rates and amounts out of your title if you think you'll want to change your rate or update your stock of available gift cards before your 24 hours are up. That way you can edit that information in your submission text, since reddit post titles can't be edited.\n\nI reopened your first post, so hopefully that gives it more visibility. We can't really bend the rules on something like this because it's not fair to everyone else here if one person gets to have more of their posts visible.

This can be done by registering an EIN with the IRS, filing a DBA with your city (or state), and opening a bank account. That's having a business.\n\nI actually hurt my friend's feelings on this same subject earlier this week because she does photography and has a website where she posts her work and people can contact her for hire. However, she does not have a DBA or a Tax ID for her photography. I told her she does not have a business, which she disagreed with. But whats the difference between her and a freelancer? Nothing, she is a photographer-for-hire. \n\nShe is still an entrepreneur, just like every blogger or Amazon FBA person out there. Trying to make money for yourself automatically makes you an entrepreneur. But having a business is more than just making money for yourself. There is a certain level of responsibility and accountability that comes with starting and running a business, that is not always present with entrepreneurship. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's all semantics. You can argue that being a blogger is the same as having a business. Maybe the world of business is changing, but I don't see having a blog as a business.

Literally three buildings down from my house is a corner store market which is the most expensive option but is easily walkable.

The next option is my version of a bougie grocer which is about a 2 mile trip - many people here call them expensive, but I don't find them too unreasonable as long as I stick to mainly staples and store brands (their convenience foods and non-food items are killer though.) My other options are all about a 15-20 mile trip: Sam's Club, Walmart, Aldi's, etc. I only drive out to them maybe twice a month and buy bulk staples.\n\nI do agree that time &amp; travel costs should be factored in to shopping trips. I find it's not worth it to drive 20 miles to save 20 cents on an item, so I try my best to plan shopping trips to stock up on dry goods.

{"id":"d0e7bs3","author":"joshw220","body":"I saved this so I too can comment. I received a copy of The Amazing Selling Machine for free (To take a look and review my opinion for an outside person.) It is that one Guru company that wants you to pay 4K for their program. First off the program was bad news. They gave a lot of good info but people didn't understand their demos and examples they were showing. So all the sheep people ordered the same product and now you have 60,000 private label garlic presses and soup spoons. In the ASM course they demo kitchen utensils as an example of how amazon works and most people didn't understand it was just an example and they all ordered the same thing. Very comical. Second they have you move through phases with homework assignments between, and you have to finish the homework assignments before moving on to the next phase and getting the badge. The homework assignments include spamming your product on twitter, youtube and facebook. Also spamming their products and other ASM products on social media. They are sly about it, but they want you to find the most busy videos of the day and leave a comment trying to get people to go to your channel where you will have your product and amazon store front in big bright letters. Then when you are done spamming about 20-30 social media venues then you can go on the the next 5 minute video and repeat the deal all over again. They have you violate many amazons policies such as buying reviews, having friends and family review, how to cheat the system using keywords to get the bad reviews removed. There is a reason you see on the amazon forums recently about people losing massive amount of reviews over night. People are manipulating them. Now my story is I have been selling on amazon for the past two years and do pretty good. I did go from a full time position to a part time position and just said I went back to school. If I lost my job tomorrow I make enough to survive on amazon and eBay, but the best thing that was said about both of these platforms is that you are building a house on rented land. They can pull the rug out from you any time for any reason. Now did I learn anything from the ASM course? Yes! BUT! Not a lot, I learned about how to set up a free google adword account and learned about a few other websites like merchant words and learned about freelance websites and what ones to use. I also learned about ad campaigns and how they work. Everything else I already knew and learned for free. I could of even added a few tips to the course. The things I learned also were free on reddit and youtube, but was stuff I didn't even know about so that's how I learned it. The course was not worth 4K at all. \n\nAn online business is really the 1% rule. 40% of people cant do it because they have bad banking, bone crushing debt, IRS debt, no money at all for even demo product, 30% will discover online marketing but not actually take action, Another 10% will be debie downers and think it is fake and to keep working for the man, another 15-20% will not last as they will be suspended or banned because they do not understand the rules, sell counterfeits, not accept returns, do not know how to ship, many will quite, get sick, go back to work. I have read it all. \n\nA handful of these Gurus are good, I have heard good things about Jim and his Silent Sales Machine group, but most are extremely bad and will end up getting you in trouble online and then when you tell them about your situation all of a suddenly they are not available or claim you didn't fallow them and it was your fault. Also the problem is that when these gurus show up they lay down videos so you have hundreds to thousands of people watching the same video and now that market is flooded. They will do things like give you secrets of 10 fast moving selling items, now you have 6000 people all selling the same thing because all of them watched the same video. I have my own way of finding products and sourcing and it is not for sale or on some youtube channel or video series. Also FYI most of the Gurus out there are people that use to sell on Amazon and are banned and don't want to go back to the work place so they sell the dream. It doesn't matter what secrets or information they share because they are not selling anymore anyways. If you ask most of them to show their last deposit with their name on it most of them cant. A lot of good guy gurus believe their is enough room for everyone and are really just trying to help the single mom with the job at walmart be successful and believe in the 1% rule so the secrets they sell are not secrets because most of the people will not take action. \n\nYou have to be careful because I read about a girl had a group called shop your way to wealth where she would do hotel seminars all over the country and got a lot of people banned with her method and was sued by many people. I do not know the name but she was well known for starting pyramid schemes and property ownership schemes. Also a facebook group I was a part of the guy that ran the group and was the admin did private consults for $100.00 over skype for an hour and in a comments one day he had accidentally slipped that he was banned a few months ago. A lot of people had left the group. He is not back on with a \"partner\" and things are good. He found a noob to buy and used the persons information and they split the profits.

{"id":"d0ecf6x","author":"drunkmall","body":"Hi there.\n\nI think you're on to something with the presentation of the site and I have a few ideas you can use or discard as you see fit.\n\nWithout knowing the functionality of the site, the landing page is a little weird. The \"Get Started\" button specifically. Since you're using a landing page instead of taking me (the user) directly to the experience of the site, the landing page needs to give me more information as to what would happen if I do choose to get started. \"Get started with what?\" is the question your landing page makes me ask, when it should be the answer to that question.\n\nSince you are now my competition, I have more of a reason to \"get started\" than the average browser, so I did click the button. Right away, this reminds me of old websites like Hot or Not (and younger people today would say it reminds them of Tinder), which is a good thing because sites like that used to be huge and there's no reason they can't work today. If I were you, I would move even further in that direction by making a few changes to the design/functionality of the site.\n\nWhere you have the \"I'm an idiot\" button to take me to Amazon (which I probably won't click because almost nobody really likes to think of themselves as an idiot), you should have two buttons in that space. Move your \"another one\" footer into the same container. That's now your version of Tinder's left swipe. \n\nNow, you could do a couple different things with your \"right swipe\" button...\n\nYou could leave the functionality the same and have it open the amazon link in a new tab...\n\nOr, and this is what I would do, you could have right swipes add the product to my wishlist on your site. This will keep people on the site longer, as they have fun on their treasure hunt. You could have the site function in \"sessions,\" say, 30 products to a deck of slides. Then at the end of each session users can review their \"matches,\" again, like Tinder. This also gives you a reason to ask for my email address to make an account with you. Depending on how successful this becomes (or how good you are at programming), you could conceivably invest time in a solution for personalizing suggested products based on a user's matches.\n\nIn summation, what you've built is more like a web app than a website and I think you should go even further in that direction, especially if you can integrate an actual swipe gesture into the site on mobile devices. (No idea if this is possible. Not my field.)","name":"t1_d0ecf6x","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-26 08:06:32","week":8}

They are suffering from decades of collecting profits and ignoring a constantly evolving marketplace.  It's called the innovator's dilemma, do I monetize the strength of my position? Or do I continue to innovate (i.e.invest) to keep pace with my competitive set and the market.  Unless innovation is woven into the fabric of your culture it's in the best interest to the founders of said business to monetize.  As a result, you're eventually going to decline.  Its the natural order of a capital market.  And if you dont switch modes (from monetizer back to innovator) quickly enough? You're done.  It's too late for JC Penney, and too late for Sears....pretty soon will even be too late for Wal-Mart.\n\nAnd, this is pure rhetoric from Eddie Lampert.

Nothing is more frustrating than entering a niche that is so packed full of heavy hitters that it takes you years to rank and is not worth the time to someone just starting. In my opinion it is much better to go after smaller niches and get a taste of the money and how things work before you tackle bigger projects.\n\nAlong with that, you want to make sure the niche is not seasonal. You can do that will Google trends.\n\nThen you want to make sure the niche has buyers intent. Like I posted in another comment, would you rather have a site about dog tricks for women over 50, or a site about the best dish scrubbers for grease? One of them people are literally ready to toss cash at you to fix their problem, while the other one does not want to buy anything.\n\nI also take a good hard look at the other websites i will be competing against. Are they big or are they small? Are there loads of sites ranking or targeted to my niche. The more players in my niche, the more money generally but also the more competition you will have.\n\nLook at the link profile of these sites that are ranking. Are they backed up with spam or legit links? Look at the individual links. Are there any PBN posts? these are a bitch to outrank manually but can still be done through outreach. I usually look at the referring domains. The less the better. \n\nAre there a bunch of ecom sites ranking like Amazon? Harder to beat, but still not bad. Is the top page wiki? Well, harder to beat but not impossible. If Wiki is ranking, is it a buyers intent keyword? Maybe not! If other niche sites are ranking, you can probably bet there is some money there so take a harder look at that site.\n\nHow much content will you need to fully flush out your niche? 10 articles, 20 articles, 3000 articles? Articles cost money or time. Are you willing to put either of those in to compete?\n\nOther than all the little details, you will mostly learn what you should or should not do by just starting and figuring out these things as you go.

I would charge you a delivery fee and I wouldn't set a minimum order purchase. Also you'll be able to tip the driver. Even if you weren't in my target market I would still love to hear your feedback.  \n\n\nAlright I have a few comments/recommendations:\n\n**1) You need to make your service easily-accessible and easy-to-use.**\n\nThere are a few services in various large cities that do the same thing, but the #1 thing they fail at is not offering a *functional* website, or app for a cash-less transaction. They literally want you to call them on the phone, and pay cash when the driver shows up.\n\nIf I want to order something from them, I have to physically hand cash to a delivery driver, then get all squeamish when it comes to the tip thinking *'shit, how much should I tip this guy for walking into a gas station to get me a coke? fuck, ok, ill just give him the whole $20 so it's not weird...'*  \n\nUber was awesome because people didn't have to tip (Yes, I know passengers are \"free\" to tip, but before Uber started fucking their drivers out of pay, everyone was happy with the no-tip option), and you don't need cash or a credit card on-hand to use their service.  \n\nI think you should take a similar approach, and build a web or phone app that lets people order from a select few stores, on the go.  \n\n**2) You may want to choose your city &amp; audience wisely.**  \n\nThere are a few services out there that will allow you to order goods from an app (PM for an example), and the most successful ones are in, pardon my french, hipster-ass towns. Think: Towns filled with tons of little boutiques, creative studios, and stores all clustered in up-and-coming neighborhoods.  \n\nThe people that live in those places are willing to pay for a service that delivers from their favorite local stores, but may not be as inclined to order a USB cable from best buy with the same enthusiasm.  \n\n**Enthusiastic customers + an easy-to-use product = a profitable idea.**  \n\nThe catch here is **not** including Best Buy in your marketing.  \n\nAgain, if you got his route, your customers aren't bed-ridden elders - they're people that probably could Uber to their favorite store, but want the *luxury* of getting their trinkets or shirts or donuts delivered fresh to their home.  \n\nYou can be a luxury/leisure brand, or a value brand, but as we've seen already Google and Amazon are the biggest players in value at the moment.\n\n","name":"t1_d0ezput","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-26 21:16:05","week":8}

He's a power guy and he likes to assert his power. I mean, you remember the fight he got into with Cuban a few years ago? Cuban isn't an idiot, or poor either and some might argue a great businessman as well - but shots were fired and they went to battle. \n\nBezos buying the Post to push his agenda (in Trump's mind) is why this is an issue.\n\nNow, on to the subject. \n\nFirst off, please read [The Art Of The Deal](http://www.amazon.com/Trump-The-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0345479173) before saying he isn't brilliant, because as much of a hothead as he can be, the one thing he can do better than nearly anyone is make a deal - and in business, that's the hardest part. \n\nOn to Bezos. No doubt a very smart person, and it's unfair to pick on or compare his business acumen, but one thing is certain - he still started Amazon with $1m in funding. No different than the $1m loan Donald had from his father.\n\nIt's true, Trump inherited $500m, but that isn't how he got his start and I'm not going to say Bezos is a fraud because he raised hundreds of millions either - they're both very, very good businessmen that utilized every resource available to fulfill their vision.\n\nI'm not taking sides here. Trump, Cuban, Bezos, all of them have made their mark in the billion-dollar range and rightly so.

Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have ALL sold out completely to the government.  Apple seems to be standing up to the government, which is awesome, but here's what I would do if I were you Marissa!\n\n-----\n\n**Release a SUITE of applications that are private, end-to-end encrypted.**  Make it your corporate policy that you will 100% NEVER give the government your customers' private data.

NSA, you want my consumer's private conversations?  Sorry, I don't have it.  Smaller and lesser-known companies are doing this ([Signal](https://whispersystems.org/), protonmail, etc), but they don't have the name recognition that you do.

It's a sexy thin, beautifully aesthetic handheld device that does what kids do 90% of the time on their phones anyway:  PLAY MUSIC AND APPS.  Have it run Android.  Give it a kickass battery and screen. Why *NOT* have a microphone and a GPS?  Because the NSA will get that data from the carriers.  You will still partner with carriers and offer a version with multiple carriers, but you will also offer a wifi-only device (like Kindle Fire devices).\n\nNumber 3 could be a search engine.  DuckDuckGo does it.\n\nHow can you do these things?  Fucking CHARGE MONEY for them instead of them being free-and-ad-supported-and-we-sell-all-your-shit-to-the-government-based.\n\nResurrect yourself, Yahoo.  PLEASE.

{"id":"d0g3bi9","author":"TV_News-Watch","body":"Hi Ovman and the Reddit Community,\n\nWe just came across this post and wanted to let you all know some information about News Watch as it seems there is false information out there.  We understand there are many fake/scammy companies and we want the Reddit community to understand that we certainly are not one of them.  \n\nTo start, we are a legitimate business registered in the state of Virginia, USA. We have been around for over 29 years, are family run, and pride ourselves on the work we do.  In fact, I am one of the co-owners of the company and a family member as well.  We work with companies large and small, from [Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/06/13/intel-tablets-showcased-on-the-history-and-bio-channel-feature-newswatch), [Audi](http://newswatchtv.tumblr.com/post/138988652330/e-tron-quattro-concept), Sony, and [Siemens](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/02/prweb12517927.htm), all the way down to large app developers like [Ruzzle](https://vimeo.com/85178044), Marvel, Random House, and down to small independent developers like [TaxiFare Finder](http://www.taxifarefinder.com/newsroom/2015/12/10/discovery-channel-to-feature-taxifarefinder/), [inFit](https://vimeo.com/147900228) and many others.  Just to give you an idea of our quality of work, here is SteelSeries, a worldwide headphone company, [talking about how much they enjoyed their experience with us](https://vimeo.com/91308716).  \n\nWhat we do is we help these companies market and advertise their product on television, as well as online through social media and online distribution sites.  We have a strong following online and have partnerships with other major news sites through syndication companies where our content is displayed on the likes of [CNN](http://i.imgur.com/ZEWIvmk.jpg?1), TechCrunch, Wired, The Guardian, etc. \n\nThe most important thing we want to stress is we are not a fraudulent company.  In fact, we are far from that. When speaking with a company we always let it be known when there are costs to the production and airing of segments and we always outline exactly what the costs are.  To further ensure there isn’t any confusion, the members of our outreach team have the title “Sales” in their signature.  \n\nAs a bit of background, in Television and online media there are many different ways companies can advertise.  There are direct ads (i.e. Superbowl ads) and indirect ads (i.e. product placement).  The ads on our show fall into the indirect ads category.  Our show is made up of editorial content (like our review of the Occulus Rift, our story on the [BB-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhOi990u5ds), and many other examples) with indirect advertisements mixed in as we don’t do any direct ads (like what you see on the superbowl) in our show.  \n\nThere are many forms of indirect advertisements out there.  For example, Product placement – think of this when you see a show and everyone is [drinking Coca-Cola with the label shown outwards](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01484/idol0_1484050c.jpg). Or on The Bachelor when they go behind the counter at McDonalds and have the McDonalds logo in the background.  There is also the indirect advertising where a company is being reviewed or interviewed, and they paid for that spot.  That is similar to the indirect advertisements on our show. Examples of this would be when a show is interviewing someone about their new book, or talking to a Tech Expert during the holidays who has their “must buy” products displayed in front of them (the industry calls this a tabletop presentation).\n\nAdvertising has been a part of television since its origins, and we are a part of that world as well.  We have a working relationship with the Discovery Channel, the ION Network, the History Channel, and over 65 broadcast news stations across the United States that air our content. We are also in talks with Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix about joining their sites and are excited about the possibility of that as well. \n\nIn short, we just want the Reddit community (a community we are a part of as regular social media users) to know that we are a small family run business that helps companies both large and small get exposure through advertising on television. Our customers think we have a great product and many companies work with us multiple times each year.  We are proud of what we do and hope the community understand that too.  \n\nWe also recommend you check out our website to see all the hard work we put into technology stories and reviews that are pure editorial. Once you read our content and see the breadth of our coverage, we hope you’ll further understand our function as a content creator and advertising platform.  \n\nIf you have any questions you can PM us directly or feel free to email us.  I promise, we will respond quickly.\n\n**Tl:DR** – We are a family run business who helps companies advertise and market on TV, just the same as product placement in shows like \"The Bachelor\" and tech interviews of products on large networks like ABC, CNN etc.  We have been around for 29 years, have worked with companies big and small like Siemens and Ruzzle, and provide a service for companies to help market/advertise themselves across multiple mediums, both online and TV.  We understand there are many fake/scammy companies out there and we want the Reddit community to understand that we are certainly not one of them.

{"id":"d0g3hvc","author":"PorridgeWashington","body":"Ah, that all makes sense. I would like to reiterate that your portfolio and general strategy seems fine. Once you add international markets and bond, in my opinion you will probably do better than a majority of the people who visit this sub and are all in on TSLA, AMZN, gold, Bitcoin, etc. Personally, I think that your whole portfolio should not all be up for an extended period of time, because that means a slight change could occur and it could all be down for even longer. That's where the inverse correlation with bonds come in. They tend to go up when your IVV goes down, and you can then use them to buy more IVV (or retire). \n\n&gt;Any advice on how to select a bond?\n\nAnd here is where you have ventured into an area where I am no longer confident on offering my opinion. It has been [discussed on this forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2qod8e/the_relationship_between_government_bonds_and/?) that present bond value is mostly dependent on flight to safety vs flight from safety behavior as opposed to perceived/actual federal reserve rate increases. Where we are in either of those cycles and where we are going is not something that I have any idea about right now (but I am actively trying to research and understand). \n\nI do know, however, that the general goal of the bond allocation diversity that I am referring to is to balance your portfolio for times of downturn/bear markets (some say we are heading into this now, some say we are not) by picking bonds that are not highly correlated with the rest of your portfolio. Corporate bonds generally would not accomplish this, but US government bonds generally do.\n\nI was actually considering posting a thread on here for Monday to further discuss an update to that bond post I linked to, it really has a lot of beginner info on bond investment. \n\nEdit: formatting","name":"t1_d0g3hvc","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2016-02-27 21:10:22","week":8}

Amazon killer it ain't, but their going to hold on to the other half of the majority of the business cloud, so that's a solid place to be.\n\nGiven the option between 3d and augmented reality platforms, the holo lens beats the shit out of the oculus and if they can deliver on that I can see one going in to most homes in 1st world countries, parties with people wearing them and playing games developed on the platform, etc etc.\n\nOffice cloud is GREAT and affordable for the average person now, and it's been the backbone of corporate entities for years and years. The improvements keep on coming, and MS's focus on bringing everything under one umbrella Microsoft account is extremely enticing in a world where you have to remember 50 passwords for 50 different sites that you use on the daily.\n\nSurface books are sexy as hell, and definitely compete with the Macbooks. Needs another 1 or 2 generations but then it will be a solid platform. If nothing else it was an awesome gamble that's raising the bar for laptops manufacturers in the retail space, which means more vamping apple users. Meanwhile for the tablet marketplace they do fairly well with the surface line.\n\nWindows 10 is damn good, no complaints there minus the privacy concerns, but people are just going to get over it eventually anyway. Google knows more about you from your maps history, phone records and google searches anyway, so the privacy issue is overblown imo (again, being deeply entrenched in MS technology).\n\nThere's huge institutional reliance on their products, and they've decided that resting on their laurels is bullshit and have decided to start pushing the sector forward with alternatives.

{"id":"d0g9mzl","author":"yo1k2tog","body":"Step 1 - Determine how many lines you need.\n\nStep 2 - Look at your actual usage.  minutes, texts, data for EACH line and total.\n\nStep 3 - Determine by where you live and work what the coverage is in your area.  (it does you no go to be on a low cost carrier that isn't in your area)\n\nStep 4 - Determine whether you are going to be buying a new phone(s).\n\nAfter doing step 2 - determine how much data you really need.  For a week or so, shut off mobile data and turn on WiFi at home and where available.  Change your settings to update and push changes on WiFi only.  (Facebook is a notorious culprit for eating data in the background, as is most mapping software. You can do things like download your directions on WiFi so that it's not eating data)  You are probably under a WiFi cloud 70-80% of the time anyway.\n\nSo, let's assume you are a very low use users.  In that case go to Ting and punch in your numbers and see what your bill is.  Ting has two sides, GSM and CDMA.  Most GSM phones will work on the GSM side with no problem, so you may be able to move a phone easily.  The CDMA side is iffier at to what phones work, you can use their checker to see if your phone will work.  However, since your phone is glitchy and you will be looking to buy, check out their list of phones for sale and the phone markets (glyde, swappa, Amazon, etc).  I have two CDMA phones on Ting, a Desire 510 and a One M7.  I am a light user and pay $35/month-ish for 2 phones. You do NOT have to get a top of the line phone.  Anyway, if you go with ting, stop by /r/ting or PM one of the people here who say they have it and they'll be happy to pm you back a $25 off linkie.\n\nWait, let me reemphasize - YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GET A TOP OF THE LINE PHONE.  Just get a good one that works with whatever service you are going to!  \n\nLet's say you are a medium-ish user and ATT is good in your area.  Cricket - two lines with Autopay, pick the level of service good for each phone.  Currently running a $50 credit, and two phones with 5GB usage (the Smart plan) each will run you $90/month; two phones with 2.5GB usage each (the Basic plan) will run you $70/month.  \n\nProject Fi - if you are under a WiFi cloud most of your life, It's $20/month per phone, plus data.  Let's say you pay for 2 GB/data per month at $20/phone.  But you only use .5GB on each phone.  Well, they prorate that $20, so you are at $50/month for two phones.   Truthfully, it's a better deal for one phone than multiple phones, since they only offer an individual plan.  So, basically, you are looking at $40/phone/month for 2GB.  Again, turn off your data!\n\nLet's say you are my nephew, and eat data like it's a potato chip buffet.  In that case, Sprint's unlimited plan may be right for you.\n\nIn fact, Sprint may be right for you due to their promotion on halving Verizon's fees.  However, be aware that they will try to lock you into buying a top of the line new phone on installment.  Particularly if you try to do this on line, you will not be happy after everything adds back up to more than you wanted.  They currently also have offers for a free Galaxy S6 or a $200 trade for you old phone, etc etc.  Sometimes these deals stack, sometimes not.  They WILL try to upsell you.\n\nNet10 and Straight Talk.  Both have versions for every major network, just pick the one that works for your area.  Unlimited talk and text with .5GB of data will run you $32/phone on autopay, and you actually GET data after that, just throttled.\n\nT-Mo - the best deal going if you talk very little but text and use a lot of data - $30/month of 100 minutes + 5gb data then throttled and unlimited text.  Talk, text and NO data? $25/month.\n\nVerizon true-believer?  I still have a line on Verizon.  It's because I get an affiliation discount and the kid using it uses a lot of data and is in an ATT dead zone.  I pay $52/month including taxes for that phone on the medium plan.  Check to see if you have any affiliations (university,employer, clubs, unions, whatever)  If you can both live with the small plan and have an affiliation that gets you 20% off, I can see this running $50/month for two.  Just shift to that and buy a new phone (do NOT put it on payments or sign a new contract!!)

Now I can print the UPS label.\n\nI'm only shipping 75-250 items at a time to Amazon so far so perhaps if I were sending 1000 at a time it would feel less burdensome.  \n\nNow with multi-channel FBA, maybe they keep things separate from the stuff sold on Amazon and maybe there are less hoops to jump through.  If so, I'd probably recommend FBA over renting a warehouse.  Check the math though.  Amazon does have amazing shipping discounts for the 1lb+ items.

You make a great product that solves a problem for a certain segment of people, and sell it through a variety of channels to reach that segment of people.\n\nAmazon is the low-hanging fruit for your new product, and you should 100% launch it on there because there's so much traffic.\n\nThen it's fairly easy to set up your own eCommerce site, so do that too.\n\nThen you can list it pretty simply on other marketplaces like Ebay, Etsy, etc.\n\nAfter that you can sell it wholesale to some local stores to put on their shelves.\n\nThen you could contact a regional distributor and show them the kinds of margins you can offer them, and your existing sales history from the local stores and the reviews from Amazon.\n\nThen you share booth space with them at trade shows and grow your customer base of retailers and consumers.\n\nThroughout all this you're launching more products and growing your brand through in-person, print, and digital marketing.\n\nOnce you approach it like a \"product\" business instead of an FBA business, a lot of different opportunities open up. \n\nBut keep in mind it starts with a great product. The longer you develop it, the more barriers there are to development (capital requirements, patents, custom molds, hard-to-find materials, multiple manufacturers, technology component, licenses needed, etc) the less commoditized your product will be in comparison to your competition and typically you'll be able to charge more and enjoy healthier margins.","name":"t1_d0gu9im","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2016-02-28 14:32:45","week":8}

{"id":"d0h14d8","author":"ysosriusthefirst","body":"I moved to the US recently, so looking for a job is limited to minimum wage. I have a background in initating business and sniffing money on goods as well as exporting sports nutrition back home. I built somewhat of an ok credit, then went overkill applying for multiple credit cards around the same time. 6 out of 8 cards went through. Screw the credit score for now as I got the cards. \n\nI purchase surplus inventory, liquidations, collector editions; I hawk craigslist/classifieds listings and snipe the bargains. I start selling on eBay. I make sure to DETAIL THE EXACT ITEM CONDITION when posting. Actual photos--touch 'em up for appeal with a slashed down list price--are more desirable than stock photos. Sales pick up. It takes time as I need to test mostly every used/return item for proper description. Broken items/missing components are fixed with handiwork or purchase of said missing components. I customized a small area constantly being updated with more tools and utilities as need arises. I would say to start seeing good profits:\n\n• 3 hrs a day browsing for the latest deals, trends, forums, etc. even if you are not making purchases. Read and learn to mix up your sales system. You do not have to stick to used. You can flip new items. You can find hotsellers and buy in bulk and automate them. Dropshipping is still vague to me and I am more handson atm. Bookmarking and backing up all your built information is your friend.\n\n• 3 hrs testing products and taking photos. Products that need fixing are put in a separate section and a list detailing what each item needs is kept.\n\n• 3 hrs listing goods. I usually average 5-10 min for each listing. I would say I average 20 listings in 6 hrs--the aforementioned 3 hrs go into this as well.\n\n• 2 hrs printing labels, packing sales, upkeeping packaging products, dropping off packages.\n\n• 1 hr for classified pickups if available.\n\n10-15 mins here and there on other facets are required as well.\n\nThere is a family to spend time with.\n\nIt starts paying off eventually. This is my first year filing taxes and I messed up not having a proper tax system. I might go with estimates this year before moving on to a fullfledged automated accounting system.\n\nSo to answer your question, it all depends on your drive and knowledge. You have to learn. You have to get down and dirty with your purchased goods. You have to have your eyes everwhere on the internet. Sometimes you will feel it's too much to handle. Eventually, you will start getting the hang of it. It will start getting easier. And when it does, you go and make it harder. Discover and start indulging in new flip endeavors. Pick up the ropes while you still have your job. Once you get the hang of it, ditch the job and take making money into your own hands. I do have to say I utilize nootropics and brain enhancers as well. You always need to be one step ahead of yourself. You cannot snooze or get tired. You can make it. \n\nAn extra tip as well for your eBay sales - purchase your menial needs off eBay and not Amazon. If you want multiples from the same item, purchase from different sellers. I wanted charging cables for my 3DS. I bought 3 from 3 different sellers. Three positive feedbacks that get accounted for. It all adds up.\n\nYou will end up with nice things as well, especially when purchasing mixed lots. For example, I would have never purchased/owned a $500 Roomba. I purchased a lot once with two roombas two lynx hoovers and 20+ other items for around $900. The $300 roomba was in a great condition so I sold it. The $500 had a battery and sensor problem. I purchased a new battery from China and fixed the sensors, and now I have a cool Roomba. My wife can choose whatever she wants. I give my baby stuff. I give my pet stuff. I gift my parents and loved ones stuff. When it comes to it at the end of the day, you will never get this feeling from any stable desk job. Not that I could have gotten a decent one. With knowledge and some credit, I proved myself. I believe anyone with the proper mindset and good intentions can as well.\n\nA fellow redittor mentioned the hardship of having a newborn baby alongside this. I attest to that. We had a collicky baby that kept me up all night. My wife had to go to work early as she only got one month paid and we need someone to pay the bills rent car loan etc.--I could either just get by and pay those or invest what I had and repay my wife for her support later. I ended up having to care for the baby 12 AM till 6 PM every day. She would sleep a broken sum of 4-5 hrs in which I RUN to do some work. You are nowhere near the comfort zone. Those were the times when I felt like giving up most. But you can't. And you won't.

{"id":"d0h27vs","author":"echo-engee","body":"Generally a bad idea to cancel a card if there's no annual fee.  This is because a large factor in your credit score is the average age of your accounts.  If you cancel an account in one month, that account will sit on your history as a one month long account until it falls off your report years from now.  \n\nIf your card is sitting around and you're not using it, you're not losing anything, but your average account age is going up, which will help your score in the long run.  I haven't used my first card in a long time, but it has no fee, and I wouldn't think about canceling it, since it's buoying the average age of my accounts.\n\nAdditionally, having a larger available credit limit is good for your credit utilization ratio (% of available credit used), which is a significant part of your score.  If you put $500 on a credit card with $1000 total available, that's 50%, but if you put $500 on a card and you have $4000 available, that's 12.5%.  If you cancel the card, you lose some available credit.\n\nAll that said, maybe consider a different card with a better signup bonus.  $50 credit for Amazon is pretty meager, and you can easily find no fee cards with better benefits.","name":"t1_d0h27vs","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-28 19:00:01","week":8}

I will definitely look into maxing out my $18k TSP limit by the end of the year.\n\n I was definitely thinking of contributing to an IRA for both 2015 and 2016. I haven't filed my taxes for 2015 yet, so that isn't a concern.\n\nAs far as the rest of my money... I'm currently reading Boglehead's Guide to Investing and related online resources, and my takeaway so far can be summed up in this statement from an Amazon book review: \"Go to Vanguard, pick your retirement date, buy a \"Target Retirement\" fund for that date, and you're done\".

{"id":"d0h9n0d","author":"Alex-Gopson","body":"Everyone will tell you the same thing--sell a few items you already have lying around the house.  This is just to get a feel for selling, whether it be on Ebay/Amazon/Craigslist.  After that I'd recommend trying your hand at some thrifting.  It's a lot harder to lose money when you are only spending $3-7 per item at most Goodwills. \n\n---\n\n&gt; What percentage of profit should I focus on?\n\nDon't focus on percentage of profit at all.  All of these \"rules\" you see people tell you are irrelevant.  If something is a good profit margin to you, it's a good profit margin to you.  Some people will tell you they only buy items they can triple their money on.  Some people will tell you they only buy items with a 100% ROI.\n\nAll of these \"rules\" have so many caveats and footnotes attached to them that they aren't worth focusing on at all.  Think about what you value your time at, and go from there.  If you make $40/hour, then selling a $3 shirt for $20 might seem like a lot of work for the payoff.  If you make $8/hour at a shitty min. wage job, then 2 hours pay for selling a used shirt may seem awesome.  It's completely different depending on your financial situation.","name":"t1_d0h9n0d","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2016-02-28 22:20:52","week":8}

{"id":"d0hb4xp","author":"alwaystacobell","body":"I don't have kids, never want kids, but I know a LOT of people who've had them in worse situations than you. I don't know shit about WIC and that jazz, because I'm not American. Tips for prepping for kids:\n\n* Look on Facebook in your area for the moms buy and sell pages. People will sell like 100 baby outfits for something ridiculous like $50. See if you can get some of that stuff sooner rather than later. When is she due? If she is due in the summer, then the baby(ies) will need winter clothing for ~6 months old. Just keep in mind the baby age for the seasons.\n* If people are selling huge lots of these clothes, and only half of it will fit, take it anyway. Resell or swap with other parents.\n* Someone is going to offer to throw a baby shower, take the offer. Register somewhere like Amazon, where people who can't make it to the shower can have stuff sent directly to you. (this goes for marriage too. i'm getting married in a month, and we have an amazon registry, so far away friends/family can send us stuff)\n* When you register, ask for bigger things. Or gift cards. Don't waste space with things like clothes (get them used) and especially not diaper shirts (you can buy a boat load of them at target or costco or kmart for SUPER cheap)\n* Brand name baby stuff isn't a big deal, OTHER THAN car seats. DO NOT buy a used car seat, it's actually illegal to do so in a lot of places.\n* Decide ASAP if you want to do cloth or disposable diapers. Cloth can be had for very inexpensively if you buy used. They're relatively easy to take care of, and only add one or two loads of laundry a week. Bonus: better for the environment. If you do cloth, look for them on the facebook groups, and add them to your registry.\n* Sign up for all the baby coupon programs you can think of. Start earning rewards on baby stuff (and everything else) now, and redeem it later. My fav is Ibotta [ref link](https://ibotta.com/r/idhsyrm) You get money back for just about anything. I'm super close to my first cash out.\n* Turn your date nights into stay home nights. It sucks, but that money can be put directly into the baby fund.\n* It will probably be more economical for one of you to stay home with the kids. Normally this is the mom, but this depends on where you both are in your careers. If she stays home, it's going to be WAY easier for her to breastfeed.\n* Try to breastfeed if you can. If it isn't possible, don't feel guilty. But it's WAY less expensive than formula, baby poop isn't quite as nasty, and it's better for the mom.\n\nI can't think of anything else off the top of my head, but please keep me updated on the situation.","name":"t1_d0hb4xp","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2016-02-28 23:01:16","week":8}
