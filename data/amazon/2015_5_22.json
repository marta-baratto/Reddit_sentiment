{"id":"37a3oz","author":"warner62","body":"As the title says, I plan on buying a new vehicle soon. I make 81k a year (straight salary, no bonuses or anything) and besides a past car loan (an order of magnitude less than I am trying to finance now, 3.5k then, 22ish k now and also paid off early) and a student loan (paid off very early) I have no credit history besides years of good payment on utility bills (worthless, I know). My question is, this, I intend to buy a car fairly soon (down payment will be cashout of vacation and sick time from previous job plus trade-in and maybe another 1k). Anyway, as I do not have a credit card, and it is past due for me to get one, I would like to go ahead and do that soon as well. I have at least one international and several domestic trips coming up in my intermediate future and want to be better prepared. I have always lived within my means and had a credit union that took great care of me, so I never felt the need for a credit card. I also didn't fully understand them well enough and didn't want to commit the time to learning how to properly use them so I just never bothered with it.\n\nAnyway, in my research it seems that one of the drivers of credit score is credit check history. Obviously, since I will be getting a new vehicle soon (lease or buy), they will check my credit. I was hoping to get this card sometime this summer (maybe the Barclay's SallieMae or Amazon) as well. Will having my credit checked for the car loan (I will probably go through my credit union, they have great rates and my parents were charter members) have a bigger impact or potentially hurt me for a tougher to acquire card like the SallieMae?\n\nI'm not really looking for advice on the best way to get the vehicle itself yet. I need to talk to the dealer about what my actual options are and I will do the math myself, I'm mostly just curious about how it will affect my credit score and ability to get a decent credit card in the near future.","name":"t3_37a3oz","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-26 04:36:23","week":22}

{"id":"37bf4l","author":"BeatDaBest","body":"Hey guys!   \nI know that Amazon Affiliate sites aren't always considered beermoney, but people in this sub have been interested in this before, and if creating websites or writing is something you enjoy doing then this is a viable option of making some extra cash online.\n\nP.S.- This will be me sharing my experiences with Amazon so far. I am by no means a *guru*, and I still have a **ton** to learn. However I wanted to show you that you don't have to be an expert to make money.\n\nP.P.S.- Amazon does not accept affiliates from Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, Rhode Island, or Vermont. \n\nP.P.P.S.- Amazon does accept affiliates from other countries into it's Amazon.com program, but it also has country specific programs such as amazon.uk and others. In some cases it's more profitable to create an Amazon Affiliate site in your language rather than try to compete with numerous Amazon.com affiliates.\n___\n#My history with Amazon\nI found out about Amazon Affiliate sites almost a year ago, but I never thought about creating my own.   \n\nLast August I read a couple of long Amazon Affiliate journeys on BHW and that spurred my interest in creating a website *even though it wasn't Amazon Affiliate focused at first.*   \n\nThen last December I stumbled upon another Amazon Affiliate thread, and I decided that this was something I was interested in doing myself.   \n\nMy first site is the one that I talk about in [my blog post](http://www.onlinemoneyz.com/blog/my-first-amazon-affiliate-site-attempt-2015) which is what this post is based on.   \n\nAfter seeing that I enjoy the process of creating the sites and writing content for them I created 2 more sites, and I have ideas for numerous other ones which I will work on this summer.\n\n2 of my sites are still in the baby stages so I haven't made a lot from them, but I've made a total of around $50 from this site even though my timing for creating it was absolutely horrible. *(More on this later)*\n___\n#What you should know before starting\n* This takes a lot of work and you will not see the reward for at least 2 months. *(If not more)*\n* It is possible that your site will not earn you any money at all. *(I haven't had this happen to me yet as even my \"baby\" sites had at least one sale on them.)\n* This is more of a long-term strategy where you invest a lot of time now and reap the rewards later. *(With investing an hour or so every month checking your site and adding a new post)*\n* You have to **do keyword research!** *(You will not succeed otherwise)*\n* If you don't enjoy any of the aspects of creating a website or writing content for it, don't do this. It's not worth it.\n* Wordpress is better than Blogger especially if you plan on making your site fairly big. *(Blogger is still usable, but WordPress.org trumps it in almost every way)*\n\n____\n#Starting out\nI bought my domain from GoDaddy for $4, *(With privacy protection)*, and I hosted my website on Blogger which in hindsight was the wrong decision as my second blog was hosted on Wordpress and it is so much better...\n\nI used Market Samurai for keyword research and they have a 7 day free trial.

Ex: \"Best track spikes for the 400 meter dash\", \"most reliable desk lamp under 50 dollars\", etc... They will not have a high number of searches per month, but they're very valuable.*\n* Use buyer oriented keywords. *If a person searches \"track spikes\" or \"track\" they might not be looking to buy anything, but if a person searches for a specific item or uses search terms like \"best track spikes under $50\", \"cheapest hard drive to buy today\", \"cheap replacement for blahblahblah product\" etc...*\n\n____\n###SEO and site creation\nYou can purchase a 99 cent domain from GoDaddy and NameCheap has deals from time to time also, and I decided not to go through the basics of setting up a website and connecting a domain in either of my posts, but if this is something people are interested in I could make a couple of tutorials for Blogger/Wordpress.org. *Or just use Google!*\n\nIf you did proper keyword research it shouldn't be too hard to rank for your keywords, but here are some SEO basics:\n\n* Make sure that your content is actually good!\n* Use custom permalinks (if on Blogger) and SEO plugins (if on Wordpress)\n* Create custom search descriptions to draw people in.\n* Use Categories, Labels, or Tags to make sorting through your content easier for you and your visitors.\n* Use your keyword in the title (if it makes sense), and use phrases/words related to your keyword in your writing.\n* Add your website to Google Webmasters Tools\n* Create a Facebook/Google Plus page and post on it every time a new post/page goes up on your site.\n* Later on you can create a couple of Web 2.0s or comment on niche related blogs for backlinks, but my sites ranked without me doing that. *(I'll probably do it this summer to push my rankings into the top 3 though.)*\n* **Think long term** and not short term! Even if the money doesn't come in right away, don't mess it all up by buying links from Fiverr or other sites.\n* To go along with the previous point. **DO NOT BUY LINKS!**\n* Use tracking software to track your rankings in the serps. You don't have to pay as there are plenty of free websites out there that do it for you.\n\n____\n###My results\nI've made around $50 from this site which might not seem like a lot for the amount of time I put into the website. (12-16 hours) It comes out to $3.125-$4.16 an hour, but the website will earn more and more as time goes on, and I will need to do less and less work with it.\n\nHowever, I knew that peak time for sales would be in March and April and I created my site only a month before that so it didn't have enough time to sit and rank higher in Google.\n\nI'm sure if I created this site at least a month earlier I would've gotten way more sales.\n\nEither way, the things I learned from creating this site are the biggest positive, and I'm confident that I can make $100+ per month during the next March, April, and May. *(If Blogger doesn't delete my site that is.)*\n\n____\n###FAQ and other info\n\n&gt; Should I use Blogger or Wordpress to create my site?\n\n* Definitely WordPress if you have the money for hosting. Blogger isn't a terrible free way to start though, so if you can only spare 99 cents for a domain, Blogger is the better option!\n\n&gt; Can I become an affiliate if I don't live in the US?\n\n* You can become an Amazon.com affiliate no matter where you live, unless you live in one of the banned states. (Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, Rhode Island, Vermont) You can also join their affiliate program that's specific to your country as there is usually less competition and it would be easier to rank!\n\n&gt; Is there anything I must do that shows that I'm an affiliate?\n\n* You must put this in the footer of your site or your privacy policy: “[Insert your name] is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to [insert the applicable site name (amazon.com, amazonsupply.com, or myhabit.com)].”\n\n&gt; Is it hard to get into the program&gt;\n\n* For Amazon.com everyone gets accepted, and then once you get your first sale your site/information undergoes manual review. If you have a fairly high quality site that doesn't break the Amazon Affiliate TOS you should get accepted.\n\n&gt; What do you use to track your rankings?\n\n* I use ProRankTracker (trial version) for this site, but I also use serplab.co.uk (free version) for some of my other sites.\n\n&gt; What hosting provider do you use for Wordpress? \n\n* I use Bluehost. [ref](http://www.bluehost.com/track/beatdabest/AmazonFirst) [non-ref](http://www.bluehost.com/)\n\n&gt; What are evergreen niches?\n\n* They are niches that have products that sell fairly evenly throughout the year. \n\n&gt; What are seasonal niches?\n\n* They are niches that sell most of their products during a specific period. (Some products can still sell outside of the season, but the majority of your sales will be in a specific time period.)\n\n&gt; How can I find a good niche? \n\n* Think of products you might research online before buying or just go to Amazon and start browsing through the top 100 products for each category. You can also look for old sites that haven't been updated in forevr have the Amazon disclaimer in the footer and create a site in a similar niche. You might not outrank them right away, but if the products changed and their site hasn't been updated in a year or more you should be able to outrank them or at least get close to them.\n\n&gt; What if my question isn't answered?\n\n* You're out of luck! Just ask the question in the comments and if I know the answer I'll answer it, and if I don't I'll try to point you in the direction of where you might find it.\n\nThanks for reading!","name":"t3_37bf4l","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-05-26 13:39:57","week":22}

{"id":"37dob3","author":"RelativityCoffee","body":"Hi /r/Frugal. I'm a coffee roaster who lived on $17k/year during graduate school, so I know what it's like to want to save money. I saw the post on frugal iced coffee ([here's what I said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/377j7r/trying_to_save_in_coffee_making_iced_coffee_in/crknmxj)), and I thought a general guide to frugal coffee drinking might be helpful. The goal of this post is to tell you the cheapest way to drink coffee. An added bonus is that, in addition to being cheap, my suggestion will actually taste good. (And in case you're worried, I'm not going to say that buying from me is the most frugal.)\n\nI'll go through the options in order of least frugal to most frugal, so if you just want my recommendation, skip to the end.\n\n*Most expensive*: Drink coffee from coffee shops. But you already knew that.\n\n*2nd most expensive*: Keurigs or other pod coffee makers. A Keurig costs at least $100. I'm sure you can get a used one cheap, though, because people are abandoning them by the thousands. But you've still got to buy pods. Pods average 70 cents per pod, which makes 6 oz. But it's not a very good 6 oz, because it's very weak (the water temperature isn't high enough, and the coffee:water ratio is wrong). [Keurig coffee costs about $40/lb](http://time.com/money/3733586/k-cups-price-cost-comparison-coffee/). Clearly not frugal. It saves time, sure, but this isn't /r/timesavers.\n\n*3rd most expensive*: Fancy machine, fancy beans. Another option is to get a nice coffee machine, and buy coffee beans from your local roaster (like me!). This will actually be less expensive than a Keurig! [A really, really great coffee machine, like the Technivorm Moccamaster, will run you about $300, and a really good one, like the Bonavita 1900TS, will run you about $180. But coffee from your local roaster (like me!) will run you about $18/lb, which is half the price of the Keurig pods. Over a year, this option will be cheaper. And much more delicious! But it is not the most frugal. \n\n*4th most expensive*: Crappy machine, crappy beans. This is probably what most of you think is the cheapest way to drink coffee. Buy a $30 Mr Coffee machine (or better yet, $5 at a garage sale!), and then get Folgers or Maxwell House or maybe pre-ground from the bulk bins at your local grocery store. And depending on where you live, you might be right -- this might actually be the cheapest. But there is another option that's almost as cheap, if not cheaper, and it will make your coffee experience 100x more enjoyable.\n\n**MOST FRUGAL**: Roast your own beans. To do this, you need to get a $15-$20 popcorn popper, like the Presto Pop-Lite. Then you can buy unroasted beans on Amazon, at Happy Mug, on ebay, or any number of places. Unroasted beans cost about a third of what roasted beans cost. So to get that fancy coffee that your local roaster (like me!) will sell you for $18/lb unroasted will cost you about $5 or $6 per pound, and to get that crappy supermarket-grade coffee unroasted will cost you about $3 per pound. \n\nThere are plenty of guides on how to roast with a popcorn popper, like [this one](https://www.sweetmarias.com/airpop/airpopmethod.php), and any questions can be easily answered at /r/roasting. It's really easy -- almost as easy as making popcorn.\n\nFor brewing, you want to do your freshly-roasted beans justice. So you buy a good but cheap grinder, like the Hario Mini Mill (a grinder is the most important thing; don't skimp and get a blade grinder!), a tea kettle -- any tea kettle -- and a Clever Dripper and some filters, and you're all set. \n\nUpfront cost: $80 if you don't have a kettle, $60 if you do. But now you roast *and* brew yourself.\n\nContinuing cost: $3-$6 per pound, plus filter. Each pound (453g) of coffee (the beans) makes 6305g of coffee (the beverage), which is 222 oz, which is 22 10oz mugs full. So that's 13.5 cents (grocery store quality) to 27 cents (the very best single-origin coffee) per cup of the freshest coffee you can get.\n\nI hope this is useful, and if you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them!\n\nEDIT: I had to take out links to the products.","name":"t3_37dob3","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-05-26 23:36:45","week":22}

{"id":"37h1zk","author":"cheresier","body":"Hey guys,\n\nI am sitting on quite a bit of Amazon gift card balance. Amazon won’t let you cash it out in any way  or transfer it to another person (short of some really quirky hacks which are not really scalable). I am looking for some ideas on what to do with it. I do buy stuff on Amazon, but not nearly enough to use all the balance that I have and it is growing faster than I can keep up with spending it. This being a flipping community, are there any flipping schemes where Amazon gift card balance could be useful?\n\nAnticipating a question about the source of the balance I will answer it right away: textbook trade-ins\n","name":"t3_37h1zk","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-27 18:04:48","week":22}

{"id":"37hxug","author":"Not_BillMurray","body":"Just a bit of background. \n\nI'm currently a college student. My father recently passed, I received a decent sum of money which I used to put a down payment on a house that will be paying for itself once I rent a room out. All my previous debt has already been paid off (just car payment and student loans). And have a decent sum (above 40k) as emergency savings and a little bit as \"income\" so I can quit my shit job and focus on finishing school.\n\nI've never had a credit card. My dad, while great with money, never taught me a damn thing about credit cards. I really don't spend huge on anything. I've lived off about 15k per year for the last 1.5 years. I was raised lower middle class so I just don't really know or want to spend money extravagantly. I always have just paid with a debit card for everything. \n\nFor example, I use Amazon for a good bit, so I looked up their credit card. A review said if I spend less than $1250 a month(!!!) on Amazon it wouldn't be worth it. Seems ridiculous. \n\nFrom what I've read on a few posts here, credit cards can clearly be a useful tool, but I honestly don't know if I spend enough to warrant one. Would the interest overtake the rewards? Is there even interest if I pay it off in time? \n\n**TL:DR I don't know if I spend enough money to warrant having a credit card, if I do, what should I get?**\n\nLet me know if this post is unnecessary and I'll delete it, I tried to search for a similar topic.","name":"t3_37hxug","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-27 21:39:18","week":22}
{"id":"37i29q","author":"Asynchronization","body":"While doing some research into private label products for Amazon, I found a pretty concise article on finding private label products. It includes some solid fundamental content but also a lot of new and helpful info that I didn't know before so thought I'd share. I just copy and pasted from the site, it doesn't have the pictures or diagrams but you'll get the gist of it.\n\n\nFor those of you who want to read the entire article, you can find it [here!](https://honestfew.com/private-labeling-and-amazon-fba-finding-the-right-product-for-you/)\n\n\n**Finding the right Private label product idea for you**\n\n\nThis is the one of the most crucial steps because everything else can be done perfectly and if we don’t choose a good product, we could possibly fail and lose our investment. That’s why the planning at the product selection phase should be researched carefully and not be rushed.\n\n\nThe first and most important thing you’ll be doing is finding a product to private label. This is the hardest step but with enough research and preparation you’ll be able to create a product that generates income for you on autopilot.\n\n\n\n**So lets look at some simple ways to come up with your idea:**\n\n\n* Reach out: See what issues your friends, family, and others are having. You can try asking on Facebook or Reddit. People are using products and facing problems that need to be solved every single day. Ask them about the products and problems that could be improved in their daily lives.\n\n\n* Write your ideas down: Whether it’s in a notebook or on your phone, jot down ideas or products that you find cool and interesting. This could be on your way to work/school, going to the grocery store, you name it. There are opportunities everywhere.\n\n\n* Look on Amazon or Ebay: There are extensive listings and probably any product you can think about are on those platforms. We’ll be taking a look at the technique behind vetting products on these platforms a little later on.\n\n\n* Solve the problems you have: Often times we look outside of ourselves to find the answers we’re looking for but sometimes the answers we’re looking for are right under our noses. Solving your own problems could also solve problems that other have as well. What things annoy you or are things you don’t like to deal with? Can it be fixed? What do you enjoy doing? Could you sell products related to it? What do you purchase on a regular basis? Could this be something you could sell? Find a way to fix other people’s problems by solving your own and you could very well make your own product\n\n\n**More advanced approach to coming up with ideas:**\n\n\nCheck out what’s selling on the Amazon Best Sellers and Amazon Movers and Shakers. This should be a great source of inspiration for ideas. Also check out eBay completed listings.\n\n\n**Coming up with ideas for Private label products**\n\nYou can use Amazon best seller lists, also take a look at movers and shakers for more ideas. It’s a great place to look for new product ideas because you can see what the top selling items are.\n\n\nGo on the page and take a look at the best selling products. Look through the different categories and subcategories. You’ll want to make sure that the products you find pass the criteria we've set up earlier in the article. Also keep in mind that some categories aren’t good for private labeling or have big brand names selling in them already.\n\n\n**Choose a category that you’re interested in or gravitated to already.**\n Choose an area of products where you don’t need name brand to sell. Things like: appliances, kitchenware, home décor, pet accessories, phone accessories, etc.\nPick a product category you are interested in and makes money. The top categories on Amazon are Supplements, Health and Beauty, Kitchen and Dining, and Mobile Accessories. Two low competition categories are “Sports and Outdoors” and “Travel”\n\n\n**Finding The Right Best Selling Products**\n\n\nYou'll want to find products that rank that are already high in Amazon's ranking system. The higher the BSR (Best Sellers Rank), the more sales that product is making. Products in the 1-1500 range are really great. Don't just focus on finding the perfect product. Since you're building a brand, you'll be selling a couple of different products in your niche anyways.\n\n\nA good tool you can use to figure out the trends and demand of a product is Google Trends.  Say we were interested in selling resistance bands, we would see that the keyword is somewhat seasonal but more importantly you can see that the interest/demand has been increasing over the years. Also something cool you can do is to check the \"Forecast\" box and it'll show you what the projected trend is for the keyword. It's awesome and can give further insight as to whether the trend will increase or decrease. Super important and useful to use when vetting your products. It'll help you account for whether a product is really getting more popular over time, whether it's seasonal, the potential, etc.\n\n\nOn top of google trends, you can search right in Google for products with specific Best Sellers Rank and in specific Categories. So for example if you wanted to find the a product with a BSR of 30 in the sports &amp; outdoors category, you would enter this into the Google search bar: [\"Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #20 in Sports &amp; Outdoors\" :Amazon.com] The underlined items are factors that can be changed depending on what you want to find. Some of your searches may yield no results or results that are slightly off and that is due to Google's algorithm that is being updated constantly.\n\n\nGoogle keyword planner is great for figuring out how many people are looking up keywords related to your product. It'll give you an estimate of the monthly search volumes and also related terms for your keyword. It's a great research tool to add to your arsenal. Go to the Amazon best seller list and look at the keywords that you see in categories/subcategories that you like. Enter them into the keyword planner and explore the potential of your product. Be sure to click on the \"keyword ideas\" tab to get a more accurate count of how many people are looking up the product keyword. (It's right beside the \"Ad group ideas\" tab)\n\n\n**Categories to Avoid:**\n\nGrocery and Gourmet Food,\nMagazines,\nMovies and TV,\nAppstore,\nKindle Store,\nMP3 Downloads,\nBooks,\nClothing,\nElectronics,\nGift Cards,\nMusic,\nPrime Pantry,\nShows,\nSoftware,\nVideo Games,\nAppliances.\n\n**Ebay categories**- You’ll be doing basically the same thing as you did for the Amazon best seller list, there will be some different products available for you to explore.\n\n\n\n**Alibaba categories**- Most private label products you’re going to find will be sourced from Alibaba so it’s a good place to start to look for products. And if you do find something you think will do well, you can straight to sampling and production. Some of the best Alibaba categories to check out are:\n\n\nHealth and Beauty,\nHome, Lights and Construction,\nBags, Shoes and Accessories,\nGifts, Sports and Toys,\nMachinery, Industrial Parts and Tools,\n\nSo we’ve just looked at where and how to come up with some private label ideas. Let’s take a look at how we can differentiate from the competition.\n\n\n**There are 3 ways where you can can do this.  Ask yourself are there:**\n\nProducts I can innovate,\nProducts I add value to, \nProducts I can private label, \n\n**Innovations:**\n\nYou should examine which products are currently selling and check out the reviews. Are people giving it bad reviews? What issues do they have with it? Most people don’t think beyond the surface and just see a product that has good reviews or bad reviews.\n\n\nWe need to go deeper than that and ask “can something, be done about it?”  This is a good opportunity to improve and provide a product that is better. Think about different characteristics of the product, size, color, quality, shape, issues, and what actual reviewers are saying about the product and how it sucks at the moment. Afterall, the reviewers are giving you actionable advice to make something better. The biggest advantage that you have is that most established Amazon businesses won’t change their product or improve because they have been selling for so long and what they're doing is working so why change? It takes much more work for them to redo again  and improve compared to a new seller like you who can come along and do everything well the first time and capitalize on that.\n\n\nCheck out the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews for the best tips on improvement. Your job is to make take peoples pain points away with your improvements.\n\n\n**THE VALUE ADDED TACTIC**\n\nYou can also look for opportunities with popular already existing products. We’re simply looking to add more value, this could be in the form of an accessory or complementing product. It could be even be an ebook, use your imagination. Look at reviews and see what people are doing with the product. If reviewers have bought an ab roller and they’re talking about abs, maybe you could add more value by offering an ebook or even a real book that teaches how to build leaner cut abs with help from. With the techniques you’ll learn in the sourcing part of the course, making a physical book and adding that as a bonus should be no problem.\n\n\n**Creating your own brand/ Private Labeling**\n\nA lot of products on Amazon and eBay are commodities meaning that they’re the same and aren’t proprietary besides the brand name labeled on the product. This means that there is also a lot of competition, something generic like an ab roller may have tens if not hundreds of sellers. You’ll need to differentiate yourself somehow.  You want to build your brand and become a premium in the market. If not a premium, just not known as the cheap guys. Competing on price is not where you want to be, especially as a new seller. People buy products and will often pay extra for a brand that has authority and trust. Create a name that defines the category or types of products you’re private labelling so you can also expand into selling those products eventually.\n\n\n\nThe essentials checklist and must haves to ensure you pick a profitable product.\n\n\nWe discussed how to come up with good ideas for private label product, now lets take a look at the qualities a private label product needs to have to make sure it does well.  It’s recommended that the product you plan on selling have most if not all the requirements below.\n\n\n\n**Some requirements of the products you will be private labeling:\nIs the market viable?**\n\n\n**Average product sale price is between $10 and $70.** This price range is important because it’s where consumers don’t really have to think about purchasing. They can act on impulse decisions and buy quickly compared to more expensive products where they would need to do some research and think about the purchase. Having a lower sale price also makes purchasing your first shipment easier afterall the higher the sale price, the more you can expect to pay to make the first batch of product. We’re also not going under $10 because at the range, the margin is going to be very low.\n\n\n\n**Products have 5000 or smaller Best Seller Rank in Main Category or the sales rank is under 10,000 for each of the top 3 items.* *Amazon doesn’t disclose sales made on a product but it does give you the best seller rank(BSR). BSR shows you how well a product is selling in its category. This is an indicator of whether there is demand for a product in the market or not. You don’t want to start with a product that sells only a couple of units a day when it’s at the #1 spot for the keyword term. The lower it is (closer to 0), the more it is selling. A product with a BSR of 1000 is selling much more than a product with a BSR of 10,000. It’s recommended to go after products in this BSR range because they have enough sales and people buying similar products ( to ones you’ll be selling) to justify trying to break into the market. You’ll have a lot of options to choose from when you’re starting out so why not pick the prospects that have the most sales potential right? Also pay attention to main categories and sub categories. We want to focus on products selling in the main category with a BSR of less than 5000, the sub category BSR isn’t a good indicator of how well a product will do because sub categories are focused on very specific product niches rather than a wide scope of how many products are selling.\n\n\n\n**A national brand name does not rule the market. You don’t want to pick a product that has a national brand name ruling it.** This is because they’ll have built enough trust and authority to draw most customers to them and it’ll be difficult to compete, especially for a new seller. When you’re looking for products to private label on Amazon, search for your products and if you see brand names on the first page it may be a good idea to reconsider pursuing that product. There are exceptions to this rule, if you find a brand name selling similar products but not exactly the same as yours, then you may be able to compete because they’re not selling your exact same product. An example of this would be if you want to sell a bird cage and you see a brand name selling a dog cage. To recap, it’s hard to enter a market with big brands that lots of people know of, you want to create a product, launch and start generating sales right off the bat\n\n\n\n**Do each of the first three items have less 400 reviews.** If they do, then that’s great news. Well kind of. 400 reviews might seem like a lot, especially for a new seller but it means that they’re not so far ahead that it’s pointless to even try to compete. The top 3 spots will get the most clickthroughs because they’re right at the top and are prioritized. The question you’re asking yourself here is can we beat one of the top 3 and get in their position?\n\n\n\n**2-3 Products with Less Than 50 Reviews on First Page.** This is similar to the last qualifier except we’re seeing how easy it would be if we just wanted to rank on the first page in general. Reviews are a factor that Amazon uses to rank its products so it is pretty important for a listing. Generally 50 reviews aren't considered a lot so if there are multiple listings on the first page with 50 reviews, then it’ll be very possible to compete. Just because we’re not in the top 3 listings doesn't mean that customers don’t look at other listings on the first page.\n\n\n\n**Can current listings be improved or optimized or are there knowledgeable sellers in top 3 listings (Using title keywords, excellent pictures, html desc., etc).** Listings that are not optimized are clear signs that the competition won’t be as strong and it’ll be easier for you to rank on the first page. Things to look out for include: short descriptions, weak bullet points, low quality product photos, zero or only one product photo, missing product photos that could create more fantasy or highlight more benefits, short or non descriptive title, and vital information left out. Also remember to focus on the benefits and not just features in your listings. People don’t buy because of features, they buy because of benefits.\n\n\n\n**Top 3 keywords have over 100,000 monthly searches in merchantwords.com.** MerchantWords is like the Keyword Tool, except it indexes searches straight on Amazon instead of Google. It'll show you how many people are searching for terms on the site. I believe there are 3 free searches before you will need to upgrade for a paid account or wait until your time limit expires. It’s recommended that you have over 100,000 monthly searches for your top 3 product keywords because that guarantees enough demand and traffic in your market to justify selling your product.\n\n\n**Can your product sell all year long?** As a new seller, you should gravitate towards products that can sell all year long, that way you’re not making sales in only one or two seasons. You can’t really afford to miss these sales especially if you want to grow your business.\n\n\n**Are similar products sold on Ebay?** If similar products are selling on Ebay, then that means that there is a demand for it across platforms and not only on Amazon. It’s a good sign and if you've vetted your product and it seems good, there isn't really a reason why it wouldn't be sold on Ebay.\n\n\n\n\n**Can you expand to related/similar niche products?** When you’re building a private label brand, it might take a while to start scaling but once you do you’ll want to spread into related products so you’ll have more revenue streams. Also these streams will be able to draw customers to your brand from different avenues which will help build more sales.\n\n\n\n**Does your product have multiple keywords.** Listing your product for multiple keywords helps it get found on Amazon. These different keywords will be able to draw more traffic to your listing.\n\n\n\n\n**All of the Pay per Click ad spots being used.** It shows that sellers are making sales on the products they’re advertising and that it’s more competitive.\n\n\n\n\n**There is no product video on the first page of Google for the main keyword.** This is a sign that the product listing has not been fully optimized and you may have an opportunity to compete.\n\n\n \n\n**Is the product viable?**\n\n\n\n**Product weighs around 1-3 pounds.** This helps you to avoid large shipping cost from eating at away your margin. Also makes things easier to handle when you’re dealing with moving products or with returns. To get a better idea of  the fees, you can find the Amazon FBA Revenue Calculator here. To figure out what you'll earn from a sale, look for a product similar to yours, enter it in, enter in the price you'll charge and then watch magic happen.  The weight will definitely influence your profit margins and how much success your product will have. Lightweight products are preferred if possible.\n\n\n\n**Product is smaller than 8 x 8 x 8 inches.** Smaller products are easier to deal with and also cost less to ship. Also Amazon has certain thresholds on the size of a product and pricing, after certain sizes things get more expensive.\n\n\n\n\n**Product is durable and not easily broken while shipping.** This is a crucial. Not only will this cause refunds but it can lead to some really negative reviews for your business which destroy chances of future customers buying from you. Think simple and generic products that don’t have moving parts.\n\n\n\n\n**Can your product stand out from crowd with improved packaging or brand on item.** We’ll look to improve products but also improving packaging can create more value for customers and help give you an advantage in sales. Product packaging is a great way to improve perceived value without changing the actual product. Can you make present our product with better packaging than something similar on the market?\n\n\n\n\n**Can you add something to make product more valuable?** Ebook, related products/bundling. This relates to the last point about adding more value. With less reviews, sales, and experience than other sellers, how can you add more value to your product and make people want to buy it instead of just competing on price? Think about how you can add more benefits or use out of your product, whether it’s a digital addition or a physical widget, it’ll help you differentiate and find more ways to appeal to buyers.\n\n\n\n\n**Product can be sourced in China.** The products will need to be made in China or somewhere similar because it makes economical sense. You will need to account for the cost of the product, shipping, amazon warehousing fees, amazon sales fees, and other miscellaneous fees when you’re working with FBA. If your margins aren’t good enough, you won’t be making much money!\n\n\n\n**You can purchase including shipping for less than 20% of the sales price.** You want to pick the products that will have enough of a profit margin to account for the various that are going to come with selling the product. If you can get the product made for less than 25% of the sale price, it’ll leave you with 75% margin left and most likely enough to cover fees. When you have a product in mind, you can check quickly by going on Alibaba and searching for your product to get a rough idea of what price suppliers will need to make your product.\n\n\n\n**Initial purchase can be less than 500 units.** You can reduce the risk involved with ordering your first round of product by conducting research and due diligence however it won’t eliminate it completely. Without a proven demand for your product yet, you’ll have to test to see if sells. Look into negotiating a smaller MOQ (minimum order quantity) to begin with. 500 is a pretty good number to start with because it won’t sell out too fast and if it does pick up traction you’ll have some inventory to prepare for getting new inventory. Of course all of this depends on the pricepoint of your product and if it makes sense. Use your discretion!\n\n\n\n**The product leads to reorders or subscriptions.** This is a great way to ensure that you will have repeat business because if people are constantly looking to buy the same product again, it means that there is demand and a piece of the pie for you. It’s not absolutely necessary but if you can find a product that fits this role, it may be a lane to pursue.\n\n\n\n**The product is not a commodity and not easily purchased at local big box store.** If the product can be purchased anywhere or locally, customers may not be purchase as many from you. There may be people who are too lazy to go out and will buy online but it’s something for you to consider. This is not a make or break factor.\n\n\n\n**Product is straightforward to use and won’t need instruction manuals.** The simpler the product, the less information and reviews and research overall a customer will need to do to purchase it right there on the spot.\n\nAnd that concludes the essential checklist of things you should vet your new product ideas with. The more rigorous you vet your ideas, the more likely that they'll stand to succeed. Congratulations on coming this far, you have learned how to come up with new private label product ideas, where to look for them, and how to make sure they're more likely to be successful when you start selling.\n\nThanks for spending some time with us and if you enjoyed this, feel free to share it with friends or family who might benefit from this as well.

{"id":"37iywc","author":"biz_guy_01","body":"Hey guys, I posted this over on /r/fulfillmentbyamazon earlier and thought I'd share my story/progress here as well. Some details are abstracted a bit, but happy to answer any general questions.\n\nThis is sales of branded products from a US manufacturer/company, not private label FBA.\n\nMy Amazon Sellers account performance report: http://imgur.com/E944t2H\n\n-----\n\nStarted selling two primary products I was able to source from a large IT manufacturer at a great discount due to past business relationship from 8-10 years ago. Was simply trying to pick up 1-2 units for myself but when faced with such good pricing I kept negotiating and committing to larger orders.\n\nThis represents about 4-8 hours/week of work or effort in total. I order in small bulk which is delivered via freight. I usually have to re-wrap and sometimes removed damaged product and then simply label and ship off to Amazon for FBA.\n\nAbout 2 months in Amazon suspended my account for almost 2 weeks due to a \"review\" for exceeding velocity limits but overall I haven't had many issues.\n\nHappy to answer any questions that aren't too specific of course.\nIf you're curious...gross margins range about 15-30% depending on my discount (changed slightly each quarter) and how aggressive Amazon wants to compete directly. I usually have no issue winning the Buy Box and prefer it even with lower margins because it keeps the product moving quick.\n\nBiggest challenge is just working capital to purchase more product and somewhere to PUT it while I receive and prepare it to ship to Amazon. I use my garage right now so I have to manage inbound inventory carefully. Could be a lot bigger.\n\nReally wish I could ship from manufacturer to Amazon, but that won't be happening...no way possible. I'd be a rich man if that was the case.","name":"t3_37iywc","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-28 01:44:20","week":22}

I've been a member of the Reddit community for about three years and I feel that this is a great place to get answers and ideas when you've hit a brick wall (figuratively speaking, of course). I've got a bit of a dilemma on my hands and I'm open to suggestions from you all. \nSo, I recently ventured into selling on Amazon and after doing some research, I placed an order for a large amount of some baking mats that seemed to be selling very well. I decided I would get in touch with a manufacturer and have my own brand of baking mats made to sell through Amazon FBA. Well it's been a couple of weeks and I have not sold any yet and, quite frankly, I'm beginning to feel a little nervous about losing a substantial amount of money. \nSo, aside from opening myself up to suggestions, I'd like to invite you all to check out my listing (link is at the end of the post) and please feel free to add it to your shopping cart ;)\nPlease share the link with family and friends that might enjoy baking.

{"id":"37jwg8","author":"MacKBalla","body":"Hello all,\n\nI've accumulated three different retirement accounts in 8 years of work. I was always told to save, and I'd like to think I've done somewhat decent so far. I haven't really managed the accounts (set and forget) However, as I'm currently going to school while \"working\" super part in the reserves, I'd like to continue building at least some interest/dividends with one of these accounts (or two?). I'm not sure as to what the best approach should be. What do you recommend? Throw everything in the TSP? Rollover the IRA into the Roth? Here's the scoop:\n\nI have around $16,800 in the Thrift Savings Plan I accumulated while I was active. The current allocation distribution is:\n\n40% C fund\n20% G fund\n20% I fund\n20% S fund\n\nWhen I was deployed, my supervisor convinced me to open a ROTH IRA through the bank (USAA) last year. I contributed $5500 and bought some stocks in Amazon, Lockheed and Apple. It's sitting at $6800 today, and I have a little over $2000 available for trading. Should I buy bonds? Vanguard? Ditch it?\n\nBefore all that, I had a 401K at my old job worth roughly $3500. It's been left unchecked for 5 years, and I recently rolled it over to an IRA through USAA. It's currently just...sitting there. No allocations.\n\nSo, tl;dr: How should I get \"maximum\" return on my retirement while attending school with:\n\nTSP - $16,800\nRoth IRA: $6800\nIRA: $3500\n\n\nAny help greatly appreciated !

Here's the reasoning they gave:\n\n\"I am glad to inform you that it is indeed removable as per Amazon policy because it implies a review on the case related to the year 2007 and account has been closed.. Therefore, I have removed the feedback and the rating will no longer affect your performance. \"\n\nI guess because the review was so old and the customer had closed their account the feedback qualified as removable.

{"id":"37mluu","author":"gresquare","body":"# Background\n\nI’m a marketer with 5-year+ experience working in startups and large organisations. I always mainly focused on the customer side of the funnel - how to retain customers and make them happy. True marketing is my passion, I love understanding customers and providing them with what they need.\n\n3 months ago I left my job to start a SaaS marketing startup for eCommerce retailers called Slices. I did some research before quitting, mainly using the “[Four Steps to the Epiphany](https://books.google.ie/books/about/The_Four_Steps_to_the_Epiphany.html?id=oLL2pjn2RV0C&amp;redir_esc=y)” book as a structure. \n\nI started by validating the problem and a possible solution. I talked to a lot of prospects along the way. I posted on /r/Startups about my process ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2rz8aj/here_is_how_i_built_my_first_mvp_in_less_than_a/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2x82cu/here_is_how_i_validated_my_business_idea_with/)).\n\n**Everything was going as planned.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n***\n# Validating the product\n\nAfter having validated my business idea, I decided to move on to my next challenge: validating the product.\n\nThis means, building a product valuable enough for my prospects to pay for. To achieve this objective, I had to work simultaneously on four different topics:\n\nfiguring out the MVP requirements,\nfinding developers able to build this MVP,\nfinding people to join Slices,\nand prospecting to generate more leads.\n\n## Figuring out the MVP requirements\n\nIn the last few weeks, I spent the majority of my time working on the MVP. I knew that I had to simplify the product, keeping one or two features. And I also knew that I had to keep the essence of the product intact: the MVP would still have to solve a painful problem for eCommerce retailers (struggling to engage with their customers at scale).\n\nI started to brainstorm about how users would use Slices to solve their problem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n######### Extract from MVP Specs ##########\n\n*Slices.io empowers eCommerce retailers who want to increase their profitable revenue by sending automated &amp; relevant emails to their customers (just like Amazon).\n\nSlices.io helps:\n– convert more visitors into buyers,\n– make customers buy more, more often, for longer,\n– retain lapsing customers.\n\nSlices.io is a SaaS platform using a new technology that replaces solutions like Abandoned Cart Recovery, Online Loyalty Programs or Marketing CRMs. Slices.io makes it easy to understand customers, engage with them and check the results, in one single platform.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn total, I wrote more than 40 detailed pages about the MVP, its features, its technical requirements and its benefits. I also included detailed wireframes of Slices (using [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/)).\n\nGoing through this level of details took me a long time (about three to four weeks in total).\n\nThe objective of this document was to give a clear picture of Slices for any outside party, particularly developers.\n\n## Finding developers\n\nMy second objective was to find developers who would be able to extract to build a first version of Slices using the MVP specifications.\n\nThere were different options available to me:\n\n- Option 1: finding developer(s) based in Dublin, who believed enough in the idea to start working with me.\n- Option 2: finding companies to outsource the development to.\n- Option 3: learning to program myself.\nI started to focus on the first option. \n\nI actively shared the fact that I was looking for passionate developers who wanted to solve an eCommerce challenge.\n\nI created a landing page using Bootstrap and shared the following update to my network and got in touch with a few developers:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/pzOYdhd\n\nI also got excellent traction from the Irish Tech Community Slack channel after I shared the update.\n\nFinally, I attended two to three “technical” events a week to meet developers and like-minded individuals.\n\nI also looked at Option 2 and got in touch with software development companies in Ireland and abroad (particularly in Eastern Europe).\n\nI sent my MVP specs to get a better idea of what was involved in building the first version of Slices.\n\nFinally, learning to code myself was never really an option.\n\n## Finding people to join Slices\n\nI was lucky enough to meet some very smart and interesting people by going to events and networking in the last few weeks.\n\nI mainly used Meetup.com as a way to find like-minded people. I also took part in a Startup Weekend in Dublin.\n\nI met a few people who were willing to help me, most of them involved in marketing and business, like myself.\n\n## Prospecting to generate more leads\n\nThis is clearly the tactic that I had to put on hold to focus on building a team and building a product.\n\nWhile I stayed in touch with the prospects I knew, I didn’t spend much time trying to generate new leads.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***\n# What happened and what I learned\n\n## I underestimated the amount of resources needed to build a first MVP\n\nI knew that building a B2B product would be expensive, but I didn’t how much until I received quotes back from companies and developers.\n\nI had some savings and I would have been able to raise money from friends and family to pay for developing the MVP. But it didn’t feel right.\n\nMy guts were telling me that I was taking too big of a risk with no proper team.\n\n## Finding a team is not something that can be forced\n\nAs I previously mentioned, I met a lot of great people by networking and I also made a few friends. I also got the chance to meet startup teams who already had traction.\n\nThe vast majority of the teams I met knew each other long before they started to work together. I thought that I could meet some people along the way who shared the same vision, who had complementary skills and who would be willing to join in.\n\nBut getting to know people takes time and finding people who are available right now is nearly impossible.\n\nI now believe that building a startup sort of happens when a group of people know each other well enough, want to solve the same problem and are in the same stage in their life.\n\n## Working on your own is tougher than I thought\n\nI’ve set up a pretty cool office in my apartment when I started to work on Slices. It is great to avoid the daily commute and to be able to work from a relaxed environment.\n\nAfter a few weeks, however, the initial excitement is being replaced by a daily routine.\n\nNot being able to bounce things off with somebody else or ask for somebody else’s opinion can quickly become tiring. Also, not being surrounded by people, even people you don’t know, could affect your moral.\n\nLaunching a startup is not only about filling a business model canvas and craft 10 beautiful slides for investors. It is a momentum game. A marathon and not a sprint. And it is tough to keep the momentum going when you are on your own.\n\nI read about those three issues many times before and I thought I could overcome them. It is not until I experienced them myself that it all started to make sense.\n\n## I learned a lot\n\nBy talking to many business owners and marketers work in the retail sector, I learned a lot about the problems they struggle with on a day-to-day basis and the way they operate. I know a lot more than I used to.\n\nI also learned a lot by researching the market. I probably tried well over 100 marketing products in the last few weeks and I really enjoyed using a few of them.\n\nI went out of my comfort zone more times in the past few weeks than I ever did in my entire life.\n\n## To summarise\n\nMy passion for marketing and customer experience is intact. My work in the past few weeks confirmed that businesses are struggling to retain customers and engage with them in a meaningful way.\n\nA lot of emphasis is made on customer acquisition and lead generation, yet only a handful of businesses have a solid customer experience strategy in place to build loyalty.\n\nI also learned a few things about myself:\n\n- I have a short attention span and like to juggle between different projects.\n- I love teaching. I lectured in marketing recently and this was a great experience. I love to learn but I also love to share my knowledge to help others.\n- I have imposter syndrome. This might sound over-the-top but I feel less competent that I really am and I feel like others might know more than they actually do.\n- I want to bootstrap my business. I don’t feel comfortable with outside investment as off yet. I want to build the foundation of a solid business first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***\n# Time to evolve\n\nMy gut feelings were right at the start of this adventure: consulting was the best route to take based on my personality and my personal situation.\n\nIn my previous article, I explained the reason why I ditched the “consultancy MVP” to focus on a product-based solution.\n\nI said that:\n\n“– I didn’t have any experience as a consultant,\n– I would have validated the problem but not the solution,\n– And, in fact, consultancy as a solution would have been a weaker solution than what my prospective customers are using at the moment.”\n\nFrom what I learned recently, I think I was wrong.\n\n- It’s true, I don’t have any experience as a consultant BUT I have provided huge value to the companies I worked for in the past. I can employ the same tactics to deliver some big results.\n- I fell in love with a product-based solution. I liked the idea of building a scalable product. I forgot that a product is not always the answer and that it very much depends on the context.\n- There again, I was wrong. My prospects are using some decent marketing tools, but helping them improving their processes, and implementing some smart data-driven marketing strategies are where the value lies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***\n# Building a consulting business\n\nI’ve decided to start a customer experience and marketing consulting business 2 weeks ago, helping B2C businesses to stand out from the crowd by designing unique experiences that make customers come back for more.\n\nI’ve made a few quick changes, such as changing the name from Slices.io to Slices Consulting. I redesigned my social media profiles to build credibility. I also worked on my offering and on a marketing manifesto, “The Light Side of Marketing”.\n\nNow is time to start working with clients. As you know, getting the first clients is always the toughest part of consulting. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***\n# I want to offer my help\n\nAs you know, the toughest part of consulting is finding the first clients. I want to offer my help to fellow redditors to get some case studies. A few examples of customer experience/marketing projects I can help with:\n\n- doing a conversion audit on your eCommerce website to convert more visitors into customers,\n- designing customer journey maps across different channels to uncover some opportunities to delight customers,\n- setting up automated campaigns to re-engage with lapsing or lost customers,\n\nThanks for reading this far and feel free to get in touch.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR: I switched from a SaaS startup to customer marketing consulting.

{"id":"37mpzb","author":"MEngineeer","body":"I manufacture and sell 1 product (retails around $15). It does well in retail with standard designs but I've got a printer so I can offer full custom designs on it as well. \n\nSo, 130k split by sales channel:\n\n* **Online Sales - $54k** - I had a good launch, combination of my website, Etsy, Amazon, and RedditGifts while it lasted :( Christmas was spectacular.\n* **Wholesale - $33k** -  Just counted my wholesale customers and its up to 38. There's one 8 store chain in there but the rest are all 1-store locations. I picked up 10 or so local locations on my own but the rest come from 3 independent sales reps that I work with. I've got no problem writing those commission checks. \n* **Deal Sites - $20k** - Groupon Goods\n* **Craft Shows - $16k** - This was all from a one 4-day long show. I thought I'd do well but not $16k! I was scrapping the bottom of the barrel for inventory by the end. And it was a hugely needed cash infusion, no 30 day terms it was $16000 in cash. There's nothing like walking into a bank and pulling out a massive brick of 20s (this helps make the bankers happy when you come asking for a line of credit). I paid down CC balances I had run up a bit and made some critical large inventory purchases to be prepared for the rest of the holidays. I had a friend of mine who I paid to help out at the craft show (in November) and he ended up working for me for the rest of the season, about 20 hrs a week or so. Couldn't have done it without him. Then a weird thing happened sales stayed steady at 10k a month since Christmas. No after holiday dropoff, that's how I know I've got something good here.\n* **One time promo sales - $7k** - These sales came out of left field. They're from large corporate customers and I don't see them repeating. But hey I'll take it, it kinda makes your day when you get a $3500 order.\n\nMy profit was about $55k before taxes. And is actually $25k after all my equipment depreciation. I'm happy with it for my first year.\n\nNow I'm launching two new products this summer that should do as well or better than the first. I'm gonna take all those sales channels and double down i what worked with all of them:\n\n* **Online sales** - The marketing launch is gonna be polished with great photography and video. I'll be leveraging Amazon FBA heavily for two reasons. Gear sites and blogs are more likely to cover you if you give them an Amazon Link because they'll get a cut of the sales. You also get to use Amazon's brand to help sell your product. Plus it reduces your shipping labor expenses. \n* **Deal sites** - not much to change here, maybe reach out to some of the other deal sites to see if their interested. \n* **Wholesale** - So there are thousands of independent sales reps out there searching for new interesting product lines. Ever industry has sales reps. I am gonna have a sales rep network in place to cover the whole country. \n* **Craft shows** - Adding product so I expect to increase sales, cutting out the crappy shows, only doing the major ones. \n\n**My challenges:** Keeping up with demand. I currently manufacture a portion of my product. And just inventory demands in general. All my funding is currently coming from my cash flow so that's terrific. I'll be forced to hire soon and to be honest that's something I am a bit apprehensive about. But you don't grow as a person if you don't do uncomfortable things so I'll do it. Growing pains in general, fucking bookkeeping, space constraints, lead times, accounts receivables, writing systems. \n\n**Why I want to grow?** Becaus this is an excellent oppurtunity to learn how to run and grow a company and make a shit ton of money. Because money is power. And not money for money's sake but because with money you can create even better stuff and have a wider impact on society. In a year or so Ican walk away with a few hundred thousand cash and start something maybe more in line with my passions (which I'm trying to keep up with on the side by research and networking, investigating different opportunities). This is the same as the guy working 1 year more so he gets his fluffy pension. Plus I'll bring all these new skills I'm learning now to the table at the next oppurtunity. \n\nMy passions deal in solid wast management, definitely recycling of some kind. There are robust recycled materials markets growing every year. And when I want to get into something it has to be physical so that's gonna mean buying processing line equipment. And that gets expensive really fast. So if you have your own cash you don't need investors, no loan payments or interest to worry about. So your margins can be a little lower and you can get riskier with your business model. Oppurtunities are always on the fringe a little bit. Investors don't like too much risk. \n\n**tl;dr** Don't put all your eggs in one basket when you're trying to generate revenue.

{"id":"37mzhb","author":"hempiestad","body":"A few weeks ago I went live with our eCommerce drop ship site . We were not getting much traffic and were still waiting for our first sale. I was worried so I setup an Amazon seller account. We launched the seller account yesterday and I was ecstatic to see orders steadily coming in. For just opening we made about $600 in gross sale in the first few hours open.\n\nThen I received a notification from Amazon that my seller account had been suspended for being linked to a blocked account. Amazon gives you some links to a FAQ on how to refute suspensions but none of them list what to do about being linked to a blocked account. I called Amazon support which was of minimal help, but they did have me email seller-performance@amazon.com. Amazon refuses to provided how or even what account they have found you linked to. They leave you just to plead that you have not had a seller account previously blocked by Amazon. There is no one to speak to about it and even after refuting they just say your suspension is permeate and further inquiries may not be replied to.\n\nSo I was left with $600 worth of orders and I didn't know if I would even get the funds if I processed the orders I called Amazon to find out there would be a 90 day hold on the funds if I processed the orders. I ended up having to cancel each order and email each customer to explain why their order was being canceled. \n\nI went from being really excited to feeling like I was just mugged. I'm going to refocus and reinvest all this time I have been using to deal with Amazon and invest it in our own brand and website. Hopefully we come out stronger from this.\n\nI will be contacting my state and national representatives, better Business bureau to do my part in getting this policy of blocking without any avenue of resolution removed from the Amazon seller system. It would be unacceptable to treat a customer that way it's unacceptable to treat your sellers that way as well Amazon.\n\nSummary: opened Amazon seller account, was suspended for being linked to a blocked account, Amazon makes it impossible to get unsuspended when this happens even if a false positive","name":"t3_37mzhb","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-28 22:39:26","week":22}

{"id":"37ni3h","author":"[deleted]","body":"New grads at one of the top tech companies in Vancouver (AMZN Vancouver, MSFT Vancouver, A Thinking Ape, Mobify, Ericsson, HootSuite, etc.) average about CAD $79-81K at the high end. (These are the companies that only want the best.) Add on bonuses and stock options, and after taxes this results in a net of $70-75K. \n\nPublic health insurance in BC (MSP) is $864 per year, and there's probably going to be a group extended health plan as well. Then there's Canada Pension Plan and UI, roughly ~$9,000. So, say another $10,000 on top of that. By my calculations the final take home pay is between $60-65K. This is probably totally very wrong, but it was a rough estimate.\n\nUsing the CoL calculator on Numbeo (that factors in rent), a net salary of CAD $60,000 in Vancouver will get you the same standard of living that USD $62,150 (CAD $77,550) will get you in Seattle. For CAD $65,000, the equivalent in Seattle is USD $67,330 (CAD $84,020).\n\nEngineers in Seattle start out at $90-105K USD ($110-130K CAD), and can even go as high as $120K USD ($149K CAD). Now, I'm not sure what a Seattle software developer's paycheque looks like, and the way IRS withholding and deducting works will remain a mystery to me, but it seems that even when factoring in CoL and the exchange rate, Vancouver engineers are still *grossly* underpaid. Especially considering Washington has no state income tax.\n\nOf course, if my calculations are way off that would be a different story.","name":"t3_37ni3h","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-29 00:58:31","week":22}

I'm just making a post because I don't wanna PM every single person I helped.\n\nAnyway, the cheat I share with you all has been working perfectly for me. No ban and I'm making $12.50 a day off my 5 devices while only touching them once or twice a day and for only a couple minutes. I've redeemed over $200 in Amazon cards so far and my earnings are consistent. I could be making a bit more but that would require complicating my process, so I'm content with how it is now.\n\nAs for anyone who's interested in the method, sorry. I advertised it and shared it for free a while ago, warning everyone that I wouldn't share it again. There are many reasons not to continue sharing it and I hope you understand.\n\nPS: If you're skeptical and can come up with a realistic way for me to prove myself, I'd be happy to do it.

{"id":"37o1ed","author":"tmiw","body":"For those of you who aren't aware, the major airlines in the US offer programs through a company called Rewards Network that lets you earn additional miles/points at participating restaurants on top of whatever you're already earning with your card (up to a maximum of 5 points per dollar). If you eat out a lot, those points can add up pretty quickly. For instance, with my Chase Freedom card I'm earning 5 United miles + 5 UR points per dollar, or 10 United miles if I transfer the UR points to them. \n\nTo set up your account, you normally need to enter the card number(s) of the cards that you want to use. You would think this precludes the use of NFC at these establishments (since they use a different card number that isn't normally visible). However, it will still recognize transactions performed with NFC *as long as the correct card number is on file*. In this post I'll explain how to set up MileagePlus Dining for Apple Pay to improve convenience when paying at those locations. The instructions should be similar for any other NFC service and any other airline dining program.\n\n*Disclaimer: Like with any other aspect of churning, this carries risks (known and unknown). I'm not responsible for any adverse action Rewards Network, your FF program or your card issuer may take as a result of following these instructions.*\n\n* * *\n\n**Part 1: Reading your card number**\n\n1. Purchase a USB RFID/NFC reader from Amazon or your favorite store (the one I'm using is [this](http://www.amazon.com/OMNIKEY-5321-Smart-Card-Reader/dp/B00737J1H6) but it appears to be discontinued; other similar ones should work). Install the drivers for it for your operating system.\n2. Download a program called [cardpeek](http://pannetrat.com/Cardpeek/) and install it on your computer.  Plug your card reader in and then start the application. \n3. It should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/xjtausO.png); choose the card reader you have plugged in. Say Yes if it asks to download updates.\n4. Choose Analyzer-&gt;EMV and place the phone over the reader. For Apple Pay you'll need to authenticate with your finger/thumbprint before it will transmit any card info. For the Android solutions it should be enough to unlock your phone's display, but you may have to enter a PIN depending on your settings.\n5. If cardpeek asks to send GET PROCESSING OPTIONS, choose Yes.\n6. Once it's done scanning, a whole bunch of data will come up. You want to look for something called \"Track 2 Equivalent Data\". The first 16 digits of it (15 if American Express) is the card number that you're going to add in Part 2 below. The last four digits of that should be equivalent to the Device Account Number shown in Passbook if you use Apple Pay.\n\n**Part 2: Adding to Rewards Network**\n\n1. Log into your preferred Rewards Network site ([SkyMiles](http://skymiles.rewardsnetwork.com/), [AAdvantage](http://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/), [Mileage Plan](http://mileageplan.rewardsnetwork.com/), [MileagePlus](http://mpdining.rewardsnetwork.com/), [Rapid Rewards](http://www.rapidrewardsdining.com/)). You may already have an account if you have certain credit cards (Barclays Aviator/US Airways for example), but if you don't, go ahead and register. There are usually pretty good bonuses for new members' first few visits to participating restaurants.\n2. Click on the Account Information tab if you're not directed there and then click on \"Add a card\".\n3. Choose the card type and then enter the number you found in Part 1 above. \n\n    **WARNING for non-Apple Pay users**: the card type you selected to use is likely not going to be the same as what's transmitted. This is especially important for Google Wallet users, as it uses a virtual MasterCard even if you have a  Visa/AmEx/Discover card added on your phone. General rule of thumb is to check the first digit of the transmitted card number: 4 is generally Visa, 5 is MasterCard, 3 is American Express and 6 is Discover.\n4. Agree to the terms and conditions and push Save. You're all set.\n\n**Things to keep in mind**\n\nNot everywhere in the US can take NFC right now, not even close. However, this is definitely improving over time. I found out this worked because I followed Part 1 a while ago and went to a Greek takeout that supports Apple Pay. I didn't realize they were RN members either until I got the email from it.\n\nAlso, the numbers transmitted are not guaranteed to stay the same for a significant period of time. I think Google Wallet's changes occasionally but I don't know how often. Apple Pay's should stay the same unless you restore/wipe your phone or otherwise delete and re-add your cards to it, or if you have to report your physical card/phone as lost or stolen. You may want to repeat Part 1 again occasionally and compare the last four digits to what's on the Rewards Network site to make sure nothing changed; RN will not automatically update them.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this helps people! Let me know if you have any questions.","name":"t3_37o1ed","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-05-29 03:33:50","week":22}

{"id":"37se8i","author":"thesabreslicer","body":"Hello /r/entrepreneur!\n\nI am starting a company with a couple friends that will act as an alternative matchmaking service for Valve's Counter Strike: Global Offensive using Amazon Web Services. Right now, we are in the development stage. As we are all in high school, we won't really start working on it seriously for about 2 more weeks.\nOur costs will be low - AWS charges for servers by the hour, and cheaply at that, so if our user base is low, then we will have low monthly charges. As our business grows and we get more paying customers, they will cover the server costs. I also have a stable disposable income, so I can cover a few large costs if they come up.\n\nMy questions to you:\n\nHow does investing in a company like this work? I am talking to a couple people who may be interested in investing capital into our business (friends), but how do we estimate how much their investment is worth? And, what should I spend that investment on? As I said, our month to month costs will be covered, but I expect the actual development of the service to be our biggest expense (monetarily and / or work wise). Should I spend it on more developers or save it for advertising?\n\nAlso (and I know we have a ways to go before this), how do we register as an actual company doing business in the State of California?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.","name":"t3_37se8i","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-30 02:29:35","week":22}

It offers 5% on groceries, gas, and Amazon, which honestly covers the majority of my spending. \n\nBut then I also found the Citi Double Cash Card. 2% back on everything.

My Quicksilver card has none of those features, and it doesn't look like the Sallie Mae card does either. But does that make it the better choice?

Then you sprinkle in the review of the camera or whatever it is you are selling.  \n\nThere is no way you can compete with Amazon by writing a single review for 4 cameras.  If you want to focus on a specific niche, moving your existing 8 articles to a new domain would make no sense.  (And if cutting and pasting 8 articles to a new domain sounds like a lot of work, I'm afraid you might not be cut out for running a business).\n\nSay you're reviewing a camera that attaches to a drone.  You could post articles about:\n\n* why you selected the camera and not a competitor (with links to all cameras you considered)\n* how you mounted the camera (with links to all the accessories and tools you needed)\n* your day trip to the location where you used the camera with funny anecdotes that happened along the way\n* a post showcasing the footage you took with the camera and the reaction to the footage from your friends and relatives\n* a post about why you are considering upgrading to the next level of camera\n\nBTW: these posts can be completely fictitious as long as they are believable.\n\nI have written scripts to generate websites to sell products with affiliate links.  It simply doesn't work.  If someone searches for the name and model of a Canon camera, ads and amazon links come up first in the search results.

If you posted a link on twitter that said \"Click here to buy a Canon Rebel t3i\" no one would.

{"id":"crl5ksy","author":"tchesofpches","body":"If you're gonna go with the many recommendations for a good memory foam from Amazon (which I fully support, I own a Lucid 12\" that came at an incredible price-- under $700 altogether for mattress/box spring/mattress&amp;boxspring protectors/sheet set/pillows!!), I'll give you my input. Number one would be SORT BY HIGHEST CUSTOMER REVIEWS/RATINGS. You're paying a pretty penny, it's best not to waste it on some rando piece of crap. Second, the warranty is always killer on memory foams. You are truly buying an investment. Unfortunately (third), they run hot. Super hot. Nobody likes going to bed sweaty. So if you do it, I'd go with memory foam gel, or buy a gel topper separately. (I went with the memory foam gel from the get-go myself because I knew I'd need it being an Arizonan.) Fourth, they always are firmer than you'd expect. There are different densities, so I would lean plush as even the medium's are wayyyyy firmer than a traditional mattress. Mine was supposedly medium but felt like concrete, so I got a latex topper after. Massive improvement. Speaking of your back, it will love you!

For example, \"the overall performance of this camera is high but not perfect\". What the hell does that mean? By what metrics are you measuring performance? In what environmental conditions?\n\nRead some reviews from popular sources. They go into details colour balance, saturation, low light performance, etc etc. Going by your review you haven't even used any of the cameras you reviewed, let alone own any of them. People nowadays expect reviews to be backed up with sample images and videos in different conditions, with analyses of each even down to the file size of each picture, and how that compares against other popular devices.\n\nWhy did you choose cameras to review? Are you a hobby photographer? Or did you just figure \"eh, high margins, I'm sure I can flog at least a few\"? Nothing in life is low-effort high-return.

To the point that sometimes even gigantic corporations fail at it - look at Microsoft's Zune, or Amazon's Fire Phone. That's not to say you can't do it, you just have to be smart about it. Write about your experiences using the devices, do comparison reviews (people love those), write guides about doing stuff on the cheap (\"Wanna get into photography but don't want to spend five thousand dollars on gear?

{"id":"crln9q3","author":"BeatDaBest","body":"I got a couple question from someone that I think everyone would want to know the answer to.\n\n&gt;If you select a niche, can you list products from other categories too?\n\n* The niche selection part is for your website, and not for Amazon. Once you sign up for Amazon's affiliate program you can create affiliate links to nearly every page on their site.    \nIf you mean can you list products for other categories on your website, then yes, but I prefer to make my sites niche specific.\n\n&gt; Are there any restrictions on categories?\n\n* Listing products wise, no. Some products you get a smaller commission on (personal computers are capped at $25) , and some products you don't get any commissions from. (Amazon Appstore apps, Kindle product subscriptions, wireless plans not sold by Amazon, and other items on [this page](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/operating/exclusions?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_i=assoc_join_menu&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=&amp;pf_rd_r=&amp;pf_rd_s=assoc-right-1&amp;pf_rd_t=501&amp;ref_=amb_link_84018271_11)\n\n&gt; If people follow your link for product A, but then go on to Amazon and buy a product B, do you get anything for the sale?\n\n* You get money for *all* sales that happen within 24 hours of people clicking on your link unless the person clicks on another Amazon affiliate link before hand. (I think Amazon uses the most recent affiliate link clicked, but I'm not 100% sure on this) So if you advertise let's say $20 basketballs, but someone decides to buy a $2,000 basketball hoop, you'd get a commission on that!   \nThis is why I like Amazon. So many people use it for buying random items, and if you get them to click on your link they eventually end up realizing that they need to buy *something* on Amazon and you get money for it!\n\n&gt; Some sites have some sort of a direct link to amazon.com, not a particular product/category. This link leads you to the amazon.com main page. Do people get commission for that too?\n\n* Once you get into their affiliate program you get the ability to create a referral link to almost any page on Amazon. If the link you clicked has a tag=*randomstuff* in it, then if you buy something then the referrer will get a commission, yes.\n\n&gt; Do you get your commission if people pay using Amazon.com gift cards, instead of a credit card? \n\n* Amazon doesn't show you how the people paid for the order, and I am not sure about this, but I think that you get paid no matter what as you're getting part of the profit from Amazon and not extra money from the customer.\n\n&gt; How stringent are the Amazon website checks? What are some things that can cause failures when they review your site? I understand that we should follow the ToS but are there some things they frown upon? \n\n* The big thing is having the “[Insert your name] is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to [insert the applicable site name (amazon.com, amazonsupply.com, or myhabit.com)].” disclaimer somewhere on your site and **do not** cloak links!    \nYour site should look non-spammy (so no ads), have fairly good content, and I also believe that they only allow you to use certain buttons if you're going to use images buttons such as \"buy now\" or \"get from Amazon\".   \nYou could email or call their [support](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/contact) and they should be able to tell you if your site has any problems.   \nMost of the time if your site looks okay, has 10+ posts on it, doesn't look spammy and has the disclaimer you should be fine.   \nAmazon can also be fickle with what they think is good or bad, so god help you! ;)","name":"t1_crln9q3","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-05-26 21:28:23","week":22}

These are usually CPC driven, meaning you get paid every time a user clicks an ad.

Here you can link to products listed on amazon, and you receive a small percent. Along with this, you can google almost any company followed by \"affiliate program\" and see if they have one. Most usually offer immediate earnings (i.e. $20) or a fixed %/purchase. This is great for sites that review products, or often mention items that relate to the website.\n\nIf you're running a blog, you can also offer personal guest post or shout-outs to other websites.

I'm pretty sure you're going to need a decent income, not be a student. I never applied for it because I don't like the annual fee and the rewards are fairly useless if you don't travel frequently.\n\nAMEX Blue Cash Preferred is fairly good. I'd find it more useful than the Chase Sapphire because I don't travel that much. Again, annual fee.\n\nYou say that you're going to put enough on the card to make back the annual fee, but I don't really get the point of that. Why use all of your rewards to pay the annual fee? You would have to spend a significant amount of money each month to profit at the end of the year.\n\nPersonally, I'd consider the Discover It rewards card. That's what I use. It has no annual fee, and offers rewards similar to the Chase Freedom card. Discover's app and website are so amazing compared to my Chase card. Also, they have instant live chat customer support on their website which I'm certain no other company has.

On your way home you decide to say screw it to the doctor and you stop at McDonalds. Bible 4.0 knows you just pulled into the parking lot by GPS and sends a popup message asking what are you doing there. There is a few answers to select from. You choose 'I am going to eat here and you can't stop me'. Bible 4.0 then just gives a list of the better food/drink options.

{"id":"crmcj2o","author":"Krizzen","body":"Wow, yes \"discounted\" is accurate. Some retail prices are just laughable. Who pays for that shit? Oh, that's right, that's why those items are nearly free now.\n\nAnyway, I just shoot for a reasonable price discount based on my estimated final net profit. A few things to consider (I sort of go down this list):\n\n- Selling price. You can make a nice chunk of money off of stuff at 50% off retail, and you can net a loss on stuff at 90% off retail. Ultimately, the price *must* make sense for the item. Regardless, you're *never* obligated to buy at any price. You only obligate when you click \"Pay\".\n- Potential market. Ebay? Right back to Amazon? Craigslist? Storefront? FaceBook group? This determines your actual cost for the sale. If you have to ship 50lbs cross-country, you'll end up at a loss, but if you sell it local, you might net a huge gain. Consider the market first, determine the cost, then figure a nice discounted sell price.\n- Sell rate. Does the item move? Obviously buying things like brake rotors, wheel bearings, and lab equipment is a losing proposition. No one buys that stuff, for good reason. However, the hot moving items disappear so quickly I couldn't even tell you what those are since I might have bought them. This is the real challenge.\n- If these things make sense, I either create an alert or just wait a few days.\n\nUltimately, it's somewhat of a gamble, but no business is risk-free. I skim all categories, but I'd wager you can make a more consistent income by focusing on a few categories than everything. Sometimes I have knockout deals, other times they're quite terrible compared to what I figured. Sometimes the items come in amazingly pristine, other times I just have to send them right back.\n\nTo summarize, it comes down to how fast an item moves, how close to retail that price is, and what you can buy it at. After shipping/selling, do you net money in the pocket? If yes, even a $5 can be a win.","name":"t1_crmcj2o","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-27 12:27:16","week":22}

{"id":"crmo1qp","author":"indiraa","body":"You should probably find some ways to cut back on the wedding. You said that there's 275 people and that's mostly family... remember that your wedding doesn't need to be a family reunion, somebody else can plan one of those if they want it. You said both of your parents have lots of siblings - are you good friends with all of their kids? Do they live close? If the answer is no, cut them from the list. Cut children out too - people understand and I think they have more fun when they don't have to watch them all night. We had a kid free wedding (save for 2 special distance circumstances) and nobody grumbled.\n\nAlso consider if you really want flowers, they get really expensive. We used lanterns from Amazon and battery powered tea lights for bridesmaid \"bouquets\" at about $13 each. I splurged a little on boutonnieres on Etsy, buying 14 (incl for parents, extras) for $180, and I still have them. I know some of our friends spent 4 digits on flowers, and even if you're doing them yourself, you need to find the time (and patience) to put them together right at the end.\n\nThird, if your venue has a buffet option, that's usually cheaper, and probably worth checking out. Out of all the weddings I've been to, I think my favorite food was from one that had a buffet with a carving station. People think that buffets might not be as good, but I think with so many people the savings will be a lot and the food quality almost definitely won't change at all.","name":"t1_crmo1qp","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-27 19:12:16","week":22}

But, you are also paying the going rate.\n\nWe had a similar bill and I was just shocked one day when I was paying the bills. I recall when the bill was just a fraction of this.\n\nHey, good for you!! Without sounding contrite, you are a good \"kid\".\n\nCut the cord for cable and go with Internet only. That is assuming you are not under a long contract with Comcast. \n\nYou can do Netflix, Amazon and/or Hulu along with an HD antenna. Tivo has a cheap DVR with a monthly service that is good and will give you access to all of this.\n\nFor the phone, you could just ditch the land line and go with mobile phones only (I'm guessing everyone has their own). Alternatively you could go with something like vonage (~$24/mo) and port your home number over (there is likely going to be a ~$30 charge for the porting). \n\nYou could also get a little techy and port your number over to twilio and hook up the OBi100 VoIP Telephone Adapter and Voice Service Bridge ($39.24 on Amazon) directly to your current home phone and your modem. There will be a porting fee for keeping your home number with this solution as well. For this solution, you can get Anveo Enhanced 911 for $15/year, so that Fire/EMS/Police will know where you are if a 911 call is placed.\n\nThen your entire phone bill on Twilio would be $1/month for the number and then you only pay for your usage. It's almost like having no phone bill at all.\n\nSo, conceivably you could go from ~$280/month to ~$40/mo xfinity internet, ~$5-$25/month for phone, $15/month tivo service, and whatever extras like Netflix, etc. \n\nTotal: ~$80/month + Extras like Netflix +$15/year if using Twilio/E911\n\nI also noticed that Oakland Xfinity (Concost), has a Internet Plus 50 deal that is $45, that includes local channels and Steam HBO live. So that could save you the Tivo cost for just $5 extra per month. \n\nThere are alternatives for you and a savings of ~$200/month is definitely worth looking into!

He's grown his $10 169% in a month.  You'd have to extrapolate the data out to find out what you'd expect the annual return to be, but they key to figuring that out is what is the amount of freight he has to send in to make it to where he's selling out of the last batch just as the new batch arives (or just a hair shy from it).  That would be the peak of efficiency in this case.\n\nEither way, 69% return if that's all he did for the year, it's worth it.  With unlimited funds, any return beating the pace of inflation by any amount is worth it.  When you don't have unlimited funds, which is every person in the world (it's gonna run out at some point), you basically figure out, out of all these options that I have, what can make me the most money the quickest.\n\nSome people shoot for about 10-12% for their retirement.  Some people shoot for a higher risk for higher gain, some people shoot for a lesser risk for a lesser gain.\n\nIn any case that you cut it, being able to return 15-30% in two weeks (not even a year, which is what we looked at before) will always, always be a good choice.

{"id":"crnfjck","author":"flashheatmvp3","body":"Google and find a site that will compare trade in values for multiple sites, off the top of my head slugbooks is one that compares the biggest few companies. When it comes to selling books there's a few values you want to keep in mind: how much you originally paid for it, how much it's currently going for (new and used), and how much you could receive as a trade in for cash/gift card. \n\nWhat you originally paid is just to kinda ballpark what you're hoping to get back and whether it's even worth it to put much time into selling it. Other than that just see how much sites will give you, I found it was often worth taking a slight discount on return when a site would offer me a fixed amount of cash and free shipping. \n\nThe other option is to put the book up for sale through a site that is going to take a fee, I did this one time in my first semester and never went back to it. For me the sale price after fee was not a sizable increase over regular trade in prices, and not worth the stress and hassle of paying for shipping etc. That's more the case for cheaper books though, as a textbook worth a couple hundred can be worth holding out on for a good price. \n\nAnother thing is always try to sell your books locally, best places to do this are college Facebook boards and Craigslist. Costs nothing to put an ad out there so would be stupid not to atleast have them on Craigslist while you're figuring out what else you could do with them. Best way to make a sale locally is find out what the used price is at the bookstore or Amazon, and just undercut it a little bit. Students love finding deals and this makes them feel frugal as well. \n\nTime is of the essence with textbooks as they can depreciate quickly by the school year. If a new version gets released whole you're holding out for a large sale you might be shit outa luck.\n\nAlso most often your campus buyback will have the lowest trade in value compared to sites like chegg , valorebooks, acebooks, textbooks.com etc. Sometimes if your textbooks are school specific though this may be the only place to trade in at, in that case though should be easy to find a local buyer that you just meet somewhere in between what you could sell for and what he could buy for. The reason your bookstore gives you the least is because they know it's the most convenient for you, and sometimes it's worth walking down the block and getting cash as opposed to shipping and waiting for a check.

Of the supplements that are legally available (i.e., aside from anabolic steroids) only two have been shown to have any documented (edit: documented meaningful, biologically relevant, more than minor, worthwhile in a cost-benefit perspective) effect on performance. The first is adequate protein intake and the second is supplementation with 5-10 g of creatine per day. For protein, you can get that from wherever. Foods, protein shakes, doesn't matter. Just get enough protein. \"Enough\" is debatable. By no one would argue that 1g per pound of body weight isn't enough and most would say you don't need that much (0.6-0.8 g per pound). Most people looking to build muscle though err on the side of too much, which is safe, but not the mist frugal. Creatine is dirt cheap, find the cheapest one on Amazon and take 5-10 g per day. It has been shown to give you a couple extra reps at max intensity lifting. It won't do anything for aerobic performance. And honestly, you don't need it, but if you want to take some supplement, at least take the one with some evidence. Other than that, it's all unproven broscience. Multivitamin? Maybe. Fish oil?

They probably don't understand margins and profit and selling velocity... they responded because they want to be paid to be doing what they're already doing.\n\n\n2) If they're smart... they'll keep the items that can be sold for a ton of money, and only give you the scraps.\n\n\n3) If they're not smart, they're going to waste your money.

{"id":"crnr43t","author":"jameswesleyhunt","body":"Man... I don't mean to be a Debbie-downer but you have a LONG road ahead of you. \n\n1. You are starting from ground zero. Without telling us the niche I can't gauge the competition, but I'm assuming there IS competition. That's just the internet.\n\n2. If it is a smaller niche with less competition then joining an affiliate network probably isn't going to be an option or the way to go. You might have to reach out to the manufacturers or sellers directly. This isn't that hard to do and could possibly be easier than signing up with an affiliate network based on the fact that you don't have any prior experience with affiliate sales.\n\n3. I'm not sure what you mean when you say sell branded merchandise. Being an affiliate does not require you to put a logo on anything. You're selling SOMEONE ELSE'S product, so you wouldn't put a logo on it. You can't just put a logo on someone else's product and sell it. \n\n4. You keep 90% and the brand keeps 10%? That's not going to happen. They have to make money... From experience you would generally get a 30-60% discount on product but you would have to purchase it from the seller. You can sell apparel without buying it but your margins would probably be more along the 30% range because the brand would still have to take care of shipping and hold the inventory.\n\n5. Adsense is okay, but you'll need a high traffic website. I'm not sure how familiar you are with websites and web traffic but people don't just flock to unknown websites and click on ads. Not the best game plan.\n\n6. Yes, you can use an Amazon affiliate account on multiple websites.\n\n-Here's the deal my man... Even in a perfect world where you have a low competition niche and a desirable product, you still have to build a website that ranks on the first page for your product searches. That not only means you have to RANK your page, but you have to OUTRANK your competition. From there you have to funnel people to your product and convince them to buy. It's possible, but takes time and experience. \n\n-This is not going to be a walk in the park. I would say a strong majority of the people who create an affiliate site fail. All the advertisements you see out there talking about how easy it is to make these sites and generate thousands are lying. It's no different than any other industry or business. 8 out of 10 businesses fail in the first 18 months. I would say 9 out of 10 affiliate sites fail in the first month strictly due to a lack of understanding when it comes to web development, SEO, sales, etc. \n\nWith all this being said, if this is something you REALLY want to do, then learn as much as you can and approach this with the idea that it's probably going to take you a lot longer than expected BUT could be worth it if you succeed. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions.","name":"t1_crnr43t","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-28 18:01:18","week":22}

Even taking advantage of 3 points/dollar on Kroger products, you would still only get 1.5% cashback on your purchases.

Since it seems like you're concerned about cashback, I propose you look into:\n\n* [Barclays Sallie Mae Mastercard](https://www.salliemae.com/credit-cards/sallie-mae-card/): 5% cashback on groceries, gas, and bookstores (including Amazon). Up to $250, $250, and $750 spend per month, respectively. Plus, get a $25 statement credit with your first purchase.\n* [American Express Blue Cash Everyday](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/blue-cash-everyday): 3% cashback on groceries, up to $6000 spend per year. 2% cashback on gas and department stores.\n\nThose 2 together will help maximize the cashback on your ~$400 spend per month without paying any annual fees.","name":"t1_crnvcx6","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-28 19:49:14","week":22}

And to save money on shipping, Amazon should allow customers to swing by and browse through their product selection (of course, all goods will be fully categorized by department). And as long as customers are there, they may as well sell groceries too. Now, to make sure customers pay, Amazon needs to add a series of check out counters where their friendly associates can scan and bag the purchased items. To help with transporting goods, they can include shopping carts in the front of each store, as well as a large parking lot.

I paid way less than retail, but I'm wondering what is the best way to sell these. I'm thinking that trying to sell locally might be the best, craigslist ,etc rather than eBAY or Amazon. Most of them are larger sized items , electronic items. I can't really tell on some of them if they had been opened or not. Some were clearly opened as you can tell they were taped over etc. \nAll the items are in box, for the ones that appear to be new do you think they could just be sold as new on eBAY or possibly amazon. \nAlso some of them have Amazon stickers on them, which means they were sitting at amazon for some reason and then sent back. \nOne item which has a high retail price is a subwoofer , with something like this i'm wondering if it's better to just take it out of the box and sell it as used. I got it for much less than the amazon price. Even if I could less it for 50% of the amazon price it would still be a great profit. \n\nI probably got a bit eager and was excited to buy cheap items. But hopefully I don't end up totally screwed! At least one of the items i'll probably keep because I needed them anyways.

{"id":"crocvy5","author":"aahhii","body":"This is definitely a tough situation.  It sounds like your dad wanted to be that guy for you but he couldn't.\n\nAnyways, you've been doing a great job getting through college without debt.  As someone who went through college with a shit ton of debt and not a care in the world, I respect your frugality.\n\nAt this point, all you can do is make the best of a bad situation.  Here are some options off of the top of my head.  I'm not sure if any of them will work but I hope that somewhere in here you find something to get yourself going:\n\n* Get on LinkedIn, put your degree, and see if you can intern at an engineering company.  If you can program look for remote jobs.  You def want to finish your BS degree, so don't give up on that, but a 3.4GPA in engineering ought to be able to get you some sort of part time gig.\n* On your job applications, **LIE** and give an address on campus.  Do you have friends at that school?  See if you can go that route.  I usually wouldn't recommend this to most people but you're in a tough situation and employers are more likely to give you a job if you're local.  Basically, if you wind up not going to class for the summer at least set yourself up to move there for the fall.  Employers almost never verify addresses so you if you get a job you could just tell them your address changed on the first day.  Maybe talk to a homeless shelter and see if they'll let you list it as your residence.  An alternative would be to just put a PO Box on the resume to get the application moving then make up some bullshit reason for why you have a PO Box if they ask.\n* Get on craigslist and look at listings for gigs.  If you're out in the country, chances are there are some farmers around you who will pay you $15/hr for some honest labor.  If you don't see any ads, list one.  Can you fix stuff?  Put it on there.\n* If you get a part time job, take it, no matter what.  Keep looking for ways to improve your situation, and quit as soon as you get something better.\n* Check out your nearest welfare office and see if you qualify.  If no one is claiming you as a dependent then you should be able to qualify.\n* National Guard (part time and - if you live frugally - you'll make enough to get by and actually eat something)\n* A four year stint in another branch of the military.  Could probably do the coast guard if you didn't want to near combat.\n* **RE-APPLY TODAY**.  Don't sit around and think about how much it sucks.  Get back at it as soon as you can.\n* Get loans lined up for the remainder.  Do you have anyone willing to cosign for you?\n\nAnyways, I hope this helps.  Out of curiosity, what is your major?\n\nEDIT: MORE IDEAS\n\n* If there are any UPS/Amazon distribution centers near your school, apply there ASAP.  You might wind up working nights but they pay something like $2k/year in tuition reimbursement in addition to paying like $10/hr and offering benefits.  Also, these roles usually have part-time supervisor roles which pay something like $1200 - $1400/mo. You'd likely have to start as a part-timer and you'll only get 10/20 hours a week but if you can get into a part time supervisor role (should be able to b/c of degree) it'll go a long way.  Also, this is the time of year they're ramping up for Christmas season so it is perfect time to apply.\n* Re-iterating on the loans.  You've done a great job so far of getting through college with no debt; but as an engineer you should make more than enough with a four year degree (assuming you're able to move) to cover a couple years of in-state education.  So if you can get them, just do that and focus on school and building your resume.","name":"t1_crocvy5","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-29 03:50:42","week":22}

Most of what I know has been absorbed as I've done research on incoming marketing in general.\n\nWith that caveat, your blogging platform should be whatever is easiest and convenient. From experience, if it isn't easy for you to use, you won't sit down and write because it frustrates you. Wordpress is a solid platform, with plenty of themes and plugins available for adding more functionality later on. To start, however, you'll want to avoid those nitty-gritty details and focus on just producing quality content. You can add fun widgets later.\n\nFor affiliate offers, it really just depends on what your niche is. The standard is Amazon, because they sell everything, so it actually takes some work to find a niche that they wouldn't have a product available in. For specific services and products, typically they'll be listed on the company website.\n\nBy this time next week, I'd say you should have your niche thought out (don't underestimate the importance of choosing the right niche, especially if you want to start transitioning into a product-oriented niche site later; take a solid 2 days and do some research on all the possible niches you're interested in), at least a handful of potential blog entry ideas, and at least one rough draft of a useful post. I'm ignoring the domain name and webhosting portions, because those are a bit braindead simple (though the domain name should obviously match up with your niche).\n\nSorry if that's not perfectly comprehensive, my practical experience with affiliate programs is extremely limited.

Well, vapes are newer and better every month. Online buyers are savvy and will always chase the next thing, so if you stock up on the IPV mini, you're fucked when the IPV Mini II comes out.\n\n2. High defect rate. I had to process many returns not just because of faulty hardware, but because of user error. It's a very sensitive device that needs to be handled perfectly. Some companies are good with warranties, (handled by Asmodus in California), but it will still cost a processing fee and time that will kill any profit you could make on defective units.\n\n3. DANGEROUS defects. Lately, there have been many reports of certain models that have issues with the charger or battery, causing explosions and fires. User error? Sometimes...but it's such a low margin of error that this is likely. Recently one guy burned his tongue all the way to his throat and another guy burned his garage down. Lurk in /r/electronic_cigarette if you want to find out which models...very well known established brands. *ahem* istick 50w\n\n4. Margins suck really bad. It's hard to negotiate with the manufacturers on these and even buying large quantities (100+, which can take thousands of dollars for one model) and you'll make a few bucks on it. After freight and whatnot, 10% margin would be nice.\n\n5. There are several online places which provide great service AND a killer bottom floor price. Good luck with that.\n\n6. You cannot sell this stuff on Amazon or eBay, so you must drive completely organic traffic to your website. Paid ads if you want to lose some money to get some initial traction. There are lots of people doing it on Amazon and eBay, but if you get caught, your account gets shut down.\n\n7. This market is the one I've had the most people try to scam me...I don't know if it's just the demographic (broke young kids), but yea...even when I sold on reddit I had someone try to scam me out of a $80 device.\n\n8. I've worked with many of the manufacturers, and to get a complete catalog, you'll have to work with some that are jerks and not responsive.\n\n9. Lots and lots of counterfeit products. Very hard to spot sometimes and will destroy your reputation.\n\nThat's online e-cig sales in a nutshell.

For example, I just went on to amazon.fr and they're saying I can buy a book with 1 day delivery to Scotland from France. (That said, they would try and charge GBP 9.00 for that). Amazon.de said they could deliver books in 2-3 for GBP 4.00, and didn't offer next day.  \n\nIn theory, within the EU, you load something on to a truck and just drive it over the border.

{"id":"crpal3u","author":"esmscom","body":"Hi All, First time poster.. After reading this Post, I wanted to chime in and give some concepts and terms to use for investigation purposes. Hope it helps and feel welcome to AMA. I am not an expert but I do know more then some. Hehe. (You get that more after reading below.)\nCosoarick has a great suggestion.. \"Info-Products\". A multi-Billion dollar industry.  One way to go is S.Y.O.P – (Selling You Own Products).  If you know a great deal about a topic (You just simply need to know more then other’s) you can sell your content.  Hard part comes in when you want to get your content/product to market. \n..There is a great deal of effort/work in making good, steady money from S.Y.O.P, for several reason, ex: Depending on the topic of content, it may be best to make the content available in more then one format. Ex: Text/pdf, Audio or Video. Then there is “Packaging” the content.  This would involve creating “Sales-Copy” to place on a Site (even a one page Site) or on a Sales-Listing on Amazon or where-ever... and it’s highly recommended to create an image of what the Product would look like.. you know.. your Book… nothing like being able to judge a cover right.! An EBook-cover or Graphics helps sell the book along with the right title.. Got to be able to present the Content as though it’s tangible..  and then making the content accessible through E-Commerce.  Learning curves yes.. but there is “Info”-Products out there to learn to do all of this. – Now to make more sales faster with your product.. figure out how to have affiliates sell your product for you. Just pay the affiliates on time and everybody wins.\nThen, there is  S.O.P.P = (Selling Other People's Products). Other-wise known as Info-Product Affiliates. Yes, there are Software affiliates to.. they both do the same thing.. get traffic to a sales page and make a commission per each sale.  This is a good way to start out making a few dollars to earn capital to take this type business model to the next level.  The down side to S.O.P.P is.. if you have no money to pay for Ads then you must have a “LIST” of people interested in the niche or Topic of the content to send your Sale-Page to in order for people to buy it.,..\nIf you haven’t hear this term … The Money Is In The LIST… then, if you dig deeper into this business model.. you run into it at every turn. With-out this one thing .. A List .. this business model sits and collects digital dust.\nIf you have question about.. feel welcome to message me and I can assist personally.. if not and you just have general questions.. post them and I’ll do my best to answer.\nWell. I hope this helped someone and peaked some interest. Have a Great Day.\n","name":"t1_crpal3u","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-29 23:37:52","week":22}

{"id":"crpf0ic","author":"ninjajpbob","body":"Hey there, thank you so much for doing this. How long do we have to ask you questions?\n\nEdit - The questions:\n\nIs the format a standard that is generally bound to work, or have writers gotten away with doing things differently?\n\nHow much do you show in a story preview on Amazon?\n\nHow much do you charge per story, or per length?\n\nHow do you deal with ... running out of ideas? Do most problems arise from being too fixated on something?\n\nMy so has told me to write a book, but all I have are a bunch of short stories, and I also feared that the market was saturated, or that someone would just buy and copy paste the stories and then that was that for that story (not to sound arrogant or anything, just generally speaking).\n\nIs it ok to \"update\" stories, or are they set in stone?  I'm ok with noting and logging what changes have been made to buyers who were satisfied with the current version, etc.\n\nWhat are some taboos of this field of writing, especially since you're using Amazon (and are subject to their ideas of writing or god knows what)? Are there any limits with what you can write about, or is there always just someone for something? Who is underserved in this market? \n\nEdit 3: I've been reading through your AMA and have received some answers to my questions, sorry about glossing over those. \n\nThat's all I have for now. Thank you once again. Let me know if I can PM you or *gulp* get feedback on anything. I know what you mean by not having anyone read your work, haha. \n\nI also apologize if I sound entitled to anything, I'm just taking my chances. \n\nE2: Are there any limits to using Pen Names? Is it all good so long as you aren't \"scamming\" someone or what have you? Do you need to make separate accounts? \n\nHow do you obtain the pictures for your ebook covers?

{"id":"crpfe4e","author":"Krizzen","body":"Yep, that's where it's at.\n\nI also do Amazon's A9 data collection HIT. I believe it's for some computer vision project, but you basically you just download the A9 Data Collection app on Android, then take up to 5 pictures of an object from various angles and get paid $0.07/picture ($0.35/object). If you have a lot of things on the list, you can easily hit $12/hr. The downside is you'll likely exhaust the list of objects pretty quickly, but the upside is it replenishes daily. I've done some objects 3-4 times, like a 2-slice toaster, headphones, computer keyboard. I mean, some are just dead simple.

No time limit as long as you don't mind waiting while I sleep or eat or write.\n\nFormat can be played with a bit, but most ereaders take your text and give them a font that can be played with by the reader.\n\nI charged $2.99 per story regardless of length. \n\nI don't really run out of ideas. I take a few kinks, and find a way to make them work together. BDSM + Impregnation? Okay, a billionaire impregnates his secretary. Or she's forcibly impregnated by a stranger. Oh, how about Football + Gay! The players fuck. The players fuck a reporter. The players fuck the coach. The players fuck a fan. Etc. A little bit of repetition is bound to happen, but that's fine because people want the kinks. They don't care if it's original.\n\nAlso, it's surprisingly rare to have stories stolen. Just publish your shorts, seriously.\n\nYou can update stories, though readers who bought the previous version will not get the new version. New readers will, though.\n\nDon't write pedo, don't write about real animals (werewolves are okay if they're in human form, not transformed. Dogs are never okay), don't write obvious rape. Dubcon is okay as long as it isn't mentioned in blurb or title. \n\nNo one is really underserved in this market, but these books aren't going to become someone's favorite that they read 100 times. They're throwaway, so any saturation of the market is only for a certain amount of time. In a few months, they'll want billionaires again. \n\nI can't do feedback on stories for legal reasons, but feel free to shoot me a PM if you have more questions!\n\nFor your edit, there's no limit to pen names. Just search Amazon to make sure your name isn't exactly the same as someone else's. Pen names are chosen while uploading the book, so they can be uploaded on the same Amazon account.\n\nI use Dollar Photo Club for my stock, but I also recommend Deposit Photos and IngImage. DPC is a dollar each, the others have credit packages you can get for cheap. Some stock photo sites also have free trials.

I'm not really familiar with the entry level db tools. There are some open source ones out there, but check Amazon SimpleDB. Or DynamoDB.\n\n2. Do you have existing data you need to migrate?

Do you have data that needs to be encrypted? Like Passwords, payment info, PHI, etc?\n\n5. Do you need to export data to Word, Excel, or PDF?\n\nI am speculating here, but if you don't have a lot of experience with databases you may better off starting out with Access, stabilizing your model, and the evaluating private vs public cloud options.","name":"t1_crpik29","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-05-30 03:57:40","week":22}

{"id":"crpjv9o","author":"ninjajpbob","body":"&gt; You have forever to ask me questions! No time limit as long as you don't mind waiting while I sleep or eat or write.\n&gt;\n\nThanks for letting me know! Haha, of course. Poor George R. Martin is only allowed to take a leak.\n \n&gt; Format can be played with a bit, but most ereaders take your text and give them a font that can be played with by the reader.\n&gt; \n\nI see. What I meant to say was the way you set up the story, with the meeting, sex, and ending, and if those could be altered in length.\n\n&gt; Also, it's surprisingly rare to have stories stolen. Just publish your shorts, seriously.\n&gt; \n\nWow, thank you for being upfront about that. They're half or a third or what you've recommended and just get straight to the sex, so I guess I should lengthen them a bit.\n\n&gt; Don't write pedo, don't write about real animals (werewolves are okay if they're in human form, not transformed. Dogs are never okay), don't write obvious rape. Dubcon is okay as long as it isn't mentioned in blurb or title.\n&gt; \n\nOh god no. Thanks for the werewolf idea, though, that'll definitely be fun to work with. I was stupid to not realize that people who had \"conservative\" views probably wouldn't be looking for erotica of sorts in the first place and thus wouldn't criticize you unless you made a book as pervasive as 50 shades. \n\nHmm. What would you define as obvious rape, since you gave an example of being \"forcibly impregnated by a stranger\"? Do you mean rape in it's terms of asserting dominance and power over someone and not based on some typical sexual fantasy, and with the person constantly protesting it? I'm sorry, I'm just not exactly sure. \n\n&gt; I can't do feedback on stories for legal reasons, but feel free to shoot me a PM if you have more questions!\n\nI realize that would be a concern. Are there any other legal things that we should know about, or is it a pretty smooth process overall (it sure seems like it)? I appreciate it! I guess I'll reply to your comment here and then message if a week goes by, since I'm assuming it's the same ordeal. Unless you want PM's from now on if that's easier to work with. \n\nThe following below is read, duly noted, appreciated, and would probably have generic and expected responses to them:\n\n&gt; I charged $2.99 per story regardless of length.\n&gt; I don't really run out of ideas. I take a few kinks, and find a way to make them work together. BDSM + Impregnation? Okay, a billionaire impregnates his secretary. Or she's forcibly impregnated by a stranger. Oh, how about Football + Gay! The players fuck. The players fuck a reporter. The players fuck the coach. The players fuck a fan. Etc. A little bit of repetition is bound to happen, but that's fine because people want the kinks. They don't care if it's original.\n&gt; You can update stories, though readers who bought the previous version will not get the new version. New readers will, though.\n&gt; No one is really underserved in this market, but these books aren't going to become someone's favorite that they read 100 times. They're throwaway, so any saturation of the market is only for a certain amount of time. In a few months, they'll want billionaires again.\n&gt; I use Dollar Photo Club for my stock, but I also recommend Deposit Photos and IngImage. DPC is a dollar each, the others have credit packages you can get for cheap. Some stock photo sites also have free trials. A good cover is 99% of what gets a sale, so they're very important.\n&gt; For your edit, there's no limit to pen names. Just search Amazon to make sure your name isn't exactly the same as someone else's. Pen names are chosen while uploading the book, so they can be uploaded on the same Amazon account.","name":"t1_crpjv9o","subreddit":"beermoney","subreddit_id":"t5_2s5or","created_utc":"2015-05-30 04:43:09","week":22}

{"id":"crpl74e","author":"mikered30","body":"Would the HOA be against a portable AC or mini split?  I can see why they wouldnt like the look of the window AC, but the portable AC exhaust sits in the window, and doesn't hang out, and the plastic retainer piece can be spray painted to match the window color.  I suppose to ask them permission would be to seek denial. Do any of your neighbors have portable ACs that you can tell?  They are pretty loud, so it would be something that is run during the day and shut off at night, especially in such a small room.  The newer ones supposedly self evaporate, the first gen ones had a bucket of water you had to empty daily.  They can be expensive, so that really doesn't fit in with the frugal aspect of this sub.  Mini splits are quite expensive.\n\nAlso, blackout curtains would not work, by the time the light hits the curtains, the heat is already in the house. Foam Insulation or foil backed bubble wrap, spray painted to match the color of the blinds/curtains may be the best, taped tight to the window, but no light can enter.  Tinting may work, but insulation would be the cooler idea.\n\nHave him buy moisture wicking/ventilated sheets, something with a poly cotton blend with a low thread count and maybe a thin comforter made of the same material.  Also, a bedfan may solve his issues, it is a fan that sits or tucks under the mattress at the end of the bed and blows air up the top sheet.  Amazon carries it.\n\nDoes your son have a thyroid issue or health problem (weight) that makes him want to sleep so cold?  \n\nAlso, if the air flow from the vents are weak to the second floor, you can add an inline duct booster or shut off vents in unused rooms.  \n\nI really like the idea of the solar screens, but adding the foam insulation board is much cheaper.

They are only useful when someone is in there. \n\nIf his room is a lot hotter than the rest of the house, the ac system likely either isn't balanced or there may be air leaking from the duct to his room. Depending on how handy you are, you can do this or hire someone. Go in your attic and make sure the duct isn't collapsed anywhere (like someone stepped on it) and double check all connections between the vent in his room and the main place it splits off from. In a hot attic, you should be able to feel air leaking easily. If you do, get some foil tape (not duct tape) and wrap it like crazy. \n\nIf non of that works, you can get a duct fan pretty cheap (Amazon has them for around $25) that forces more of the air into his room. You basically disconnect the duct near his vent, but the fan inline and connect a new piece of duct the rest of the way. You may need an ac guy here, but if you are handy you can do it. \n\nOne last though, consider getting a solar screen on the windows to his room. Those things help a ton. It may not be the most ascetically pleasing thing though. Blackout curtains would be a good second choice if you don't want to do the screen.

{"id":"crr3nsc","author":"redcards","body":"I've worked part-time at Best Buy while I'm in school, and during the summers I intern on the buyside as a fundamental research analyst (now going into my senior year). So for me, working at Best Buy was exciting both because I enjoy sales and was able to round out that particular skill set, but also because I was very curious to get an \"inside\" look at how the company operated at the store level. \n\nUnsurprising to me, I was able to come away from my time there with a very bearish view on the company. I'll try to summarize some of my key takeaways. FWIW - none of this, I believe, comes from proprietary knowledge that I shouldn't be mixing with an investment angle. Also, I believe my store could be considered one of the better Best Buys based on the expertise of the managers and salesmen I worked with as well as some of the development strategies we used for new people, so for all of these points think worse for your typical Best Buy. \n\n* **Unmotivated Sales Force** This is probably the biggest issue I think the company has. For the average Best Buy salesmen developing the necessary knowledge for the products in your department takes some time, and when you actually start to know what you're talking about it feels really good to sell a customer and move a product. What doesn't feel good is not earning commission on those sales. There were a lot of times where I would spend an hour+ with a customer and move $5k+ of product for one sale (and in computers, that was a lot), but I still only earned $9/hr. Best Buy justifies their lack of commission with a \"bonus pool\" that is shared among EVERYONE in your department if they beat their high water mark for the quarter. So if you have 2-3 really great salesmen who are driving most of the sales, EVERYONE in the department earns an equal slice of that bonus. Our managers would encourage everyone to work hard so that everyone would earn a bonus...I can say that this just doesn't work like that. Its pure capitalism - people are only going to work extra hard if the pay off comes directly back to them, not someone else. \n\n* **Store Level Management** You know the scene in Office Space where Peter Gibbons tells the Bobs about how he has multiple different bosses that harass him? Thats what Best Buy is like. Each department has a \"Lead\" and then a \"Supervisor\", so thats two right there. Then you have your GM, and then the Supervisors and Leads for every other department who are all equally capable of telling you what to do and giving you a hard time. Like Peter, I would sometimes work hard enough just to not be bothered. That doesn't include the one day where I wore the wrong color undershirt under my Best Buy shirt and heard about it multiple times from every manager in the store. Also, and this relates back to the above point, because employees' sales are tracked on various different metrics, you are checked at the end of each shift by a manager that you achieved your sales goals for the day. If you don't meet them, you get reprimanded. This does not make a lot of sense to me since no one earns commission, so these metrics don't really matter. \n\n* **Price Matching** Price matching is a great thing Best Buy implemented, but you won't always get it. Especially for Amazon, you will only get a price match if you can show the product on Amazon is the exact make and model as the one in Best Buy, and it also has to be shipped AND sold by Amazon. On top of that, I was repeatedly denied price matching Amazon on various products because our store would have taken too large of a margin hit. That was the most incredibly stupid thing I had ever heard a store manager say. Sometimes I thought my managers were more concerned about the P&amp;L than the financial analysts at Best Buy corporate. \n\n* **Best Buy Credit Card** I hate this thing. It exists only as a tool to drive sales. If you are with a customer who put together a $2k basket but they can't afford it, just whip out the credit card application and tell them they won't have to pay interest for 6/12/18 months and they're sold. Plus, it literally takes 5 minutes to apply and be approved for, and you can use it for that sale right away without waiting. I maybe only ever did two card applications because I felt I was doing the customer a disservice, especially since my store was in a low income area. The idea of the credit card is to encourage repeat shoppers, but I hardly ever saw anyone signed up for a card come back on a regular basis. Nor did I really ever see Best Buy cards used to pay. \n\n* **Geek Squad** 100% profit. \n\nSo those are just a few things that I took away from the business that I didn't like. I'm happy to answer any follow ups about anything I mentioned or didn't mention. \n\n**Bottom-Line** - Best Buy's principle problem lies at the salesmen level. Customers would rather come in to Best Buy and look at a product and then go home and order it off Amazon than deal with the typical, uneducated, Best Buy salesmen.
