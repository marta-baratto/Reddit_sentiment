{"id":"3s2uyf","author":"dnale0r","body":"The official story about the instamine: https://dashdot.io/alpha/?page_id=118\n\n&gt;Evan Duffield:“The instamine happened, there is no one disputing that fact. The crypto-community at large has no problem with this except a few who think it’s trying to be hidden in some way. In fact, I posted multiple times about the instamine, first in “The Birth Of Darkcoin” which is an account of the first few weeks of the launch and the mistakes that were made. Recently I also posted spoke about the Instamine in the video “Virtual Corporation”, which considers the concept that it might have been key to Dash’s success, which I believe now.\n\n\n&gt;It’s also important to note, I was working a very challenging day job while working on Dash in the first couple weeks. So I was putting out fires every night, keeping tabs on Dash during the day (while getting yelled at by my boss when he caught me a couple times). Eventually I quit when I got Dash stable enough to work on full time and decided I really wanted to explore what I could do with it. “\n\n\n---\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it was a planned instamine. This wasn't mentioned before launch. \n\nThe features of this coin were also not public at launch.\n\n=&gt; Nobody was really interested in the coin at launch, making this instamine more a kind of \"stealth launched premine\". In my books, that's a scam. Please don't ignore the facts:\n\n**2013-12-29**: http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg03557.html\n&gt;2 guys from Hawk Financial Group, Evan &amp; Kyle, are asking on the Bitcoin Dev mailing list for \"1 or 2 really good C++ programmer that is familiar with the bitcoin internals to help with a for-profit startup\". They are planning to build a unique coin that is \"not just a clone of the original Bitcoin code\" but in stead \"a merge-mined altcoin that will provide a very useful service to the whole crypto-coin ecosystem\". They claim to have \"detailed plans on how to implement it\".\n\n**2014-01-18**: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg4596809#msg4596809\n&gt;There were some issues at launch, so Evan said he would postpone the launch and would \"definitely not\" launch it in the next hours. But he did launch it a few hours later.\n\n**2014-01-19**: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/block.dws?000007d91d1254d60e2dd1ae580383070a4ddffa4c64c2eeb4a2f9ecc0414343.htm\n&gt;Xcoin was launched. This was the emission in the first 72 hours of the coins existence:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/fef5818649a839bb091c29e8b3722b7e.png\nThis was the emission of the first 100 days:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/3acc6ea5d90db13e51d95dac0e4b8fa2.png\n\n&gt;At the moment, there are about 6 million DASH in circulation. There would be 84 million Xcoins eventually. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg4588082#msg4588082)\nNote that in the first hour, 500k Xcoins were mined. Due to the \"quick fix\" of the bug, not many people expected to launch a few hours after Evan said he would \"definitely not\" launch in the next hours.\n\n**2014-01-19**: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg4594074#msg4594074\n&gt;Right after the launch, there were problems with the window binaries. Evan clearly was mining right from the start, as he offered 5000 Xcoin as a bounty for compiling the binaries.\n\n**2014-01-20**: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg4629218#msg4629218\n&gt;After the emission of almost 2 million coins, Evan said that \"now that everything is stable, I'll be posting later about the vision of this project and milestones!\". Up until this point, only the \"X11 hashing algoritm\" was a known feature. According to him, it was \"time to move on to actually implementing what I set out to do\".\n\n**2014-01-22**: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg4654183#msg4654183\n&gt;Evan releases his plans for XCoin. At this point, more than 2 million coins were mined.\n\n&gt;Xcoin rebranded to Darkcoin and eventually to DASH later on.\n\n---\n\nLater on, some contradictions surfaced:\n\n* The emission schedule changed multiple times. The latest we heard is that the number of coins would be somewhere between 14 million and like 16 million DASH. (https://youtu.be/wIvcQIdSbIY?t=9m)\n* Evan said that this project was just a hobby he started while working on a full time job and coded Xcoin in a weekend. (https://youtu.be/wIvcQIdSbIY?t=9m17s)\n* Evan claims there were hundreds of miners if not thousands when Xcoin launched. (https://youtu.be/x5sNx7SMTP8?t=3m39s)\nRecent investigation showed that there were 124 IP addreses that were mining at the start. 115 of those addresses where Cloudhosting and Dedicated Servers, 9 of them seem to be private/users.106 of them were at Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud instances. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1220064.msg12781520#msg12781520)\n\n---\n\nConclusions:\n\n* Evan isn't acting alone, he had/has a team behind him right from the start. It wasn't a hobby. he had a plan to make a profit.\n\n* Evan had plans for his coin right from the start, but didn't release them until after the instamine\n\n* 1.5 million coins were mined in the first 8 hours. Most of these coin ended up in his (and his friends) hands. It's very likely the 500k in the first hour were only mined by him with cloudhosting services.\n\n* He lowered the emission later on, to make his relative share of coins bigger.\n\n\nHow can this be all an accident (like Evan is always saying) and NOT be intentional?\nEvan was looking for c++ devs for a \"for profit startup\" at the end of 2013 for the launch of an altcoin.\n\n**Question**:\n&gt;How can you make a profit by launching an altcoin (and be sure to be able to pay your devs)?\n\n**Answer**: \n&gt;by premining and/or instamining.\n\nHow he did it is pretty easy:\n\n* telling people the release would definitely not be in the next couple of hours and after that do launch it a few hours later\n\n* buggy windows binaries\n\n* a \"code error\" creating 500k coins in the first hour, &gt;1.5 million in the first 8 hours.\n\n\n**=&gt; DASH was clearly a planned premine/instamine.**\n","name":"t3_3s2uyf","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","created_utc":"2015-11-09 02:50:19","week":46}
{"id":"3s31ah","author":"eagle3y3z","body":"I just wanted to write an update on what I'm doing now and sharing my noob experience so far.\n\nMy first sale a month ago about my ventures into the entrepreneur world can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3oavyu/i_just_sold_my_1st_ever_item_ever/)\n\nTl;DR Without any kind of promotion on Amazon, I sold my first ebook.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter selling my first ebook through Amazon, I did a free 5 day promotion afterwards. My suspicions were confirmed. I received around ~400 downloads by the time promotion was done. A slight little bump of traffic (10 or so) to my website and NO EMAILS. That was my entire goal of putting it on Amazon in the first place. I considered it a failure of a promotion. No emails to me meant no future sales. Also out of all 400 downloads, no reviews. The free promotion was for the emails, traffic, and social proof of reviews. Mission failed on all levels.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next day after promotion was finished, I received 2 sales. WAT?!? Promotion is done. I didn't even come close to cracking the top 100 free or paid kindle list (A snowball effect occurs once you crack the top 100 list). Why is this happening? The next day 1 sale. Huh?! What's going on?!? This book is for 4.99! Why are people paying for this with no reviews?!? This kept going on for about a couple days straight of 1 sometimes 2 sales. Then zero sales for 4 days straight. All's right with the world. I couldn't understand why people were buying my book. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen a miracle happened 2 5-star reviews came through praising my book! YES! The \"drought\" of no sales finally ended after that. I kept getting 1 sale and then 0 sales almost every other day. I was still busy with school to look more in-depth on why this was happening.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUp until last week sales changed. Still no promotion. Focusing on school work. I check my reports and 3 units sold! That's a new record! Once again why was this happening? The next day zero sales. Ok cool. The day after that 4 sales!! WHAT?! In the same week I broke my record of sales. How?! Then the day after a record day 0 sales. This is not making sense.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's until near the end of this weekend.  I have sold 2-3 books every day for the past 4 days! I needed to get to the bottom of this and figure out what was happening.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI go log onto my website and check my traffic about 2-3 visitors per day during this entire month of my ebook being on amazon. Nothing but bots probably. Look onto my facebook page. I automated it to post images and there seems to be one guy liking some of the posts (THANKS one guy!). Clearly FB wasn't the reason (20 likes). Pinterest? Nope (40 followers). Twitter? Nope (30 followers). Instagram? That's one site over this entire month that I have been consistently been putting images on and it's being well received. Last month I was about at 60 something followers. Now I'm at 730+ and counting. Based solely on numbers I conclude instagram being the #1 reason behind these sales. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's when I remembered my bit.ly links that I had.In each of my social media profiles and website, I included a unique bit.ly link to track which one was generating more clicks. Not surprisingly instagram had the most clicks. I tested my bit.ly links several times and bit.ly does not discriminate against your clicks. I checked each link at least 10-15 times on mobile and desktop to make sure it was working and bit.ly counted all my clicks. Since last month, instagram alone has accumulated 40 clicks with my clicks counted! 40-15= 25. 25 people clicked on the link to see my ebook. That may not sound like much but here's where it gets interesting. I only sold 22 books.  22/25 bought my book. 88% conversion rate. How the hell?!?! Even if not all of them bought the book, amazon has the kindle unlimited plan where people borrow your book and you get paid per page (spotify for authors). 1300 pages were read. According to kindle algorithm my book was 97 pages long. So that's 14 books people have borrowed (1300/97). So there is a HUGE chance that 100% of people who clicked on my instagram bit.ly link, came to pay or borrow my book. Another interesting tidbit. Out of 33 instagram posts only 3 posts \"hard sold\" for the ebook. One was when the book was for free during the promotion. The other was asking for reviews while the promotion was happening. Then the last one was when I hit 500 followers. I obviously need to dive deeper into this to increase sales.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Room for Improvement:**\n\nFacebook ads and Google ads (maybe):\nIf I'm doing numbers like this with no promotion, I can only imagine with an actual promotion. How do I replicate this onto my other social media accounts? I now have a little bit more funds to experiment with ads and I want to go 100% through with it. A month ago with $1 on fb ads I was able to get likes, shares and one email, but I wasn't comfortable with the results. Stopped it all together. Maybe it was luck. Facebook gave my ads a relevance 10 out of 10 so surely with more funds I can truly measure and optimize results.Facebook I know is very pay to play now to get your page/posts seen. I'm no longer going to seek likes to my fb page and posts, instead focus on optimizing my ads for website clicks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTwitter and Pinterest Improvement\n\nIs anyone a Twitter and Pinterest \"expert\"? I'm 20 years old and I can't for the life of me figure out how to get a following or work on those even though I read a lot about it. I figured out instagram to an extent but twitter and pinterest? Nope! I understand interacting and reach out to your audience but what specifics strats do you all use? Instagram is much simpler. You just like a couple pics of an account. Leave a comment (simple compliment is fine). Hit follow button. Done. Pinterest and Twitter? No idea and as a result very little time invested in it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBlogger Outreach\n\nI wasted so much time with this. My niche deals with cooking. Naturally I was going to focus on mommy and daddy bloggers (nowadays they're called 'lifestyle bloggers'). Little did I know they charge a LOT. Bloggers with 5k followers charge $100+ for a sponsored post and/or shoutout. Most do not accept any guest post whatsoever and state it. Bummer. Warning to businesses actually targeting small bloggers, look at their engagements. Often times I'd see these 5k followers get 30-40 comments per post! That $100 might be worth the investment if it's receiving that much engagement. Right? WRONG! I clicked on every single comment and %99.99 of the comments were from other mommy bloggers with a link to their website in their profile. I believe they were commenting for link building purposes. Check their twitter and instagram as well. They will upload their new post and retweet another mommy blogger post with a compliment. All of these 5k mommy blogger posts receive zero favs and retweets. They do well in the likes on instagram but receive hardly any comments. Pinterest, no idea how successful they are but I'd imagine the same thing occurs. The 10k+ followers is where true interaction happens. Too bad many of those bloggers signed up with agencies that you have to email and they charge a fortune! Don't even think about a guest post. I didn't even consider the 100k+ bloggers at that point. I'm still not going to give up on influencer marketing because there is true potential in it and I know why they charge what they charge. Still going to be on the lookout for bloggers who I can establish relationships with for a reduced price and have targeted good engagement mainly (unicorn basically).\n\nA lot to be done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR Still a wantrepreneur making noob mistakes...but I sold some more books and got room to grow.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n","name":"t3_3s31ah","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-09 03:39:02","week":46}

{"id":"3s3roj","author":"Going-For-Broke","body":"The following is the musing of a reseller that is for all practical purposes wet behind the ears, but desires to contribute to the flipper community as a whole:\n\n\nI guess I realized that I had the merchant bug back in the day while playing the few console games that had the option of buying and reselling items, like the Torneko Taloon Adventure game. And then there was World of Warcraft. While the rest of my guild mates spent their downtime PvPing, questing, crafting and alting until our major weekend raids, I found myself running my auctioneer alt. I enjoyed learning the different markets on the auction house and making a killing by buying low and selling high. It was hands down my favorite part of the game.\n\n\nI dabbled in trying to buy low and sell high on eBay long before Amazon was a major player. And while I had some success back then, I just did not have the financial capital to make a serious effort at being a reseller. I was also probably too impulsive and immature to make it happen at that time.\n\n\nFast forward ten years.\n\n\nI’m a little more mature and steady these days. But I still have a risky streak in me and a thirst to flip items. It’s a high for me on some level.\n\n\nI made about $300.00 reselling items in about half a month. And while that may sound like pennies on the dollar to many of you, it is a step forward in the right direction. It is progress.\n\n\nAnd progress is not always easy. Most of the time it is not. Progress and experience will take turns beating you about the head with a stick. But we take something away from each of those brow beatings. And if we apply what we learn from said beatings, we will find our path as a reseller a little straighter, a little narrower and perhaps a little easier on down the road.\n\n\nIf you are a new reseller or an old reseller, let me encourage you. Things will be tough. But the more you learn and the more mistakes you make, you will be made better for. You will take that wisdom and knowledge and later turn it into profit. So don’t give up. Get back up on your horse.

From there on, you can pair products together based on your margins and ultimately what your customers want. Keep track of this list and adjust as necessary so you can see what is working and what isn’t.\n\n---\n*Decide whether to cross-sell, upsell or bundle.* Remember to only upsell items that will add value to the customer experience AND/OR your customer when they are presented. Consider multiple ways of combining your products based on how customers use them – Amazon does this with such flair it would make anyone’s head spin. Also consider nudges that aren’t related to upselling, but can push customers to make a bigger purchase – examples include personalized service, freebies and aspects of social proof. (90% of people buy these items together, etc)\n\n---\n*Determine how to do it.* The most common way to upsell is during the conversion process: at the signup stage, checkout stage, or payment stage. You must strike a balance, too: if you bombard customers with promotional messages at the wrong time, you will just turn them off. \n\n---\n[Click here for the whole post with pictures](http://helprace.com/blog/is-it-possible-to-upsell-and-make-customers-happy)","name":"t3_3s47jk","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-11-09 10:52:01","week":46}

{"id":"3s5e7m","author":"micahhorner","body":"You may have read the story of how my partner, Donald, and I launched a profitable business in 2 months:\n\n[Vicky Virtual Receptionists: Idea to Profit in 2 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/30u0yo/vicky_virtual_receptionists_idea_to_profit_in_2/)\n\nWe launched on January 1st of this year, and are closing in on 1 year of being in business at the end of next month.\n\nWhile we haven’t necessarily had mind-blowing, record-breaking growth, we grew our little startup into a 6 figure/year business with nothing more than a few hundred bucks, and a ton of hard work.\n\nOver the past year, we’ve learned a few, really important lessons the hard way that I think might be useful to you, no matter where you are in your entrepreneurial journey.\n\nHere are the top 10 most important lessons we learned:\n\n**1. The importance of Long-Term AND Short-Term Thinking**\n\nWhile reading *[Scaling Up](http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits/dp/0986019526)* by Verne Harnish, the biggest realization I had is that we were spending way too much time on dealing with immediate concerns and putting out fires on a day-to-day basis, and not nearly enough time focusing on the long-term strategy and health of our company.\n\nAs the leader of your company, you are the person responsible for the vision and strategy, while also making sure the business is executing every day and making money.\n\nGary Vaynerchuk refers to this as “[Clouds and Dirt](https://medium.com/@garyvee/youre-focusing-on-the-wrong-stuff-543aed6168e5)“. Disregard everything in-between.\n\nRegrettably, it wasn’t until just a month or two ago where we got serious about defining the following;\n\n* Who we are as a company\n* What our core values and higher purpose are\n* What our competitive advantage and long-term strategy is\n\nWe also took the time to figure out:\n\n* How much money we’re going to need over the next year to fund our growth\n* What our plan is for how to handle the growth logistically\n* What roles we’re going to need to fill and, what their functions will be\n\nWe used the free [Growth Tools](https://gazelles.com/g/one-page-tools) provided on the Scaling Up website to guide us.\n\nBefore doing this, we had our heads in the dirt, and didn’t take the time to stick our heads into the clouds nearly enough.\n\nThis is the type of long-term planning that prevents the avoidable problems that wipe out so many startups.\n\nWe did a very good job of executing on solving the problem we set out to solve, and that made our customers happy. However, we realized we didn’t really know *why* we were doing any of this in the first place, what our potential weaknesses were, or where we wanted to end up in 5–10 years.\n\nWe were focused 100% on the immediate concerns, which lead to us being blind to foreseeable and avoidable problems.\n\n**Processes**\n\nThe one thing we did do right is document and make processes out of everything we were doing.\n\nWhen it comes to administrative tasks, we don’t memorize anything. We create a process. Not only does this save a ton of time when we have to repeat a task, but it greatly reduces the chance of making a mistake or forgetting a step.\n\nThe first time we do something, we write it out step-by-step so that, as we grow, we can quickly hire people and plug them directly into a role.\n\nWe had a thorough training process for our employees from day 1, which allows us to get a new receptionist fully trained, proficient, and independent on the phone in a fraction of the time of a typical call center employee.\n\nUltimately, our goal as co-founders is to make ourselves completely obsolete and irrelevant to the day-to-day operation of the business, so that we are focusing all of our time and energy on high-level, high-leverage tasks that only we can do.\n\nIf someone else *can* do it, they *should* be doing it.\n\nMy favorite quote from *Scaling Up* is:\n\n&gt; “Every business is more valuable to the degree that it does not depend on its top leader.”\n\nThis stuff takes a lot of time to do at first, but I promise you, it will save you exponential amounts of time and energy in the long run. All of the daily “how do I do this?” questions have been virtually eliminated, and everyone knows exactly where to go to get answers and instructions to almost any question they might have, which frees Donald and I up to focus on more important tasks.\n\nOne important thing to note is the difference between processes and policies.\n\nEasily repeatable processes enable you to scale quickly.\n\nPolicies often end up being nothing more than red tape that slows you down.\n\n**2. The importance of having a “North Star”**\n\n[Here](https://trello.com/b/vmXT5y58/core-values-mission-and-vision-statement) is our Trello board where we nailed down our Core Values, our higher purpose, and our long-term goal as a company.\n\nLike I said in point #1, we knew the “how” and “what” of the business, but not the “why”.\n\nAside from surviving and making money, we really had no clue why we were doing what we were doing.\n\nWithout a higher purpose for your business, a “North Star” to guide you, you are going to wander around in circles, and never end up really going anywhere.\n\nEven worse, you are going to eventually burn out and become miserable. At a certain point, money alone isn’t going to be fulfilling. Your new business will become just an endless list of tasks and headaches to deal with, and it will feel like the job that you hated that drove you to start a business in the first place.\n\nMy advice, no matter how cliche, is to chase something that makes a real difference in the world; something ambitious and important, that guides all of your daily decisions. Something your company can unite around and feel good about working toward.\n\nNot only are you going to be happier, but so will your employees. This has the additional benefit of increasing retention, and will lead to more productivity, happier customers, and increased revenue.\n\nProfit isn’t enough. You need a higher purpose, both for your business, and yourself.\nFor us, this higher purpose is to do our part to help small businesses and entrepreneurs succeed.\n\nOur goal is to turn callers into lifelong customers of the businesses we serve. This has the additional benefit of not only keeping our clients in business, but it also helps them provide for their families, and take care of the other people they employ.\n\nSmall businesses drive the economy and literally help millions of people put food on the table. By supporting small businesses, we enable them to do more good in the world.\n\nBy taking their phone calls, we give our clients back their time, reduce their stress level, and enable them to focus on the high-leverage tasks that grow their businesses.\n\nWhatever your business does, figure out the higher purpose you can serve, and then communicate this with your customers, and the people in your organization.\n\nMake sure that each person in your company knows exactly how their job contributes to this overall goal and vision.\n\nAdditional reading: [Why Businesses That Are Purpose-Driven Come Out on Top\n](http://www.inc.com/ed-zitron/why-businesses-that-are-purpose-come-out-on-top.html)\n\n**3. The importance of Happiness**\n\nHappy Employees = Awesome Customer Service\n\nAwesome Customer Service = Happy Customers\n\nHappy Customers = Vocal Advocates Who Market For You\n\nVocal Advocates Who Market For You = Reduced Marketing Costs and Increased Revenue\n\nIt’s really that simple.\n\n**Happiness = Success**\n\nMore than that, creating a happy company culture will guarantee that you love going to work every day, and will forever be proud of the company you’ve built.\n\nMake happiness a core part of your business. That means doing the research into what actually makes employees happy, engaged and motivated.\n\nHere’s a hint: it starts with having a higher purpose, and has little to do with money.\n\nIf you don’t trust me, trust Zappos CEO [Tony Hsieh](http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/160941280X), who [sold](http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/21/smallbusiness/amazon_acquisitions/) his company to Amazon for almost 1 billion dollars.\n\nHe didn’t get to that point by focusing on the money. The money was merely a side-effect of focusing on happiness, and Zappos’ higher purpose.\n\n&gt; “Chase the vision, not the money; the money will end up following you.”\n&gt; — Tony Hsieh, CEO, Zappos\n\n**4. The importance of Actually Caring**\n\nThis is one of our most important [Core Values](https://trello.com/b/vmXT5y58/core-values-mission-and-vision-statement) at Vicky Virtual.\n\nEverywhere you look, you see people and companies doing the bare minimum to get by. Passion is an extremely rare and limited resource.\n\nHow do you gain passion?\n\nYou guessed it; having a higher purpose. This is how you supercharge your organization.\n\nIt’s sort of hard to explain what it means to actually care to someone who doesn’t.\n\nTo us, it means going the extra mile for yourself and those around you, taking pride in what you do, working hard, achieving great things, and creating a life you can look back on and be proud of.\n\nIf the passion isn’t there, you might as well pack up and go home.\n\nNever hire someone who is dispassionate, and who doesn’t actually care. Apathy is a cancer that will spread quickly, and destroy your company from the inside.\n\n**5. The importance of Being Broke**\n\n&gt; “A little less cush. A less nice office. It pays to be scrappy in the early days. Work to build something real. Ditch the company happy hours and use that money to create an amazing product. If you have that amazing product, you don’t need the VC.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first few years of a startup aren’t supposed to be cushy. Those are the years that you grind. If you’re getting into entrepreneurship because you want a lavish lifestyle, you’re in it for the wrong reasons.”\n&gt; \n&gt; – Gary Vaynerchuk, Why You Shouldn’t Take VC Money\n\nThere’s not much more to say here. We started Vicky Virtual with a few hundred bucks.\n\nWhy? Because that’s all we had. We spoke to investors, but in the end, we decided to turn them all down.\n\nAnd, to be honest, as hard as it has been to have to figure out how to build a business to this level without any money, I’m grateful we did it this way. The lessons we’ve learned, and the strength we’ve gained from overcoming these obstacles are priceless, and will serve us the rest of our lives.\n\nI truly believe that having a ton of money, or being born with a silver spoon in your mouth is a huge disadvantage in business.\n\n**Having it easy is how you lose.**\n\nDaymond John, CEO of FUBU and star of the hit TV show Shark Tank, is actually coming out with a [book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Broke-Competitive-Advantage/dp/1101903597) soon called *The Power of Broke: How Empty Pockets, a Tight Budget and a Hunger for Success Can Become Your Greatest Competitive Advantage*.\n\nThere’s a great [article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/trangho/2015/11/02/the-5-habits-shark-tanks-daymond-john-wants-you-to-have/) in Forbes that talks about this a little bit more:\n\n&gt; “To fellow Shark Barbara Corcoran, an entrepreneur from a wealthy family doesn’t need to start a business to make a living, and that is a critical difference when things inevitably get difficult. She believes that if you have a safety net, you won’t be willing to do whatever it takes to succeed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Desmond John doubts he would have catapulted to fashion stardom had he not started out broke.”\n\n**6. The importance of Down Time**\n\nOur business hours at Vicky Virtual are 8 AM — 7 PM Central time.\n\nThat meant an 11 hour work day, bare minimum. No breaks. Every day.\n\nFor most of this year, Donald and I both started at 8 AM or earlier, and worked until we went to sleep.\n\nEvery single day.\n\nWhile we had to do this out of necessity at the beginning, we stuck with it, convincing ourselves that we were getting an enormous amount of work done.\n\nOf course, we weren’t. Short bursts of productivity when you are at your optimal state outweigh long periods of semi-productive work.\n\nTrying to run marathons every single day will ensure that you will burn out and end up not going anywhere.\n\nOur challenge was, how do we make sure everything is attended to from 8 AM to 7 PM, while not burning ourselves out completely every week?\n\nRecently, we’ve introduced a system where we take turns getting off at 5 PM every other day, since we are usually pretty slow from 5–7 PM.\n\nWhile this has helped a lot, we were still unable to get any focused work done during the day as we were both being distracted and interrupted constantly by pressing issues.\n\nThis past month, we have decided to take our 2 slowest days of the week, Thursday and Friday, and alternate doing 1 “Murder Day” each.\n\n1 day a week, we each take turns completely unplugging from the day-to-day operations of the business, and focus on “murdering” as much work as possible, while the other one focuses solely on manning the ship.\n\nThis is an opportunity for us to relax, focus on less stressful work and replenish our energy. It’s a day where we can work anywhere we want; from home, the lounge of a nice hotel, a coffee shop, or anywhere else that allows us to unwind and be productive.\n\nIf you don’t have a partner in your business, I highly recommend hiring a VA or part-time employee so you can implement a similar system. Even if you don’t do a “Murder Day”, you need to be taking a day out of the week every now and then to completely unplug.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that your time off really is time off. This means completely forgetting about your business for at least 1 day of the week, usually Saturday or Sunday, and enjoying life outside your business.\n\nThis will ensure long-term sanity for yourself, and the long-term success of your company.\n\nIf you can’t unplug from your business every once in a while without it falling apart, you have bigger problems to address.\n\n**7. The importance of Self-Knowledge**\n\nFrom the very beginning of our partnership, Donald and I were intentional about being honest with ourselves, and with each other, about what our strengths and weaknesses were.\n\nI can’t stress enough how important it is in business and in life to set your ego aside, and be brutally honest about who you really are, what you’re good at, what you suck at.\n\nBeing delusional and prideful is how you lose.\n\nBusiness is cold and fact-based, and the market doesn’t care what you feel or think. Reality is the only thing that counts.\n\nStart by being real with yourself, then with everyone else (“Be Real” is, incidentally, another one of our [Core Values](https://trello.com/b/vmXT5y58/core-values-mission-and-vision-statement) at Vicky Virtual).\n\nBe an adult, and don’t be so insecure that you can’t own up to who you really are.\nOnce you know who you really are, delegate what you suck at, and double down on what you are the best at.\n\n&gt; “If your emotional abilities aren’t in hand, if you don’t have self-awareness, if you are not able to manage your distressing emotions, if you can’t have empathy and have effective relationships, then no matter how smart you are, you are not going to get very far.”\n&gt; \n&gt; – Daniel Goleman\n\nBy making this a personal practice, we were able to bake it into the fabric of our company, and we now have an extremely open and honest culture that allows us to discuss blatantly what we’re doing good at, and what we suck at and need to improve on.\n\nIt also allows us to identify what we need to delegate to someone else who is far better at the task than we are.\n\nAgain, I quote Verne Harnish from *Scaling Up*:\n\n&gt; “Senior leaders know they have succeeded in building an organization that can scale — and is fun to run — when they are the dumbest people in the room.”\n\nYour goal, as an entrepreneur, is to build a team of people who are smarter than you. If you’re the smartest person in the room, then you are your company’s biggest liability.\n\n**8. The importance of Specialization**\n\nThis is a cliche that we’ve all heard a million times, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Don’t try to be all things to all people. You will end up being mediocre at everything.\n\nDecide what your competitive advantage is, and focus on being the best in the market at doing that.\n\nDon’t try to go after a small piece of a big market. Go after a big piece of a small market.\n\nThe more you focus on your core competencies, the more you are going to be able to easily satisfy your customers and grow quickly as a company.\n\nIn *Scaling Up*, the author uses IKEA and Apple as examples of enormously successful companies that intentionally alienated 95% of the market, and focused on giving the 5% of their most hardcore fans products they would fall in love with.\n\nThis is diametrically opposed to the conventional wisdom that tells you to create products that will appeal to the biggest group possible. This will never create the fanaticism, devotion and loyalty that you will need to succeed in the long-run.\n\nPick 1 thing, and do it better than anyone else.\n\n**9. The importance of being Pro-Active, not Reactive**\n\nThis goes along with the long-term planning mentioned in point #1. If all you’re doing is reacting to problems, both in your business and in the market, you’re going to lose.\n\nHave the foresight to solve problems *before* they become major crises, both in your company, and for your customers. Don’t wait until something becomes such a big problem that you are forced to react to it. By then, it’s probably too late.\n\nBe an entrepreneur. Innovate. Get ahead of the market, predict trends, and then form a strategy to capitalize on them.\n\nSpend as much time as possible growing your business, and as little time as possible putting out fires.\n\nThere are several times where we avoided enormous disasters by looking ahead, and being pro-active enough to prevent them from happening.\n\nWe do this by never being satisfied with the way things are, and being obsessive about constantly improving everything. We’re always looking for ways to make things better for our customers and employees. This includes removing obstacles, and incorporating new ideas, strategies, and technologies long before our competitors do.\n\nIt’s important to build optimism in your organization, but having a few people around who are focused on the negative, and are never satisfied with how things are currently is also vitally important. Those are the people who spot the problems and sound the alarm before they become giant disasters.\n\nThose are also the people who discover your weaknesses, and come up with innovative ways to improve your business and stay ahead of your competition.\n\nNegative thinking, unlike cynicism, can be a very good thing for your business.\n\n[Inc.](http://www.inc.com/jill-krasny/the-power-of-negative-thinking.html), [Entrepreneur.com](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241484), and [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2014/10/24/how-to-expand-your-business-with-negative-thinking-coach-bob-knight/) have all written about the power of negative thinking for your business.\n\nOne of the most important responsibilities you have as a manager of people is to get out of their way, and make sure that your company’s policies and processes enable them, instead of hinder them. To do that, you have to be focused on constantly spotting inefficiencies, and always be improving them.\n\nWe rarely go a month without spotting a major obstacle to our workflow or processes, and removing or streamlining it.\n\n**10. The importance of Under-Promising, and Over-Delivering**\n\nAgain, another cliche, but one that is extremely important to keep at the front of your mind when courting potential customers.\n\nNo customer will fault you for over-delivering, but if you over-sell your product or service, and fail to meet expectations, there’s no recovering. This can and will do irreversible damage to your brand.\n\nShoot for the moon and be ambitious, but also be realistic about what your company can feasibly and realistically accomplish.\n\nManage the expectations of your customers, so that you can set yourself up to surprise and delight them, instead of disappoint them.\n\nWe realized way too late that what we were promising our customers was nowhere near sustainable in the long-term, while maintaining a competitive price level and quality of service.\n\nWe anticipated that we would not be able to continue doing some of the things we originally agreed to do for a few of our customers, and decided it would be better to reverse course sooner, rather than later when it became a big problem.\n\nWe actually had to overhaul some of our policies and send out an email to our customers detailing these changes, and the reasons for them.\n\n*Ouch.*\n\n[Here](http://us9.campaign-archive1.com/?u=83178c988c24b4d77af5d874f&amp;id=6e2357687f&amp;e=%5BUNIQID%5D) is the email in full.\n\nWhile it was painful and slightly embarrassing, we were committed to being 100% honest with our customers, and making the changes necessary to ensure that we could serve all of them to the highest standards of quality possible, without raising prices.\n\nIn the end, the damage was minimal, and we made the changes necessary to build a solid foundation from which to build a long-standing, strong, and healthy company into the future.\n\n**BONUS TIP: Take care of your health, and exercise first thing in the morning.**\n\nWhat caused me, of all people, to start getting up at 6 AM, much to the shock of my friends and family?\n\nThe only way I would give up my precious sleep and get up this early is if it caused such a drastic improvement in my mood and performance that I didn’t have any other choice.\n\nGetting up at 6 AM and immediately hitting the gym has done exactly that. I can’t understate how much this has changed my performance, mood and the impact it has had on our business.\n\nWhat I once considered something that only those crazy “morning people” did has become the most important part of my day.\n\nAlong with improving my diet and getting more sleep, this one change in my daily routine has literally transformed my life, my mood, and my performance at work.\n\nI echo the words in [this](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245224) Forbes article entitled *“Why Exercising Is a Higher Priority Than My Business”*:\n\n&gt; “If exercise stops, then my health goes downhill. With the loss of physical health my productivity at work goes down. I become depressed. I lose motivation to do the things that makes my business successful. I’ve learned firsthand that excellence in one area of my life promotes excellence in all other areas of my life. Exercise is the easiest area of my life to control. It’s easy to measure. Either I get it in, or I don’t. When I do, it lifts up all other areas of my life, including my business.”\n\n\n**That’s all for this update.

{"id":"3s6sk2","author":"perfectdaynutrition","body":"**Note that this post is primarily tailored towards Amazon FBA sellers who sell their own branded products.** It may also be applicable to sellers that do retail arbitrage and have products that have a high enough margin, but you need to be selling a moderately high margin product in order to be able to pull things off.\n\nSo I've been selling my own branded products ([three different nutritional supplements](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Morning-Pill/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_9036722011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9036722011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=The+Good+Morning+Pill)) on Amazon, using FBA, for about four years now. Sales ebb and flow, I never managed to get the product/business to the next level, etc. I've been mostly content letting it run on autopilot.\n\nBut a few months ago, I was checking my \"promotions\" folder in Gmail and noticed that I had gotten an invitation from Amazon to apply to run a lightning deal for some of my products. (For those of you unfamiliar with Amazon's Lightning Deals - [here's the page for them](http://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox/ref=gbps_ftr_s-3_0822_dlt_LD?gb_f_GB-SUPPLE=sortOrder:BY_SCORE,dealTypes:LIGHTNING_DEAL&amp;pf_rd_p=2245060822&amp;pf_rd_s=slot-3&amp;pf_rd_t=701&amp;pf_rd_i=gb_main&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1F4KM8M5Q6P6D1BHHGHA) - basically, products are marked down by at least 20% and are on sale for 4 hours, or while supplies last.)\n\nI had missed the response window for that first promotion and was a bit bummed... but i dragged the email back into my main inbox and started checking email more regularly. Lo and behold, a few weeks later, i got another email and did NOT miss the deadline to apply for \"holiday\" lightning deals. The invitation covered all of my products, and in the application form that the seller fills out and returns (containing fields like quantity, price, etc.), i submitted all of my products back to them. Requirements for the deal are that products must be marked down by at least 20% versus the average listing price over the past month, and that a total deal's volume must be in excess of a certain dollar amount (~$5,000) - so basically, they want to offer customers actually decent prices and be able to move a lot of product. I believe that they say that they prioritize both large volume and large discount offers, so it makes sense to really give them your best price and put in as much inventory as you are willing to sell.\n\nA week later I got an acceptance email saying that [one of my products](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PGNMSZG) (thankfully, the one i was most keen on selling at a discount) was approved for holiday deals. It got scheduled to run four times, the first of which was this past Saturday. I did not expect a huge sales bump during the deal - it ran from 9:45PM eastern to 1:45AM eastern on Saturday night into Sunday morning, so I figured that even those on west coast time likely had better things to do than be scrolling through Amazon's lightning deals on a Saturday night. (**Amazon set this timing, not me - so YMMV in terms of getting \"worse\" times like this or \"better\" times (i'd imagine that 2pm on a Tuesday would be better)**).\n\nBut the promotion did **so** much better than I expected. I sold about 50x average daily sales in that 4 hour window. (**edit: I went from a handful of sales [reliably every day] to about 200 sold during the promotion.**) And since my product is a consumable, some of those customers will likely convert into second, third, and more purchases, which is just the cherry on top of the promotional sundae. \n\nSo other than fawning about how great it was - I do have some takeaways that I wanted to share with any of you who might be in a similar situation:\n\n* **DO** check all of your inboxes regularly to make sure you do not miss these emails. Normally they have about a one-week response window, so if it gets filtered into spam or if you get flooded with emails, you might not see it before its too late. The emails come from special addresses (e.g. something like \"fba-holiday-deals@amazon\") so it might get caught by your filter or you might otherwise miss it.\n\n* **DO** do a deal as long as the economics work for your product. The sales bump is totally worth it. **Keep in mind** that Amazon is charging normal FBA fees for these sales - it's not like they get waived or something - so use the calculator or your own monkey math to make sure that your deal price minus Amazon fees will still provide you with whatever net revenue you are willing to accept.\n\n* **HOWEVER** be conscious of the fact that some of the deal parameters may end up being slightly different than you put on your application. For example, I think that I filled out that I was willing to sell 1,000 units of product. In the acceptance letter, Amazon let me know that they were going to run the deal four times, and EACH time, 1,000 units of product should be available. This is not problematic for me - I didn't sell out on the first deal, and if a product does sell out, I'm sure that they would understand... but if you have XXX units of product to sell and would rather sell it slowly at high margin rather than quickly at lower margin, then lightning deals may not be for you.\n\n* **DO NOT** be afraid to give generous deal terms. In hindsight, I wish i had been more generous with my product offers. The one product they accepted was the one I discounted the most and offered the most quantity of, because it was a product I sort of have excess stock for. But now knowing how well products sell while on deal, I would have been happy to get my other products featured on a deal even if it means that the margins on those products are a bit lower.\n\n\nSo... this post is already a bit longwinded and I think the above provides the basic information, but I'll be happy to answer any questions that you guys might have. **REMEMBER TO CHECK YOUR SPAM EMAIL** - I hope this post helps someone else out!\n\n\n**TL;DR: Did my first Amazon lightning deal over the weekend. Sold like 50x a normal day's sales during the 4 hour deal. doing a lightning deal is pretty awesome but there are a couple of things you should be conscious of.**\n\n____________________\n\nNote: edited the post to include the product and sales figures because based on questions, it seems to be helpful information.\n","name":"t3_3s6sk2","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-09 22:51:32","week":46}

{"id":"3scfrj","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hey it's ya boy Cereal! \n\nErm. Let me start over. \n\nIt's me again with another post in the general field of starting a business. \n\nIf you read [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3rdid8/the_chicken_or_the_egg_why_successful/) you will be familiar with the notion that I am always seeking to provide value and solve problems. \n\nIf you haven't read it, it will only take you 5 minutes. Think of this post as a sister post. \n\n**Problems**\n\nWell guess what y'all? **A lot of us entrepreneurs have a common problem**\n\nI've had it. You've had it. \n\nBill Gates probably had it. \n\nThe problem being, **how the heck do I go about solving people's problems?**\n\nWhere do I look?\n\nWho do I talk to??\n\nIf you have ever walked outside and screamed at the sky **”HOW ARE ALL THESE ENTREPRENEURS SOLVING ALL THESE PROBLEMS?! WHY AREN'T I FINDING PROBLEMS ANYWHERE!”** this post is for you.\n\n*****\n\n**The Truth**\n\nThe truth is that solving problems isn't easy. Growing up my teachers have always said, “Cereal, you are a bitchin' problem solver.” They probably said that because I wasn't very good at anything else. You know. A confidence booster. \n\nI say this because when I first started trying to solve problems I couldn't do it. I couldn't identify a good niche, and I sure as hell didn't know how to solve a problem. Fuck you Mrs. B you lying batch of cookies! \n\nThe Truth 2.0\n\nThe second truth of problem solving is that it's hard but not as hard as we may think.\n\nThe PROBLEM of being in the business of solving problems is that there isn't a whole lot of easily accessible information available for solving the problems of solving problems.\n\nConfused yet? Good. It get **way less confusing from here**.\n\n*****\n\nNow, I am not going to sell you an e-book or some shit. Even though I could write a better e-book than half the wanna be's out there riding the magic carpet that is “self-publishing”.\n\nIf you continue reading you are going to **learn some good shit** and you are **not going to be sold an e-book**. Those are my humble promises. \n\nLets get started. \n\n*****\n\nAhem. \n\n**Step 1: Find a Niche**\n\nSolving the problem of a specific niche market is way easier than trying to jump into the middle of a large crowded market where there are a ton of huge players. I don't bother. Sure, there is money to be made there, but I prefer the method of targeting niches because in under 30 days I can be making moolah. \n\nIn my last post I talked about markets and sort of went into solving problems. This was a general post I had made so that I can link it in the comments when people ask questions that it can answer. Yes, the post was for the community but it was also for my own piece of mind. \n\nI will be going into **more details**because thats what the people want.\n\n**How to brainstorm niche markets**\n\nCreate a criteria: Don't be afraid to lay down the law. \n\n**Criteria 1:** I only choose niches that serve over 200,000 people. How to tell? Search “niche name” forum into the Google machine and find some forums. Total up the amount of members in all these forums. If it is at least 100k people it is fairly reasonable to assume that there is over 200k people in this group. \n\n**NOTE** Think about your life. Yes! Entrepreneurship can be about you too. What are some issues? For me I, getting enough protein in my diet is a problem because I am one of those vegetarians. Don't take that as me having to tell you like that joke goes. I am telling you for an example. Another problem I have is I want to get some winter tires on my car and I have been having a hard time getting a quote from a couple of the shops around town. Write them down. \n\n**Criteria 2:** We are also looking for a market that has problems. We can't solve problems that don't exist. It's like fitting a square peg into a grinder. It will fuck your shit up and spit out remnants of what once existed of your self esteem. \n\nWhile you are on those forums search for words like help, stop, how do I, cure, fix, solution, can't, suck, love, etc. Get creative. \n\nSign up for Google's keyword planner and type in the same words plus your niche's name. This will show you what people have been searching. People make careers on that tool so look up some YouTube vids on how to use it effectively. \n\n**Criteria 3:** The people looking to solve the problem are willing to spend money to fix the problem. Want to know a pain point of mine? Fucking fruit flies. I hate them. The little frickers get into my compost and on my fresh fruit. They are a pain to get rid of. But you know what? When I type it into the keyword planner all I see if “Free homemade fruit fly traps.” It is no mystery that I can't go to the store and buy and actual effective remedy. Nobody is buying the solution. \n\nDon't make a fruit fly trap. People would rather do it for free because they know they can. \n\nHonestly, if I knew more about biology and how to deal with the little shits I would make a badass trap myself. It is still a dream of mine; but if you steal the idea I will thank you. Just send me one for free or something. \n\n**Criteria 4:** Competition. Maybe you are looking for that moonshot. A unicorn or whatever. Call my quaint. Call me old fashioned. Call me old school. But I like traditional businesses. I like them because most of them are failing to quickly adapt to how technology is affecting the global market in every way possible. They are ripe for the picking. Sometimes this means competition. Competition is great because if two or three companies are selling it already, it means there is a market for it. You just need to create a better product or service. Provide better service. Go the extra mile. I hope all of you reading this like to go the extra mile. \n\n**Now go out and use these methods to find some niches. Choose 10 that have or could have a problem**\n\nYour niches could be broad right now, don't worry about it. \n\n*****\n\n**Step 2: What are the problems? How do I find them?**\n\nProblem time. \n\nNow that we have some niches that you have found we need to start digging into their problems. \n\nMy favourites methods are **blogs** and **forums.** \n\nJump on some forums and search like I outlined in step 1. Try to see what problems they are having. Write them all down. Big or small. Sometimes a small problem goes unnoticed and underserved by current players in that market. \n\nGet on blogs too. Search, search, search. It's hard work but it will pay off. \n\nNever doubt good old Google and Bing. Search away, friends!\n\nWrite down those problems!\n\n**Amazon** Amazon is great. It's the place to be right now in eCommerce. Search what is selling in your niche. Ask yourself, “What problem is this solving?”\n\nCan you solve it better? There is nothing with importing a superior product and selling it better than the competition. Have some fun. It's like a game. You job is to sell more than the other guy. You will at least take some of their sales! \n\nSo, found any problems yet? I am sure you have! Write em down. \n\n*****\n\n**Step 3: Putting it all together. Choosing a winner**\n\nRemember that keyword planner? Hit it up. \n\nType in the niche's problems you found. **Be specific** we want to see how many searches we are getting on very specific words. \n\nIf you are getting 10,000 searches a month on a specific word that is excellent! That is a good amount for specific terms. If I search “Vegetarian protein powder” I get 2,400 searches a month. Not too shabby. Now what do those people want? A diet? A workout plan? They probably want to build muscle. \nSo I search “vegetarian bodybuilding”, “vegan bodybuilding”, “vegan build muscle”, “vegetarian build muscle,” and lots of words on muscle building supplements. \n\nI get lots of searches a month so it is safe to conclude that this is a decent niche (although this example isn't amazing.)\n\nRepeat the same process on AD Group Ideas.\n\n102,000 monthly search on “Vegan Diets.” Very interesting. This is better than the “vegetarian diets” keywords. Regardless, there are definitely people looking for these diets, but I found a cool one. \n\n**”Vegan Mom Diet”**\n\nThat has around 9,000 searches. This could be a good problem that vegan and vegetarian women have when they are pregnant. How do they get the proper nutrients for their baby when they are pregnant? What it really means is about 9,000 vegan moms are concerned for their baby's health are willing to spend real money on real health food solutions. \n\n **See what is currently out there.** If your problems have a ton of solutions and easy to access information then it may not be a winner. If there doesn't seem to be a solution you are looking at a great marketplace to get into if you have a solution to their problems. \n\n*****\n\nNow, it is also important to be interested in solving your niche's problems. That means having an understand of their emotional needs. You can't be shallow. You have to have passion behind providing a kick ass solution. Simply making it is not enough. You have to **solve that problem better than anybody else**. \n\nResearch that niche as much as possible and really put yourself in their shoes. If you can do that you can validate that there is in fact a need for your solution or if there isn't as much of a need as possible. \n\nSpend time on those forums. Research the blogs. Live an breath that niche for a week and understand what it needed. If you do this and there is a problem, the solution will come to you. Problem solving is as easy as fully understanding a person. \n\n*****\n\nI hope this has helped everybody reading gain some traction. \n\nI will have to note that this process is intended to work on a B2C basis. If you are looking to solve problems of business owners you may have to tweak the process a bit. \n\nDid you like the post? What could be improved? What would you like to see in my next post?\n\n**Here is a fun game. I will only answer all the questions to me that answer the three above questions.**\n\nI want to keep providing content on this sub so if the readers can help me out. I will help you out. \n\n**Help me help you out.**\n\nI am going to work on my own projects for a couple of hours and head to sleep. \n\nI will answer questions in the morning. \n\nIf you live in Canada, tomorrow is a holiday to get out and show respect for our country's veterans. It isn't a day off from work to sit around an watch Netflix. Get out to a ceremony and show your support and respect. \n\nTill next time. \n\n- Cereal\n\n\nEdit: Some mistakes and stuff.

{"id":"3sfb50","author":"winkss","body":"Hi I have a few questions about taxes since it will be a little different for me this year.  I have a regular full time job that I pay taxes on (25% tax range).  I usually get around one thousand dollars back from federal.  These past few months I've started doing some work on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and I am expecting to make around one thousand dollars from that.  I've also made a around $200 from Swagbucks and Bing rewards.  All in all that should only be around $250 in taxes that will get taken off my refund so I don't think that should be an issue.\n\nNow I am planning to move from Edward Jones to Vanguard.  The cost basis in my non-retirement account figures on the website are approximately -$280 in one fund and +$2,400 in another.  I was thinking of selling these and taking the capital gains tax hit (most of it is long term but a little will be short term) so I can move them into Vanguard funds.  Even if I assume everything was $25 that should only be a little $500 bringing my total to $750.\n\nTax-wise will I have any issues?  I know some people have to report estimated taxes but I if I understand correctly will I be find as long as I don't owe more than a one thousand in taxes?\n\nMy final question is what software would be able to allow me to file all these taxes myself?  Will I have to pay for software or will free ones be able to do all this?  I normally had just my income from my regular job so I had super simple taxes.  This year I would have my regular job, mturk (considered self employed taxes), swagbucks/bing (extra income?), and the mutual fund sales.\n\nThanks for all the help!","name":"t3_3sfb50","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-11 18:06:58","week":46}

{"id":"3shyzd","author":"ValueInvestor1981","body":"This market is 100% crazy stupid.  Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn’t understand the history of valuations and their effect on returns and doesn’t care about protecting their capital long term.  Yes, the current P/E is not as bad as other valuation metrics, but P/E ratio is one of the least reliable valuation metrics because of how short term oriented it is.\n\nThe most reliable long term valuation metric is the stock market to GDP ratio, which Warren Buffett often refers to as the “single most reliable measure of stock market valuation at any given time.”  As of today, the future projected returns are projected to be 1% per year INCLUDING dividends. This means that taking dividends out, you would have to subtract 2% per year, roughly, from the total returns. How accurate is it?  When looking at past results, it is 92% accurate and the times it deviates is when the future returns only deviate because of massive overvaluation extremes, like now, or undervalued extremes such as 1982. \n\nSo first off, if you don’t read above and think that the next 10 years in the stock market are going to be ugly, you need to take all of your money out of the stock market, bury it in the back yard, and remove yourself from society because you’re dense.\n\nLook at the period around 1999/2000…if anyone remembers those times, expectations were of 15-20% returns for the rest of time.  If you don’t believe me, go look up articles from Barrons and other financial organizations and see what was said by “professional” money managers who were considered experts.  The scary part is, we aren’t that far off of that time right now! The annualized return expected over the next 10 years is around 1% per year! WITH DIVIDENDS!! Which is close to what it was back in 1999 and 2000, when expected returns were sub 0% even with dividends, and things played out exactly that way. For valuations today, that means that based on 92% correlation, we should expect the nominal market price of the S&amp;P to be LOWER in 10 years than it is today because taking out dividends takes the nominal price of the S&amp;P growth to negative territory!\n\nHistorically, the average stock market to GDP ratio has been in the 90% range and as Warren Buffett says, when you are in the 60-70% range, you will do quite well for the foreseeable future.  However, at the start of past secular bull markets, the ratio has gone as low as 42% before the big rises start, which means that prices are much lower based on history.  Why?  Well think about it…\n\nThe most important thing to future returns is how much you pay for an investment today.  Can an investment still do well even if you pay more for it today than you wanted to? Of course.  That happens all the time. I’ve successfully done it in real estate. But when you are investing in a broad base of companies, like any diversified portfolio should be, it will all average out.  So you need to pay as little as possible, as a whole. The less you pay, the more return you will get because over the long run, stocks will perform to their long term valuation levels.  In the short run, it’s a crap shoot.  As Warren Buffett always says “stocks are a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run.”  Which means that in the short run, the popular ones will do the best but in the long run, the fundamentals of cash and cash flow and revenue will be what determines success.\n\nSo in 1982, when the stock market to GDP ratio was around 42%, it would make sense that the following 18 years yielded 18% returns and when the stock market to GDP ratio was north of 1.5, as it is today, the following ten years produced very poor results.   Paying a higher price for anything will always take away future returns because returns are calculated on what you PAY for an investment.  The results will factor into your return as well, don’t get me wrong, but the income and cash flow are not at all affected by what you pay for the investment. They will be what they will be whether you pay $1 or $1MM for it.\n\n10 Year Cyclically Adjust P/E Ratio\n\nThis was created many decades ago (earlier part of the 20th century) by the writers of Security Analysis, which is the Bible of value investing.  We all know that P/E is the price to earnings ratio and it can be applied to the market.  However, these guys understood that any given year can have massive fluctuations based on short term expenses or revenue gains that aren’t reflective of long term performance.  So what they did was even it out a bit by taking the present value of the previous 10 years of earnings and see where the market stood.  The historical average is around 16.6, and CURRENTLY we are at 27.  27! The only other time in HISTORY that it has been higher was 1999/2000.  In fact, all previous secular bear markets prior to 1999 started when the S&amp;P 10 year P/E was around 23-25! So we are even higher than what starts a 17-20 year flat stock market.\n\nIn past secular bull markets, the S&amp;P 10 Year P/E is in the single digits.  Usually around 6-9 so in this situation, for us to get to that level again, we would need the S&amp;P to go from 2100 today down to 700.  I know it sounds unfathomable but that’s where it would need to be to have the 10 year P/E at 9.  Is it a coincidence that when valuations are high, future returns are low and when valuations are low, future returns are high? Of course not.  Go back up and read my statements on paying more for an investment will always chip at your returns.  100% of the time.\n\nI love watching CNBC and having all these pundits and experts talk about how we are in the early stages of a long term secular bull market.  Liz Ann Sonders is one person I love to pick on because she is the Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab and she should know much better.  But she doesn’t.  She doesn’t look at history just like 99.9% of the average person.  So pat yourself on the back for being just as smart as Liz Ann Sonders.\n\nValuations will ALWAYS mark the end and start of secular bear and bull markets.  Always. Remember, the less you pay for something, the better your return will be.  When valuations are low, you are paying less and therefore, your long term return will be higher.  So long term secular bull markets will ONLY begin when valuations are low.  How low?  Well below historical averages, that’s for sure.  And secular bear markets will begin when valuations are high.  How high? Higher than the long term average.\n\nRemember, the average is the average but we are never at the average point.  We are always either overvalued or undervalued.  Never at fair value. (I say never but really what I mean is for a sustainable period of time…) So we talked about the historical average of 16.6 on the 10 year P/E, but how often are we actually there? \n\nGuruFocus.com says the current 10 year P/E is 25.5, which I won’t argue. Close enough to 27.  But if you look at the data, the average they have is the 16.6 that I mentioned above.  But how often did we actually hit that?  Very rarely! And we were never there for long.  So as you can see, stock valuations are never really at fair value for long enough to matter.  We are either over or under value at all times.  So you have to decide: are you going to be a buyer or seller at any given point?  Now, do I make my investing decisions based on this?  No. You can find good buys at high valuations and bad buys at good valuations.  But if I am buying broad based funds, then this would elicit some caution at the extreme levels.\n\nBTW, interesting enough, look at when stocks were at their highest valuation peaks…1900, 1929, 1966, 2000, and today…what did stocks do after those levels?  See below…\n\nIn 1900, the S&amp;P was at the equivalent of 7.5 or so.  At this point, the 10 year P/E was around 22.  For the next 24 years, the S&amp;P fluctuated between 7 and 10 continuously until the late 1920s boom took things to the next peak/bubble.  Coincidence?  If you think so, you’re smarter than me.\n\nIn 1929, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E got to 27. The nominal price of the S&amp;P at that time was 25 or so.  So what happened after that?  The S&amp;P dropped down as low as 7 and didn’t recover to its previous high of 25 until 1952! It took 23 years for the market to hit the same level again. Again…coincidence?  Come on…let’s go to the next extreme…\n\nIn 1966, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E hit 24 and the S&amp;P’s nominal price was around 100.  So what happened from there? For the next 16 years, the S&amp;P went sideways and stayed at or below that level until 1982…which was the start of the biggest bull market run in history.\n\nNow for the biggest market extreme ever…1999/2000.  The S&amp;P 10 year P/E got as high as 44 and since then, we have seen new highs…all the way up to 2100 as of late, but the S&amp;P also got as low as 666 and based on valuations, the only reason stocks are so high up right now is that they are at high valuation peaks…so this is not meant to show that paying a high premium is ok.  It is not.  We are going to have a bad stock market for the coming 10-12 years.  History has shown it going back to 1871..why would it be different now? It’s not.  It never is.  Yes, stocks can go higher and higher for a long period of time and irrationally, but it eventually stops.  The music stops.  And suddenly the chairs disappears…\n\nIndividual Stocks\n\nAnyone who reads this has seen me short Amazon.  Well, I’ve been killed on it.  And guess what…I’m not worried.  Amazon officially is the most expensive stock, valuation based, in the stock market.  Granted, that’s based on P/E and we all know that P/E can fluctuate wildly but either way, it’s overpriced.  When other companies such as Wal-Mart and Target sell for 0.5 or 0.8 times revenue, Amazon is selling for 3 times revenue.  When other companies are selling for 3-5 times book value, Amazon is selling for 28 times book.  There is no valuation metric that shows Amazon is a good deal.  It has more than doubled in stock price this year alone.\n\nNo one cares about valuations during bull markets.  Look at private venture tech companies.  We have never had more “unicorns” (private start ups that are valued over $1Billion) ever in our history.  Including 1999/2000, the most overpriced tech market we have ever had!\n\nThe scary part, for investors, should be that Square just announced they are going public for 33% LESS than their last round of private valuation! Less! That’s not good.  They raised money at a $6Billion valuation recently but are now going public based on a $4Billion valuation.\n\nBack in 1999/2000, the only positive of the market was that smaller companies didn’t have bad valuations.  The horrible valuations were on the higher end value of companies.  Today, we are seeing it on all levels, but also high end value companies are seeing larger than life valuations.  Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, etc…these companies have been around for a while and are still sporting very high valuations! As I write this, some douche from Edward Jones named Aaron is saying that he has Amazon as a strong buy because of robust growth and stronger margins.  Meanwhile, he also says he values Amazon’s retail business at 2.5 times revenue….WTF?!?!\n\nHere is why I am confused.  Amazon has worse margins on their retail portion than Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart sells for 0.5 times earnings but he decides to put 2.5 times margin on there?!?! Why?!?! Why not 3 times? Why not 4? 5? 6? Just saying a number when the average is a lot lower is insane…of the 81 consumer companies on the S&amp;P 500, the average price to sales ratio CURRENTLY in this massively overpriced market is 1.8 times earnings and the average gross margins is 40% and Amazon’s, on their retail side, is 24%.  Wait, so they are 40% lower on margins and they are worth a premium to sales?  Does that even make sense?  yes, it is growing but as it has grown it’s margins have decreased and the majority of their better margins are coming from AWS, it’s cloud computing services which is a commodity.  It will be a price war. Margins will shrink because the costs to operate are pennies. Google and Microsoft are already in it and growing their portions like crazy.\n\nAnother example: Tesla.  Tesla is a great company. Their product rocks.  They’re the new hot thing.  But what’s it worth to us?  So typically, car companies sell for the following:\n\nFord: 0.38 times sales\n\nGM: 0.39 times sales\n\nHonda: 0.48 times sales\n\nToyota: 0.83 times sales\n\nDaimler: 0.54 times sales\n\nAre we seeing a pattern yet?\n\nTesla: 7.1 times sales.\n\nWTF?!?!? Why?!?! Yes, they are cool. Yes, their cars are awesome. But they make no money! Yes, they are trying to grow, but something has to give!! Yes, their gross profit margin is much better than Ford and GM, but it’s not THAT much better than Daimler, Honda, and Toyota, who all sport around 22% margin and Tesla has a bit over 24% margin! So what gives?!?! It doesn’t add up at all. But it’s a sexy and fun company and so everyone will pay whatever they can to get it.\n\nWhat is the Right Price?\n\nWhen I go back to my high school, the first thing I do is take my iPhone out and say “Who here has this kind of phone and loves it?”  Sure enough, over half the class raises their hand? So I then asks the students “would you pay $1 for this phone?” And of course, they say “of course we would.”  No duh.  Then I ask “Would you pay $1Million for this phone?”  And of course they say “no way.”  Again…duh.\n\nBut that’s what it seems is what happens with stocks like Amazon, FaceBook, Tesla, etc….people say the product or company is awesome so pay whatever it takes to own it.  You may say I am wrong about this, but I’m not.  Why is 7.1 times sales ok for Tesla when similar companies are getting 0.8 times sales, at best?  Why is 3 times sales ok for Amazon when similar companies are selling for 0.5 times sales?\n\nThis is a prime example of a bubbling market.  There are massive overvaluations across the board and margins are high because of lower interest costs because of the Fed reducing rates so aggressively over the past 6 years and keeping them low.  When corporate debt interest charges are down 80%, of course you earnings on the same revenue will increase but it doesn’t mean you’re a better company because of it.\n\nIf you think about investments the same way I thought about the iPhone, you will realize that there is a price for EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t matter what it is. You can buy a pile of dog shit for the right price as long as you can figure out a way to make something on it.  There is always a price for something.  When Long Term Capital Management went under and rocked the financial world in 1997, Warren Buffett made an offer to buy the very assets that took the company down.  So the same assets that took a company down had gone down in price enough that it was attractive enough for Buffett to make an offer on it. That is a prime example of how prices are what dictates the returns.\n\nRecap\n\nIt’s hard to see the market go up and read something above. I get it.  I’m not here to argue that the market can’t go up higher because it can.  And it probably will.  Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  Look at Japan.  Those markets have been irrational for decades.\n\nBut at the end of the day, valuations do matter. And anyone who thinks that buying today will yield good results long term has another thing coming.  It may not happen this year, but it will happen eventually.  People have to give up on stocks for stock prices to go to the point where they are a great buy again. Literally they need to be saying “if you want to retire well, do not buy stocks.” Just like in 2009 when the world fell apart and in that same year in real estate.  People have to give up.\n\nPeter Lynch has an anecdote he has told many times.  He talks about how he knows when to buy or sell stocks.  When he goes to a cocktail party and people are telling HIM what to buy, he knows it’s time to sell.  When he goes to the cocktail party and people are feeling bad for him for being a money manager, he knows it’s a good time to buy.  People think you MUST own stocks and that’s when things get crazy.  Prices have to drop and prices only drop when people don’t want something anymore.\n\nThere will be a tipping point soon.  Just like it was mortgage backed securities in 2008.  That isn’t what caused markets to crash, it is just what caused markets to care about valuation suddenly.  The tipping point is something we don’t know or see yet, probably.  But when it happens, everyone will blame this one thing and then later say they saw it happening.  So many people now say “it was so obvious that real estate was overpriced back in 2008.”  Oh was it?  Hmm.  It’s ego on my part because I have 3 years of blog posts showing my views on the market and so far I have been “wrong.”\n\nWhen this market does take a turn, for us to get to the point of starting a real secular bull market, we have to get to an ugly place.  Years and years of bad returns.  People have to give up.  We aren’t anywhere near that now.  Even 2008 and 2009 wasn’t that bad.  I think in the last 12 years, we have have 11 of them be up years.  That’s unreal.  It shows you how short and quick the last drop was. You don’t lose faith in markets when it’s a quick pop and then rebound.  We need a long term drudging.  It will eventually happen…but I just don’t know when.","name":"t3_3shyzd","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-12 05:31:30","week":46}

There's a couple of different products in different markets so lets take them one at a time.\n\n[Righteous Golf](http://www.righteousgolf.com): Golf gifts for the chosen and blessed golfer\n\nI've been trying to keep this Amazon based and will move to FBA if I ever get enough sales traffic to justify it. I have a small run of inventory and I'm in talks with Chinese factories to get a larger run made of both head covers, as well as a couple of other custom printed golf products. Should I stick with Amazon? How do I get traffic to them? I'm running advertising on Amazon but the click thru rate is pretty low, like .5%, and the conversion rate is mostly non-existent. I've had the Rabbi up for a longer period of time and it ranks on google if you do a search for a \"Rabbi Golf Club Head Cover\", but the Jesus one went up just a week ago and hasn't ranked on google. How long should it take before it ranks and is there any way to make it rank faster? I think the price is on point - I've price tested on Ebay and $24.99 w/ free shipping seemed to be the sweet spot. Should I put up a Shopify site as well and sell them direct?\n\n[Case of a Lifetime](http://www.caseofalifetime.com) Phone Cases for the Fly Fisher. \n\nAm I the only one on earth that likes this product? I've had about 300 visitors to the site since I put it up Nov 1st and haven't had a single sale. I don't know if the price point is bad or not. This is really in a testing phase and I'm using a print on demand case fulfillment company so I don't have to hold inventory until I make a decision on if this is viable. I'm in talks with Chinese manufacturers and if I stock inventory I'll be able to drop the price down quite a bit and still make money. The cases from the fulfillment company are very similar and possibly the same as SkinIt. They're high quality and worth $20-$30 for sure but I'm not selling any and I don't know if it's because of my website or the price. I've also not been able to generate the kind of traffic I need. So, help me out. Does the website suck? Are the images bad? Is the price bad?\n\nI work full time and I'm married with a kid so I haven't had the kind of time I've wanted to put in to these projects. I'd like to do a bit more to the phone case website and get that to look better but I'm not sure it'll help with conversion.\n\nThanks for any help.

I budget all of my earnings down to each individual cent and haven't been this conscious of my finances ever in my life. Budgeting has provided me with so much security.\n\nOver the last year or so, I've started to build credit from scratch. I am currently 24 years old with no debt. I haven't missed one payment over the course of the year and have a relatively good credit score. However, I'm curious what are the effects of opening multiple credit card accounts will be on my credit score? On the surface, it seems that if I open up a credit card - keep in mind, with no annual fee attached - make minimal purchases and on-time payments, I'll essentially be awarded free stuff in the form of introductory offers. \n\nShould I avoid this practice? Or is it completely acceptable within reason?\n\nThe current credit card I'm looking at is the REI Mastercard, which has no annual fee.

{"id":"3sptb5","author":"gmoney20000","body":"So I've submitted a different appeal 3 times now, and it looks like Amazon is still giving me a chance to devise a new plan of action. Here is their last email:\n\nHello,\n\nWe appreciate the information you provided, however we do not consider that to be a valid plan of action. A review of your account indicates that:\n\n1. Your late shipment rate is higher than the goal of less than 4%. If you have any open orders, please ship them.\n\n2. You may not be filling orders because you are out of stock.\n\nBefore we can consider reinstatement of your selling privileges, please provide us with a detailed account of the steps you will take to remedy the above mentioned issues. We will then review your plan and determine whether to reinstate your privileges.\n\nHere is the appeal that I wrote up:\n\nDear Seller Performance Team:\n\nMy account was recently suspended due to the fact that buyers have received delays in their orders and because of stock-outs. As mentioned in my appeal, here are the reasons I believed this happened:\n\n1. Disorganization due to an unexpected increase in selling volume resulting in packages being shipped out late, resulting in late shipments and an inaccurate count of what is currently in-stock.\n2. A computer failure last week resulted in a large number of tracking numbers to be uploaded later than expected.\n3. Poor inventory tracking methods.\n\nThe main cause is due to disorganization due to increased volume. In order to prevent this disorganization from happening again, here is my revised Plan of Action:\n\n1. I have already put in a request to give a shipping refund to all buyers who had a late shipment within the past 30 days in order to compensate for their dissatisfaction and have apologized for such inconvenience.\n2. Before shipping any items on my own again, I am first going to switch to using FBA. This way late shipments and lack of inventory will be a rare occurrence. Customers will also be more satisfied.\n3. I have already updated all tracking information and shipped out all products.\n\nFor if I ever decide to switch from FBA to shipping on my own again:\n\n4. I have already downloaded the Amazon Seller App to my phone. This will allow me to informed almost immediately of when a product sells. As soon as this happens, I will make it a priority to ship the product out, receive the tracking information, and then upload it to the Amazon system. From now on shipments will be sent out the same day. If it is after hours, packages will be sent out immediately the following day, even on weekends.\n5. We will slowly build up our sales volume, and increase it only after experiencing a long period of excellent performance metrics. For now, we will start small and work our way up from there.\n6. Inventory will be kept up-to-date in real-time so that stock-outs won't occur. Inventory tracking will now be managed using inventory-tracking software as well as doing a daily count by hand.\n7. I have already bought another computer to prevent technical problems in the future.\n\nThank you for your time in reading my appeal. Please let me know if any further information is required.\n\n\n** If anyone can give any help as to what I should change, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm surprised Amazon has given me this many second chances.","name":"t3_3sptb5","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-13 23:27:00","week":46}

I know someone who works in one of the warehouses and it's not exactly like they hire the model citizens of the world, I imagine a lot of it could be due to theft.","name":"t3_3sq451","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-14 00:57:17","week":46}

{"id":"3sx1we","author":"7D4Y_WEEKENDS","body":"I have Amazon Prime, but spend a lot more money on eBay.com. I also own both AMZN and EBAY stock. (bought eBay post split)\n\n\nI'm long eBay with the simple [Peter Lynch perspective](http://i.imgur.com/9t0Tm1d.jpg). I love it, I use it, I understand it, and want a piece. I like eBay because it has great filters, and easy to search for the item I want. The majority of the items I buy are free shipping, and most arrive in the same amount of days as Amazon's 2 day shipping. Most are shipped USPS expedited shipping. Amazon you pay tax, regardless of where the item is sold, eBay only charges tax if within the same state as buyer. \n\n\nI love Amazon’s sameday shipping though. Paying $5.99 to have something delivered to you with a couple hours. That is amazing.  To consider how much time/$ it would cost you to get in your car and drive to buy it yourself, $5.99 is a great great value. \n\n\nSome might say eBay sells a lot of knock off products, but most of that was shifted over to the new site ioffer.com. Based off of customer reviews, I've found a lot of Amazon fulfilled items that were fake. For example, the American Crew and other beauty products. Amazon has also been fighting the fake reviews. Seller on Amazon sells someone at Fiverr products for $0 dollars, then they are able to leave numerous fake reviews.  \n\n\nFor selling: IMO, listing and selling items on Ebay is a *breeze*.  And this is why I believe eBay has such a differential advantage. Anyone with a PayPal account can launch a store. As a total rook, I've been able to list, sell, and print shipping labels throught eBay and Paypal. I’ve tried a Shopify and Squarespace store before… eBay is easier for bootstrapping. \n\n\nI admit, I haven't put a lot of effort into listing something on Amazon, and I quickly gave up when I saw all that was required. I think eBay has a great niche for independent sellers, and most don’t go to Amazon unless they are going for fulfillment. I’d never buy something on Amazon that wasn’t prime; I’d just go buy the same item on eBay with free shipping. \n\nFor example, last purchase on eBay was 6 office chairs: \nI first looked at Costco, because that’s where I bought my last ones. The one on eBay was cheaper than Costco and the AmazonBasics version, and had free shipping. I also factored in the tax I’d have to pay buying from Amazon/Costco, so eBay was a sure choice.

I've been writing covered calls and holding some long calls and I'm optimistic for a big 4Q following their [3Q](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/10/23/ebays-third-quarter-results-come-in-better-than-expected-driving-stock-higher/) surprise...

Your contract are with PayPal and Indiegogo, there is no direct contract between supporters and campaigns. All suits and cases have to be filed against either PayPal and Indiegogo and the rest of the information will flow through those channels. We had refund requests through the campaign and we sent requests to Indiegogo to process since that was the contract and that was the channel we were informed to follow. Also with the nearly elapsed funds remaining it would be impossible for us to circumvent regulation and process them directly, which in itself will be a very small fraction of what was originally disbursed also given that Indiegogo and PayPal commissions were already extracted by them at the onset itself without regard for the principal to be released to get actual work done. Refunds would have to be done in collaboration with PayPal and Indiegogo since we were under direct supervision and direction by those companies.\n\n&gt;Note: We will make all communication available for everyone to know that indeed your funds were withheld for as long as 14 months despite numerous requests for release.\n\n&gt;...Continued (please excuse as Indiegogo doesn't allow more than 2500 words per update)\n\n&gt;(Follow-up Part 2/2)\n\n&gt;3.

The plan was to make available the parts we have already and to partner up with some companies / manufacturers / vendors on a profit sharing basis where they can supply the parts we have developed to everyone including regular sales to support labor and people that have to be paid by their companies\n\n&gt;You have been patient and we've had numerous updates showing work in progress, supported visits from backers and all have left with a clean and healthy impression of work being carried out. Mr. Jim Baker was the first to visit and we have another visitor next week.\n\n&gt;It is with a very heavy heart we had to take a pause on the development and look at the big picture of how to overcome the situation. in the best interest of the entire community, we have to have talks with PayPal and Indiegogo and also have talks with potential partners and dig our way out of this situation for everyone's benefit.\n\n&gt;We have everyone's best interest at heart and if nothing comes of it, we will give out all the company's Dragonfly IP with full license authority to all our campaign backers for use, re-sale and more as they please to instigate recovery against their loss.\n\n&gt;With Very Best Regards,\n\n&gt;TechJect Team\n","name":"t1_cwtfz2j","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-11-09 00:52:43","week":46}

But here is my 'problem.'\n\nI have always thrifted and collected vintage stuff that I like.

Fast forward, and every few years I think, 'Okay, just do it, post online, stop being so chicken, knucklehead!' - and then I don't. Again!\n\nAll of you are so reassuring about just starting small, sticking with what you know, which is what I would do. I would just start with cool old stuff I already own but don't need, so other than packaging and shipping there would be absolutely no overhead. And I'm already completely conversant on the buying end with eBay and Amazon, and started using both early in their existences.\n\nI keep reading posts from other people with this same mental hurdle.

{"id":"cwu0znz","author":"launchie","body":"Okay, this is going to be long.\n\nDelivery seems like a better option than constantly having to rely on your dad, especially since that means a trip to the store has to cater to both of your schedules. BUT there are the pros of these store trips. **Since you won't want to go often, you'll learn exactly what you need and exactly how much of it.** I tend to buy things in excess, just cause it seems like a better deal, but I often end up having it lie around taking up space and ultimately wasting money, since I paid more and didn't need that much more (This doesn't apply to essentials like toilet paper). In addition to a better understanding of your own needs, it'll help you with your budgeting/predicting your money flow. I see you mentioned depression, and OP I'm not sure if you're a guy/gal, but **getting up and going to the store is a chance to make yourself feel good.** It's a chance for small, nice observations/encounters (grocery stores are a treasure trove of all kinds of people). And when you look good, you feel good. Not in a vain sense. But looking presentable can help inspire confidence and the idea that you're worth something, that you're a person worth taking care of :).\n\nThis leads to a question: *What are you buying?*\n\n**If groceries/general toiletries**, then what I said about physically going to the store definitely still applies. However if there are some purchases that you wouldn't feel comfy making with your dad around, then by all means Amazon that shit. Just watch out for shipping costs/minimums for free shipping, because you might not end up saving if you're buying more to get free shipping or paying out of pocket for shipping. Unless it's something you know that you'll always be in need of.\n\n**If clothes**, oh fuck I've got a lot to say. I LOVE online shopping. I can spend hours and it's so bad. I have my cc info memorized. This is going in two parts: how I keep myself from buying every single cute/cool thing I see and the process I use to determine what I will purchase, if anything.\n\n**How I keep myself from buying every single cute/cool thing I see:**\nI first put them all in the 'shopping cart'. That rounds up the total, so I can be appalled every single time at how much I want to blow. I check what I've got in my bag often, so I also get this slap in the face often. Then I check out all my favorite stores and see if I can find something comparable. Usually, pieces aren't unique. You can find a variation at another store. A similar style, a similar feel, different colors. I'm also not good at visualizing how something looks on my body. It may look super cute pictured, but not on my body. I have a really good friend who understands my body, my style, and can visualize these things. So getting a trusted opinion from someone always whittles down what's in my shopping cart. And then I really look at the prices. I make X an hour. Is this worth 2, 3, 4 hours of my time? Usually not. Is the item you're eyeing full price? Then it's not going anywhere. I wait a few days. Still exactly what I'm looking for after 2 days and searching for alternatives? Usually not. For sales, something may seem super cheap, but would it actually be a useful addition to your wardrobe?\n\nTo remember: YOU ARE NOT SAVING MONEY BY BUYING SOMETHING AT REDUCED PRICE IF YOU WERE NEVER GOING TO BUY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND JUST HAPPENED TO STUMBLE UPON IT BY VIRTUE OF THE MARKDOWN.\n\nThis leads into **how I screen for what items I will actually purchase**. Here is where the difference comes in between how I throw everything into the shopping bag and how I leave with only what I REALLY want and need. You can like something very easily. Liking it enough to buy it is something else altogether. The golden question is, *will it actually be a useful addition to my wardrobe?* There will never be a shortage of items that are cute or cool. There will never be a shortage of sales. Think about why you want to buy an item. It's cute? It is a wearable piece, that you can pair with other items in your wardrobe? It's a style you want to emulate? Is it relevant towards *your* lifestyle? If you want to buy a bikini for your trip to Alaska, well you should have stopped reading a long time ago. The golden question again: Will it actually be a useful addition to my wardrobe? The answer is usually no. If I do decide to order something, I get the added bonus of appreciating it more, because that piece survived the process! It's way more exciting waiting for a package to arrive/getting it when you know the \"value\" of the item to you :).\n\nI'm going to conclude with future tips, because what I said above is really just damage control from spending an exorbitant amount on things you don't need.\n\nDetermine what you *do* need. Learn your habits. Before going to the store or searching for something online, write down what you're looking for. Have a clear picture, so as to not deviate and spend needlessly. These places, both physical and online are made to get you sidetracked and to drop more than you initially intended. Do research, compare, and pay attention to the slight variations in details. Remind yourself of what you're saving for, and how much this car would mean to you. I would looking into having a savings account, and depositing a certain percentage of your paycheck to it each time you get paid, the day of. You can set automatic transfers, or do it manually if your paycheck varies. Check the balance of the savings account to inspire you to save more. Make sure to reward yourself occasionally :).","name":"t1_cwu0znz","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-09 14:24:55","week":46}

{"id":"cwu2ay7","author":"queenannechick","body":"Hi all! I can totally speak to this. Lately every time I contribute on here though I regret it so... please don't make me regret it. Its so weird how hate-y people get when their opinions on strategy vary... No I am not willing to identify my products. That would identify me. Don't get all hate-y. I'm just trying to help a fellow-in-arms out here k?\n\nAnyway... I have been selling three different products online for about 7, 6 and 5 years. I make about $1000, $800 and $1200 respectively average per month on each product. Basically, they're all plugins that allow you to upload your data (think Access, SQL, CSV) to e-commerce systems. The primary headline for all 3 would be: manage your data the way you like to and upload it to e-commerce easy-peasy. They all sell for around $200 - $500 for an annual license. I wrote them all myself. They're varying from/to platforms so I've had to write code in like... a lot of stuff. PHP, Java, C. Its all over the place.\n\nI have no idea if this is viable for you. I would say you need to find a niche that has demand. I REALLY prefer B2B. The general public... sucks. I sell to IT people which helps immensely. Don't underestimate the support still. People call me all the time (about 70% of my sales call me first) just to make sure I'm a living, breathing, phone-answering entity. As far as steps to success, write something. \n\nI really don't believe in MVP (or Minimum Viable Product) in the sense that software devs seem to use that phrase as an excuse to release shit with bugs. It can be minimal in features but it better not have bugs on release. If it doesn't work and is not easy enough for a monkey people are SO quick to abandon the trial forever or hit that refund or complain button on PayPal/Google Checkout/Amazon Payments or call their bank and ask for a refund. Half the time, even once I fix it, they never recall the complaint so they get a refund and I get hell from my payment gateway b/c they'll just say \"provide a tracking number\" on repeat. It sucks. This also hurts the rates you get from banks, they may write a bad review online for you, it sucks. Make sure it works and that includes rock-solid documentation that is really, really easy to find and use. I now call every sale every time. Sucks so much but I've gone a year without a single chargeback and I'd been seeing 3-4 every year at least. Even this makes a HUGE difference when your sales are low volume per payment gateway.\n\nI tried doing the whole make a software for an industry thing with landscape businesses. I shut it down. A word of warning: every business has a different way of doing things and every business thinks their way is the final word/industry standard. So, you get people who call and scream at you that IT MUST WORK THIS WAY and demand refunds and demand you change it and go red in the face and... fuck all that. I stick to plugins now as far as repeatable software sales. My \"day job\" (when I bother to work, usually I fuck around and travel and ski and climb and shit a lot) for the past 11 years is designing custom information systems. I always thought if I could just build one ultimate [insert industry here] software application instead of the one I was working on for a customer then, I'd be a billionaire. It is a lot harder than you think. That's why the blockbusters are all so modular (see: basecamp) and most businesses still have something custom even if they also use a SaaS in tandem.\n\nNothing was a huge waste of time. Collecting email addresses for trial download (then emailing VERY occasionally like 4x a year), solid documentation and a 30 sec video \"above the fold\" explaining what the product does were some of my best wins. Huge return on time investment for those three things.\n\nIf you have any more questions, ask away.","name":"t1_cwu2ay7","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-09 15:15:20","week":46}

How much money will you keep in your checking account? 4% is certainly more than anyone else is offering, but objectively it's not that much.\n\nFor every $1,000 that you keep in the account for a full year, you will earn $40.81 assuming 4% interest compounded daily.

Newborn clothes you will stop using in 3 months, the same for toddlers clothes it's a waste of $ to buy new.  \n\n*Diapers - you'll go thru hundreds every month, Amazon has subscriptions for diapers.  $50/monthly \n\n*Furniture - Crib, playmats, mattress, bedding/sheets, change tables etc - $1000 to $2000 depending on what you get\n\n*Infant car seat/Stroller - Get a combo travel system - $200 to $400\n\n*Formula - I suggest breast feeding, but if the wife is not producing enough, supplement it with formula.  It's about $25 per week when they reach 4 to 6 months old.  \n\nThat's just a small list of things you'll need to get started, healthcare costs and childcare costs vary depending on where you are and if you have family helping you.

It'll also reduce your average age of accounts, which will increase as you maintain your cards. Both of these are very minor factors in your credit score. Payment history is far more important.\n\nIf you already have a bunch of cards, there's no point in getting rid of them. Just put a tiny monthly transaction on them each month so they don't get closed. They're helping you by increasing your average age of accounts.

In our industry Prime members are the golden gooses. We charge more for prime items because it's a higher tier service.  It's standard practice.  However, HEAVIER items are where prime prices tend to shine in a very big way because of the negotiated shipping rates Amazon has.  That's when you can start getting large heavy purchases for cheaper than merchant fulfilled.  \n\nThe entire idea of prime is to get people who would NEVER shell out for 2 days shipping to do so because it was more expensive.

If you do, thrift on stuff like ties, dress socks etc. where it won't immediately be noticeable if it is a bit ragged.\n\nSlacks: JCP, or TJ Maxx, Macys. $30 a pair, get a set of blue, grey, and maybe black. Be sure to get them tailored ($10-15); ill fitting slacks really ruin a look.\n\nShirts: I have had really good luck with Costco. About $20 per shirt and they look better than the $80 ones I got as a gift. Be sure to get your measurements correct. You can look for some at thrift stores, but you would have to get them tailored and it might just be easier to buy new shirts that are the correct measurements.\n\nShoes: Zappos/Amazon sells some really nice shoes. Get black and brown. (~$40 each)\n\nBelt: Black and Brown Belts (Amazon, Target, Marshalls, TJ Maxx, ($10-15)\n\nTies: Amazon, TJ Maxx, Target, Marshals. Get a few basic ties (3 to start?) About $15 a pop. You can thrift for this stuff too.\n\nDress Socks: TJ Maxx sells a variety pack of 6 pair for $12 IIRC.

{"id":"cwv4fcs","author":"wordfactorydesign","body":"I love shipstation. I ship about 50-100 orders a day that weigh between 4oz-15oz and shipstation is a bit cheaper than shipping through my other options. Not much but a few cents here and there add up. The real savings with them is my time. I can pull in all orders from all shops that I have on Etsy, Ebay, Amazon, Shopify, Bonanza, etc. into one location and print all my labels at once. No going back and forth to see if I have orders here or there. Another perk is printing off a SCAN form for the post office that has everything you've shipped from all stores on 1 page.  If you aren't shipping a ton, I don't think shipstation would be worth the monthly fee.  I started out with stamps.com and now have a free stamps.com account through shipstation so you can grow into these things once you have the orders to justify it. I shipped about 5000 packages last year and USPS pulled through on 99% of them. That other 1% is in no mans land or took weeks to get where it was going. They aren't good at getting things where they need to be on time, especially during the holidays, so be careful what you promise your customers if you go that route. Best promo for me has been \"free shipping\" and sending it out first class.

You would still have to pay for the domain and hosting ($10/year for domain and $15/month for hosting average). Alternatively you could use a service like http://merch.amazon.com and they just take 30% of what you sell as a fee, but you don't have to pay any money up front to list with them, and you're more likely to sell your shirts faster because Amazon is a selling machine. Printful also allows you to sell prints and canvases of your work, so check them out!","name":"t1_cwvf5ac","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-10 17:18:44","week":46}
{"id":"cwvftt4","author":"vineetr","body":"&gt; Contrary to popular belief, there is a world beyond Netflix and Amazon.\n\nI mentioned Netflix and Amazon because it takes a lot of effort to build resilience into an offering like AWS, and despite that, customers like Netflix have to do extra to make their businesses work optimally. I work in the same field, and if you do, read up on Netflix OSS - streaming movies on a planetary scale is not a very simple thing to do. See Google Cloud which is not a new offering, or OpenStack which was meant to commoditize cloud solutions, and you have to wonder why AWS is the dominant leader.\n\n&gt; Oracle's bread and butter is hardware, software, and related enterprise services for companies all over the world. The dinosaurs that inhabhit supply chain management, AP, etc, will, out of habit, contract obligations, or, just barely possibly, rational thought, prefer to stay in the Oracle ecosystem when starting to use cloud computing services.\n\nAgreed with this on principle, because I see it often. But such practices also change with time. I've noticed companies tend to go in for fresh blood who understand the newer tech, instead of attempting to justify staying on existing tech (their competitors show better margins after moving on). And the new hires with purchase authority, having come through a world with less of Oracle in it, tend not to favor Oracle.\n\n&gt; For the record, almost every interaction I've had with an Oracle product leaves me pissed off and wondering how companies fork over millions for crap.\n\nThey have a knowledge moat in some of their products and services. It would take enormous amount of manpower to write an equivalent system for their ERP offerings. Then, there is the lack of negotiating knowledge when it comes to their clients - Oracle sales can give discounts to a certain point. Some purchasing managers see the sticker price and think the expensive product is really good (it's not). Most veterans know this is a game played in the enterprise software sales industry. Purchasing managers come off happy when they see a huge discount (not a measly 5% or 10%, this could go way higher), that they can use to justify a big-ticket purchase. Even larger discounts can be sought, but that would require someone higher up (think CFO level or a CFO reportee) in Oracle to sign off on them, and that's usually done only when you are a very big client.","name":"t1_cwvftt4","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-10 17:36:20","week":46}

I'd say I'm a MS intermediate, I've done several $3K minimum spends, though mostly back when Amazon Payments was around.\n\nI want to start using VGCs, but I keep reading that they're harder and harder to use.  I've read the FAQ, but I'd like some direct feedback from people who were unsure at first, but then got comfortable using VGCs.  I don't have a car, and while I live in a large city with reasonable mass transit (Philly), I'd prefer not to spend my weekends traveling on the bus to Target to unload VGCs.\n\nMy main reason for churning is airline miles, so I don't really care about cash back categories or profiting from cash back bonuses.  Just want an easy, low risk, and cheap way to meet min spends.  It's probably a \"you can choose two, but not three\" situation.

You mentioned in a reply that you use data for streaming music...if it's serving as background noise, get an FM radio.  If you want to listen to your choice of music, Amazon has good prices on downloads.  The have a selection of $5 albums that they rotate regularly, and there's usually a few quality albums in the mix.  Even their regular priced downloads have seemed a little cheaper than iTunes in my experience.  And as others have said, there's the paid version of streaming services which let you sync music for offline play.\n\nSo at the very least you can save by reducing your data plan.  But I would look into switching to a $50/month no-contract plan (the major providers now offer these).  Depending on what it costs you to get out of your current contract, the savings might offset that lump sum soon enough to make it worth while.

{"id":"cwwlgas","author":"yeahthatsmee","body":"Good morning everyone! I have been flipping for a little while but mainly on craigslist or finding stuff for people I work with. I haven't jumped into making an eBay or Amazon account yet. That being said I recently bought (4) Airmar/Furuno PB150 Weather stations (MSRP $1000) and (5) Furuno RD-30 Display units (MSRP $500). I also have assorted cables and accessories for both. These are electronics used on sea going recreational/fishing boats. I would put them on my local craigslist but I'm pretty far inland from the ocean. Looking on Ebay it looks like the display units go for $200-$300 apiece, but the actual weather station doesn't really sell. Some of the accessories specifically the Sunscreen (X4) and Mounting bracket with knobs (X5) go for $20-30 apiece and they sell somewhat regularly.  \n\n\nSo what I planned on doing is calling a few used marine repair shops and see if they want the whole lot for $1800-$2000. My next option was to put a package deal on craigslist(San Diego and LA) for a single weather station and display unit for $600. My last option is to piece it out on eBay, which like I said the display units go between $2-300 and the accessories $20-30 each. But then I'd probably still be stuck with the weather stations since they really don't move on eBay.\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. If anyone could set me up with a marine shop that deals with electronics that would be awesome too. And lastly if anyone here is interested or has a use for them I could work a deal out if you PM me.      \n","name":"t1_cwwlgas","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-11 16:57:28","week":46}

Would also consider a 2-week British Isles / Western Europe trip if we can't make Asia happen. Have been hanging onto BA Avios and Amex MR points for Europe via BOS-DUB.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Am looking at the Citi Premier for and closing down the AA Executive. The Citi Premier might be my go-to card when not meeting MS because of good bonus categories, OK-ish lounge access, flexible redemptions. Any flaw to this logic? I would prefer to have the CSP for a daily card, but 5/24 has locked me out. Was using SW Premier for daily spend, but no lounge access, not great earnings on the things I spend money on. \n\n1. Thinking about closing the AA Platinum WEMC and reopening the AA Platinum Select for another 50k AA points. Any issues with this?\n\n1. I really value Primary rental car coverage. Seems like only CSP, Amex (via the add-on for $25/rental), and Ritz-Carlton offer this. I can't get the CSP because of 5/24. Amex is $175 yearly AF. R-C is $399. Both are kind of high for my liking, especially since I never use the Amex at all. \n\n1. What should I do with Amex points? Keep them and add more by getting more Amex cards? Transfer them to Avios or something else and close the Amex? Use them and close the Amex? If I open another Amex and close the Premiere Gold, can I keep the primary car insurance add-on benefit for $25/rental?\n\n1. Which other cards should I close? I'm thinking about closing my Arrival +, Aviator Red and my wife's SW Plus. Any reasons to keep these open? Should I be trying to churn any of them (like Arrival+)?\n\n1. I keep the Marriott card open for Silver status and \"free\" Cat 1-5 room with my $85 AF. Should I close it and churn it?\n\n1. Which hotel cards should I be targeting next, and in what order, given that I don't have a firm destination in mind and am looking at a mix of domestic and international travel over the next 2 years?\n","name":"t1_cwwuunr","subreddit":"churning","subreddit_id":"t5_2vrf0","created_utc":"2015-11-11 20:54:21","week":46}

I gave him my steam profile so he can add me and get the keys...\n\nWhat struck me first was that he insisted me to go first. I did background check him and it was pretty clear that he had a lot of rep, so I didn't mind going first with the 4 cs:go keys.\n\nAfter he received the keys he did give me a code, which when I entered gave an \"Invalid code\" msg. I asked him to double/tripple check it, but he assured me that he gave me the correct one. I print screened him everything, but he didn't believe me. Told him to try the code in his amazon, but he didn't want to. At the end he started forcing me to use Skype and screenshare option... after a lot of thinking I did that (which I regret atm). \n\nWhen i was screen sharing I showed him how I put the code, press redeem and it leads to an invalid error. He then asked me to share again and show him all my previously redeemed codes to see if his isn't already redeemed. I have never actually redeemed a $10 code, so was PRETTY obvious. At the end he wanted me to screen share again and to log out of amazon.com, log in again etc etc. That's when I thought something fishy is going on and told him that I will give every evidence of his broken GC to the mods, and if he wants he can speak with them after.\n\nA minute after he told me that he tried the code on his amazon, and it didn't work as well, so he gave me the keys back. At the end of the day it wasn't a complete scam, but still think there was an attempt of doing something pretty fishy. I'm a bit paranoid so am googling all the possibilities of him breaching into my PC via Skype screen share and stupid stuff like that now lol. \n\nAnyways, hope /u/bg_20 or another mod will look into things, and if there's anything that I can do to prevent something bad happening, will msg me ...\n\nP.S.

{"id":"cwxe9i0","author":"FormerGameDev","body":"My lady was skeptical at first, that one could make real useful money without doing this like full time or more.\n\nI showed her my spreadsheet that tracks inventory and sales.\n\nI started selling on Amazon at the very end of August.\n\nCurrently my spreadsheet has some decent sum columns:\n\nCOGS (Cost of Goods Sold) = 752\nTotal Inv Cost = 1301\nGross Profit on Sales = 1544\nGross Income = 2297\nTotal potential GP = 2246\n\nSo, I've made almost 1k in PROFIT in 2.5 months of doing this, we cleared the entire cost of inventory about 2 weeks ago, and sailed up to 1k over since then.  I think the real star of that show though, is the GP on Sales -- (Total Sales - COGS - Other Costs on Units Sold).  Making a $1544 profit on $752 in merchandise is pretty damn good, especially considering that I'm a former retail manager, and would've killed for a GP line like that on most of my product lines.  My retail manager head sees the 67% gross margin and explodes, every time I open my spreadsheet.\n\nAnd this is why when I say \"hey we need to drop these packages off at the UPS store\" she hops in the car and goes.    (and also because I don't have a driver's license.. which I'm using this profit to rectify)\n\nI doubt I'm going to pull the kinds of insane deals that I've been hooking myself up with over subsequent periods, but I'd definitely be happy with $1k in profit for every $1k spent if I could keep that running for a long period, which I'm pretty sure I can do.\n","name":"t1_cwxe9i0","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-11-12 06:09:59","week":46}

Amazon is hugely profitable, just not according to GAAP. \n\nCash flows are the only thing that matter....and you don't address this at all:\n\n* AMZN: 34x OCF growing at 71% per year\n* WMT: 10X OCF but shrinking at 2% per year\n* COST: 16x OCF growing at 10%\n* GOOGL: 20x OCF growing at 18%\n\nAre you seeing a trend here?

There is nothing that comes close to its growth.\n\nWhat does WMT's outlook look like over the next 5 years? How different will the company be? I only see rising wages and slow to no growth. This is what shoots down the valuation.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, has its hands in a ton of different businesses, providing a recurring revenue stream that is growing by leaps and bounds. AWS is where the future is, and it is not a commodity business as you suggest. Only the largest, most cash-rich companies can produce infrastructure to the scale of Amazon, yes Google and Microsoft are two of those companies. Beyond that though, it is very little. These three companies will own this space.\n\nUntil you know more about accounting on recurring revenue models and SaaS, I don't think you should be talking on the subject of valuation.","name":"t1_cwxes1d","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-11-12 06:29:40","week":46}

Online arbitrage is similar, but buying from online sellers instead of brick and mortar, like buying from a seller on eBay and reselling for a higher value.\n\nOverall, arbitrage is all the same: It's securing relatively low risk profits from differences in markets.

{"id":"cwyazhc","author":"bunchabinchois","body":"Definitely was joking about the Mercedes -- I'm not even comfortable financing a cheap used car! As much as I want and would appreciate a nice car, I'd only justify it if a Mercedes were somehow 10-15% of my salary. Which will never happen.\n\nI'm spending about $0.70 per mile on this car, though, with insurance/gas/repairs so far (assuming instant depreciation to $0 after I bought it), and that's before I make any more repairs. So it IS more expensive than a new car, sadly.\n\nMy biggest expenses were temporary: furniture, kitchen equipment, all the stuff I needed to move out of grad housing and start a life. I do most of my drinking alone and infrequently (see what grad school does to a man?), so not spending more than $50 a month there. The biggest expenses seem to be random things on Amazon that I pick up with the justification of 'oh, it's for the house'.\n\nI could probably save about $150 a month if didn't buy lunch at work and another $150 if I bought less premium groceries (being in grad school leads you to buy expensive food on poverty-level wages, it's a strange place, I tell you!). I go to restaurants no more than once a month.\n\nCooking more for myself would give me less time and less willpower to study in the evenings after long days at work, though, so I'm banking on the fact that optimizing for time and work output rather than money  in the short term will pay off in the form of rapid salary growth over the next few years.\n\nI'm spending $900 a month in rent (splitting a house with someone), and my portion of internet/utilities comes out to about $100 a month on top of that. Don't have cable, and I average around $100 a month for audiobooks for commuting/movies/tv shows. Cell phone is paid for by work, thank god.\n\nGas comes out to about $130 a month; insurance is about $75 a month, although that should improve in a year when I hit 25. \n\nCar repair is, if I make these current repairs...about $500 a month.\n\nIt looks like *owning* the car itself is the least expensive part about this whole situation.\n\nI'm  incredibly averse to spending that much at once, but the Honda Fit doesn't look like a bad deal. I definitely think that I'd get enough value out of something sportier to justify the expense on a nicer car instead of other forms of entertainment...but I'd probably buy a new Honda Fit and drive it into the ground (with my current commute, I'd hit 200K miles in less than 9 years) before I could even begin to think of spending that kind of money! It wouldn't be painful to squeeze a monthly car payment of $300 out of cutting back on random purchases and food, but I'm pretty averse to financing.","name":"t1_cwyazhc","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-13 00:55:34","week":46}

The whole chain had a one-day-only-flatware sale on Tuesday, so I guess now I'm primarily a purveyor of mediocre flatware. :-)\n\nHad a dumpster dive that landed me some valuable textbooks too.

Firstly, it doesn't help your score. Secondly, it costs you money. Wait until your statement comes and pay the statement balance IN FULL. You don't have to pay anything above the statement balance, because it will not accrue interest. If that's what you meant by \"carrying a balance\", then that is fine.

This isn't a business where people will reorder.\n- You are subject to varying costs depending on the size of the item. Where a larger product seems to be worth it, shipping costs might kill your margin.\n- eBay sellers might sell you junk/damaged items. I have a hard enough time sacrificing control on Amazon, but to get the double whammy from eBay and Amazon is not my cup of tea. \n- Sourcing from China is cheaper. It is more work, but it is cheaper. \n\nWhat I guess I am trying to say is if you want to be involved in eCommerce and sell on Amazon, importing and private labeling is still a great place to be.

Amazon's calculated that a page load slowdown of just one second could cost it $1.6 billion in sales each year. Google has calculated that by slowing its search results by just four tenths of a second they could lose 8 million searches per day—meaning they'd serve up many millions fewer online adverts.\" (http://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales)\n\nI agree with you - people want tech and they want that information and they want to be able to share selfies and yadda yadda yadda.

I think a lot of the smaller mall stores (A &amp; F, Aeropostale, etc etc etc) are where the real trouble will be and you've already seen a lot of mall stores go (Wet Seal and others.)  Malls that have more vacancies due to problems with smaller stores will have traffic erode and that's less people who happen to stop by a Macy's. Again, on top of that you have the problems with what people's priorities are (expensive clothing not high on the list.) I've said for a while and I continue to think the era of the \"dime a dozen\" strip mall is over.

{"id":"cwz41ul","author":"ChildishThunder","body":"There are many arguments that can be made about how a start-up **should** be valued. For this post though, I will explain to you how a VC firm most often will value a potential investment.\n\n---\n\nInitially, the VC firm would make projections with a *best case scenario*. This scenario would be based off of the entrepreneurs/founders expectations as a starting point.  Outlined below is a simple list of steps a VC Fund would walk through.\n\n1) Figure out what is the total addressable market. If everything were to go great, how many customer/clients can we have?\n\n2) What is the business model? Is it one that has been established before? If there are any type of similar companies then the job becomes much easier. If there are not, then a different process is applied:\n\n   a) For a company in an industry with other competitors (example: Amazon Instant Video was a new entrant into a market in which Netflix was already somewhat solidified) you would simply look at the expected long-term margin profile (gross and profit margins) and apply those to the firm you are trying to value.\n\n  b) If there are no similar companies, you must establish a margin profile based on expectations and research. \n\n3) Now that you have the building blocks of a best case scenario operating model (user growth and margin profile) the VC Fund can begin to build a DCF.\n\n4) The most interesting part of a VC model is the cost of capital/WACC/cost of equity. Since the *best case scenario* projections were used, the VC Fund often discounts these numbers significantly. Often times VC Funds will use discount rates of between 40%-60% (these numbers are often calculated arbitrarily due to the perceived riskiness of the cash flows).\n\n5) Now you have a value for the firm, and can determine how much any % equity stake would be worth... or at least you have a starting point!\n\n---\n\nIf you have any further questions, or want me to explain something above then please feel free to ask.","name":"t1_cwz41ul","subreddit":"finance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhfj","created_utc":"2015-11-13 19:08:39","week":46}

If only we could all predict the future.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that if everyone knew where Apple was going to be 10 years ago we would all be rich here. Reality is that there will be people that have positive outlooks and negative outlooks on a company. \n\nI have that positive outlook because of these reasons:\n\n1. They have great fundamentals. Rich in cash with a strong brand.\n\n2. Superior product. Why would you invest in company that makes a cheap knock off rather than a company with a GREAT product. The product cycle is an issue they will overcome.\n\n3. They are on the frontline of VR and Drones which will be a big market in the upcoming years. You have companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google investing. If anything, GoPro will be acquired by one of them if it comes down to it.\n\nI am underwater with GoPro, but still buying for the long term. I imagine they will blow away earnings this Christmas.

{"id":"cwz7qqk","author":"knowledgeispower88","body":"Another thing I want to add to this, is I think people expect you to say yes to everything, or take on any job. \n\nThese last couple of years, I have been saying no a lot more and trying to follow my own plan. In the end, if all fails, at least I tried. I can always get a low wage job in anything people don't want to do if my life ends up that way (carers, cleaners). \n\nBut for now, while I have the advantage of a roof over my head, food in my belly, and time on my side, I'm going to try my ideas.\n\nSo I do appreciate my opportunities and count my blessings. But that doesn't mean I have to go for anything.\n\nAnd since I've done it this way, which was this year, I've had 2 big successes. One I milked the hell out of, a wholesale item I was making £20-30 a day for one days work a month with Amazon FBA!\n\nThe other one I'm doing now I'm not going to discuss, but that's more long term, upscalable, long term, and doesn't rely on 1 product.\n\nBut the point I'm trying to say. Is I have been offered shitty low paying jobs that would have taken all my time up, and I wouldn't have done any of these things. Sure I could have done both, but I don't have that much will, and I DIDN'T NEED TO! I wasn't trying to make ends meet, or on the verge of homlessness, etc... I respect people who do make a success while having to work a shitty job to provide for their family.\n\nBut at the same time, logically my best bet was to focus all my time on these ideas and turn down shitty jobs. In 2014 I had taken the shit jobs, and if I had stayed in 1 of them I would have been super depressed and miserable (who knew passive aggressive bullying still existed at our adult age in office environments). I would have probably ended up full of envy and bitterness like the people we talk about today.\n\nBut I decided to politely resign after 2 months as I thought I can do much better than this for £15k a year. Working with shit people, expecting to work overtime without additional pay, having to learn a whole shit of regulations and material that would not benefit me in any other career, in other words a dead end job.\n\nNow most people would expect anyone to stick it out through any reasons. I said no and I quit. I'm not a person you can pile stress on and burn me out, I'm not tough as nail. Then I got a job at a theme park as a ride operator, made the same amount of money, made plenty of friends, worked hard, and didn't have to worry about anything when I got home at 5pm. But since that was seasonal (April-November), it was 2015 where I decided to give myself a go with my own ideas.\n\nSo the point of all this, was saying No isn't a sign of weakness all the time as some would make you believe. There's this one guy I know who before told me I can't be picky with jobs, I should take any job. He's a jack of all trades, smart guy, hard working, but is always struggling for money. He's smart, he was trained as an electrician, but can do plumbing, painting and decorating, building, loads of things, 25 years of experience. But he can't say no to people, though 2 years ago he spent £10,000 on a gas certifying course so he could make money with less work. Yet he never advertises and keeps saying yes for the less paying jobs that he hates (and is killing his back). If he said no a little more so he could drop this shit work, and focus on the thing good work he paid to be certified on, and eventually replace all his work with it, then he could be living his dream he originally had. Obviously easier said than done, but he doesn't make any effort, he'll take on any job, he's got plenty of business from many people, why not drop the bad jobs and just do the good jobs, even if it isn't the gas.\n\nBut anyway, yeah people will always judge, especially if you don't take any job. But I've made just as much or more this year doing a job from my own house, having plenty of time on my hands, and enjoyed it, as I would have taking these shitty office jobs, working all day for £15k a year. And this next business is starting to grow fast, so there's a rolling effect compared to the first idea that helped me turn quite a few quick bucks earlier in the year.\n","name":"t1_cwz7qqk","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-11-13 20:42:55","week":46}

If they are the same condition and item you only need one listing. \nWhen creating your shipment you can choose what items you will be shipping, then who preps, andwho labels. It's .20 per label for Amazon to do so. For me it's more cost efficient to label myself. Since you are already creating the shipment all you have to do is print the labels and stick them on the item.

People are use to getting products within 3 business days.\n\nDropshipping straight from China...I would advise against unless you have a great relationship with your supplier and have already verified the quality of the product.\n\nMajority of people have their items shipped to them and then ship them out to their customers.\n \n1. Because you can add personal notes to show the consumer you care about them and appreciate the purchase; build a connection with your customers (referrals and second times purchases with result from this)\n\n2. Make sure you are sending out quality products and maybe create your own unique packaging to represent your brand &amp; differentiate from competition. \n\n3. Great to have pieces handy because you don't know who you will meet. I can't tell you how many times friends asked to see my shirts only for me to have to show them a picture vs the real thing.\n\nIn conclusion you might not want to hear this but unless your dropshipping from the U.S you might want to get multiple samples from your supplier overseas and then make your customers aware multiple times about the shipping estimate.

It is a fairly popular item, so she posts 12 available at a time with \"Buy It Now\" listings and generally sells all 12 in two or three days. \n\nAfter fees she makes a couple of bucks per, which isn't much, but what I taught her is that if you can find one product that you can make $2.00 on and sell a dozen and make $24, then you can find ten items and do the same and make $240... or a hundred and make $2,400 each time you list them.\n\nI'm going to help her by writing an app for her that will do all of the ordering automatically, so that way she just has to find and list the products using a GTS format, rinse, and repeat.\n\nShe recently found an item that she was able to buy for $20 less than it sells for on eBay (she buys them for $20 and it sells for $40).

I work in Seattle and I don't want a commute more than 45 min during rush hour so that limits the range of homes as well.  \n\nFor a while now the home inventory in the Seattle area has been low and the prices are rising quickly.  Amazon and Boeing are expanding and I think many people from California (cash buyers) are coming here as well.  The house I'm looking at now was $575 and bid up to $700, which is how I ended up here.  I think it's still a good investment with the growth that I think will continue, and the quality of the home, so I decided to move forward with the loan.","name":"t1_cx041du","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-14 19:28:21","week":46}

Cheap and looked great, and an easy thing to check off your list by planting early since they will grow and not die, like flowers.\n\nWe bought a cheap tripod and remote control for an iPhone on Amazon and set that up in a corner as a \"photo booth.\" Our guests loved it and took hundreds of hilarious photos. Photo booths are a fun activity for guests, but we got estimates around $2500! We spent maybe $30 on the tripod and remote control.\n\nI second the idea of getting a bunch of different cakes from Whole Foods. We did cakes/pies in different flavors, set up a \"dessert bar\" and saved tons of money. Plus it looks pretty!\n\nIf you know anyone who DJs, makes great food, etc....PAY THEM. Unfortunately people are just not reliable unless you have a contract and a payment understanding. We were lucky enough to have friends who are caterers and DJ's, and we figured out discounted rates we could afford with them. The friends who we lined up to help with services who refused payment ALL dropped out a month before, then we had to scramble AND pay full price for those services. People just don't see it as a commitment unless money is involved, unfortunately.\n\nYou can make a bunch of playlists and ask a reliable person in the wedding party to man the iPod.\n\nDesign/print invites/programs yourself.\n\nFind a unique and amazing wedding dress from a thrift or vintage store, or a used wedding dress service like oncewed.com \n\nIn general, avoid using the word \"wedding\" when talking to potential vendors.

{"id":"cx0onpd","author":"housesoftheholy","body":"Thank goodness the \"rustic\" look is in. Saved us a bunch on the wedding. \n\n1. Get creative with your flowers. Wildflowers, sunflowers from a grocery store, and baby's breath are all affordable options. I visited a friend in Portland and went lavender picking. It was $5 for as much lavender as you could fit in your hand. I got two big bunches, dried them, and used them for decorations as well. If you have a green thumb and time, you can grow your own flowers. Succulents are a fun option as well, and they easily propagate (for free!)\n\n2. Use mason jars for vases. You can also go to a thrift store and get secondhand vases. I've seen affordable options at Dollar General as well. \n\n3. Centerpieces - We did mason jars with a floating candle and a ribbon tied around it. We sprinkled silk flower petals on the tables for a little color and down the aisle (I think it was like $2 for 100 petals on Amazon. Worth). Tulle is very cheap, and we tied tulle bows around columns for some color as well. \n\n4. Speaking of Amazon, this was an amazing wedding resource for me. Got our guest book, ring pillow, cake cutters, tulle, ribbon,  from here. Very affordable. \n\n5. Dress. Check out Modcloth for wedding dresses. They have lots of cute short ones and a few long ones, too. See if your fiancee can borrow a veil from a relative or friend (something borrowed!). Go for mismatched bridesmaid dresses (something they already have) and groomsmen. \n\n6. Invitations - Vistaprint. Choose a template, type your info in, and they ship it to you. I think ours were about $60-70 for 100 of them. Email is free, though. You can do a wedding website through theknot.com, and guests can RSVP there (free). \n\n7. Venue - just make sure you have a plan B for rain, but outdoors is generally cheaper. \n\n8. Food - If I could do it again, I think I'd change this. Consider a morning wedding, with brunch options (finger food). Might save you on alcohol, too. If not, chicken, potatoes, and salad buffet style are pretty affordable.\n\n9. On thing I'd splurge on is the photographer. My friend went the cheaper route with this and the photographer was late, was visiting with guests when she was supposed to be taking pictures, and most of the ceremony photos were blurry and out of focus. My photographer was awesome, professional, and my favorite vendor to work with. Glad I splurged on him. \n\nCheck out r/weddingplanning!

{"id":"cx0xb0j","author":"luala","body":"I have a similar unique product on Etsy and Amazon but my problem is people don't know it exists and those sites tend to be search-based. Marketplaces are a good way to expand your audience but just listing isn't always enough. There's a chance people may be looking for adult colouring books and like the twist, I think it may be worth some sales. You're better off getting it in front of an audience that's known to like novelty or be seeking a gift for someone. That may be via quirky shops offline or online. Iwantoneofthose.com tends to deal with that sort of quirky novelty present and your book would fit into the gifts under £20 kind of category, for instance.\n\nPeople associate Amazon with books and in some places around 40% of people try Amazon first to look for anything, so you could pick up some sales from Amazon's massive audience. Etsy is easy to list on and cheap in terms of fees, but I'm not sure your audience would find you there. I suggest you see if other adult colouring books are selling on there. A rough way to judge this is to count the reviews. In general 1% of buyers might leave a review. That's really a loose guide to sales though.\n\nTL;DR worth a try but pick the right marketplace.

{"id":"cx195z2","author":"Mad-Dawg","body":"You'll need to think through what's most important to you. I you plan to carry a balance every once in a while, the you'll want the lowest interest rate. In my experience, credit unions offer very good rates.\n\nBut if you will never, ever carry a balance and you're more interested in rewards, it will depend on what type of rewards you want. Some cards are better for miles, some are better for cash back. It sounds like you're a cash back person. I have a Chase Freedom card that I like. No annual fee, 5% back on bonus categories (currently Amazon and some other things I don't remember), and 1% back on everything else. There's usually a small bonus when  you sign up and spend a minimum amount. \n\nAnd all of that depends on your credit score, which could be on the lower end if you don't have any credit history. In that case, you may need to start out with a secured card, which requires cash collateral.\n\nYou can check out your credit score (soft pull, won't count against your score) with creditkarma.com, and that can give you a better idea of what cards you'll qualify for.","name":"t1_cx195z2","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-11-15 21:35:29","week":46}

Amazon Balance Restrictions: Trading Amazon balance is frowned upon for security reasons, and is absolutely forbidden without moderator approval. If you still want to trade your Amazon balance, click here for instructions on how to request approval. Even if you do a trade where you are the one receiving Amazon balance from someone else, and that person did not have mod approval to offer it, you will also be subject to disciplinary action. Make sure anyone who is offering Amazon balance has moderator approval, with a public comment.\n\n5. $100.00 and over Gift Card Restrictions: If you are offering $100 or more in gift cards at a time (note that this can be, for example, 5 x $20 cards, or 1 x $100 card), you will need to verify the cards with the moderators before posting on the GCX. Click here and follow the instructions to message the moderators with verification. Please note that even if you are offering a little less than exactly $100.00, while you aren't required to contact us for verification, we'd still appreciate it, and we may end up removing your post and contacting you to be safe.
