I feel exhausted and I don't have much to show for it. I spent the entire week brand plugging. For those of you following my posts this is in regards to my brand [Caron &amp; Doucet](http:\/\/www.carondoucet.com). Here is what I did...\n\n1) Contacted 230 Bloggers, sent out samples to 25 of them, they are going to review on their websites (results will probably take a while im guessing)\n\n2) Set up google adwords, not much action going on there yet, it usually takes a good 2-3 days before something starts happening...\n\n3) Created a giveaway on my website, shared it on facebook etc, got 100 likes from friends and family. \n\n4) Started to do facebook advertising to get some traffic to hit that giveaway page. \n\n5) Hit up 6 big food related forums and started promoting the products in a discrete way.\n\n6) Set up Amazon sales channels. \n\nSo far I have collected 4 emails WOOW my own friends dont even care about the giveaway... not a good sign. I think I need to learn how to market this product on Twitter. I have yet to do much with that, not sure how to market on that platform...\n\nFor people who think the idea is not validated, I have a decent amount of wholesale orders from retailers in Canada and U.S\n\nUPDATE: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for all the wonderful feedback, I really mean it! Today my subscriptions are starting to come in. Ive been up since 4:30 a.m till now learning how to use photoshop.\n\n1) I changed all the product images \n2) Working on the homepage... \n3) Re writing the copy today\n\nMy friend is lending my his amazing camera and I will start shooting the videos real soon! \nTHIS IS BOOTSTRAP BRANDING!!!\n\n[You can see my updated post here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/2ymlov\/caron_doucet_update_3_website_changes\/)","4":"[H] $25 Disney Gift Card [W] Paypal or Amazon Gift Card","5":"First off, I really want to thank everyone and this thread for the help.

This was originally around $800, but one-time moving expenses and her not working for the first 3 months depleted it.\n\nLast Credit score: 696\n\n\nSO didn\u2019t get her job till about 3 months after we moved, things were extremely tight then, and are *slightly* more relaxed now.\n\nCurrent monthly bills:\n\nRent: 810\nUtilities (power, water, internet): 200\nGroceries: 250\nCar Insurance: 145 budgeted monthly, paid every 6 months\nMedications: 30\nGas: 40\nTotal, with car note and her loan payment: 1901\/mo\n\nThat leaves around 350\/mo left over each month. She also spends about 100-150\/mo on lunch at work (~$4-5\/day), though she\u2019s trying to start taking lunches to cut down on that. We have an entertainment budget of about 50\/mo, which goes mostly to Netflix, kindle books (that we get 5% back on) and online gaming. I\u2019ve been hanging onto the extra 100 or so a month, with the intent of holding as an emergency fund, but at the moment it\u2019s still mixed in with my general account.\n\n I\u2019ve recently started using YNAB, and am in the process of adding in all the bill and account details (neither of our banks allow statement export as anything other than pdf)\n\nFuture Possibilities:\nI've applied for several research positions on campus. If I get accepted, there\u2019s a 2200 stipend to work as a research assistant over the summer.\n\nAlso, my SO is on-track to replace the current studio manager when she leaves later this year (around May\/June). This would be about a 33% pay raise, in addition to 5 hours of guaranteed overtime per week, or about ~500\/mo extra on top of the 33% raise. So overall a 58% raise (before taxes). No one else is currently in training or qualified for the job, so it\u2019s almost as good as done.\nI\u2019m not going to *rely* on these two things happening to make ends meet, but I will include them in my plans.\n\nPlans:\n\n* Minimize spending wherever possible (i.e., making lunch at home and taking it to class\/work)\n* Look for a good savings account (considering ally, for the 0.99% interest)\n* Move more of our bills onto the cards (paid off every month) to maximize cash back.\n* Once I have a decent savings account, start building my emergency fund back up to 4-6K (2-3 months\u2019 worth of bills)\n* Consider merging our bank accounts (we\u2019ve been together 8 yrs) so that our finances are easier for me to manage (I\u2019m bad at financial things beyond basic budgeting, but good at organizing and planning)\n* Look into other savings options\/maybe an IRA, though I have less than 0 idea how to go about that . . .\n* Keep hunting for scholarships so I can cancel parts of my December loans.\n* My SO wants to start looking for a house once things get more stable financially wise. I\u2019d like to wait until we have that emergency fund built up to start looking.\n* Once our emergency fund in built up, I\u2019d like to divert most of our spare cash towards paying down our loans, most likely hers since they have the highest interest rates.\n\nSo\u2026having next to no practical experience with managing my own household, I\u2019ve had to go with what I could glean from research and guesswork. Are there any glaring flaws with this setup? Anything I can do better? Any suggestions or ideas? I\u2019ll take any advice you guys can give, gladly!\n\nEdit: formatting\n(Due in the OR in 30, I'll check this as soon as I get out, thanks in advance for reading!)\n","14":"Amazon customer service number Berkshire","15":"Amazon customer service number London","16":"Amazon Customer Service Number Cardiff","17":"3\/9\/15 Early Monday Movers: GM, XOM, AAPL, AMZN, BBRY, TSLA, DAL, MSFT, EBAY &amp; more","18":"[W] Amazon code 25 [H]Paypal 22.50","19":"[H] Amazon, Paypal, Google wallet [W] any Target cards","20":"In my free time over the past few weeks I have started throwing together a male fashion affiliate website (yuppieswag.com).

My name is Mitch, and I'm co-founder of MITVIS, a business based in Calgary that specializes in IT support and projects for small-medium companies in the area. Our differentiating factor is that we focus a lot on \"cloud\" technologies, and SaaS (software as a service) offerings (Office 365, Google Apps, Amazon AWS, Windows Azure, etc), and have a ton of experience with them.  We incorporated in July of 2013, and carry a few small clients, which are enough to pay our (already very low) overhead of hosting, email system, phones, etc.\n\nThe company was formed with me and a very good friend\/former coworker. We work well together, and have very clear visions of where we want the company. We both have tons of experience in the industry, and have used this \"side business\" for extra revenue now for the last couple years. Oddly enough, our entire main revenue stream has been website design, which we wanted to be a \"side income\" type thing. We are both IT consultants\/techs by trade. \n\nRecently, we were let go from our separate day-jobs, due to the falling price of oil, and how drastically that impacts Alberta. We've been looking for FT work as well, but we think this is a great time to take the business \"full time\". We recently relaunched our website (www.mitvis.com), and have been pouring tons of effort into social media, word of mouth, etc. We also just re-did our cards and truck magnets yesterday too, and I have to say - I think they look pretty great. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on what we can do to grow business? So far we have been on this roll now for 3 or 4 weeks, with very very little to show for it. We received one or two calls, but were unable to even understand the caller because they had such a thick accent. Essentially, no business whatsoever. \n\nThoughts? What can we do for free marketing\/advertising? We don't have a lot in the bank, and are still trying to feed ourselves with what little we have left. I welcome criticism as well, provided it's constructive!!!\n\n**Mitch Brown**\n\n**MITVIS Corporation**\n\n*Innovative I.T. for Business*\n\nEDIT: \/u\/anocweb is my business partner!","23":"The Four Horsemen: Amazon\/Apple\/Facebook &amp; Google--Who Wins\/Loses","24":"Jeff Bezos relies on lowly grunts like me: Life as a cog in the Amazon machine","25":"One of the best lectures I have watched on the future of Apple, Amazon, Google and FB.

I personally use ebay to sell mostly games and media and haven't run into a problem yet, but I'm always nervous about getting scammed; there's no shortage of ebay horror stories to keep that fear alive.  I'd heard about FBA, and it sounded like there'd be much better protection against sellers getting scammed, since Amazon has to check in the items and then ship them to the customer.\n\nI guess it turns out that's not the case?  I see the same instances of being having buyers say they were sent something \"not as described\" and then sending back bullshit in the box and still getting a refund, with the seller stuck with an unrelated or broken item.  I've seen some instances were Amazon reimburesd the seller after they provided proof the buyer screwed them, but not many.\n\nWhat are your opinions on the safest place to sell your stuff?","27":"Win $1000 in Amazon gift cards","28":"[H]$5 Amazon [W] $4.50 Paypal","29":"Looking to get rid of these codes...\n\n2x $75 Amazon codes\n\nComment PM and send me your offers ","30":"Willing to sell my $25 Amazon gift card for $21 Paypal.

But I've found, in my experience, that's changed. Completely. I got taken by a fraudulent seller for over $100. It was as cut and dried as a case could be, and Amazon did not honor their A-Z guarantee. The seller never replied to me OR to Amazon (which broke their own A-Z policy and should have resulted in an automatic refund to me). Amazon closed my claim almost immediately without consideration. Dumbfounded, thinking there must be some kind of mistake, I reopened it. One of their customer service reps then emailed me--somehow mistaking me for the seller--saying, \"Amazon loves their sellers! We know this customer is just trying to take advantage of you!\" I was livid. I emailed Jeff Bezos, twice. I thought for sure it would just take someone with a brain to look at the obvious and all would be good. But Amazon just kept reiterating the exact same nonsensical tripe, now directed to do so by Bezos himself. I was spending fruitless hours on this ridiculousness, and had to make the decision to cut my losses. Amazon actually *refused* to allow me to leave a perfectly accurate (non-disparaging) feedback comment on the product, as well! Since that time, I have had late orders, used merchandise being passed as new (a recurring them with Amazon), etc. I currently have an order where Amazon cancelled out two of the items on the order, stating that my address was undeliverable (tracking shows it didn't even ship out until after it was due to arrive to me, they must have recalled it), yet UPS and USPS deliver Amazon orders here nearly daily, including three other items from this same order that were shipped separately! They arrived 3 days late and I emailed Amazon about it after reading this post and asked what they do to compensate Prime members who, in goof faith, pre-pay the $99 subscription fee to repeatedly have their orders show up late, ETC. I haven't heard anything back, not even an automated response acknowledging my communication! Amazon has most definitely changed for the worse.

My boyfriend of 5.5 years has accepted a job right outside of DC staring in a month or two (in Maryland, but within walking distance of a metro station) and will be moving soon. Relationship wise he's perfect husband material (we love each other, both very responsible with money, respectfully discuss things instead of argue, etc.) and we want to live together before taking the plunge. My plan right now is to try to find a job in that area and move up from Atlanta when I graduate. \n\n\nI have an internship that pays $20\/hr (40 hrs a week) during the summer and research at $10\/hr (20 hrs\/week) during the school year. I also work for a babysitting agency once or twice a month (usually gigs where the kid is asleep most of the time so I can get paid to sit and study) and after taking out contractor taxes earn $100\/ month. I am completely independent from my parents (I helped them get back on their feet). My monthly expenses are as follows:\n\n\n* Rent: $375 (lease up in December)\n* Utilities (my part of it): $120\n* Car payment: $328 on a Nissan Versa (45 months left and 13.99% interest, no cosigner. Yes I know that was stupid of me. I was expecting to graduate a year sooner and pay it off immediately with my job) I owe about $11k on it\n* Car Insurance: $118\n* Health Insurance: $24 (obamacare)\n* Phone: $40\n* Gas: $100\n* Visa: $96 ($4,099 left at 15.55%, debt from when I was giving my parents cash and used my credit to make it work. Paying it down now.)\n* Discover: $40 ($1,700 at 18.99%, textbooks and suits for interviews)\n* Kohls and Amazon cards: $0 (payed off, both at 22% interest)\n* Food\/misc: $250 (bad take-out habit; started cooking crockpot meals at home) \n* Student Loans: $50 ($1367 including interest, federal subsidized, not concerned in the slightest until after graduation)\n\n\nMy internship want to hire me in Atlanta and according to Glassdoor I can expect to make $55-$60k a year. They have an office in the DC area, but they don't have a branch of my department (to my knowledge) working out of that office. My backup plan is to stay here and pay things off and visit every other weekend (with flights booked well in advance for $200 airfare) every other weekend. I have 9 months to decide\/prepare. I know that DC is crazy expensive and that I might have to sublet for a few months until his lease\/ room mate arrangement runs out. I expect to make $80k in that area.

I talked to the guy and he said he didn't know why they were taking them back, as he didn't hear anything about them selling them again.  He then went on to explain how much I could get, cash vs credit...and it was the same as the article explained.\n\nThe part that I didn't know, and I don't think the article discussed, was that if you sign up for their free card (not the $15\/year one...the basic one), you can get an additional 50%.\n\nThat's $37.50 in store credit for a PS2!!!\n\nOh and to make it a bit sweeter, most Gamestops sell gift cards, including Amazon gift cards. \n\nPS2 consoles are trending at around $40 on eBay...this is just about the same, and so much easier.

I recently placed an order with Amazon to the tune of roughly $1400. That main part of the order was a Lenovo Y50 laptop at roughly $1100. The rest of my order showed up as expected, but the laptop never did. Amazon said they would refund the amount. Then a few days later I received in email from Amazon Payments telling me I need to contact TRS. So I did. TRS claims my payment didn't go through. So while on the phone I checked my bank account and it stated otherwise. They say sorry, we'll check again. Now my Amazon account is on hold and I can do absolutely nothing with it. Well I call again the next day and they are very rude and demand I make another payment. I try to explain the situation and they are not helpful. So I get off the phone with them, spend the next hour with my bank verifying everything has gone through, got all of this documented from my bank and then try again. Same result, more hostility, no resolve.\n\nSo for the next week I am in contact with Amazon and TRS. Amazon does nothing other than tell me they will forward it to an Account Specialist. All this accomplishes is the same exact regurgitated email from Amazon Payments about TRS, absolutely nothing else. TRS refuses to do anything unless another payment is made even with proof that the money has been taken from my account.\n\nToday while chatting with Amazon, I spoke with a Manager\/ Member of the Leadership team who basically told me sorry nothing I can do and quickly ended the conversation with Have a good day and signed out. Needless to say that pissed me off.\n\nTLDR:\n\n * made $1400 purchase at amazon\n * Missing Laptop($1100) from said purchase\n * Contact Amazon, say will issue refund\n * get letter from Amazon to contact TRS\n * Contact TRS, they say they had trouble with my original payment and I need to pay again\n * verify with bank that the payment did indeed go through\n * Provide TRS with evidence, they reply with \"sorry wont dont anything until you make the payment, if it did indeed originally go through we will refund you\n * amazon has said they will forward my request for assistance to an Account specialist\n * This results in the same email from Amazon Payments to contact TRS\n * Today I speak with a member of the leadership team who says sorry nothing I can do, settle it with TRS, have a good day and signs off.\n\n\n * I'm currently out $1100 for the laptop which I need for work. TRS is demanding I pay an additional $1400 to settle with them. \n * Job is at risk because I dont have the computer\n\nSo what can I do at this point? I'm pretty astounded at how this has been handled and now I'm at risk of losing my job. ","121":"I've got 1 $50 Amazon code. Lowest rep goes first. Thanks. No trades.

I'm a 23 year old living in a very small town. When I was 18 I started buying on Craigslist and selling on Ebay. For an 18 year old I was making what I considered good money, around $300 per day. (Not literally per day, but on average, you know what I mean). I did this until I was 21. I had a really good amount of money saved up, in my mind I was on top of the world and destined for great things. I drove a corvette, had my own house, had dropped out of college, and was living on craigslist and had the opportunity to play with every single new gadget on the market, then sell it for even more. Life was good (Yes I'm making this sound a bit more luxurious and wonderful than it was, in actuality I was 20 and flipping second hand crap on craigslist and driving a car I shouldnt have bought). \n\nThen I turned 21. My father, his grandfather, his great grandfather, were all alcoholics (here I go...). My mother always told me it was genetic. I didnt believe her, I had self control, I was 21, I was going to have fun! Fun I had, I went to parties and drank all day. Eventually I was slamming down a half bottle of everlcear in my room at night with the lights off. I didnt have time for craigslist cause I was too busy being drunk from 9 am to 9 pm, then passing out cold on my kitchen floor. One night, Feb 13th to be exact, I was plastered in my office playing Civ 5 and doing nothing producrtive what-so-ever. A friend calls me up \"Hey come over, we're going to drink and play Smash\". (Here I go.. Again). I drove to his house which was about 5 minutes away. We drank, played Smash, and did nothing useful all night. A girl at his house started something with me, things got angry, and being too sloshed to think straight I decided I was GOING HOME RIGHT NOW. I got in my car and decided \"its 5 minutes fuck it\". I drove back to my house.. In the oncoming lane. I wound up being pulled over, arrested, charged and found guilty of DUI.\n\nMy \"career\" was over and I was about to go broke. Before I continue, let me get something straight. At the time I was in a bad place. Selfish, only cared about money, no regard for anyone else. What I did was horrible, reckless, dangerous, and I deserved everything I got. To be honest I am glad I was pulledover and charged. I could have hurt or killed someone, and I am cringing right now just typing this out. I dont remember the drive home, only bits and pieces. I dont want it to sound like im glorifying or bragging about this, because I know it's hard to read emotion over text on the internet, but I do regret and feel horribly about what I did and I'm glad I was caught before something bad happened to anyone.\n\nAnyway, I spent $25k on lawyer fees, and various other crap. I sold my car, sold my house, had to move back in with my parents. I had $150k in my bank account and did not know what I could possibly do without a license. I had lost it for a year. Craigslist was over, I had no chance of finding a job. I decided to try out Amazons FBA program. You buy wholesale and sell on Amazon. I spent $40k on inventory immediately with no research out of a desperate attempt to make it back on top and get myself together. I sold it all for $30k. a $10k loss. I did this over and over and over and over again for the entire year until I had basically nothing in my bank account. The entire year was me drinking, quitting drinking, drinking again, making drunk whoelsale purchase, forgetting to pay taxes. It was a mess. Everything was a sham. I had $2k left. My last chance. I decided I'd start a business selling e-juice ( the stuff people put in e-cigs). To keep it short, I spent the $2k on supplies. No one bought. I was fucking broke. I had nothing at all. I was 21 and living with my parents. No car. No money. I lost everything I ever had.\n\nI quit drinking, I got help, and I was 22 with my license back. I realized a lot. I realized chasing money is pointless. Chasing success is pointless. Life is to be enjoyed. Life is what you make of it and money is the last thing that matters. If you can afford to do what you want, and support your family, who cares how many 0's are at the end of your bank account? I sure dont. Not anymore, at least. I'm 23 now. It's March 13th and I have my license back, I'm ready to start back on craigslist, get out of my parents house and get back on my feet. I closed my business, the one I've been filing zero returns on for months, and I'm starting fresh. I have never felt better.","169":"Link your account with Amazon, and you get a $15 promo code. \n\nAmazon redemptions for TYP are a lame 1pt:.8ct, so it's not worth using this in the long term. \n\nYou must use at least some amount of TYP on the order for it to be eligible for the $15 coupon code. \n\nAs an example, I ordered a $30 item and used $1 of TYP (125 points).

Would love to hear what people think.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dual-Momentum-Investing-Innovative-Strategy\/dp\/0071849440","197":"http:\/\/freonshopper.com\n\nI started this website last August with the intention of offering relative industry information as well as selling refrigerants to HVAC contractors or to individuals. \n\nFast forward to today and I have over fifty blog posts all with good content. I have quite a bit of content in the FAQs section and in other pages as well. I'm averaging about 3,000 views per month. ( I know not a lot, but it is a niche.)\n\nI 'sell' cylinders individually by using Amazon or E-Bay affiliate programs. I make some money doing this but not enough. \n\nI then offered bulk purchasing for bigger companies. Basically, they fill out a form and it e-mails to me and I work on a quote. Well, I received inquires on bulk purchasing and found that I couldn't be as competitive as I needed to be. Customer's weren't biting. \n\nSo, I had another idea of whenever I get a bulk request I forward it to various refrigerant distributors that i know of. They then contact the customer and give the customer the best deal they can. I'm forwarding about 1-3 requests a week to various companies. (Each potential sale is over $4,000 each.) I've been doing this for a about a month and the companies I forward to are always grateful but I never hear much after that.\n\nExpanding on the bulk purchasing idea I had the idea to start a 'Preferred Partner' program where distributors would pay me monthly for space on my page and for first dibs on bulk orders. I haven't had any interested clients yet but feel that this has potential to expand. (Maybe 3-4 distributors paying $1,000 a month each)\n\nI am getting good feedback on my blogs and people in the industry seem to enjoy them. But, I want to make some decent money with this site. I know the niche works from previous experience and today I forwarded on a potential $15,000 order to a distributor.\n\nNow, if you're asking why don't I just fulfill the orders myself? I can't at this time... but that is the ultimate goal. Today, I am bootstrapping this and don't have any disposable income besides the site. On top of that, distributors in the US leave me at an uncompetitive price. I would need to import from China in order for it to work. I'm hoping to get some decent income coming from the site and then I can eventually branch out.","198":"[H] Amazon $50($25x2) [W] Paypal $45(90%)","199":"$13 Amazon.com GC (in form of 2x $5 GCs, 1x$3) for $11.50 (88%) US Paypal.

The Zymox stuff is for treating ear infections.  It has great ratings on Amazon and is working well for us.\n\n * $50 saved - Grooming him with the Oster Classic 76 clippers my wife uses on my hair.\n\n * * We were concerned that the noise would freak him out, but he is thankfully okay with it.\n\nThere are some initial and recurring expenses along with time spent doing it, but we almost certainly save time doing it on our own and definitely save a lot of money.

Many people order on Amazon and every week I'd get several suitable boxes and often bubble wrap and air pillows were in the boxes. \n\nAlso if you ask at Target or Wal Mart you can find out a good time and they will save them up for you. Finally, if you get a bit more advanced, find a packaging supply company in your area. Figure out what size boxes they offer. They usually sell in bundles of 25. Order a variety of 3-5 sizes, a bundle or two each. Get a roll of kraft paper or bubble wrap. You also might know someone who works in a shop or office that has spare bubble wrap from shipments. I wouldn't really mess with foam peanuts. People mostly hate those.","281":"[They announced the change a while ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SwagBucks\/comments\/2u7ptq\/a_few_new_changes_to_our_rewards_store\/). Also note that the discount is not exclusive to Amazon. You get one discounted $25 gift card per month (excluding PayPal~~\/Visa~~).","282":"Edit: Amazon GC still available","283":"We buy toiletries, cleaners, paper towels, etc on Amazon. You don't have to spend it all at once.  ","284":"Amazon is really useful, because not only could you get an awesome toy for yourself (like the radar detector,) you can also get a number of household supplies with it. It can be very useful for every day purchases.\n\nSome examples of the things I get on Amazon:\n\n*  Toilet paper\n*  Paper towels\n*  lightbuls\n*  redbull\n*  soap refills\n*  deodorant\n*  shaving cream\n*  shower liners\n*  spare charging cables\n*  ziploc bags\n*  socks\n*  hand warmers\n*  soda\n*  umbrellas\n*  mouse traps\n*  garbage bags\n*  portable phone batteries\n*  fire extinguishers\n*  air conditioner units\n*  printer ink\n\nNext time you have a household purchase, instead of getting it at the store, why not just get it on amazon, and save the money? You don't have to spend it all at once. You load the balance, and you can use it bit by bit until it runs out.","285":"Prime is a great idea. The free, fast shipping throughout the year means you can buy basic necessities on Amazon instead of having to go to the store. That will save you travel costs and time, and will also get you more competitive rates on the basics that you would have to buy anyway.","286":"That seems a little overpriced. I go to Safeway and buy a 24pack of Charmin for $14.95. And even on Amazon the double-quilted 'quilted northern' is $23.94 on Prime for 48 rolls.","287":"Off topic, but which model are you using?  The ones I see on Amazon look awesome and from the future, but are $400-$800","288":"Personally, I find my Amazon orders are large enough that I get free shipping anyway so I don't bother with Prime. If the streaming music and video service is appealing to you then Prime can be be a really great deal.\n\nIf you order household supplies like others on here have suggested you can use Subscribe and Save for a discount and free shipping.","289":"I'm highly interested in this.  How come Alibaba isn't a massive competitor?  I thought they were rolling in it and do the same thing, basically, as Amazon.  Doesn't that mean they're gonna clash hard?","290":"You can ferociously study \/r\/flipping for the next few days and then visit your local thrift shops. Use that $100 to build up your initial inventory to sell on Amazon and eBay. \n\nAlternatively you can use it for some retail arbitrage. Or maybe a mix of both. ","291":"You can buy groceries on Amazon and have it shipped to your house. Or clothing you need. \n\nIf you really don't want to shop on Amazon, list it on ebay and get $250 for it. ","292":"\/r\/fullfilmentbyamazon you list items on Amazon and ship them in bulk to their warehouse. They deal with the shipping to customers whenever it sells. It means cheaper shipping, less work but higher fees which can be offset further by the fact that FBA prices can be a bit higher and are generally preferred by buyers for the quick shipping over merchant fulfillment.\n","293":"I sell PS2s on Amazon regularly for around $50 each. This is supposed to be the flipping subreddit...you guys should get more creative.","294":"Depending on the size and need.  I buy bubble mailers from Amazon at about $.20 a piece and use almost all priority packaging for anything bigger. thats free.  Use newspapers for free cushioning when you crush it up into balls","295":"There are many sites you can sell your cards to and you can sell then for a loss on Craigslist and Facebook.  Amazon is big so you shouldn't have to lose too much in value","296":"Lesson #1 never buy cables, peripherals, and\/or accessories at a brick and mortar stores unless you know you got super deal (once bought network cables for 10 cents each at Staples). Stores like BB gouge prices on these things. Don't get me started on the monsterly cable brand either.\n\nLesson #2 if in need of these items always shop online. You will find the best deals. Monoprice.com has quality cables but sucks one must pay shipping. The only thing is it takes time to receive. If in a rush there is always Amazon. And if you want to go super cheap order on eBay via China sellers. Only thing is you might get pure crap and takes at times a month to get. Another little tip: see what China sellers are offering. Then buy the same from a US based seller. You will pay a little more but will get it a whole lot sooner.\n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck.","297":"I got a good deal. As I said, I needed a cable, and didn't want to wait a day or two (even though Amazon has pretty guaranteed same\/next day shipping near me) for it. Worth the extra few bucks for the same cable.","298":"Posting a direct affiliate link to Amazon is a huge TOS violation and amazon will ban your account without notice (plus not paying out any of your earnings in the last 2 months). I made this mistake once but because my blog drives a large volume to amazon, they gave me a chance to fix it up. ","299":"Houses Labels on Amazon. Great prices and quality","300":"Amazon, the first page is always the under cutters and new people who basically give their stuff away. If you have a console with both cords and at least 1 controller, usually better with 2, you'll sell it within 1-2 weeks. Because the people who actually want a ps2 and know what they are looking for go to page 2,3,4 until they get to a seller with a complete console and good feedback. I keep seeing people complain that ps2s only go for about 20-30 around and I just don't get why they are settling for that.","301":"If you sell on ebay that is about what they go for, good to know about Amazon though.","302":"I have a bunch of cutting boards, including one pretty nice bamboo one.  I bought it probably 10 years ago and some oil along with it.  The bottle is still almost completely full because I've only oiled my board twice.  I'm always reaching for my LDPE cutting boards because they're much easier to clean.\n\nThe problem I see you having is that there isn't enough here to build a brand.  No one feels an emotional connection to cutting board oil.  The closest brand that I'm aware of would be Method cleaning products.  But they have lots of SKUs that customers will have almost daily interaction with and they heavily leverage the \"all natural, eco-friendly\" spin.  \n\nEven you did find some people with a fanatic devotion to your product, there aren't enough of them (nor would they consume enough of your products) to provide for a sustainable business.\n\nMy recommendation would be to eliminate all but one SKU.  Rebrand the product to focus on it's specific benefits (not a grandiose lifestyle brand).  And then sell it exclusively on Amazon.  Get your bloggers to buy and rate it on Amazon.com.  If you eventually hit a home run, grow the brand with additional SKUs at that point.","303":"Yea, somehow I don't think any of us are doing more volume than Amazon","304":"It's all about the unique value you can add to the product. For instance, Amazon adds a lot of value to commodity products by having superior reviews, 1-click checkout, and free 2-day delivery (Prime). Not to mention their customer service is fantastic.\n\nThere are lots of ways you can add value. Maybe you have the best video resources for how to get the most out of the product. Maybe you are focused on building communities around the products you sell.\n\nThere are so many ways to add value beyond the product itself and that's the best way to stand out. Competing on price alone only gets you so far.","305":"Also, just to clarify things.  I have been thrifting for about 2 months now, building up inventory.  I have shipped 2 boxes to Amazon FBA, and I utilize Amazon MF and eBay.  My first sale was 3 weeks ago.","306":"I have the Discover it as my rotating categories card. I would recommend something with set rewards, chase freedom will just rotate again (nothing wrong with that, just not my cup of tea). I have cards for each category I usually spend on every month.  \n  \n  first, I would say, wait until there is a signup bonus for a card before applying. I got approved for my discover it card only to find a link on amazon the next day where I could have gotten $100 gift card for getting approved.  \n  \n  My card system is as follows:  \n  1) Bank of America Cash Rewards (3% back on gas, 2% groceries, 1% everything else)  \n  2) American Express Blue Cash Everyday (3% back on groceries, 2% gas\/department stores)  \n  3) Amazon Visa (3% back on amazon, 2% gas\/restaurants, 1% everything else)  \n  4) Capital One Quicksilver Visa Signature (1.5% on everything)  \n  5) Discover It (5% back on Gas through march, 5% dining and movies april-june, 5% home improvement july-september, 5% amazon october-december)  \n  \n  This way I get something back for things I buy every month. it may not seem like much, but it adds up between all of the cards to be a few hundred I cash out at the end of each year. All of these are no annual fee.  \n  \n  these are the best I've found for the categories I use all the time. The only other card I wish I got for a little extra would be the Citi double cash card (Mastercard). This nets you 1% back on all purchases, and another 1% when you pay it off (2% total if paid in full every month avoiding interest).   \n  \n  hope this helps  \n  \n  edit: So, almost anything Visa or Mastercard will be taken if your Discover isn't accepted. Visa Signtaure tends to be favored over higher end mastercards is what I've found from my research","307":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

The classic example is Amazon's way of buying books versus Apple's. \n\nSometimes it better aligns the incentives of the store and the product provider.  However if you're a buyer with a lot of buyer power, you would'nt agree because you should theoretically be able to capture more value through buying wholesale.  This does not take into account a slidihg scale of percentage of profits based on product scarcity however. ","309":"I really enjoy my Chase Amazon Rewards card. It's a visa. It has somewhat high interest rates (14%) but if you pay it off in full it doesn't really matter.  Every purchase you make you get points you can redeem on Amazon.  I've had the card for 8 months now and I've gotten about $80 of Amazon credit for just using it for purchases instead of using my debit card like I used to. ","310":"It seems like the numbers are pretty close. 6k grocery on a SallieMae nets you $180, whereas your card gets you $360, but that drops to $210 after the annual fee. Keep in mind the SallieMae gets you 5% back on Gas as well, over your 3%, and you also get 5% at bookstores. (Amazon is included in this.) I still think the SallieMae edges a bit above, but they're both good cards! ","311":"I like it so far. The surveys aren't really long, and they usually deal with current events so it's always something new.  I've been doing it since September I think. In the US it's 500 points per survey, and occasionally I get a 1000 point survey. I usually average 5 surveys a week, sometimes I'll get two or three surveys a session though.\n\nI haven't actually cashed out yet. The pts\/$ rate is kind of wacky, in that it improves the higher you cash out at. Like a $100 Amazon card is 100,000 points, a $50 one is 65,000 and a $15 is 35,000. So I decided to wait until I get to 100,000 before I redeem for a $100 Visa prepaid (currently at 86,000).","312":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

As any succeed then Bitcoin by functional necessity will rise in value.\n\nBy owning Bitcoin I don't have to pick winners (facebook or MySpace, Amazon or pets.com) I'm invested in the industry itself which, as with the early days of the internet, if you understand this new technology isn't such a speculation.\n","315":"I didn't buy on Amazon and I don't see the model I have there. I can tell you though that this is my third salad spinner; the first was simple with a crank on top. The second had a pull string, and was fun, but the third one has a spring inside a large button\/spindle on top and one pushes down to make it spin. Like an old-school toy top. I like that one best. They last a long time, and I \"upgraded\" as needed since I have joint problems. Hope that helps.","316":"\/u\/NotLawrence\n\nLook at the Sallie Mae by Barclay. It offers 5% back on groceries, gas, and bookstores.\n\nGas and groceries are limited to $250 monthly ($12.5 reward) while the bookstores are limited to $750 monthly. \n\nItems sold by Amazon count toward the 5%. Items **sold** by Amazon, not just fulfilled. However, you can go around this loophole by purchasing Amazon gift cards with a 5% discount, **I think.** Digital purchases don't count neither. ","317":"Yeah. Amazon can do all this natively.","318":"OP, let's just call it - you're not going to sell much of your product on your website.  Proctor &amp; Gamble doesn't sell Tide direct.  There IS a tide website, but its not selling anything directly.

No, they either buy it at Target\/Walmart\/Home Depot, or they go online to their favorite online mega store (Amazon\/WalMart\/Target) - where they already have an account, buy it, and call it a day.   Your success getting into retailers is awesome, and really its where your product belongs.  There's always room for a better product, a better brand.  Run with that.  Make your website a brand story, a page for retailers to contact you, remove the retail element all together.

I don't have a landline, so I use my cellphone.  Look into plans through places like StraightTalk vs. AT&amp;T, etc.\n\nCoupons.  If I do have to make a purchase, I always look online first.  Retailmenot is a great tool to use if you do have to make that purchase.  I also use websites such as iheartwags.com, coupon forums, slickdeals.net, iheartthemart.com.  Also look into shopping at places like Aldi vs. Walmart.   Also consider doing this:  if you want to make a purchase-sit on the thought for 30 days.  I've found that if I want to buy something (no matter how big or small) and it wasn't something I needed, I waited 30 days.  By then, the urge had passed.\n\nIf your credit cards have a higher interest rate, try getting a personal loan to pay them off or pay all them down under 50%.  Also look into doing balance transfers to a card that offers 0% interest for 12-18 months.  You can also call your credit card companies and ask for an interest rate reduction.  Every % helps.\n\nI also hide my credit cards.  I have a safe, and I put all of them except for one in it.  That one card travels with me in the case of an emergency, and it has the lowest available balance.  I also have a sticky-note on it that reads:  Is it something you want, or something you need?  That way, I'll feel guilty and more less likely to buy a want item.\n\nI also use a website called Swagbucks.  I don't use it as often as I should anymore, but one year I was able to redeem enough swagbucks to buy my entire Christmas shopping with Amazon gift cards.\n\nPlan your week out ahead of time.  I used to get in my car and go all the time, because I forgot to get this or that, or had to run here or there.  Now that I plan my week out, I consolidate my trips and therefore save on gas.  It also gives me time to plan grocery shopping and match up coupons, deals, etc. at the same time.\n\nDo you use cash for purchases?  Get a mason jar or any kind of jar, etc. and put all your change in it.  Don't touch it until it's full.  In less than 6 months my S\/O and I had a mason jar full of change and it ended up being $96.00 worth of change.  We took that and put it into a savings account but it could be easily used to pay extra on your debt.\n\nSomething else I struggled with but eventually did:  exchange pop\/soda for water.  I never realized how expensive pop is.\n\nI can't stress this one enough: CROCK POT RECIPES!!!  I can cook a batch of chicken chili for less than $10.00 and it lasts my S\/O and I 4 meals each!  I have one that allows you to program your temp and time, and once that time is reached it switches over to \"Warm\" so I can safely cook my meals while at work (although I plan it out to be home before the food is actually done).  Crock pot meals can be anything from bread to chili to lasagna!  There are tons of recipes online and it truly is a great way to fix bulk meals for cheap AND EASY!\n\nAnother idea: overtime.  Does your company offer overtime?  I work at a company that allows me to have overtime, and I use every cent of my overtime earnings towards my debt.\n\nI don't consider myself frugal, but I do try and minimize spending and I'm always constantly aware of my debt and what I need to do to get it paid off quickly.","321":"They offer the same here in the US, but be warned that the day those 6 months expire it will automatically charge you for the next year or prime (at half price).

You might want to take a look at the Amazon.com credit card - often times they allow you to purchase camera items for 12 months no interest. My wife is a professional photographer and when she started out that is what we did (well, for the endless lenses) so she bought the equipment and then would shoot the gigs and use her earnings to pay off the loan. \n\nI am not at all sure, but from a utilization perspective I believe it pulls from all your cards. No reason not to have multiple credit cards.\n\nAnd if you are just needing to extend your credit amount to make an online purchase, but not to finance the camera and equipment, you could just \"send\" the CC company the necessary amount so you have a positive (negative?) balance when you buy the equipment.","323":"Yes, it actually does.

They did all work but still definitely worth it.. Hard to say what my profit is since I buy in weird lots and bundles for cheap, but I got them for next to nothing. You're definitely ahead of the ball if you trade in incompletes. Even the completes are an OK deal, but less so. It's valuating a 7.50 trade in value for a ps2 controller, ac adapter, and av cord, bring a total complete trade in value at 37.50.

","336":"There's really only three options since money is a zero sum game:\n\n1) Decrease spending to put more money toward the debt (and feel like you're poor).  If this doesn't happen, it will be almost impossible to kill the debt.  Keep in mind, the existence of consumer debt means you've been living beyond your means for a while now, so even just living within your means won't be enough to make up for the past.\n\n2) Increase income without increasing spending- 2nd jobs, sell things you have on CL or Amazon to put the money toward the debt.  Take this strategy if you'd rather sacrifice your time than cut your spending.\n\n3) Neither of the above, pay off credit card debt for years and years, preventing you from living the life you want in the future\n\nThe first step is to make a budget you both agree with.  As you pay down the debt, you'll want to direct all the extra payments to the debt with the highest interest rate, so it is important to find those out.  It should be on the billing statements for the cards.  If any have 0% interest for a promotional period, be sure to pay them off before any back interest is added on!\n\n&gt; I'd like to put $2,000 savings, and save $800 to redo our floors since the plan is to sell the house once we're in a decent spot and the floors need to be redone.\n\nWhere are you planning to live after you sell the house?\n\nRegarding the OT and the personal spending of 50\/week, I see you're getting a lot of crap over that, but I don't think it will be easy to go from buying whatever you want to buying nothing. So here's an alternate idea- personal spending for the month = overtime from last month.  Potentially just leaving 289 at the end of the month is no where near enough, especially since there's a ton of misc expenses that you haven't budgeted for like wedding gifts, doctor copays, car registration.

","345":"Buy low and sell high works, but you can do it in reverse: (borrow the stock and) sell high, then buy low (to give the stock back to the person you borrowed it from.)\n\nThis is called shorting a stock, and it can get you in trouble.   As an example, let's pretend it's January 2013 and you're convinced that Netflix and Amazon are hugely overpriced, and rumors are coming out that Netflix is having trouble licensing content, Amazon and Apple are about to get into the business, and so on.  You think it's an easy short, so you sell 100 shares at $100.  You get $10,000 up front, and you hope to ride the stock down to zero so you can buy it back for nothing.\n\nThen, it comes out that Icahn has bought into Netflix, and between January 14th and January 21st the stock shoots up to $170 per share.  Guess what?  You're $7,000 in the hole - a 70% loss in less than a month.  If you held on for another year you'd find the stock at $448 - closing the position now means it'll cost you $44,800.  Subtract the $10,000 you made up-front and you've lost better than 300% of your bet size.  If you'd simply bought the stock and it had traded all the way down to zero, the most you'd lose is 100%.  So shorting can be riskier than being \"long only\" (buying stocks and hoping they go up.)\n\nSurprise news can move stocks quickly, really hurting short positions.  This is especially true with heavily shorted stocks - if lots of people are short a stock and it starts to rise in price, the short sellers will start to buy it back in a hurry to cover to minimize losses, resulting in a \"short squeeze\" where the stock rises surprisingly fast.  I've seen movement of 100% in lightly traded stocks in a couple of days.\n\nSo, if you want to short, then manage the position closely and have a tight stop, or buy a call option as insurance in case the position moves against you.  I tried shorting Apple at $300 a while back and watched it go to $400 on me.  That would have been a 33% loss except I'd bought matching calls so my downside was limited to 10%.  That was a good lesson for me (Keynes was right when he said \"the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.)","346":"I have a Brother printer.

Trying to avoid each and every scam is going to take too much time and effort, you don't want to avoid a major market like eBay or Amazon because you're afraid you'll be scammed.","350":"Time to start trimming that budget. The big things I see that can be cut significantly in the short term:\n\n*Cable $170 - This is a firehose spraying your money out the window. Drop the cable package, just get internet, and pick up a subscription to Netflix, Hulu Plus, or Amazon Prime. This will save you somewhere around $100\/month, maybe more, depending on the options in your area.\n\n* Phone: $150 - This is an outrageous number if you're in debt. You can get inexpensive plans from Ting, Republic Wireless, etc. It may be worth the early termination fees to cut that cost down.\n\n*Electricity $145 - Holy crap, that's a lot of juice. Identify what's the money hog (AC\/heat is pretty typically the biggest drain) and reduce it. Letting your temp drop by 2-3 degrees in winter and go up by an extra 2-3 degrees in summer can save you a lot of money over the long run. Once you've gotten used to that kind of a swing, you can save a bit more by opening up a touch more and letting the temp in winter drop to mid-low 60's and the temp in summer up to 75-80.\n\n*Transport $996 - This is pretty high. Do you drive an old gas guzzler, or are you just commuting two hours each way? Can you sell the car that has a payment, buy something more fuel efficient without a loan, etc?Just dropping the loan will let you change your insurance policy to a less expensive one, likely freeing up over $300\/month right there.\n\n*Lunch Money\/Dining Out $195 - Stop. Eating. Out. You are underwater. Bring leftovers for lunch. Cook at home for all meals. Every dollar you spend there instead of spending on your debt is costing you the interest payments as well.\n\n*Grooming $25 - Can this be trimmed? (Sorry for the pun.) Is this something your pet can do without, or that you\/your wife can buy the tools to do yourself?\n\nIn addition to the above, what about (dare I say) moving to a smaller house (I dared!)? I know that's a longer term item, and one that many people find unpalatable, but a combined housing cost of $2500+\/month when you make $5200\/month is a bit high, and that's before factoring in that you're spending $425\/month in commute costs. Downsizing a little and moving closer to work could make a huge difference in your budget.\n\nAlternatively, could you look into a mortgage refinance that would reduce the monthly rate in exchange for a few more years of time, letting you pay a bit less now, then turn around and pay more as your budget catches up?","351":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

It's almost certainly going to sell the next time someone goes to buy that specific book and then the best value for the condition and shipping speed they are looking for will get the sale.  If your book is in better condition than the one selling for 25, you have two options.  Do you want the next sale that occurs on that book, or do you want the next sale that occurs on your books condition.

This was maybe 5 years ago and I've only used about 25 of them so far. I have a beard so I just use them to prevent neckbeard. I feel like I'll be dead before I run out of razor blades.","380":"You can get very varied sampler packs on ebay or Amazon with five or ten or more brands for a minimal price. I went from multiblade to straight razor to a safety and the safety is by far the most cost effective and best shave:maintenance ratio for me.","381":"For gas\/food\/online?

No question. \n\n5% on grocery up to $250\/mo\n5% on gas up to 250\/mo\n5% at bookstores up to 750\/mo (includes almost all Amazon.com purchases)\n\nYou can also link it so the cashback pays your loans down.  But that is optional, you can also redeem for statement credit.  You do not need to have a Sallie Mae loan to get the card.","382":"The Fusion cartridges really are that expensive and if you're stretching out replacements to save money, you're not getting a good shave.\n\nI quit using cartridges when I got tired of the constant price hikes.  Today, I get 50 Feather blades off Amazon for around $20.  That lasts me a year.  I spend another $10 or so a year for shaving soap and witch hazel, as an aftershave.  Shaving costs me $25-$30 a year.  Further, I'm getting the best shaves I've ever had.  No irritation and I stay clean for hours longer than with a cartridge.\n\nI took the money I saved over a year and bought some nice BIFL shaving equipment.  One is a nice Pils stainless razor.  It's a gorgeous piece of equipment made of stainless.  Gillette's modern razors are plasticky and look like they were designed to excite nine year-old boys.  The Pils is strictly for adults.  So are many other razors.  \n\nNext, I picked up a nice scuttle.  Has a barber ever put hot lather on you to trim up around your ears and neck?  A scuttle gives you hot lather in your own bathroom.  Sounds like a luxury, but it's one of those things you can't live without after you've tried it.\n\nThen I got a very nice silvertip badger brush from Rooney.  It's wonderful.  And it will last a lifetime, like the razor and scuttle will.\n\nFinally, you don't hack yourself up with a safety razor.  That's why it's called a safety razor.  More likely, you'll just get poor shaves before you learn to use it correctly.  I'd have patches of stubble while I was learning.\n\nOverall, it's just a better experience.  I like to use shaving tools that were made for adults, not plastic children's toys.  Plus it costs less and you get better shaves.","383":"I used to work for a software company that made software to track all of that (their receiving, inventory, orders, billing, etc). I now work in a related but different position. Generally it is called 'warehousing' or 'fulfillment'. \n\nIn my experience it is definitely profitable, but it really varies a lot based on not only your operation but on your customers (the ones who's stuff you store\/ship). I've dealt with mom and pop places that had 1-5 small clients (talking less than a hundred orders\/shipments a month) to huge multinational companies that send\/receive way more than that in an hour. \n\nThere is definitely money to be made, but there's a lot of competition and it definitely depends on what services you offer and how you run your shop. Are you old school and very manual? Do you rely heavily of automation or software to manage your inventory and processes? \n\nI guess the first thing you need to secure is space and a client, but I'd definitely recommend getting a good software application to help. No company uses the exact same software, so you need to be flexible from client to client in order to offer what they need (that is accept any information they provide, give them info they want\/need back like billing, inventory reports, etc)\n\nI'm not sure how much you know already but definitely read up on the industry and companies like the one your friend's dad runs and even ones like Amazon to get a feel for the day to day stuff. There's more to it than getting paid to store and ship stuff. Do you bill the client based on only what comes in\/goes out? Do you charge for storage fees over time? Do you give volume discounts? Do you offer them to manage their goods in your warehouse? Do you have a relationship with FedEx\/UPS\/DHL to get cheaper shipping rates? Do you pass that back to the customer?","384":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Not a hope in hell.\n\n\nI can see why he rushed through his charts there. He says \"Amazon may be the most innovative company in retail in the last 10 years BUT\" and then starts talking about stock returns within the last five years. This is disingenuous because Macy's et al pay a dividend and Amazon don't, so of course a returns chart is going to favour Macy's in a period where their dividend increased a lot. Does not paying a dividend signal a problem now? Stock returns aren't a sole metric by which to judge a company's demise, but it seems like that's what he's doing. Why isn't he comparing any other metric? (Obvious answer is obvious)\n\n\nHe also says that brick and mortar retailer's growth in e-commerce is outpacing Amazons. Duh. He's comparing retailers that had *zero* e-presence to an e-commerce company, of course their growth is higher than Amazon's. If I start up an online lemonade stand tomorrow I might just outpace Amazon's growth in e-commerce :o\n\n\nWhy is he making the snide remark about Amazon trying to smother retailers via access to cheap capital? One, i'm looking at their balance sheet and I can't see much debt on it. Secondly, if they have access to cheap capital, why wouldn't they use it? This is normal.\n\n\nThen he starts saying that Amazon's problem is that their shipping costs are increasing, but doesn't even question why they're increasing. Why are they increasing? Because Amazon are now shipping TV's and pool tables and people's consumable items. This, at the same time that their revenue has increased 20% yoy. But increased shipping costs signal a problem? Is it not more a case that these increased shipping costs, combined with massively increased revenue, shows just how dominant Amazon are?\n\n\nThere's also an approximately zero percent chance that random fucking people are going to start delivering packages.

And even though the Uber model *can* be good for the end user, it's still facing legal challenges around the world. Successful legal challenges. On top of that, Uber makes sense in the domain of moving people around metropolitan areas where all you need is a car, but does that translate to a domain that requires monumental fixed assets to be a player in, and requires national reach? Ships, ports, aircraft, landing slots at airports worldwide, fleets of trucks, lorries...and then...centralised package hubs, delivery schedules, national delivery routes. Amateur delivery men within metropolitan areas aren't a substitute for aspects of this, and the implementations of this that have existed already show these problems in terms of diseconomies of scale (Kosmo), amateur work ethic (Yodel), etc. I can't see it being a workable model for drivers in terms of earnings, and I can't see the delivery industry letting this happen, in the same way that taxi drivers aren't letting it happen.\n\n\nOf course, it'll be different if delivery firms purposely spin out their home delivery divisions...\n\n\nThe other thing to consider is that Amazon have already started vertically integrating into delivery, and are clearly thinking about the future of it and investing in it (delivery drones and so on)","426":"They went ahead and re-newed mine, but I just emailed their customer support - they refunded me the charges, gave me a $15 credit to use, and an extra free month as an apology.

Their P\/E ratio is n\/a because they're not profitable. But clearly that company should not be worth zero, right?\n\nLet me tell you why I bring this up, so there's less back-and-forth. The P\/E ratio is meaningless when evaluating certain fast-growing firms. This is because their management is reinvesting the profits into the business so they can grow more, i.e. take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nIn general, the investing thesis with such companies is as follows:\n\n* Their quarterly reports generate enough information to determine whether the company has a long-term future. Generally, this means they need to demonstrate the ability to grow revenues at a substantial pace. (This is also why they drop a lot when they miss analysts' revenue forecasts but hardly at all if they miss profit forecasts.) These reports also tend to disclose how much they're investing in R&amp;D, capex, etc. which are intended to grow the business.\n* Implicit in their valuation is the understanding that **if they do not reinvest and expand the business, someone else will take over the space.** That is, they have to exploit their niche. So each earnings report is an exercise in determining whether the company's management is executing on their plan. If they are, that bodes well for the company and the market bids up their shares for the opportunity to enjoy substantial profits down the line.\n\nSo their P\/E ratio is compressed because it doesn't have anything to do with the company's future prospects.","430":"I perfectly understand why Amazons PE is so high and how they continue to reinvest all profits in other potentially and often moon shot markets. \n\nI do not see fast growth in EBAY.

I eventually just sold the site right before one of Google's major updates.

Netflix is great for movies, but their TV selection can be pretty bad unless you really like generic prime time sitcoms.

I would suspect that those items have a high rate of scammers because they are well known and the scammer can use it to purchase anything they want from that store.\n\nFor me, the items typically are very specific for games and as a result people are usually just happy to get their rare \/ discounted item.  If they plan to buy more in the future, it is not in their interest to open a case against me as they will lose a seller in a market where there aren't many.  \n\nLast month I sold about 130 items and out of those 1 person shot me a message saying that the code didn't work.  I had checked it previously so I knew it should have worked but I have had some flukes happen before.

I knew it was a scam or some kid getting in trouble for using his mom's credit card because the case was opened 2 weeks after I sent the code.  Typically if there is a genuine issue with an item the buyer lets me know within 24 hours of the sale since that's when they first try to redeem it.

The keyboard costs $200.  Where is the delivery driver going to get that initial $200?  Are they going to be paying out of their own pocket and then getting reimbursed through your app? That's pretty risky for the delivery driver, and it also relies on them HAVING that extra money to begin with (which is unlikely, since they are doing piece-work for cash).\n\nMore importantly - how do we agree on the value of the item? What if the item is a different price than the buyer thought it was going to be? Are you holding money in Escrow? Is the delivery driver just out of luck if the buyer refuses to pay the higher price? \n\nYou need to think through this payment mechanism.  Either you are holding money in Escrow (in which case, how much? How do you independently value the inventory of a store, sight unseen, that isn't necessarily listing every item online), or you are putting so much risk on the delivery driver by making them front the value of the items that they won't sign up.\n\nEdit: The only way that I could see this work is if the items were ordered and paid for ahead of time by the student that was ordering them, using a call-in or online credit card.  But then you're competing with Amazon - and I can't imagine that the fee you have to pay to motivate delivery drivers is going to be lower than what students would pay for their free Amazon prime shipping.","509":"I sell on etsy, and honestly I am thinking of leaving. There are just sooo many sellers on there now, and its really hard to stand out unless you have an established presence and fanbase. I am actually selling handmade goods, and I feel like at least 50% of sellers are just re-selling mass produced items these days. Etsy is totally fine with that, yet all these items are still categorized as handmade. I can't compete in the handmade section, when my items are priced at $100-300, and other sellers can sell for so much less. \n\nEven if you planning not to sell handmade items, the market is still so saturated with re-sellers that you will have the same problem. There are hundreds of etsy shops all selling the exact same t-shirts, necklaces, etc. \n\nIf etsy was to rethink their strategy and re-categorize so there was a separate handmade marketplace, I would be happy to continue selling there.

There are so many small expenses that can pop up -- even just one unexpected but necessary repair for your vehicle could cut into your food budget. Never mind that you need to control for climate conditions at all times. For example, Yuma is a consistently warm place to spend the winters during the DAY, but the nights are still pretty cold. Flagstaff is freezing in the winter, but temperate in the summer, if you can manage to avoid the monsoons. How will you stay warm in the winter? Where will you go in the summer if the parks are full? (They often fill up months ahead of time.) Where will you shower? What if the cost of gas increases? Those are just some examples of questions you need to answer before hitting the road. I am living the nomad life as frugally as possible, but still surprised by how expensive it can be. There is no end to the contingency planning you need to do every step of the way.\n\nI'm not saying it's impossible if you're traveling alone, but make sure to have backup options for cash flow. Perhaps there is a business you can do from the road, like transcribing or running an online store. You can also look into 'workamping' for a few weeks\/months at a time to build your income back up, then hit the road again to continue traveling. I know people who do seasonal work for Amazon at an hourly wage or volunteer at state parks in exchange for camping facilities, then spend months traveling until the bank account starts to dwindle. Not sure how this figures in with your SSI, but might be worth exploring.\n\nGoogle fulltime RVing and 'vandweller' blogs -- they can provide you with a ton of information about how to turn your dreams into a reality.","529":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Believe me, this situation blew my mind in its absurdity. This, after my experience with Amazon's customer service has always been one of continual surprise that they just issue refunds left and right.

Whatever the case, THIS situation--which totally warranted a refund--was amazingly denied.\n","574":"It hasn't been my experience, either, that's why I found it shocking. Well, that and because it was so unbelievably ridiculous and maddening. I was leaving feedback on the product, which were terry lounge covers that had not been pre-shrunk, so they lost many inches after laundering, and no longer covered the lounger. An obvious cost-saving measure, not pre-washing the fabric--they use less fabric, have less cost, and then the customer washes it and the shrinkage is so significant that the item is no longer usable as advertised. All over the product page, as you would imagine, it said \"washable\" as the whole point of the product is to BE washed because you can't wash your expensive lounge covers. Amazon simply continued to state, ad nauseam, that I had washed the product. Yes! I had! the covers stunk of chemicals and I washed them in a new, state of the art washing machine and dryer, selecting \"towels\" on the settings. And the product didn't hold up to the advertised promise! Plus, as I said, the seller refused to respond to me OR Amazon. Amazon--when thinking they were communicating to the seller in an email to me--nudged the seller, saying in the future they needed to remember to respond to them (Amazon) within 7 days or Amazon HAS to refund the customer.  Yet the seller didn't, and Amazon didn't.

They will tell you that they are investigating you and that your account is frozen. You will beg and plead with them to tell you what is going on. You can e mail them every day and explain that you need this money to survive, that you are starving and just want to know what is going on. But the person you are writing to will not even take the half second to explain or point you to the Amazon fine print that says the can freeze your account for 30 days as day after day passes and you wonder if you are going to get kicked out of your apartment.","583":"I've had the opposite experience buying through Amazon.

I either throw it away, donate it (tax write off at least), sell it directly back to Amazon.com (possible for only certain items) or just sell it on my front lawn the old fashioned way.

You had to exchange e-mails between buyer and seller directly (i.e. off site) and typically send a money order via snail mail to get your item!

Amazon said that's cool, keep the item and have your $200 back! \n\nOne week later, buyer had that goddamn book for sale for more than they paid for it. Of course with a note that one page had owner's name on it. \n\nAmazon protects buyers, but leaves sellers at the mercy of scammers. \n\nEDIT: I didn't buy it back and scam the scammer because it would've been pretty obvious and I figured Amazon wouldn't let it fly. They had multiple emails and phone calls from me arguing with them about how insanely unfair this policy was and that they were clearly enabling a scammer.

I found this $10 book is better than the *entirety* of information online.\n\nhttp:\/\/blog.mdwoptions.com\/my-books\/\n\nThe Rookie Guide to Options, 2nd edition.\n\nThe formatting is kinda poor, and the dude seriously probably would benefit from a good editor. Nonetheless, the information is solid and presented logically... especially to someone who is only familiar with stocks. Just pay $10 for the pdf, or if you need a dead-tree version, I think Amazon sells the book for like $20 or so.\n\nIt teaches options starting with the safest, easiest to understand option trades. Mark D Wolfinger is clearly a conservative investor, as he starts with strategies that have even lower-risk than holding raw stocks. (Writing Cash-covered Puts or Covered Calls).\n\nOnce you get jump-started with that book, you'll find various online resources to be much easier to understand. Still a beginner book and I'm gonna start working my way through some more advanced books now... but this one is a good place to start.","598":"So, created a Reddit account to talk about this.\n\nFor some background- I'm a current business\/accounting student, and I read a lot. On the one hand, this means that I'm more likely to fall for the similarity principle- The subconscious cognitive bias that tells you that people who are similar to myself, and share certain traits [in this case, love of reading and an interest in business] are more trustworthy than people who don't.\n\nOn the other hand, it also means I know what the similarity principle actually is.\n\nNow, I haven't finished the 67 steps, and I don't plan to. I had initially, of course, but after completing 1-12 I feel that I've seen enough to make some broad generalizations.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer- Tai's advice is not all bad. In fact, a lot of it is fairly sound. Now, before you get your wallets out or prepare to call me out as a sockpuppet or whatever, let me finish- Tai's advice might be sound, but it is not unique or special. You can get pretty much the same advice, and a lot more depth, by signing up for a student success and intro to business class at your local community college. \n\nMoving on, I'm going to address Tai's commercial. Now, I'll be honest, Tai's commercial is the entire reason I joined his site- Because I have never before seen an advertisement that hit every single one of the cognitive biases listed in \"Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,\" and I thought that anyone who put together a commercial like that must have some idea of what they were doing- Even if they were a bit clumsy about the application. IMO, That 2-hour commercial can probably teach you more about marketing and sales than the entire rest of the 67 steps combined.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Influence, that's fine. I'm about to explain the ways that his ad used the cognitive biases described in it.\n\nFirst, he opens up the ad with promises that he is going to give you something worth $100, free of charge, just for watching the video. This is the Principle of Reciprocity, the psychological bias that says that if someone gives you something, you are obliged to pay them back. \n\nNow, his actual application of Reciprocity is very clumsy. You're just watching a video, after all, and as most people are aware, you can't just hand people things through the screen. Plus, as you all know, at the end he goes from offering you something for free, to offering you a free gift... With your purchase of a $67\/month subscription. At this point, Tai falls prey to the Contrast principle- His initial promise of a free gift comes up against the sudden brick wall of a $67 fee. Now, he also clearly uses that principle when he asks us \"What is living well worth?\" and goes down the list from 1000, 500, and so on and so forth until he reaches that point, in addition to the established value of the gift- or, rather, claimed value of the gift- being higher than the asking price for the program.\n\nNext, I'd like to talk about his convenient user testimony. The Social proof- Other people think this is a good thing! They like it! You know, Tai hasn't heard of anyone not liking the program at all! So, clearly... If you try it, you will find it valuable, because everyone else did. He used it pretty well, to be honest, even including e-mail addresses and contact info to 'prove' he wasn't scamming you.  Which, he might not be- For all I know, there are real people at the end of that contact info, who really do feel that the program helped them.\n\nThat doesn't mean anything beyond their own personal feels, though. \n\nHe also spends a lot of time flattering the viewer ham-handedly. \"If you've watched this far, you're obviously pretty smart\" came up at several times- And this was probably calculated just like everything else. When someone compliments you, even when it's obviously fake... You like them more. Maybe only a little bit, but it's a measurable amount, and the Principle of Liking states that if you like someone, you're more likely to buy what they're selling you.\n\nHe also claims to have experience, and luck, in finding several mentors- Who he quotes, along with other famous authors, almost religiously. He's not the one who came up with this, he claims- It was other people, wiser people, respected people. Authorities, you might say, which he is appealing to.\n\nThen, you get the final bias in the advertisement video- The scarcity bias. Why, he's only opening this program [which he advertised on youtube, heh] to a handful of people- Maybe a hundred or two, I dunno, not that many, so you'd better buy in fast! \n\nAnd there we get the principle of Consistency- Come on, sign on the dotted line. Once you sign, once you pay, you'll know that you've signed up for it, and you'll rationalize it- Obviously you've gotten benefits, obviously you think it's worth it, otherwise why would you have signed up for it?\n\nEvery single cognitive bias in the book, all in one single video. Pretty impressive, though he's obviously not that great at using them- His whole video screams \"Scam Artist\", not \"This is a great idea and you should feel great for having it,\" after all.\n\nUnfortunately, the steps themselves are much less educational than that first ad video. Each of the videos could probably be summed up in less than five minutes, if it wasn't for Tai's rambling anecdotes, and- As Tai himself says once or twice- He could have condensed them into a much shorter length. However, he has two reason he doesn't, which he spells out at length.\n\nFirstly, he wants us to put the effort in to glean the 'Ounce of gold' from the hour long pile of dirt. Second, he wants us to take at least 67 days going through the course- Long enough to form a habit. \n\nThese feed back, again, to the consistency bias- If you've spent this long, and this much effort, going through the course? You must find it worth it! So, if you've found it worth it, you might as well keep your subscription active, so you can keep learning more. It's only 67 a month after all, right?\n\nLet me counter that, with one of Tai's own arguments- If you're spending 67 a month on his program, that's time and money you're not spending on other things- Things like actual business books, which cost about 5-10 on Amazon from my experience. \n\nWhich, to be fair, is not to say that Tai's series is worthless. It's entirely possible that at some point later in the series, he comes out with something unique and insightful, completely different from his early videos.\n\nIf you want to check and see, though, make sure to cancel the additional monthly fees. There's no need to pay more than the initial seventy bucks for what he's selling you.\n\nI hope this helps.","599":"I did consider Newegg (if I missed anything, of course I can check it again) but am leaning Amazon.\n\nFirst, it seems like Amazon has the best customer service, plus I already have Prime and would get the best shipping options that way (free two day shipping on almost everything) compared with Newegg, where I could join their Premier for free to get most benefits of Amazon but still get only three day shipping.\n\nThis also means that Amazon offers refunds and return shipping as well as price matching with the return window, because I could just repackage a part and get it elsewhere if I decide it's worth the money saved.\n\nSecond, Amazon has all of the hardware I need (newegg doesn't sell the case), although I'm trying to see about a couple that aren't sold by Amazon directly, and I may decide to purchase just the monitor separately to save $62 even if it does require waiting. I could save $60ish more by buying from six separate vendors, but I'm not sure it's worth the difficulty in the possibility that anything doesn't work and I need to have time to return it to make sure I test all my components within the return window.

To start out, I'd like to drop ship the products already listed on Amazon. If the venture proves successful, then I'd move to sourcing the products myself to save money and ensure supply.\n\nI thought I'd start out by simply ordering items off Amazon as \"gifts\" for each customer. It's not a great solution but for validation, it's ok. Then I thought, if I've found the item on Amazon and Amazon doesn't really want me to be dropshipping for them, then maybe there's an easy way to find companies that do want to dropship carrying the same product. Does that kind of directory exist? Only problem is I know at least wholesellers want you to jump through various hoops to establish a relationship before they're willing to sell to you. I'd like something as easy as Amazon to get started. Show up as a new user, give them your credit card, give them the address, and that's it.","621":"I'm currently at the point of considering if this would be something worthwhile and possible for me to attempt, and so I'm looking for some tools\/information about how to begin. I read the sidebar and followed tools there. I also searched and found a few other posts about computers that didn't offer much. It's entirely possible that what I was searching for doesn't exist (a particular bonus for computer-related expenses). I'm also aware that I could just take that as $2000 toward any new card, and choose from among the information that I have found, but I was trying to see if anyone could provide links to information where it might be relevant. For example, I could use a DiscoverIt card to purchase through Apple and get 5% back - that would be $100 I could enjoy (except that I'm not using Apple). Someone else suggested the Barclay Sallie Mae card which offers bonuses for Amazon. Those make sense as vendor-related cards. When I googled the question, I found store cards for all the possible stores I could buy from. I didn't mean to imply that I was too lazy to search or read information myself, but I just didn't see any information about my particular question. I have a double cash citi card with 2% back on everything. I also wasn't attempting to ignore having goals or to be vague, but I was suggesting that if I knew what my expenses would be, how could I find information to select possible goals that best aligned with those expenses. Maybe that doesn't make sense, and I should just look at my options based on knowing I'll be spending $2000 in one day and then returning to my normal spending patterns?","622":"It really isn't all that unique an idea that you need to evaluate yourself.  There are many others doing it and in heavy volume. If you go to ebay, there are sellers with stores exclusively dedicated to \"dropshipping\" from Amazon.  There margins are thin, but they are selling in huge volume to make up for it.\n\nIf you've found a product that somehow has a great margin via \"dropshipping\" then look into the manufacturer of the product.  If you contact them, they will likely give you a list of distributors.  The distributors will likely only be interested in speaking with you if you place large bulk orders. Also don't waste your time looking up lists or directories etc. until you know what product you are looking for. \n\nSo I think you need to ask yourself if you want to focus on one product and go slowly or go in and sell in bulk.

The customer received wrong item and it was the last one I had in stock, so now my inventory reads zero (even though AMZ still has the physical item that i originally FBAd.) I called AMZ to see what could be done and their only answer was to have the customer return the item to me and then ship out the correct one.  But the item that would be returned to me would be an item that I've never sold and is not in my inventory and since I have no more in stock, I have no more to ship out as a replacement. My only choice would be to buy one on Amazon  (probably the one I shipped in the first place, lol) and ship that out to the customer. \n\n(The item was a cake mold,  customer received an ice cube tray with the same design.

The way you screw up the machine readable part of a barcode is make a vertical line which adds meaningless data to the code; a horizontal line might remove some data depending on the thickness of the marker but if you scan either above or below the mark the barcode is still intact. A proper scanner is best for this, not a smart phone.\n\nYour other option is type the numbers under the barcode into Amazon or wherever you're researching, the numbers are what the barcode actually says and it's extremely rare to get someone that'll actually write over the numbers and then make a few vertical lines which is the only way you'll destroy both the human readable and machine readable parts of a barcode.\n\nEdit: Guess I should add, if someone does a diagonal line that covers the entire height of the code, scan the code at an angle for best results but be prepared to type the numbers in as it's effectively a vertical mark. There's a chance it'll still read vs a straight vertical which makes the barcode garbage for the machine.","626":"I've resigned myself to never getting amazon feedback.

Right now I have about 13 million products and 400 million price changes tracked. That should grow substantially as I bring up Canada and the UK along with the major retail stores available in those areas.\n\nEdit: I actually used to also take screenshots of the product pages as the prices dropped. This was really useful as you could confirm that the price drop shown was real, and you could use the screenshot as proof of the price drop when applying for price drop protection with your credit card. Unfortunately one of my competitors (an amazon-only price tracker) has been trying to get me banned, and I couldn't risk taking screen shots any longer as it might be against the terms of service. It technically isn't against the ToS, but if someone interpreted that a screen shot was the same as screen scraping, then it might.

After I buy it, I mark it in the PZ price protection tracker and it sits there watching it during the 90 days.

It's not as easy as just making a copy of the existing code; there are a lot of factors, including how to make the extension multihomed (one extension that can support many instances of PZ with supporting stores) and they don't run from the same computers or network. You have to deal with different currencies, and we also have the ability to translate currency into a user's local currency. Then there's also localization with languages..\n\nLowes is on the list to add for US stores BTW.\n\nI can't tell you exactly what will happen when, but the general idea right now is to release a working multihomed copy of the browser extension sometime this weekend. After that we have a bunch of little bugs to fix, and then we're going to bring up .ca, .uk, and .in instances of PriceZombie with Amazon as the initial store. For each region, I expect to add at least a half dozen other local stores before considering them ready for prime time users (otherwise the regions will look empty).\n\nOnce thats done, I'll need to upgrade database hard drives on the US region to accommodate the growing disk usage. \n\nThen I can get around to adding more US stores.... to answer your question: I can take requests, but this isn't our full time job (If it got popular we might be able to do that, but we're an unknown in the market right now and getting word out about PZ has been difficult) so progress is made after work when we have free time.\n\nHope that answers your question! *phew*","693":"I have Amazon prime as well, this is meant more toward online stores like GAP, ASOS, Charlotte Russe, etc. that have minimum purchase requirements for free shipping.","694":"That sounds reasonable.

Some cards give great rewards at grocery stores and gas, and OK rewards elsewhere. Others give bonuses on rotating categories, while others give bonuses on restaurants. Some are a flat 1.5% or 2% rewards cards.\nFavorite cards around here: Sallie Mae Mastercard (5% on bookstores (includes Amazon), groceries, and gas (capped at relatively low amounts but good for many)); Amex Blue Cash (preferred or everyday, depends on spending); Capitol One Quicksilver; Citi DoubleCash; Chase Sapphire Preferred; Barclay Arrival Plus.\n\nAlso, don't knock a card just because it has an annual fee.

So you could spend $5K overseas and another $24K domestically, and you would *break even*. Again, that's *after* any restaurant and travel expenses, and that's only comparing against a couple flat cash-back cards, ignoring ones with category bonuses.\n\nEvery annual fee card looks okay when compared to *one* no-fee card. It's a fallacy creditors hope you fall into. Once you get more than a couple cards, the marginal value of another card diminishes *fast*. Once you're getting good returns on gas, groceries, bills, restaurants, travel, fast food and Amazon.com, there's no point to a fee card unless you really have five-digit spending that doesn't fit into those categories.\n\nThis card is *great* if you're chasing signup bonuses, so carry on. It just has no place in a rational strategy for everyday use unless you have *tons* of spending (e.g. business expenses you can get reimbursed).","731":"I've not done it personally but I contacted Amazon customer service and they said that I could use foreign currency balance on local Amazon.

Some banks will allow you to do this. Capital One definitely will not.\n\nSecond step, if you can't convert it, get a new card. Do this before closing the other card. \n\nThird step, I would close the secured card. Note that usually I recommend not closing any cards. However, in this case the card is hurting you more than helping, since it is tying up that $300 that you can't use for a better purpose. Even if you do close this card, the account will stay on your report for 10 years. So closing it won't really affect you negatively in any way for this 10 years. By then, hopefully you will have a long history of paying your bills on time, so the effect will be minimal.\n\nAs far as recommendations, I recommend the Sallie Mae Mastercard. This card gives 5% cash back on up to $250 in gas each month, $250 of groceries, and $750 on bookstores, which includes all Amazon purchases.\n\nIf you spend more than these limits on gas and groceries, I recommend the American Express Blue Cash Preferred. This card does have a $75 annual fee, but provides 6% back on groceries (up to $6000 annually), and 3% back on gas (unlimited).","736":"Go to a good sport shoe store, gazelles or a small local shop and get fitted and property sized and pick out a last years model then take all the data, leave go home and by that exact shoe online from Amazon for $60.  \n \nI'ts a bit rude but your in a pinch right now just be sure if your using a local store to buy some stuff from them in the future.\n","737":"1.

Again, we do it about a month at a time, sometimes less, sometimes more. If we were doing it daily, we probably wouldn't do it.\n\nCategorizing is easy and fast and after a while YNAB will remember categories per payee, just like mint. And just like mint, we'd have to go back in there and split transactions based on receipts for the kinds of places where we buy from multiple categories per transaction, like Costco or Amazon. This is by far the most time consuming part of our monthly budget process. And we have to undo certain payees auto-categorization based on the context (example: fuel purchased on a vacation, for us, comes out of the vacation budget. fuel purchased regularly comes out of our fuel budget)... \n\nI never liked the mint budgeting and was using my own spreadsheet after a while anyway. I moved to YNAB when I got married and combined finances because we were essentially doing envelope budgeting anyway, just in an inefficient system of many savings sub-accounts and automated transfers. YNAB works better for multiple users than my spreadsheet, and it much easier to make changes to than creating sub-accounts at our bank.\n\nAfter a while, using mint was increasingly painful. I had a few accounts that it didn't support, so I had to track those separately anyway, and then every couple months or more some accounts would just be non-responsive and I'd have to go to my banks' pages and assert something so mint would work again. And I grew uncomfortable with them having all my account info too, and had it deleted.\n\nMint was great at helping be build up a few years of spending data though, enough to get my budget off to a good start.","743":"Via Amazon for this promotion. \n\n1 ThankYou Point is equal to $0.008, so 0.8 cents, on Amazon. \n\nAs a general guideline, it's best to never redeem points for anything less than 1 cent.

The new ones are 3% \/ 6% for no-fee \/ fee cards, but have annual limits.  So, the old card, if you had a family and spent maybe $500 \/ month on groceries, would be worth $6,000 * 5% = $300 per year in cash back. \n\nFor my money right now, I like my Barclaycard Arrival+ World Mastercard (annual fee) which has 2.2% statement credits for all purchases, redeemable for any \"travel\" spend (airlines, cab, bus, gas, pretty much anything travel-y); the SallieMae mastercard (5% cash back at Amazon and Grocery stores, up to a limit each month), and my Starwood Preferred Guest AmEx, which is amazing because I travel for work and it's like getting 12.5% back to spend on lodging for myself. \n\nThe 'best' cards at any time will change, but it's worthwhile to explore what's out there.  The Citi DoubleCash card is really good - it would be my second choice as a main card, right after my Barclaycard.  The difference in rewards (2.2% vs 2.0%) really only tips in Barclaycards favor if you spend (Annual Fee \/ (2.2%-2.0%)) = $40,000 per year or more on the credit card, otherwise the Citi card is better.  In my case, I get to put my business travel on my card, so that takes care of about half of that spend threshold each year.  I might be better off from a rewards perspective by going with the Citi card; but where the Barclaycard makes it up is in no foreign transaction fees, and chip-and-pin technology which helps a lot in Europe.\n\nCards are complicated, but there are multiple good cards for any given spending pattern.","774":"I think that's just it- a lot of folks think its get rich and really its just about making a few extra bucks but with little\/no effort.

Yes you are trying to beat Amazon if, as your original post said, you are making another marketplace.\n\nIt's not going to happen.\n\nMany have tried and many have failed.\n\nYou are not going to have more items or better prices than Amazon. You are not going to get the shipping deals Amazon has. You are not going to get the logistics power Amazon has. You are not going to get the warehouses and all the technology involved with them.","837":"Considering the average price on ebay is about $134 for sold listings with the game, this would be a horrible investment. Only 30% of listings sold for more than $125. You'd still have to get the game to match these prices and get lucky on a sale for $200 or so. Even if you went through with it, a BIN would sit for ages before someone finally bought it.\n\nEdit: On Amazon, you could list a $220 through FBA, which would gross you $170 minus whatever shipping costs you incur. Also don't forget to subtract the cost of the game (About $10-15 on eBay) from that. You'd be lucky to break even.","838":"The basic beginner tip is to start with what you know. What is something you know about that can help you make money. Then look for those items.\n\nAlso, by going to Target and GW, you are in two completely different markets with different goals. GW is going to be more of your used stuff that goes on eBay. Target is going to be your retail arbitrage stuff that can go on eBay but is probably better served on Amazon.\n\nTo start out, you should probably pick one or the other. \n\nAlso try estate sales, auctions, liquidation stores, etc. Those places are where I find my best scores.","839":"Amazon is better because an item that I had on eBay for two months at $15 just sold on Amazon within a week for $50.\n\nI send everything I can to Amazon and list what I can't on eBay.","840":"In the states, GTM used to have an exchange rate of 1000 MPs for $50 Checks.  In the summer of 2013 they changed to a new rewards redemption system through Perks Plus, but required more points to cash out.  It became 1100 pts for a $50 Amazon GC.  1150 pts is needed for $50 PayPal.\n\nI am assuming that they are passing along the costs of using Perks Plus to us instead of eating it themselves.","841":"I've read that if Amazon decides to refund the buyer for some reason, you get to pay the return shipping if you want the item back from the customer.","842":"Any issues with Amazon? Or everything has gone smoothly with them?","843":"You can see it on the actual Amazon listing page about half way down. Or if you use a scanning app like the Amazon Seller app, it will display when you scan something.","844":"Tupperware! Or some higher-quality version thereof, if you're so inclined and wary of death via microwave carcinogens. \n\nThe biggest--the biggest!--cost you're in danger of incurring is spending massive amounts of money on takeout. It's hard to bring food from home if you don't have anything to bring it with. Get a couple bigger ones so you can make a big batch of food over the weekend and store it in the fridge, then transfer it to a smaller one to take to school every day. \n\nIn terms of cookware, I think the absolute basics are a frying pan, a pot, and a baking tray. That should make 90% of the meals you'd want to cook, and you can find great deals at thrift stores or Amazon, especially if you have the student Prime.\n\nAlso--spices. Maybe a moderately pricey investment, but it'll help you make food you actually want to eat. :) If you're near an Aldi's, they have hilariously cheap spices. If you're not, most bulk aisles of supermarkets have pretty good deals .

I make my entire earnings from affiliate marketing. The money is VERY real and it's VERY good. Many people telling you to make a product have not actually made a successful product themselves, they are just pushing their fantasy onto you.\n\nMany people in this sub do not see affiliate marketing as entrepreneurial. They are dead wrong and are making misinformed opinions having seen basic \"review\" websites. Many have given it a go and sucked at it. Guess what guys, when you have your own product YOU STILL HAVE TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET IT!\n\nYou CAN make an email list and market to them later, even crap \"gurus\" like Pat Flynn and Spencer Hawes know this and they don't really have a clue what they are doing (seriously, Pats actual earnings from affiliate websites he proudly shows off grew $2k over six years, the meat he earns is in his passive income website that is read by suckers).\n\nYou CAN build a brand. You do not need a tangible product to create a brand. Information brands can be huge powerhouses. Wikipedia. IGN. Forbes. Consumer reports.Even Reddit. Fuelled by information. NOT TANGIBLE PRODUCTS.\n\nYou DO have control with affiliate marketing. Yes Amazon and shareasale are for beginners but after you have proven your salt you can write up binding contracts with manufacturers and distributors. \n\nYou CAN get repeat customers to buy. Goes hand in hand with making a brand. If you are the go to source for information then guess what? Customers are going to come back time and time again.\n\nUltimately it comes down to whatever you feel comfortable doing. If you can touch the money that you earn, then it's REALLY money. \n\nAlso to anyone else stalking my comments, Feb case study will be up by the end of the coming weekend.

At the end of the day the serious fisherman are going to go where there's fish to catch no matter how well you treat the fishermen.  Amazon was successful by planning on making $0 to bring in buyers.  It worked very well, as you can see such of a large % of this place is trying to get approved just to sell in some of their categories.  \n\n\nYou want to pull me from ebay\/amazon?  Line up buyers.  That's the service they provide.","856":"I recently picked up an American Express Blue Cash Preferred card because of the % cash back they offered was higher than my current credit cards (Mastercard and Visa), on top of a $100 cash back and a free year of Amazon Prime. I utilize it for all of my purchases now and still maintain my Mastercard and Visa for rainy days. \n\nIf you're banking on getting a new phone next year and will actually cash in on the $200 credit for it then why not?  Mind you, most people in this community will question whether or not you'd need that new phone next year or not when smartphones these days are ranging anywhere from $400-$700.  I tend to keep my phones for 3-4 years for instance if not longer if feasible. Also, with that in mind, you're banking that your carrier will have the best deal for you when your contract is re-newed (if you are under contract), thus limiting your option to shop around for the best deal at that time.","857":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.
