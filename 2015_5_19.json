Screw You!\n\nI have a few CDs, that have sold once or twice in the last year, but they have sold for $50+.  I listed mine $1 less than the next guy and I had a better condition CD.  Some idiot decided to price his, better condition CD, $26 less than mine. The next guy undercut him by $10. So a CD, that hasn't sold in over 6 months, is now $36 cheaper than my listing, for no god damn reason at all other than two idiots who don't know how to price things.....\n\nRant over.

I have read and looked at a lot of sources regarding amazon affiliate marketing, and it has given me an idea.  What if I were to start using amazon affiliate marketing from outside of north America, and target an audience specific to my geographic location. For example, if I live in India, and I wanted to target fishing equipment, I could make a website that focuses on keywords like \"best fishing rods India\", but I need a bit of advice.  \n\nWould it be possible to change the pricing on the reviews to my local currency instead of USD?  \nWill Amazon send Cheques to countries outside of North America?  \n\nWill Amazon be able to send a cheque in my local currency as opposed to USD?  \nDo you guys think this idea would work through amazon or should I rather stick to my local alternative?  \n\nI hope somebody has done something like this already and can give me some educated advice on the matter.

{"id":"34sze9","author":"hypnofed","body":"So my life has taken some interesting turns lately, and the short version is that I've agreed to come to work at a family business (accounting firm) on a plan that over a few years will transfer the operations and ownership from the family member who started it to myself.  I have plenty of experience in retail so I have decent skills related to sales, client relations, etc, but I don't know much about running my own business.  What paperwork do I keep and send the government when I hire someone?  How do I manage employees?  Where do I learn about labor laws?  I feel like there's a lot of basic information on running a business that I'm missing.  I have no doubt that my family member will train me well (he started the business from scratch and has recently turned down a seven-figure offer to sell), but knowing him I'm more likely to learn how *he* runs things rather than how businesses work in general.\n\nI've hit up Amazon for books on running a small business, but I'm not really finding what I'm looking for.  Most of the books are about *starting* a business, not running one.  While all these books have information about making a business successful, they also lean heavily toward the nuts and bolts of starting a business (eg, incorporating) which is water under the bridge as it's already happened.  Anyone have a good resource for my situation?  Books are really the medium I go through best so I'm looking for such a source if possible.","name":"t3_34sze9","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-05-04 10:37:18","week":19}

The service center offered me the best deal I've ever seen with Xfinity after about 10 years as a customer.\n\n\nThe gave me a free extended basic cable. They doubled my internet speed.

{"id":"34w96m","author":"maxwellbegun","body":"Hey all! Thanks in part to this sub, I started flipping in May 2014 with my $300 tax return. Since then, I've earned just shy of $30,000- with $4,300 of that in the last month.\n\nInstead of trying to describe my entire process, I'll just tell you what I do differently from the typical scan-everything FBA bookseller.\n\n1. I sell books in lots. A group of 5-20 of the same author, series, or subject goes together. They sell for anywhere between $.25 and $2 per book.\n\n2. The name of the game is Quantity, not Quality. I don't scan. I just get every book that meets my standards to sell. I sold 344 lots last month and I'm on track to sell 475+ this month.\n\n3. eBay, not FBA. Why? Because I sell all of my items in lots. Imagine creating 40 new Amazon pages in a day, selling one, and never using the page again. It doesn't work.\n\n4. I've built 130 feet of shelving floor to ceiling for my books. 45 feet for listed items, the rest for sorting. \n\n5. Employees! They are the best thing ever. Suddenly, you go to work one day and see the massive amount of work to be done- and you know that you can delegate most of it to others. It feels great.\n\n6. I still work 12 hour days. It's 8:30 PM here and I got started this morning at 8:30 AM. Except for a short break to play a match of Heroes of the Storm for a bit earlier, I've only stopped for quick meals.\n\n7. I started by getting books from the Goodwill Outlet. $100 will fill an SUV to bursting with books. I'm just now transitioning over to buying them by the Gaylord. The books aren't as good, but I no longer have an hour drive and best of all- no competition destroying my books while digging for textbooks to FBA.\n\nI know I'm leaving out a lot of the juicy details. Ask if you have any burning questions, and I'll answer what I can. I'm not going to give away the recipe to the secret sauce, but I'll give what detail I can.\n\nActually, I'll give you a few bits of the secret sauce, just for fun:\n\n1. The secret to quick eBay listing is using their File Upload system. I built an Access Database which exports to an Excel file that I upload to eBay. I get an item from photographs to online in 5 minutes or less.\n\n2. Photograph quickly using a webcam, Picasa, and a macro. Arrange your item, click a single key on my keyboard- and voila! The image is ready and waiting for upload. If you have more money, most newer DSLR cameras will work with Picasa as well and give you gorgeous pictures. I'm getting one soon and I can't wait.","name":"t3_34w96m","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-05 04:02:07","week":19}

{"id":"34x4l5","author":"importdojo","body":"Hey guys,\n\nI have a sourcing company in Hong Kong and work in this field over 10 years now. I have seen a lot of questions regarding importing from China, Alibaba and how to deal with manufacturers. \n\nHere is a case study of how to source a product, in our case a power bank, that is manufactured in Shenzhen, China. What you learn here applies to *any product* you want to source. If you still have questions I also cover the whole process in more depth in my free 65 page ebook over here: http://importdojo.com \n\nIt’s going to be a bit of a longer post so please bear with me:\n\nIt’s all about research and following the 6-step import process. \n\n**1) Decide on the kind of product you want to sell and your manufacturing country**\n\nDifferent countries have different benefits. While Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar is sort of “hot” for textile products for some of the big retailers right now because they offer even cheaper labor and ethics matter little, China has better infrastructure and much better technology in place for example. Do some research before you start sourcing. In this case study we want to source a power bank to recharge cell phones so we are sourcing in China. To be more specific in the heart of all things electronic of China which is Shenzhen.\n\nWe are going to import into the US so we need to be aware of customs tariff numbers and import specifications. We can look that up under: http://hts.usitc.gov/ \n\n(For any other country go onto Google and input **“YOUR COUNTRY customs tariff number”**). Make sure you understand the regulations first or you end up with a great product that is a pain in the ass to import.\n\n**2) Find a product**\nDo your due diligence on research and keywords. Here are some tried and proven ways on finding a product:\n\n* Scouting the Internet (e.g.http://www.kadaza.com/ has a large collection of trending sites) \n* Newsletters (subscribe to websites like Engadget, Wired, PCMag etc.)\n* Shopping mall \n* Traveling (great way to get inspired and see what people in different cultures use for different everyday tasks)\n* Exhibitions (local &amp; overseas)\n* Amazon, Ebay, bestseller lists\n* Alibaba, Aliexpress, Global Sources, and Taobao\n\n\n**3) Find a supplier**\n\nThere are generally three effective ways to source your product:\n\n* Internet (Alibaba, Globalsources, Aliexpress, HKTDC)\n* Exhibitions / Conventions\n* Contacts and recommendations\n\n\n* Begin by narrowing down suppliers and make sure to ask a lot of questions about their business and their products.\n\n* Ask for a copy of their business license, company &amp; factory standard (for example ISO-9001)\n\n* Ask which laboratories / third party companies he works with. If he only works with Chinese test or Inspection companies be cautious.\n\n* Ask for photos of the factory or company presentation (PDF/PowerPoint) and sample products.\n\n* Ask for their other customers and where are these customers located.\n\n**The takeaway here is to ask for whatever makes you feel more comfortable doing business with him.**\n\n* If he doesn’t have any customers in your country be careful, as he might lack experience on regulations and standards necessary for importing the products. Ask about them.\n\n* If he already works with a competitor of yours or with an industry similar to yours it’s a good sign that he can **fulfill your requirements**.\n\n* Send him a vendor profile so he can fill in his details. A vendor profile is similar to a basic questionnaire. They should cover production capability, how many workers/staff/engineers, main customers, certifications, company turnover etc.\n\n* It should go without saying that before you invest any significant amount of money into inventory you need to **get samples to check and verify quality**. \n\n* Be wary of companies who quote high prices for samples as they are often just trading companies and don't have their own factory. When and how trading companies can help is another topic for another time.\n\n* Finally, if something is too good to be true, it usually is. Be aware of prices, suspicious payments or communication that doesn’t seem right and something seems off.\n\n* Its’ never too late to simply cease communication and look for another supplier. Speak to more than one supplier. Get more offers.\n\n* Once you've narrowed it down to a select few suppliers, negotiated prices &amp; minimum order quantities (MOQ) you'll want to evaluate all your options.\n\n* Bear in mind its not always about the price &amp; MOQ. It’s also a **gut feeling** that you should get when communicating with a supplier. Did he reply eagerly &amp; fast?\n\n* Did he follow up in detail or just send fragments of answers to your questions? If you have the feeling its difficult now to communicate, imagine how it would be to work with him once the order is placed.\n\n* Make sure you eliminate the suppliers with the least potential &amp; feedback issues now and save yourself a lot of hassle down the road.\n\nSo lets assume you found your product on Alibaba. It’s a power bank with a unique design. I take this example because I found it recently and I think its going to be a hit. \n\nThe supplier is based in Shenzhen, China and after following above steps so far everything seems good.\n\nDo some research online to see if someone is selling the product already. After a bit of research you will see that it is sold on eBay. You can simply Google the name of the product and you will find a few links. \n\nFor example you can use Google Image search and drag and drop a product image into the search form, it gets uploaded and Google finds similar pictures.\n\nMake sure you understand your competition, common complaints about the product and the market before you buy. This way you might even instruct the supplier to improve some issues that you found before placing your order. \n\n**4) Calculate all duties and taxes**\n\nYour supplier will offer FOB (free on board), which is the most common way. Take this base price and start calculating your landing price.\n\nThe supplier offers US$8.19 per power bank for an MOQ of 100 pieces. You plan to order the MOQ.\n\nLets use www.dutycalculator.com &amp; worldfreightrates.com to calculate your other costs.\n\nIf you want to do a quick calculation as a “rule of thumb” you can add 20-30% on top of the manufactures price to get to your approximate landing price.\n\nThis helps so you will know right away if you can sell this product or not. To get accurate costs you should later contact a third party logistics provider (3PL) to get your shipment to the US.\n\nTake all the details you have of this supplier and calculate the costs.\nYou aren’t in a hurry so you calculated your freight rates via sea shipment with roughly US$ 215. (worldfreightrates.com) remember, these are just estimates and not 100% accurate.\n\nThen take your product to www.dutycalculator.com and enter all the details. Bear in mind this service is only free for 3 look ups, the rest is paid. Again you can look up specific rates for free under: http://hts.usitc.gov/\n\nPower banks have a rate of 3.4% import duties &amp; taxes in the US; there are no merchandising fees. There might be additional handling fees that we don’t know yet though.\n\nWhich leaves you with the following price:\n\n* Total customs value (FOB):US$819.00\t\n* Duty:US$27.85\n* Total import duty &amp; taxes due:US$27.85\t\n* Shipment: US$218.00 \n* Insurance costs: US$50  \n* Total landed cost:\tUS$1114.85\t=  US$11.14 per piece. \n* This is the total cost of importing, including product, shipping, insurance and import duty &amp; taxes\n* Add FBA costs: ~8% = ~ US$12 per piece.\n* Add another USD on top just to be safe so you have a total landing price of **US$13**.\n\n\n**5) Find a freight forwarder and customs broker (3PL)**\n\nYou can either Google this or ask your supplier to give you a 3PL provider. I recommend you let your supplier help you for the first shipment and you go for what he recommends.\n\nThe 3PL provider will take the product details &amp; measurements (that the supplier will provide you with) and calculate all costs, which may include: duties &amp; taxes, freight (international &amp; domestic), port fees, agent fees, custom brokerage fees etc.\n\nYou should get a landing price from the 3PL provider for shipping straight to your door. This service is called “delivery duty paid” DDP. You can look up buying terms here too: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms  \n\nLet your 3PL provider take care of everything. Pay a little more for door-to-door delivery as they have experience in dealing with customs &amp; government agencies.\n\n**6) Monitor your shipment and have an inspection!**\n\nMake sure you write detailed instructions for your supplier with all product requirements of your order.\n\nIf you are selling on Amazon you need to read their guidelines and requirements for packing goods. This includes packaging, labeling and carton specifications.\n\nYou also need to buy an UPC code. Make sure that you follow up with your supplier on a weekly basis to check on the production schedule and if he understood all your requirements correctly.\n\n**DO NOT LEAN BACK AND WAIT FOR YOUR ORDER &gt; MONITOR IT**\n\nDepending on the nature and total order amount of the goods book an inspection with either www.asiainspection.com or www.bureauveritas.com. \nThe latter is more expensive and I recommend using them if your order amount is above US$3,000.\nAsiaInspection charges around US$320 for a simple shipment inspection, but as a long time customer you can get discounts.\n\nYou can skip this part but I don’t recommend it. Especially if you are selling on Amazon or to retailers. You will want to know your goods have been manufactured according to your requirements before they arrive at your doorstep.\n\nIt is common to pay a 30% deposit once you place the order and the 70% after production or before shipment.\n\nIf you book an inspection and the inspection result is fail (for whatever reason) you can tell the supplier to re-work the goods or else he won’t get his 70%.\n\nSince your total order amount is only US$819 (value of goods) you should skip the inspection but you can ask him to send you a self-inspection report.\n\nIf you would order 500 or more power banks I recommend you do the inspection.\n\nRelease the shipment to the supplier and let the 3PL company handle the rest until your goods arrive at your home or warehouse.\n\nYour landing price including FBA costs will be somewhere around US$13. The EBAY seller above offered for US$45!!! **That’s a profit of US$32 per piece or a margin of 370%!!!**\nYou should put your price somewhere in that region and make a profit of **US$3200**. But of course there are many more pitfalls on the way but I hope this post has shed some light into sourcing from overseas.\n\nThis is the whole process in a nutshell. You can check out my 65 page eBook for free and read the entire process in great detail on http://importdojo.com\n\nIf you have any questions, also about dealing with Chinese suppliers in general, I can answer them here too so fire away.

Firstly, this is my first post here so please ~~don't bite my head off~~ play nice :P\n\nSo, I found a site which I ~~don't believe has been mentioned here before~~ edit: **hasn't been mentioned here enough** called SuperPay.me.

Their offers seem to work from just about anywhere, and not just the US, which is always nice. I'm a Brit, and hate it when these sorts of sites are either US-only, or are designed for \"Zip codes\" or US-format telephone numbers. This is international, big time.\n\n[Sign up here](http://superpay.me/members/withdraw/list.php?refid=271130)^referral ^link **:)** - note that with this link you get 20 cents free to start you off :D\n\n\n[Link without referral](http://superpay.me/) **:(** - makes me sad, and you don't get those twenty cents\n\n**Edit: I know it gets bad reviews in some places, for instance on myWOT.

{"id":"350qog","author":"PerkAccount","body":"I This Tutorial is for the US. \n\nPerk apps are a way to earn Perk Points to redeem for gift cards. 1000 Perk Points equal roughly $1. Rewards are handed out on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The latest you can redeem is 11:59 pm Central the night before. \n\nThere are some apps that use Perk Tokens which you can earn doing various things within the apps and spend on auctions and sweepstakes. \n\n**You can use 5 devices per app per account. You can have up to 5 accounts per household. Perk will ask for IDs. Don't use a VPN or VM or a fast forward or an automation app or your rewards are likely to be canceled.**\n\n**Perk TV** -  Perk TV is an app which plays ads and rewards 1-2 points per video. App Trailers or Funny Commercials under Popular Videos are the shortest videos there are. There is a 1 hour pop up to ask if you're still watching on IOS and 2 hours on Android. It is recommended to check low bandwidth mode on the menu to the side. If your devices begin to run slowly, clear the app data and re log in and remember to check low bandwidth mode. You can earn 50 Perk Tokens for thumbs up or down on each video. Doing this will also delay the popup another 1 hour or 2 hours respectively. \n\n\n**Perk TV LIVE** - Perk TV LIVE is an app which listens for commercials on TV and plays ads during them. You earn 3 Perk Points per ad for the first 300 in 24 hours. . 1 or 2 points for any ad thereafter. There are usually 4 ads in a cycle. There is a popup that asks if you are watching a commercial after about 20 minutes. If you are having trouble with the green light turning on, exit the app completely, open it back up and wait for a commercial that triggers it. Once it's on, it's on for awhile. If you are watching a streaming service like Netflix, go ahead and hit the \"Watch Commercials\" button every once in awhile. This info comes from posts made by Perk on Facebook. You can also earn Perk Tokens by tweeting within the app. App data needs to be cleared every so often. \n\n**Perk Pop Quiz** - Perk Pop Quiz is a trivia app in which you earn Perk Points for answering questions. It is generally recommended to use Lightning Mode. The questions go quicker and you can run through games faster. You also earn 1 extra Perk Point for using this mode. Once all the questions in a category are answered they are gone for good. If you don't answer a question, it will reappear in 24 hours. New categories and questions are added every once in awhile. \n\n\n**Appsaholic games that give points** - [This is a good user created list.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18V-V-Aa8bpyAH-lw-y9b4h3J9ReVWxXebI2paoMQSgw/mobilebasic) \n\n**Perk Word Seach** - Search for words to earn points. \n\n**Perk Scratch and Win** - This app works like a lottery scratch off. You spend your Perk Tokens on tickets. Match a certain 3 symbols and win Perk Points or Perk Tokens. \n\n**Perk Shopping** - Shop thousands of stores and earn Perk Points for it. \n\n\n**Perk Search** - Let's you randomly win points for searching. \n\n**Perk Screen** - Replaces your lock screen. Swipe left to view the offer. Swipe right to just unlock your phone. You get Perk Tokens for a the first few swipes and Perk Points for one Swipe after that and then it repeats. \n\n\n**Perk Prize Mob** - Perk Prize Mob works like a penny auction in which you use your Perk Tokens or Perk Ponts to bid on Prizes. You earn Perk Tokens every day you log into the app. \n\n\n**Perk Wallet** - Perk Wallet is an app that you can use to manage your rewards and check on the status of your rewards. It also has a 3% discount on Amazon gift cards $25 and higher. \n\n\n**Other** - There are EZ Point offers on Perk.com and on certain apps. These are ad walls which you will find on many rewards sites. There is the potential to earn a lot of points here. Unfortunately a lot don't pay out. Also, Sweepstakes are available to use your Perk Tokens to use to enter to win prizes. \n\n\n**Devices** -  If you are looking for inexpensive devices there is a weekly thread posted called \"Cheapest Devices of the Week\" on /r/GetPerk or /r/perktv. It is generally recommended that you go for a dual core or higher device. Sure there are some that run just fine on a single core but read the subs for a bit and you will find warnings all over about them. \n\n\n**Always remember to use the search on /r/GetPerk and /r/perktv before asking a question. Also be sure to read some of the top posts of all time for those subs.**\n\n\nAnything wrong or that I'm missing?

{"id":"350xvk","author":"[deleted]","body":"Hey guys, I am about to start a new job that comes with a pretty significant pay raise. I've gotten myself into a pretty hefty balance on one of my credit cards, and up until now I have been able to pay the minimum + some extra, but not really making a dent. Now, I will have the capacity to pay off my credit card balance in a significantly shorter period of time\n\n\nAt the same time, I also want to start saving to do some traveling. I haven't really been on a vacation in a very long time. I've been saving points from Amex, Delta, and my Sapphire card and I would like to use them at some point. I'm also looking at closing some cards, and perhaps moving to different rewards programs or upgrading (such as upgrading my Amex to Platinum) to help with traveling. \n\n\nMy question is, though, how can I reduce the number of cards I currently have without hurting my credit score? My plan is to funnel all purchases through either my Amex or Sapphire card and pay it off each month. I got into a balance situation because I sold my house, bought a new one, and moved and used my credit card to finance some of those expenses. \n\n\nBelow are my cards, limits, and balances, along with the year I opened them. I'm tired of having so many accounts to have to keep track of, even if I don't use them. \n\n\nMost of these cards I haven't used in 3-5 years. When I got my Amex card, I was using it for everything I could. Then, when I got my Sapphire card, I moved to using it for everything. All the other cards have been dormant. What will it do to my credit score if I drop the older, yet never used and low limit cards? It would be great to just drop the $500 limit cards, and all of the store cards.\n\n\nWhat is the /r/personalfinance recommended course here? The carrying a balance problem is already solved, but what should my plans be for carrying open accounts from here on out?\n\n\n\nChase Amazon.com Visa ($2600 limit, no balance), 2008\n\nUS Bank college alumni affinity Visa ($500 limit, no balance) 2008\n\nDiscover, ($1600 limit, no balance), 2008\n\nBank of America Amex ($500 limit, no balance), 2008\n\nBank of America Visa ($500 limit, no balance), 2009\n\nAmex Gold Card, 2010\n\nAmex Delta Airlines Gold Card ($1k limit, no balance), 2010\n\nBarclays Visa ($2800 limit, no balance), 2011\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred ($19,500 limit, $18,095 balance), 2013\n\nAmazon.com Store Account ($1700 limit, no balance) 2014\n\nJC Penney Credit Card ($1,000 limit, no balance) 2004\n\nLowe's Store Card ($1500 limit, no balance) 2014\n\n\nTotal available credit: $33,200\n\nTotal balance: $18,095\n","name":"t3_350xvk","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-06 06:43:13","week":19}

Question Two: Amazon says that once you provide this information, they will contact you to discuss your product and ask for the \"appropriate paperwork.\" Can anyone provide insight into what this process will look like? Again, I am selling a simple product from China, so I really have nothing to show. If it matters, there are dozens of others already selling similar versions of this on the site, so I know they don't have a problem with the product itself.\n\nAny help is much appreciated!!","name":"t3_353f8o","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-06 21:53:22","week":19}

{"id":"353jst","author":"blakmirror","body":"This is me:   http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/\n                                         \n\nI am writing this because since my post I have been receiving a lot of PMs about product selection. From talking to you, a lot of you are still falling into traps many new Amazon sellers have.\n\nSo I am going to be as definitive as I can on product/niche selection on Amazon.  But don’t think this only applies to Amazon this works across the whole ecommerce landscape.\n\nSidenote:  Leave the Amazon Affiliate sites alone, you can make good money but not great money.  Additionally, you do not want to be at the will of Google's ever-changing SEO rules. \n\n\nThe Golden Product\n\nThere is NO such thing. There is no product you can list that will magically give you sales off the bat with minimum to no effort. So many newbies drive themselves crazy trying to find \"the one\" product that will make them 1,000,000 in one month and let them be able to quit their jobs. It doesn't exist, find product(s) that meet the criteria below and you're good to go.  Are you guaranteed a home run, following the criteria ....NO.  But your chances of finding a dud is reduced by about 70-80%, depending on the category you choose to enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basics\n\nYou can find this list on any blog, but I'll recount it here for the new guys. To compete with Amazon FBA your product should:\n\n1.\tBe small (shipping and Amazon FBA purposes\n2.\tLightweight (shipping purposes)\n3.\tDurable/Not easily broken (shipping purposes)\n4.\tIn Demand (extremely important more on this later)\n5.\tNot dominated by a brand that instantly comes to mind (batteries=Duracell; diapers=Huggies)\n6.\tCan be sold on Amazon for at least $10.00\n7.\tCan build a brand around it (silicone spatula, silicone baking mat, silicone baking cups)\n\nFollowing these criteria many products on Amazon can be private labeled.  You should be safe when it comes to shipping costs and Amazon FBA\ns ability to both ship and hold your product without any additionally fees beyond your $40 monthly professional fee. \n\n\n\n\n\nCategories to Avoid\n\nJewelry= too much variety, hard to determine what's really in demand\n\nMobile Accessories= too much competition, will need a lot of capital to compete\n\nSupplements= too much competition, too much regulation, ultimately not worth it.  Yes, its profitable and essentially a perfect product besides all the regulation but overall just not worth it.\n\n\n\nBest Categories when it Comes to Demand\n\n1.\tBeauty\n2.\tHome and Kitchen\n3.\tKitchen and Dining\n4.\tPet Supplies\n5.\tPatio, Lawn, and Garden \n\n\n\nWhere to Look for Products\n\n1.\tAmazon: BSR rankings above 8000 in the main category; the \"Most Wished For\" list and the \"Movers and Shakers\" list\n2.\tAlibaba/Dhgate/Aliexpress/GlobalSources: simply find ideas on these sites, can't find search volume here\n3.\tEbay: Look at the \"Just Sold\" and \"Hot Listings\"\n4.\tNiche-sites: look at what products are on the front (home) page, they are their for a reason (ex. PetSupplies.com)\n\n\nTrend Sites\n\nBetting on yourself and jumping on a trend can be largely popular\n\n1.\tTrendwatching.com/trends\n2.\tTrendhunter.com\n3.\tGoogle.com/trends\n4.\tSpringwise.com\n\n\nSome of these are expensive, not recommended for beginners.  When you get some capital and some know-how then attack the trends\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Demand/Search Traffic\n\nThis is the most important factor in choosing a product.\n\nThe question you want to ask yourself is:  Is my product in demand with my target market?\n\n\nHow do I know?\n\n1.\tAmazon BSR: Good, not great indicator of a product's demand.  Again, look for products below 8000 in the main category and below 2000 for your very first product. Also, look for multiple representations of your product  above the numbered range. \n2.\tGoogle Keyword Planner:  Gives you search volume\n3.\tGoogle.com/trends: lets you know more and more people are looking for your product, and steady trend going up is a good sign\n4.\tMerchantwords.com: aggregates Amazon's number of keyword search terms (similar to Google Keyword Planner, good but not entirely accurate; be careful \n\nLook for a total search volume across all these channels of more than 8-12,000 for the main keyword, \n\nNumbers across all these channels should give you a good idea of demand and market share. \n\nYou have to know what search terms are most relevant to your product.   You can do this through Google's Keyword Planner.  Software I use to find the Top 10 searches across multiple platforms (Google, YouTube, Amazon, Wikipedia) is Freshkey.com\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Competition Assessment\n\nTake all this in to account, some categories have way more competition than others\n\nProduct Photos: well done, professional, more than one?  You will always want to get product pictures either on par  or close to your competition?\n\nBSR of Main Category (ex. Kitchen and Dining, Sports and Outdoors): Are there multiple representations of your product below the 8000 BSR range? Is there at least one in the top 1000? The top 500? The more diverse the range the easier it will be to get your share. \n\nPrice Points: How varied are they?  Can you sell your product from 10-20? From $10-40?  NO real parameter here just good to have options.  The wider the range the better, but don't have the lowest price be too low?\n\nReviews:  The number of reviews is very important. Any product with over 2000 reviews is tough competitor? Under 1000 is tough, but beatable? Under 500, you can definitely take him.  Quality of reviews is also important how many 3 and 4 star reviews a product has can help you determine a product's weakness and can give you what you need to make sure your product doesn't lack. \n\nBundles:  Are they selling more than one?  This a definite factor when it comes to customers to buying your product.\n\nSpecial Features:  A competitive advantage that many products don't already have.  They can be beaten, but to be safe make sure you can have special feature that competes or the same feature. \n\n\nSidenote: Competition is good don't be afraid.  If you are worried I have options for you below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Strategy\n\nAs I said before in my previous post products should be viewed at as stocks and should be treated as such.  \nDon't get too emotionally attached.  If you see the product just isn't going anywhere let it go. Move on. The costs are both time and money. But you only need one winner to kick-start your brand.\n\nRemember, you are building a brand, a business, or for the sake of the analogy of stock portfolio.  Some products will do better than others this is only natural.  As with stocks you may not see great short-term results, but long-term you'll find a few winners.\n\nMy strategy for building a brand is/was that:\n\nMy first product should have multiple representations below 2000 BSR in the main category.  This product should be able to fund others with its profits\n\nSidenote: Introduce a new product to your brand when you are financially comfortable enough to do so, if it takes you a year to implement so be it, three months so be it.  But make sure your first product is a success before moving on. \n\nThe second product should be below 8000 BSR and preferably be a slightly more expensive than the first (on Amazon).\n\nThe third product should be below 8000 BSR and the price point on Amazon should not matter as long as you are meeting your personal financial goals. \n\n\nAn important thing to understand is that you don't have to be number one to make money on Amazon.  Figure out the numbers you need to hit to meet your personal financial goals and pick the second and third products based on that along with the previous criteria in the other sections of this post.  \n\n\"Just enough\" is perfectly okay. You don't have to be an Amazon Superstar to make good money. \n\nEx. Sell a product for $15.00\n\nSourced for $3.50\nShipped for $2.50\nAmazon Fee $2.67\n\nThat's about $6.33 profit per product.  Say you sell 10 units a day over 30 is about $1800 dollars...passive income.  This is rent and utilities for a single person as well. \n\n\n\n\nDisrupters (The Big Idea) /Review Triage\n\nMany of you are PMing me with your \"big\" idea.  I know inventing and bringing to a life is a dream of millions, but it simply isn't necessary to be successful in the Amazon/eCommerce market space. \n\nMy suggestion is to wait. Wait, until you have the proper capital to develop and market your \"big\" idea without losing your shirt if it all falls flat.  You should start small.  You want a competitive advantage; look no further than the reviews of your competitors.  See what people want (new colors, new sizes, etc) See what other products lack (durability, more quantity[bundling])... then talk to suppliers and oblige the customer requests.  Easy. \n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\nI know what you want: \"What categories are high in demand but have low competition?\"\n\n1.\tBaby\n2.\tSports and Outdoors\n3.\tTravel Accessories (across many departments)\n\nYou can dominate with an order of 600+ units and a giveaway of about 250 units easily (take this with a grain of salt, results may vary)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nRemember to start small.\n\nDon't stress out on product selection. \n\nOne product is a passive income stream. A brand (multiple products) is a business. \n\nRemember this, and in the long term you'll be fine\n\nWant to know more about Amazon FBA; go to my full overview post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33ix6y/want_to_buy_an_amazon_course_let_me_save_you_5000/\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus\n\nA lot of people have been having search string problems, so to make it easier on me and you check out AzonSellerTools.com.

{"id":"354mah","author":"inchworminching","body":"\nI started looking at better budgeting a few months ago, and feel as if i'm in a semi hopeless situation. I am able to live pretty frugal, but after pretty minimum spending and just feeding myself (and my cats) at the end of each month it doesnt seem like im able to pay more than 100-150$ total between all my cards (not including car payment). Two of my cards have a 0% intro rate that will expire next month and the month after. I'm looking for advice as to which steps I should take before then. \n\n\n\nAccounts: |Debt: | Limit: | Int:\n---|---|----|----\nCredit Union Line of Credit | 0 | 1000 | 10.25%\nCredit Union Car Loan\t| 2,153.79 | x | 5.09%\nCredit Union Visa Card| 136.00 | 3500.00 | 9.99%\nChase Slate | 1302.00 | 2000.00 | 22.99% (0% til 07/2015)\nChase Amazon | 380.51 | 1500.00 | 222.24%\nCapital One | 1364.91 | 2500.00 | 21.99% (0% til 06/2015)\n\n-Total income **Roughly $880 biweekly**\n\n**-690$/mo in non-debt related bills:**\n\n* \tRent(450/mo)\n* \tPhone(60/mo)\n* \tAuto insurance(115/mo)\n* \tHealth insurance(65/mo)\n\n\n\nA little bit about me that may help. I work as a driver and spend around 250/mo on gas. This is not claimable on my taxes, it's paid for as part of my income. I have no other sources of income. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment with a roommate, him paying 385/mo and me paying around $450 total depending on the gas and electric costs for the month. My living situation isn't horrible though(imo), and I haven't been able to find any non-government funded housing that is as cheap in this area. My phone bill is bare minimum, and a phone is required for my work. I had a dental surgery that set me back 3300$ on a CareCredit card 2 years ago, and i've just finished paying it off. I poorly managed my credit cards, and spent where i shouldn't have as well. Some of that carecredit balance was transferred to my capital 1 card.\n Now I am just trying to put myself in a place where i have no debt and a little bit of money set aside. I've already sold everything that i own worth any money aside from my car and put it towards my cards with highest interest. Although my debt is high for my income, I've made my minimum payments and so far avoided most interest fees. I've also never missed a minimum payment, my credit should look pretty good.\n\nMy options:\n\n* I have an offer for a BoA 16.99%apr card with the first 18 months 0% interest on balance transfers and purchases. It has a 3% fee for balance transfers. \n\n* I have an offer for a Citi 20.99%apr card with the first 12 months 0% interest on balance transfers and purchases. I think the fee is 3% as well.\n\n* Once my car loan is paid off I can lower my auto insurance from 115/mo to 52/mo. Currently paying 158/mo on car payment.\n\n* I live in virginia, and have considered food stamps. I don't very much feel as if my situation is bad enough to warrant them though. \n\nI'm considering opening the BoA card and transferring my car loan onto it(or a chunk of the loan to it), so that my auto insurance will be lowered and the extra 63$/mo can go towards my existing debt. The I would transfer the capital 1 and slate balances to it as well and pay off as much as possible each month. \n\nIf I don't do that I could open the BoA card and transfer my Cap 1 and Slate balances to it, but I really just don't know what is best to do. If the slate and cap 1 cards are paid off and i dont use them, should i close them? Does it look bad on my credit to never use the line of credit and my carecredit card, should i close them as well?\n\nThank you so much for your help and your time\n\n","name":"t3_354mah","subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created_utc":"2015-05-07 03:44:04","week":19}

{"id":"356ghw","author":"self_promotion","body":"Hello entrepreneurs and fellow freedom seekers. I am a long time lurker of this subreddit and occasional poster. I have been experimenting will all kinds of revenue streams in an effort to “pad” my 9 – 5 salary and fulfill my entrepreneurial itch. I have built affiliate websites similar to This Is Why I’m Broke, sold productized digital marketing services, and offered resume writing services – just to name a few. Unfortunately, none of them took off.\n\nI struggled to understand why none of these ideas became a success. And then it hit me – light bulb -- my next project will focus on something I know really well. I am currently a marketing manager at a global professional services firm with a salary in the 6 digits.  But it took me a while to reach this level. I started out as a data entry analyst making $28k with no upward mobility.  Then I got laid off, lost my dad and became depressed. Life sucked big time. After a year, I found a similar position but this time I leveraged each opportunity along the way to find a better job. I boosted my online personal brand, took online courses, improved my public speaking and interview skills, optimized my resume and cover letter, attended industry events, and connected with senior level employees. In essence, I utilized a set of techniques that any marketer and many other employees can apply to launch their own career.\n \nThree months ago I published [Career Unlock](http://careerunlock.com/), a free guide (no email required) that shows marketers how to find the right job and build a foundation for a prosperous career. That’s right, it is free. So how did I make more than $5,000? Well, I take a job seeker on a step-by-step path with recommended products and tools that they can purchase to help their prospects of landing a better job. The products / tools have affiliate programs (via Clickbank, Amazon, Shareasale, CJ, etc.) and that is how I have made my money thus far. It is that simple. Eventually, I would like to create my own digital products or even customize my own resume portfolio folder, but for now I have setup a passive revenue stream that I believe can be replicated in many different ways.\n\nThe reason why I am sharing this wisdom with the community is because I have learned so much from other entrepreneurs in this sub and it’s time to give back. Also, the added promotion doesn’t hurt.\n\nI’ll be around to answer any questions on how I wrote and published [Career Unlock](http://careerunlock.com/) and I would love your feedback as well. Here are a few other thoughts if you are interested in publishing a free guide:\n\n* Make sure your guide has credibility. Tell your story with personal experiences and highlight your struggles and how you overcame them.\n\n* The guide needs to incorporate products and tools that have affiliate programs.\n\n* Include a \"Resources\" page at the end of the guide that lists all of your affiliate products that the reader encountered along the way. The “Resources” page is like the gift shop at the end of a museum. \n\n* Penetrate communities that focus on your topic and ask questions. Answer their questions within your guide and link back to the guide and repeat. Also, provide examples and case studies of your struggles along with a link back to the guide.\n\n* Create a \"system\" that incorporates the steps of your guide. The \"system\" can be branded and in effect will be easier to promote. I created something called the \"Point C\" Path which helps deflect a hiring manager away from the other candidates.\n\n* As the guide continues to gain readers, I will analyze the metrics to determine which elements are popular and I will create my own products (eBooks, video courses) that will drill down deeper. I will sprinkle my own products throughout the guide, thus relying less on affiliate sales.\n\nOnce again, here is a link to the guide: http://careerunlock.com/\n","name":"t3_356ghw","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","created_utc":"2015-05-07 16:35:26","week":19}

It is set up to a bunch of automatic payments like Netflix so I just keep those minor things paid off regularly.\n\nAfter checking my online banking I have a bunch of charges I do not recognize and definitely did not make. \n\nThe charges are for some American home improvement store and some sort of online computer store.

As I delve deeper into the project, looking for tracks and albums that I want to review, I'm finding that the only place to find a lot of these songs are Youtube.\n\nAmazon does carry many of them but there are so many that play on the radio almost daily in my country, that are no where to be found for purchase.\n\nWhile the consumption of mainstream music seems to be steadily moving away from downloads to streaming services, I can't help but feel there is a long-tail market out there for the genre. It may only be a matter of time before these songs end up on streaming or download services. But I still think that a service dedicated to the genre/region will provide value by filtering and curating the particular music in one place. Much of it is older music but still enjoyed and sought out by a large diaspora of people around the world.\n\nDoes anyone have insight or opinion as to whether downloads are just too passe? Are streaming services so ubiquitous that people will just stick to whatever they offer? Is youtube fine enough for most people that they don't care to have their own tracks anymore?

I use a different credit card for every transaction based on the reward I get from it (Southwest Airlines flights on SW Airlines credit card, TJ Maxx purchases on TJ Maxx card, etc). \nRecently I've been trying to simplify my life and am realizing that paying all these credit cards every month complicates my purchase tracking and budgeting greatly.

Between the miles I have on my Amex and the hotels.com nights from my company, I don't need any travel rewards. I'd rather have cash back or gift cards from stores I use.\nI'm trying to see if I should apply for a new card (Chase Preferred Sapphire? Ink Bold?

After purchasing the card with my new credit card that I want to hit minimum spending on, I called the phone number to set the PIN number to one I would remember easily.\n\nI then drove across the road to Walmart to buy the blue bird starter box. When I went to pay for the kit it wouldn't accept the card and was immediately rejected. The card is issued by U.S. Bank National Association. I read on here before that fixed amount cards seemed to have better success rates and the ability to use a pin is a must. Also that vanilla cards aren't excepted at Walmart.

I've never had a return on Amazon.

Even if this isn't the case I would like to offer a return to him because even though the item is clearly correct (The World of the Sandman is the specific name of the 3 volume set and the copyright of 1991 which is clearly stated is why it says the complete run because this was the complete run in 1991) I can understand his confusion and would rather refund than have an unhappy buyer.\n\nBasically I just want to know if I'm correct that I would have to refund the money anyways once he puts in a request, if I could offer him a partial refund or a full refund - shipping as options, and how I can go about doing this without risking some kind of defect considering that he hasn't filed an actual return request yet.","name":"t1_cqz1uaf","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-05 15:39:12","week":19}

It sounds like this might need some shoring up.  Since you have already paid the postage, if the item is still in the same condition as when you sent it to them, you could give them a partial refund.

{"id":"cqzr8qk","author":"hlxco","body":"There are a few ways to look at this.\n\n(1) In general terms, your policy is reasonable.  It sets a reasonable boundary &amp; keeps you at a distance from problems.  \n\n(2) Getting more specific, you can &amp; should measure how much profit you make in exchange to the amount of risk that you take on.  I have no idea the kind of business that you run.  But pulling numbers out of a hat, I guess that you are a manufacturer, offer a $10K credit limit &amp; make 35% margins.  Assuming this to be true, this means that for every 3 sales, you've made in profit the amount of money that you might lose if the entire relationship goes sideways.  Given that, the business becomes less a matter of protocol and more of a judgement call.  If you feel that they are going to go out of business on that transaction, you will want to press them.  If not, you might let it ride to assure the following transaction.\n\n(3) How valuable are you for your product &amp; how valuable are you as a source of cash flow?  I've known many companies to deal with anyone who gives them credit.  They make sales to flip the goods &amp; buy themselves time.  It's not the best way to do business, but it isn't your problem.  They benefit you in profit &amp; benefit themselves in cash flow.  When you take away their benefit, they take away yours.  Are people buying your product because you have the best prices/products?  Or is the cash flow the part that sweetens the deal?\n\n(4) What is their business model like?  Many sellers on Amazon will not be able to meet the standard 30 day policy because they will not see their money in that time &amp; cannot float the difference.  This does not make their company less viable.  Only less viable in a rigid timespan.\n\nRecapping my point, yours is a perfectly reasonable policy.  If your aim/temperament is to minimize risk, stay the course.  If you're looking to understand how to visualize the field to maximize your profit (at the expense of added risk) and create a win-win situation; consider the alternatives.","name":"t1_cqzr8qk","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-05-06 03:36:03","week":19}

What my concern is is that this type of business is really in its infancy, and may not be a viable option 5,10, 20 years later. Instead of clearance sales, stores may start FBAing their own stuff, maybe Amazon changes the rules and no longer allows  retail arbitrage. I am not saying that any of these things will happen, but they could. That is not to say that you can't get an education later in life if things start to go south, but personally I do think an education is still a good insurance policy.\n\nNow that I flip (part time), I will encourage my kids to flip when they become teenagers. There is literally no good reason to work at McDonald's when you can work a quarter of the time flipping and make 10 times as much money. I will however still encourage them to get an education of some kind post-secondary, particularly in their case as they will be in the workplace much longer than I will.\n\nThink about how different the world is in the last 30 years, it's naive to assume that people will still be doing FBA in 2045.","name":"t1_cr0aeok","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-06 17:26:07","week":19}

{"id":"cr15blk","author":"duckduck_goose","body":"I do. Here's my run down after using these apps at least 2 years in some cases:\n\nIbotta is my most utilized. Rebates are almost instant. It used to be a $5 cash out and now it's $10. I'm vegan and there's a broad range of items I can rebate on; More when you eat a normal diet. That said, I did a combo in April for Silk Soy Milk and ended up paying .24 cents out of pocket. For milk! Also I've talked to customer service and they're very nice. The app pays directly into your paypal. I've made $240+ in about 2 years use which doesn't break down to much but some months I do $3 and others I do $40. The app combines amazingly with coupon deals and some of the below listed apps. I used it last week for garbage bags. A $5 sale, a $1 off coupon I doubled to $1.50, $1 on MobiSave and .75 back from Ibotta. That was for like 45 Hefty garbage bags :)\n\nShopmium was my biggest earner ever during the Beyond Meat rebate because it connected to Ibotta, BerryCart (another app for organic/veg items), Target store coupons, Whole Foods coupons and a Beyond Meat coupon. So I got about a 8 month supply of meat and walked away with cash in my pocket. No joke I made money by stocking up on meat items. The payouts are within 5 days and go direct to paypal even when it's just $1. Also it rejected one of my receipts for Beyond Meat and then 3 weeks later I get an email saying it was honoring the rebate because I'm a valued user. That was nice.\n\nCheckout51 I've had since November 2013. I've earned $43 total. I think of it like a change jar. I mean every month I add about $1 in cash backs for produce. Recently I put $8 in the change jar because of all the combos I did couponing. You need $20 to cash out and they send a check. I got my last check in April. It's a long road to my next $20. The check also seems to come from Siberia on an ice floe - it comes that slowly via snail mail.\n\nSnap is like the above. You need to reach $20. A few times the rebates haven't been honored or found too. So it's also a change jar. I signed up when I first heard of it and I'm only at $13. A lot of the time I just Snap at it when there's produce rebates. It does cash out to paypal I believe but don't quote me because I've never cashed out Snap.\n\nSaving Star is one not in the title but I've cashed out several times from it. They have free things every Friday. Nothing to do back flips over but hey I got a little Jiffy Cornbread box free. (it's normally 60 cents but free is free) They also have a healthy savings offer each week so I've saved 20% on produce. Plus they do offers like spend $15 and get $5 back that match up with couponing or are easy to reach. (My first cash out was just from buying Simple products and reaching the $5) I think you need under $10 but over $5 to cash out. It goes to paypal. I think my total payout from there has been $20~\n\nMobiSave isn't being talked about yet but I've started using it April 16th. It's a mix of Shopmium and Ibotta. It's iphone only and you need to be invited in! I've saved $25 buying my regular items (no produce yet but I've saved on salad dressing, wheat thins - don't judge me - gum, juice, trashbags) so like $25 back in less than 1 month isn't too bad. I'm a heavy couponer, FYI. Anyhow the rebate is instant. Within 10 minutes I have a payout. This is how I got those $6 in Checkout51 in April too. *When you download the app it will tell you that you need to wait to be invited in once you make a new account. It took my account a week to get the invite. This was last month.*\n\nBerrycart as I mentioned elsewhere is organic and vegan friendly items. I've cashed out a few times and the limit to cash out is $5. You can transfer the money into paypal. However since March there have been zero offers that I'd use which is a bummer. I learned from the Beyond Meat hustle that it's mad forgiving though and as a vegan I keep it because when there's good deals it works great for me.\n\nReceipt Hog is super slow. I started to use it in midFebruary and I JUST NOW broke 1,000 pts. I'm also kind of shameless and have dug receipts out of the trash, picked them up off the ground and so on. So if I'm a hustler image a regular user's sad point total. I think of it like a change jar and I use all these apps so it's not much extra to snap it in. I can get a whole $5 with my 1000 pts.\n\nReceipt Pal is a little faster and takes e-receipts. Again I've hustled the same as above and joined both at the same time. I'm at 3,000 points on this one and can cash out for something like $10 on Amazon. I don't even know really. The e-receipts is a boon because I do order stuff online a lot including concert tickets.\n\nI also have Jingit but in like a year (ish) I've earned about $4. So I hardly even open it and when I do it's always the same .25 cent rebates on bread, milk, chips. It's any brand of that stuff but it's still kind of underwhelming. I also have Shrink but I still can't figure out how to make it work. It's just weird.\n\nI also have Shopkick for when I'm out couponing which I've received $25 back after 2 months of kicking. It's high effort in a midsized city and low reward unless your hobby is couponing like me. \n\nAll of this probably takes me more time than normal people but I have no life and I tell people couponing is my hobby. And well my ex commented I am more up to speed on apps than he was and he was an app developer. \n\nI'm probably going to go download Flipp now.","name":"t1_cr15blk","subreddit":"Frugal","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbe","created_utc":"2015-05-07 08:13:32","week":19}

{"id":"cr17t2m","author":"moumouren","body":"&gt; One of the great mysteries of today's market is the way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock trades at such a huge discount to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. In terms of price-to-earnings, Apple trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 12, while Amazon trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 193. This happens despite Apple growing revenues faster than Amazon, growing earnings, and growing estimates. Amazon not only has revenues that grow slower, but its earnings have been falling for two years straight. Amazon's earnings are also predicted to fall in 2012 vs. 2011, and its next-quarter earnings are predicted to fall 95% from the year before. Finally, Amazon's EPS estimates for the next quarter were slashed 90% just days ago.\n\n&gt; Knowing this, it's hard to understand how Amazon can not only trade at a premium to Apple, but indeed trade at an earnings valuation multiple that is a full 16 times larger than Apple's. To put things into perspective, if Apple traded at Amazon's earnings multiple, it would trade at $9,000. Or if Amazon traded at Apple's multiple, it would trade for just $14.16.\n\n&gt;So is there any explanation for this absurd disconnect? Yes, there might be one.","name":"t1_cr17t2m","subreddit":"ValueInvesting","subreddit_id":"t5_2rndg","created_utc":"2015-05-07 10:57:33","week":19}

{"id":"cr1btu0","author":"sords","body":"I see your point, but go ahead post that burnt toast but in month 7,8,9,24 if it still hasn't sold there should be a deterrent in this case a free listing squeeze to not list this stuff over and over.  I've mentioned it before, 2+ years ago I bought a box of 1970s projector lamp light bulbs for around $10, there were about 20 bulbs that sell for about $10 each.  How many of these projectors are out there being used and how often does one of these dozen different varieties bulbs that I purchased need to be replaced by some consumer.  It's disappointing that I may not be able to fulfill someone's need if I can't list these and I have absolutely no use for them but ebay I believe is trying to create a 1:1 supply demand scenario for such things, no need for me and 5 other sellers to have them listed if one bulb is bought every 6 months.  At the same time I think ebay is also trying to get sellers to price their things to sell, it may drive prices down, but bargain shoppers will look to ebay first.\n\nI'm usually very anti-ebay with their policies and I hate change in regards to anything, but I can understand this change and I think it will be beneficial in reducing clutter and competition.  \n\nThe media increase on the other hand is stupid.  You can list on amazon easily and for free.  Amazon is killing in the media category yet ebay wants to charge more and reduce the number of media listings on their site.  If priced right media flies off the shelf  it has to be one of their biggest selling categories.","name":"t1_cr1btu0","subreddit":"Flipping","subreddit_id":"t5_2y9q6","created_utc":"2015-05-07 15:01:20","week":19}

{"id":"cr1enb7","author":"moumouren","body":"Actually I took a cursory look at their 2013 financial statements. It seems that the reason for their losses are twofold: firstly gross margins are very low, which is fine; but they also have very high administrative expenses which eat up everything left. I dug into it and found that two aspects were the leading causes: Sales &amp; Fulfillment. Sales is the commissions etc. to bring revenues, while Fulfillment refers to affiliates-related activity. There is no further drill-down analysis.\n\nNow, the main argument for Amazon actually being wildly profitable if they stopped reinvesting is that the cash flows are being \"sunk\" into CAPEX, right? Since the bulk of SG&amp;A are Sales and Fulfillment, the increase in net profit if they stop reinvesting will have to come from either of these. I did a little more research into what Sales and Fulfillment means. Sales apparently is quite straightforward - commissions etc, so there's little room for interpretation there. But Fulfillment is a little trickier - they mostly relate to warehouse activity. As the cost of building new warehouses and scaling their SaaS segment makes up most of their reinvestments, these \"sunk\" cash flows are being attributed to Fulfillment expenses. \n\nBut remember that CAPEX does not flow through the income statement - it goes straight to the balance sheet and is reflected as depreciation/amortization, and is insignificant compared to both Sales and Fulfillment. So Fulfillment expenses on the income statement doesn't actually relate to reinvesting activity, but rather the ancillary costs of building new warehouses, e.g. hiring more people, or paying for rights to inventory. Or they could just as well be amortization of Goodwill from their robust acquisition spree, like the impressive Kiva robots. In any case, this means that Fulfillment expenses do not actually go down when reinvestment stops - they simply stop scaling up. Thus, the net profit figure that you see now is the actual future free cash flow if they simply stopped investing today. \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that I do not see how the argument that they would be profitable if they stopped reinvesting makes sense. The income statement matches cash flows across time, so it reflects how future cash flows will look like assuming Amazon remains as a going concern. Which means that cash flows will eventually catch up with profits; which means future cash flows = net profit. Which is bad news for Amazon. Cash flows may appear strong today, but that is just \"float\" which has to eventually be absorbed by future outflows. \n\nedit - Tl;dr: Amazon is not sinking money into future growth. It is sinking money into upkeep of past growth activity, which is correctly reflected as expenses. Therefore the net profit figure IS the correct amount of free cash flow. Unless I'm missing something else, the net profit/retained earnings figure is all the future cash shareholders will enjoy from present day business.","name":"t1_cr1enb7","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-05-07 16:33:06","week":19}
{"id":"cr1f4x6","author":"bringindabacon","body":"That's a pretty fair assessment.  My question would be how many other nonessential expenditures are wrapped up in fulfillment? For instance they're dumping money in to the drone program and same day delivery(as well as their grocery services that are just starting up) which I'd expect would all fall under fulfillment.  I haven't dug that in to their 10k much so I may be missing something but what I'm getting at is a lot of those expenses aren't necessarily something that will relate directly to future net profit but rather expansions of their fulfillment to new areas expected to create new revenue streams. \n\nAs far as the low gross margins that's to be expected.

They are reinvesting to support things such as amazon prime, and to improve service levels. \n\nLike you said, these DCs are on the balance sheet until they are completed. At which point they only impact the income statement through depreciation. The only thing limiting/reducing reinvestment would do, is create a much higher cash balance. I imagine once they stop with the reinvesting in north america, they will look to other markets to do the same. Or, just bump up dividends.","name":"t1_cr1jwm1","subreddit":"investing","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhq","created_utc":"2015-05-07 18:52:48","week":19}

I don't drive so ditching your car can be done. I pay the $100/mo for Trimet because I hate the rain. I got my apartment in 2012 and my friend thinks my rent is $1 a month because it's cheap compared to 2015 rents. Rent is still a huge chunk for me and it's more than the 35% or whatever bullshit of my income. A lot of people split a 600 sq ft 1 bedroom or studio with an SO. You can spend 1 - 3 months seeking a rental deal and look at 100s of shitty rentals full of mold. YAY!? \n\nI shop at Winco. I coupon elsewhere. Food is a fraction of what I used to spend. I never eat out or it's only if I'm social which stresses me out so I end up becoming a hermit because I hate spending $$ on things I can find cheaper just to hang. I hate the bar scene, I dislike IPAs, I was straight edge for 12 years so drinking/herb are rare if ever. If there's herb it's because some dude has it and I think it's a good idea but since my last anxiety with it a year ago I think it's NOT a good idea. It gives me massive anxiety.\n\nI plan for travel and save aggressively. You can ditch a car if you find a close in spot and even not take trimet by biking everywhere. I spend $100/mo on trimet. I spend $30 on electric/gas. $60 on internet only. $100 or less on groceries. I thrift shop for everything first; Scoop sales second; Use Amazon third [or price compare]. \n\nI see bands 2 to 4 times a month and buy records from them actually. I spent a lot in April to pre-purchase tix for Refused and Shellac this month/July. Both are sold out already. This month I'm saving everything to attend Fest in Florida. $1000+ but I'll later \"sell\" off space in my hotel so I'll recoup some money. I think basically I've spent for my music holiday to Fest $700~ all told. I know about it a year in advance so I save for it and spread that out each month.\n\nI'm planning to go back to school. Why?

{"id":"cr2tvh3","author":"mailingsvc","body":"I manage a fulfillment company so I do this all the time.  It is very likely that you will find that the USPS will be the least expensive on average if you want to stick to one carrier and one process.  There are some other options that might be even less expensive depending on your specific needs.  I mention FedEx a lot in this post but most places you can also interchange UPS and the same thing applies.\n\nBased on your package specs here are two scenarios\n\nShipping from 23220 (VA) to 90210 (CA) (coast to coast)\n\n* $15.52 - USPS Priority Mail with with Commercial Plus Pricing\n* $13.33 - USPS Parcel Select\n* $11.00 - FedEx Smart Post\n* $9.91 - FedEx Ground (to commercial address)\n* $13.39 - FedEx Ground (to residential address)\n\nShipping from 23220 (VA) to 37615 (TN) (One shipping zone away e.g. not local delivery)\n\n* $5.95 - USPS Priority Mail with with Commercial Plus Pricing\n* $8.23 - FedEx Smart Post\n* $7.10 - FedEx Ground (to commercial address)\n* $10.51 - FedEx Ground (to residential address)\n\nRates will likely be somewhere between these depending on where it is going in the country.\n\nSmart post is a hybrid delivery system between FedEx and the postal service.  Basically FedEx delivers the package to the closest post office and then the post man takes it to the door.  This system works well but does add about two days to the shipping time.  Also tracking can be a little spotty with this method, but it can be quite efficient from a cost standpoint, especially if the packages are heavier.  UPS and DHL both have a similar offering.  The DHL solution is often cost effective if you are mailing a lot of packages at once.  I have found they are much more interested in negotiating pricing for \"special\" jobs.  It sounds like with your peaks and valleys that might be a good fit.\n\nAlso with the postal service you can get something called Commercial Plus Pricing if you plan to ship 5000 or more packages in a year.  For the first year you just have to say you expect to ship that many and if you do't then you won't get the pricing for the next year.  If you are doing 1000 every three months you are going to be awfully close to that already so I would do it.  Its very easy to sign up for if your patient.  You fill out an application and then wait for the folks at the USPS to process in their own sweet time.  Once that is done your rates for Priority Mail are lowered.  If you use Endicia (~$40 per month subscription for the pro version) to make your labels (I recommend it) then the pricing is reflected in that interface.  For the most part the pricing give you priority mail service (2 day delivery to most of the US) for the price of standard first class parcel rates.\n\nI am not sure how many of those 1000 every three months you will be sending at the same time.  If you are sending them all at once then you can look at what presort options are out there.  I am not going to dive into the myriad of options there because I don't know enough about your needs to give good advice, but there are options and some of them can cut your price pretty dramatically depending on the specifics.\n\nAs far as free printers from a carrier.  Nothing is free even if they say it is. It is kind of like the free cell phone.  The cost of the cell phone is built into your rates.  Never tell them you want a printer.  Negotiate rates, and then after the fact ask them if you can have one.  Usually you are better off just getting one off of Amazon that you can user for many things.  The ones FedEx \"gives\" you are proprietary for their software, so you can not use it to make labels for UPS and USPS without a lot of jumping through hoops to get the drivers configured.  Also if you are only shipping 4 times a year then you might be better off just using most carriers bulk label service.  You send them a spreadsheet of your addresses and they print the labels and overnight them to you.  They usually do some data clean up and address validation too so it helps cut down on  common shipping errors if you can't do that in house.  There are a lot of services out there that often the sales reps don't even know they offer.  If you want something ask them to do it even if you have no idea if they can.  Sometimes they will come back and say sure, but the worst they will say is no.\n\n\n\n","name":"t1_cr2tvh3","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-05-08 21:06:39","week":19}

The other goal you need to set out, even before you think of what ideas to try out is just how much you intend to make from your initial $3k in 4 months...for example, let's say you want to grow your initial capital by 30%, this means you need to generate $900 in 4 months. With that in mind, it's then easy to generate a list of things/ideas that you can implement to let you achieve your goals. \n\nFor example, you could easily setup an Amazon FBA account (assuming you don't have one) - this would cost you $ 120 by August (Amazon charges pro seller fee of $39.99/month but give you the first month free..)...now you have $2880 left, do some deep research, buy an ebook and also hook up with the very helpful guys on this subreddit plus others like r/fulfillmentbyAmazon or r/Amazonseller to give you some helpful tips on doing FBA right.

{"id":"cr3lp6d","author":"lancertons","body":"Ten years ago when everyone was going digital, I made about 1,000 a month flipping collections at my peak. I got away from it for several reasons, but primarily because several Amazon customers can torpedo your ratings quick if they don't read the description and buy your CDs that don't have a case. Even without the original case, you want to at least use a paper sleeve to look like you're making an effort to protect the disc. Thin plastic cases are nicer--you used to be able to buy a good protective case in bulk for around 20c a unit on eBay, but I haven't priced them recently. If a CD is rare/out of print, it fetches money regardless. I sold a caseless out of print CD to a Japanese customer for $50 once, but those hits are few and far between unless you really know your stuff. If you do have a good title to sell, you can use a cardboard mailer--heck, even butcher paper, but the customer complaint potential for \"inadequate packaging\" isn't worth the potential savings. Small padded mailers are the best to keep you around 4oz for a CD/DVD without a case. When a blockbuster closed near me a few years ago, I bought 75 caseless copies of The Blind Side for 25c each. Black Friday came around and I was the low price on Amazon and sold out quick making $1-1.50 profit per copy--which didn't seem like a bad deal at the time. I was very up front about no case in my listing, but still managed to get a couple one star ratings from people who were shocked to get a DVD without a case. Having been burnt many a time and knowing what I know now, I wouldn't even bother cleaning ones that sold for less than $5, unless I wanted to rip the music on one of the CDs. I would pull out the valuable ones and just break them in lots of 10, sell on eBay and ship them media mail. You can put one or two valuable ones in with a handful of soundtracks/crappy titles to get the lot to sell quicker.

{"id":"cr3sy6y","author":"heyletsdothis","body":"Of course the income tax system disagrees.  But look how many rich people are able to minimize their income tax, so I would say even though they pay many more taxes than the rest of us do, the rich pay very few taxes compared to European countries.\n\nAdditionally, the reason why the system is rigged is leverage and connections.  They also say the 1st million is the hardest right?  Thats because once you have it, you can use the money as leverage in other investments to your advantage.  Now imagine you had 10 million.  Or 100 million. Or 1-billion.  The leverage tips in the favor incredibly of the billionaire, who can use his wealth to drive up stock prices, manipulate the market, or price out competitors from the economy.\n\nLook at amazon for example.  They have a lot of income so they have a lot of leverage.  It is documented that Amazon will often sell products at a loss, they will actually lose money selling a particular product if Amazon is trying to kill off an online competitor that sells a similar product. They are trying to  make it impossible for a smaller company to compete with their larger, more powerful company.\n\nAdditionally, lets look at the power money gets you.  Often times the rich are accused of insider trading.  Thats because the rich have access to information before the rest of the common investors do, and they are able to use this information to make trades that make them considerable profit.  Not to mention Congress recently told a judge they can't be investigated for insider trading, although it is widely documented that political leaders have access to information about companies far before the rest of the marketplace does.\n\nSo lets go back to your income tax point.  The wealthy often park their money overseas, in Switzerland or the Cayman Islands, to minimize income tax.  Again, the average person does not do this, they don't need to, but also they don't have the assets to do so.

{"id":"cr48xuh","author":"redcards","body":"You can develop your advantage for a company primarily through an informational, analytical, or emotional edge. \n\nAn informational edge is going to probably be the hardest type of edge because this implies you know something about a company, usually material, that the market has not priced in. Something like this would be knowing that a company's Q4 earnings will be higher than estimates/guidance before they're actually released. For all intents and purposes, that is considered trading on insider info and should be avoided. Because so many companies have large analyst coverage its unlikely you'll really ever find a true informational edge for the largest companies. \n\nAn analytical edge is probably my favorite type of edge, because you're not looking for information the market doesn't know you're just trying to dig deeper and come to a different conclusion about the overall business, their financials, or the industry they operate in than what the Street has concluded. So basically, you're just trying to disprove the popular opinion about a company. Sometimes this isn't possible and you shouldn't try to be different just for the sake of being different, but a good example of this type of edge would be with Amazon. They are a revenue/cash flow story, but if you look closely at Amazon's cash flow statement the omit capital leases from their FCF calculation. Simply adding back those expenses to the equation shows that Amazon hasn't been cash flow positive in years. Another reason why an analytical edge is my favorite is because it can be most easily exploited among small/mid cap companies just because a lot of those businesses don't have large analyst coverage, and those that do are typically not the most important company on an analyst's coverage universe so it is likely that something is getting overlooked. Management teams from smaller companies are also more likely to pick up the phone when an outside investor is calling and asking about the overall economics of their industry rather than trying to mine for hints about what next quarter's results are going to be. \n\nThird, you can develop an emotional edge. An emotional edge does not require you to do any in depth analysis or reinvent the wheel on popular companies, you simply need to not pay attention to the market's sometimes volatile reactions to short-term news that can create buying opportunities for certain businesses. For example, there are a metric shit ton of O&amp;G and related businesses that have really been brought down in stock price because of the decline in oil prices. When you start to dig in to a lot of these companies you'll find that their businesses are in tact and the earnings power is still there, and they might not even be that exposed to the price of oil as the short-term market mentality might have believed. This can create a buying opportunity for you, but you need to have the peace of mind as an investor to know that you might have to suffer a quarter or two of disappointing results before the actual value of the company is realized. Another example of something like this would be the crash Apple had back in 2012. If I remember correctly, the reason why the Street was so negative on Apple back then was because the company missed the analyst estimates for the amount of iPhones that would be sold for the quarter, and the stock tanked. Its like, who actually gives a shit about analyst estimates? It was clear that the broader, ecosystem driven earnings potential of Apple was very much still intact and investors would have done well to load up on the stock when everyone else was selling. I know I did. \n\nSo there are multiple ways you can develop your edge on any investment. It involves a lot of hard work and analysis on your part, and I think it'd be useful to start thinking of yourself as a business analyst rather than a stock analyst. Great investments are made by having a phenomenal understanding of a company's business economics and where it places within its value-chain, not having a fancier spreadsheet than everyone else. In fact, if you're not sure whether or not a company is great before you even open your spreadsheet I'd say you are not doing enough homework.

He's one of those guys who always had a silly loud stereo system in his car, and ended up doing side gigs putting radios, tvs, pcs in trucks at truck stops. After his contract was up he opened a car audio shop. That was his path. It started with getting his GED.\n\n I've always done flipping as a side job.

A toy is on clearance at Wal-Mart for $2, you scan it and it is selling for $18 on Amazon and it tells you the Fees for selling it FBA and FBM(you ship it from home, like selling on ebay). The Fees are around $4. Looks like you'll spend $6, plus a couple for shipping it to Amazon so call it $8, making you about a ten dollar bill each sale. Not too bad. If they had 10 of them, I'd buy them all. That's my Path, no GED needed.","name":"t1_cr4f6tv","subreddit":"smallbusiness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr34","created_utc":"2015-05-10 14:01:46","week":19}

{"id":"cr4h3ah","author":"ralibryant","body":"Conflicting views are good, don't worry.\n\nAmazon is a little different because they sell products that are in every store and their edge is price and logistics.\n\nThink about Instagram and the items you see that you would like to buy.\n\nExample: You're scrolling down your feed and you see a shirt. Usually, the seller would direct you to their store. You add it to your cart or bookmark it then browse the store. It's rare that you buy immediately. This leads to abandoning the cart because you find other items, list them, compare, and ask other people about what they think is best. Everything besides making the purchase.\n\nInstead, what if you were directed to a lightweight purchase page with quantity and a few other features in order to buy immediately without the fear of missing out on your options.\n\nAlso, think about why we go to Craigslist. Think about why we rush to buy limited editions. Think about why we rush to buy items that are in limited supply. Think about the girl that sells a dress directly to the people she knows without needing to create a store.\n\nIt's a coupon code that is an item and not the discount of that item.","name":"t1_cr4h3ah","subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","created_utc":"2015-05-10 15:48:42","week":19}

But if you dont feel like it, there is Target. Also, why just Costco? I see that they do have low rates but regional chains are much much better than them in terms of Quality. I personally like Wegmans, Trader Joes, Krogers/Ralphs, Haggens, and second tier stores such as Albertsons/Safeway for some stuff which anyway would not matter. There is also your local ethnic grocery stores, farmer markets which usually give the fresh produce, coops, smaller chains such as Sprouts or many such places. Last resort is the Big lots/Walmarts etc. Whole food is not that bad but it is expensive. So with so much options why pay 40 bucks for Costco?
