I\u2019m currently renting an apartment in the suburbs (single 29m) and in the process of going to school full time while working full time.  The \u2018burbs are fine for now because all I have time for is work and school, but I really have my heart set on relocating to downtown once I\u2019m done with school at the end of this year. \n\n\nMy annual income is 85k, or about $4500 a month.  I currently have about 20k in the bank and 50k in my 401k and Roth IRA.  I have no debt and have been paying for my school as I go, rather than taking out loans.  I have a reliable car that is paid off and has about 40k miles.

When I move to a new place I will no longer have TV service, so that expense should go down by about $100 as well.\n\n\nIn terms of buying a place, I\u2019m really looking at 1-2 br condos in or near downtown (Denver) in the 200-250k price range.  I can\u2019t afford 20% down, so between the mortgage, PMI, HOA fees ($400-500\/mo), taxes, etc. I\u2019d be looking at $1600 - $2000 a month. \n\n\nBased on my current expenditures, would this stretch me too thin?  Or would it make sense to stop paying for school out of pocket, get student loans, and save for a bigger down payment (still below 20%)?  Or do I just wait until I save up enough for 20%, which could be several years?   I\u2019ve been mulling over it for a while and honestly can\u2019t decide.  Would love to hear what you PF experts do in a similar situation. \n","14":"[H] $175 in Amazon Giftcards [W] 90% paypal","15":"[H] PayPal [W] Amazon","16":"So I get an email from coinstar telling me that if I cash in $40 worth of change they will give me a $10 coupon to my local grocery store (where the coinstar is located and also where I buy my groceries).

I built the [site](http:\/\/trapspice.com) from scratch, spread the word via social media, and signed my first artist a few months later. I signed three artists that month, and released their music on all the major sites, such as iTunes, Beatport, Amazon mp3, etc. Being the only employee, I did everything. I wrote an entire distribution contract (14 pages), taught myself Photoshop to make album artwork, taught myself HTML to work with the site, and negotiated with artists. Then school started in the fall. I forgot about the company, and never ended up signing another artist. Because of my lack of marketing, I made very little revenue from the artists I did sign. Trap Spice Recs lost its only employee, and it struggled to survive. I have finally decided to [sell the company](https:\/\/flippa.com\/4343235-electronic-dance-music-record-label-with-180-uniques-mo), as I am moving on to better things.\n\n**Current Project**\n\nI have been teaching myself Javascript, and have already made my [first program](http:\/\/aviationgeek.org\/runways.html). It is targeted to a niche of aviation enthusiasts (including myself!). Basically, it finds the current wind at a certain airport and returns the active runway. This is a useful tool for planespotters, as they need to know which runway planes are landing on. Besides this program, I am also developing the website aviationgeek.org. I envision it as being the ultimate aviation resource, including various information about airports, airplane manufacturers, new routes, etc. As soon as I have more content, I plan on monetizing with Google AdSense. Another monetization method I plan on trying is user subscriptions. I plan on providing personally tailored information to users who pay a certain fee each month. I have already begun laying the framework to have my site integrated with others. I am considering offering access to the active runway program to major aviation sites such as Flightradar24.\n\n\nSo, that's about it! There are a lot of other businesses I have experimented in, but I don't want to bore you.

I've found this community to be really good at educating and reinforcing some great approaches to money issues, and I thought maybe the community would have some ideas for me that would help as I work through some of my concerns.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst off, I think there is a bunch of really good, relevant material on budgeting - but I think it's mostly targeted at getting yourself out of the hole or into saving. My issue is not so much that, but how I can rigidly push myself to get my **savings % of income higher**. Over the past few months, I've really tried to educate myself more about financial independence. I want to get there sooner rather than later. For a long time now (almost a decade of working), I've really budgeted by feel and periodic asset checks. Neither my wife nor myself consider ourselves penny pinchers, but equally, we are more frugal than many people (or at least that's how we view ourselves). Both of us have frugal parents and would say that while we spend more money than they did, we have frugal roots and an appreciation of not blowing money. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhich gets me to my problem. A little in advance of our first child being born, I finally did a more robust check of our finances. Rather than only checking monthly totals on savings, retirement funds, etc, and being comforted that they were going up, I actually pulled together all the checking account and credit card detailed data and categorized to see monthly spend. I was a little shocked, honestly. It opened my eyes as to how much we were spending monthly - **roughly $9k per month**. We've had a lot of big life changes recently, so I think it was easy to write the transfers from savings to checking off as due to one time expenses, etc - but I realized it was actually very consistent spending on a monthly basis. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI dug into it across 18 categories that I thought were meaningful to understanding the spend. See below for the categories, the % of monthly expense, and average monthly dollars spent:\n\n**Rental\/house payment** ^1 - 25%, 2,400 monthly\n\n**Travel**^2 - 6%, 560 monthly\n\n**Restaurants**^3 - 6%, 545 monthly\n\n**Clothing\/merchandise**^4 - 6%, 590 monthly\n\n**Gas\/automotive**^5 - 9%, 870 monthly\n\n**Groceries**^6 - 6%, 620 monthly\n\n**Services**^7 - 5%, 500 monthly \n\n**Home**^8 - 8%, 750 monthly\n\n**Utilities**^9 - 5%, 450 monthly\n\n**Entertainment**^10 - 3%, 270 monthly\n\n**Bars\/alcohol**^11 - 2%, 240 monthly\n\n**Medical services**^12 - 7%, 680 monthly\n\n**Miscellaneous**^13 - 3%, 280 monthly\n\n**Tolls\/Parking**^14 - 2%, 165 monthly\n\n**Pets**^15 - 2%, 200 monthly\n\n**Professional expenses**^16 - 2%, 170 monthly\n\n**Athletics**^17 - 1%, 75 monthly\n\n**Children**^18 - 4%, 370 monthly - more like 1200 monthly going forward. \n\n1- We recently bought our first home, so the monthly amount is a little higher than true because of a month or two or expense getting out of the rental lease. 2,100 for monthly payment.\n\n2- We don't live near family, and we have friends across the US. Travel has gone down a good amount since the little kid arrived, but we still plan some bigger trips requiring airfare, mixed with small trips that might have B&amp;B stays or similar for a weekend. \n\n3- I usually eat lunch out, and we go out to eat occasionally. 50% of this is driven by big meals over $50 - we do like to treat people to meals when they are in town visiting. \n\n4- This is clothing, but also includes spend at places like Target, Amazon etc - so stores that I'm not certain whether stuff was for clothes, food, etc, but likely is either clothes what I would term merchandise - e.g. decorations, etc. \n\n5- Includes gas expenses and payments on one car of $250 per month. We could pay off the loan (smallish - under 5k now I believe) and just need to do that. I did buy a car with cash last year which skews this a bit because I paid about $4k more than my previous car was worth. I really enjoy the new car but I am kicking myself feeling like I probably shouldn't have spent that much (circa 17k).\n\n6-Grocery store costs.\n\n7-House alarm, cleaning service, lawn service, and pest control. For cleaning\/lawn service, a big driver of this is just the desire for more time &amp; better quality time with each other. \n\n8- think Ikea, Home Depot type expenses. Definitely higher than what it was in the past as we bought furniture for the new home and did some DIY stuff as well which required tool purchases also. \n\n9-Self explanatory. Cell phones are included here, we have one cell that is part of a family plan with other family members, the other cell is paid for by work. I do wonder how much we could save if we installed a timer thermostat, but I haven't looked into it yet. The house is a bit over 2000 sq ft, which is bigger than we've been in before, but the heating\/electric\/water bills are higher than I am used to. \n\n10-Netflix, Spotify, Cable TV, etc. We're strongly considering cutting the cable now that HBO is offering an OTT option. \n\n11-This is low hanging fruit to eliminate (as I have read a million times here), and I purposely wanted to look at these expenses. But my wife and I do typically have one or two drinks a night which is nice after a hard day. Most of this expense is now liquor stores, not paying bar prices - trips to the bar are far more rare now with the kiddo. \n\n12-Mostly driven by the kiddo. Complications and such. But don't expect those to be recurring going forward, although when we have more kids could be very likely. This doesn't even include costs that we paid for with our HSA card savings.\n\n13-All the shit I couldn't categorize easily. Ranges from ATM cash to gifts, etc. \n\n14-We live in a city and have toll roads and parking expenses to pay. I pay $7 per day to park in a garage, but could pay as little as $3 per day if I parked in an open lot. We live in the south where it can get brutally hot in a car during the day...my concern was the amount of exposure damage a car would get being in those conditions - I'm thinking beat up steering wheel, dashboard, etc - which is why I've tended to do the garage. But maybe that's bad economics? I do have cloth seats now (whereas I had leather before), so I've been thinking about whether to start parking on an uncovered lot. \n\n15-We have a doge. It requires some food and vet visits, and tennis ball expense.\n\n16-My wife and I are both professionals who have to incur some expense for certifications, continued training, etc.\n\n17-I put bike care\/supplies, gym passes, and other similar things in here.\n\n18-This probably mostly tracks purchases at pure play baby stores (e.g. Babies R Us) and his day care costs ($1k per month). A bunch of diaper expenses, etc get lost at other stores (e.g. probably get filed in \"Groceries\" or \"merchandise\").\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur **savings rate is around 35%** (when taking into account full income on an annual basis - including bonuses), which would be great to me if our spending rate wasn't so damn high. But I'm really concerned about a few things, and that's why I'm looking for help and advice around how to decrease our monthly spending. I think it's one of those things that has crept up without us realizing it - **4 years ago, we'd deposit 5k in our checking account per month** and never had a problem living within that, although we did live in a much cheaper area then. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few things that I would really appreciate opinions, advice, and help on:\n1) Reading about retirement \/ financial independence over the past few months on Reddit, I've come to have a better understanding and appreciation of savings vs spending rates and how critical spending rates are to being financially independent. I think spending 9K per month feels like a great way to work my ass off until I'm 65 and a dry, withered husk of myself. We have to change something. I also feel like it's really difficult to get my arms around projecting out investment growth, spending, etc. I think I'd be more motivated to cut spending if I had a better appreciation of a really simple metric for impact...e.g. cutting cable means I can retire 6 months earlier (or something similar). **Does anyone have suggestions for a simple tool or simple rule to help me make decisions on spending with regards to how it impacts my FI\/retirement age?**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2) There is a chance we'd go down to being single income from our current dual income status when\/if a second kid arrives. My wife and I have reasonably equal salaries, so that's a clear motivator for us in realizing that our current lifestyle is unsustainable if we wanted to have a stay at home parent (and still save money...which is fundamental and a requirement in our eyes). 9k \/ month =108k annually - essentially just about one of our salaries (pre-tax). **What are some suggestions about immediate actions we can take to cut monthly costs?** I do have some in mind already: 1) cut cable, 2) pay car loan in full, 3) Look into\/install some kind of automated\/timed A\/C control\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3) It hard to draw a line in the sand. I'm trying to understand for our situation how we can approach whether it's right to spend money or not spend it on something. It is really easy to say that it makes sense to hire cleaners so that when we are home, we can have extra time with each other...but it is also easy to look at that as an expense to cut. We are already super busy with probably only about 30-60 minutes of what I will call disposable time each day during the week. So I think part of what I'm struggling with is developing a value system I'm comfortable with at our current level of income - I guess I feel like I need some more refined guiding principles about what is reasonable to spend money on and what is not. We are earning more than we ever have before (both of us had fairly big jumps about a couple years ago), so making decisions on value of time vs value of money we are a little bit in uncharted territory still. **Does anyone have some recommendations on this? Maybe a good book \/blog post \/ mantra to read\/consider for perspective on this issue?** We want to enjoy life now and not just look forward to retirement, but equally want to feel like we're on the right path and not delay retirement with poor decisions now when we have a great opportunity to save because we're dual income, etc. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know this post is really long, so I appreciate those of you who have made it through the entire thing and can give us some thoughts or advice. My wife and I feel very lucky and blessed (although we do think we've worked hard also) to be where we are - and I think we're both just worried the spending has gotten too high and are trying to rein things back in again.

Currently I'm sitting at about 10k in debt between a car payment and a couple credit cards (one is my main card, the other my vacation\/Amazon-dump card).  For the last eight or nine years, I've worked jobs that had me handling cash (gas station, retail clerk, bartending, etc.), and I've always made it a point to buy out interesting coinage and bills.  I've never found a coin or bill that's really worth much, mainly just buffalo nickels, two-dollar bills, and some silver quarters.  \n\nMy question is this: would it make sense to deposit the \"worthless\" change to help pay off a credit card?

Example Health &gt; How to wipe your stinky butt\n\n3.\tA topic page with links to random pages and links back to the menu pages  \n\n\nThe template creator is not really a beginner role.  I am looking for someone with a bit of experience in webpage creation.  I know HTML but I want the person who builds this to be familiar with modern platforms.  The last awesome website I created was in 1998 and looked like the desktop for the Windows 98 OS.  The start menu was the site directory and each icon on the desktop did something fun.  It was pretty great but it is not 1998 anymore and we want someone who can build a mobile friendly and attractive modern webpage.  \nThe person who develops the template will get a footer link on the front page back to their site.  The template will not have any content.  It will just be a skeleton.  If this is something you are interested in send me a PM and we can discuss details.\n\n\n**1 (or more) person to make things pretty**\n\nIf our template creator doesn\u2019t have a background in graphic design or just doesn\u2019t want to spend the time to do it then we may need a couple people to help in this role.  We can discuss how you will benefit through links to or page or other benefits based on how much contribution if needed in this role.\n\n\n**100 (or so) roles as topic creators\/advertisers**\n\nI am looking for around 100 topics for the site.  This is not Wikipedia.  We are just looking for the most important and interesting topics to know as an adult.  All you will need to do is write a few paragraphs on a topic that you\u2019re a familiar with.  The content you contribute must be interesting, factually correct, and relevant to what people need to know as adults.  No articles on how to build nuclear submarines.\n\n Your topic page will then have a footer link back your website.  If you are discussing relevant products then you can even link to an Amazon affiliate page with that product.  I\u2019m going to be picky about that option though.  It will really need to be relevant and helpful to the reader.   \n\nYou won\u2019t need to do any programming for this part, just submit the text and your links.  I will handle the rest.  Once your page is added then advertise it on relevant subreddits (if you are knowledgeable on the subject you are probably already subscribed to some), \/r\/lifeprotips, or other places on the internet.\nFor those of you who are new you can use the discussion below on ways to learn to advertise your page.  We will have hundreds of people marketing this site and many thousands of people will view your page.\n\n\n**Other ways to be involved**\n\nWe can discuss having an about page were we list people who contribute in other ways and want links back to their page.  This includes logos, marketing, or other expertise you can provide.\n\n\n**What I will provide:**\n\n\n1.\t Domain names.  So far I have \nhttp:\/\/www.everypersonshouldknow.com\/\nAnd a few others listed on that site.  As you can see from that site I have a few different names and marketing angles for the site.  I would love to hear other ideas for the domain and tagline.\n\n I also have \/r\/everypersonshouldknow so please join it if you are interested in watching the project.\n\n2.\tWebhosting\n\n3.\tCoordinating with everyone and helping with any questions they have on how to do their part.\n\n4.\tSite maintenance and filling in the template that is created by our web programmer.\n\n5.\tAdvertising.  I will of course be advertising the site as well.\n\n6.\tTopics.  I have a few topics I am an expert in that I had to learn the hard way as an adult.  I will be writing on those topics.\n\n\n\nPlease ask any questions below or experts please weigh in on how we can improve the site and make is a better success.\n\nIf you would like to be involved feel free to send me a PM with what you would like to do.\n\n","63":"[H] $50 Amazon gift card [W] $50 Steam gift card","64":"###Goal: $1000 Amazon.com Balance\n**Currently**: $478.62\/$1000  \n**Progress**: 47.862%\n\n###Current Inventory (As Of 4\/6\/2015, 11:15 PM EST)\n* 0.00857960 Bitcoin ($2.19)\n* 3,818 Shopkick Kicks ($15.27)\n* PayPal* ($3.75)\n  \n^(*My PayPal account is unverified because I do not have access to a credit card or a bank account.)\n\n###The Exchange\nI will be trading my current inventory for digital Amazon.com Gift Cards or Bitcoins worth roughly the same amount. **Please note that I send Bitcoins through ChangeTip only!**\n\n###Preferred Exchange Rates\nMy Inventory|Your Inventory\n--|--\n$4 Bitcoin|$5 Amazon.com Gift Card\n$4.50 PayPal*|$5 Amazon.com Gift Card\n$5 Shopkick Gift Card|$4.25 Amazon.com Gift Card\n\nAll exchange rates negotiable.  \n^(*My PayPal account is unverified because I do not have access to a credit card or a bank account.)\n\n###Shopkick Gift Card Selection\n* Target Gift Card\n* Starbucks eGift Card\n* Macy's Gift Card\n* T.J.Maxx\/Marshalls\/HomeGoods Gift Card\n* JCPenney Gift Card\n* Old Navy Gift Card\n* American Eagle\/Aerie Gift Card\n* GameStop Gift Card\n* Best Buy e-Gift Card\n* Sephora Gift Card\n* Toys 'R' Us Gift Card\n* Lowe's Gift Card\n* Nike Gift Card\n* Papa John's Pizza Gift Card\n* AMC Theatres Gift Card\n* Barnes &amp;amp; Noble eGift Card\n* Sport Authority Gift Card\n* Foot Locker Gift Card\n* Buez di Beppo Italian Restaurant Gift Card\n\n###Reputation\n- \/r\/GCXRep [Profile (14 Completed Trades and 1 Failed Transaction)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2sf535\/ua4nrk9_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n- Old \/r\/GCXRep [Profile (3 Completed Trades)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2njoaw\/utagamer_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n- \/r\/phoneverification [Trusted Seller (3 Completed Verifications)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/phoneverification\/comments\/2r6kip\/offer_perk_phone_verification_for_1_amazon_gift\/)\n\nIf you have Confirmed Trader status or above, or if you have more total trades than I have, I will gladly send my end of the deal first.

When I brought the idea to them, they agreed to sign a generic NDA. I\u2019ve showed them the prototype and we\u2019ve discussed the product without getting into much detail about its use or market. This product will be sold through the same distribution channel (Amazon) that they already use for most of their products. So they basically have all of the manufacturing equipment and access to the same distribution channel. Once we get to the point where we\u2019re actually making product, what steps should I take to prevent them from cutting me out and doing the product on their own? Does a NDA have any real power or would I be wise to go ahead and file a provisional patent?

So I guess the safer thing to do is keep the money in savings or a CD (but 1.3% sounds paltry in light of the stock returns)...or if I want to be kinda risky, some index funds.  \n\nAnother thing I have to keep in mind is that the returns on the stock will be taxed, which discounts the return.

Quite often I go without sleep, running on nothing but coffee and a steady-flow of microwave meals.

You come to the website and browse through our products, find something you like, pay for it using Paypal and then we deliver it using Amazon S3. Pretty simple, right? \n\nThis is the model that pretty much everyone in the industry uses, from small brands to major international distribution chains, but unfortunately for us this model has proved problematic and caused many sleepless nights.\n\nLet me tell you about what\u2019s been happening..\n\n\nOn March 2nd, I written a thread over on Facebook about a free giveaway that we were doing that month, and next minute our server started flooding with traffic and thousands of people were hitting the site every couple of minutes.\n\nThe server couldn\u2019t take it. Our website dropped and none of us knew what to do\u2026 A couple of seconds later everyone in the thread started mentioning the word \u2018torrent\u2019 and my mind went blank. This is a word I associated with illegal file-sharing, something that I could have no part of.\n\nI needed to act fast. Too many people were hitting the website, I couldn\u2019t access the server and everything seemed like it was going wrong. (my head was about to explode at this point - I thought we were about to lose everything). Someone was about to torrent the files that our suppliers have worked hard on and many thousands of dollars went into.\n\nI was getting more anxious by the minute. I done a little research into torrenting and realized that pretty much everything on the internet gets torrented at one point, so I decided to the torrent the files myself and keep our branding on the files - at least this way we could port it back to the site and hopefully increase sales for our suppliers.\n\nI then posted the torrent on Reddit and it got nearly 2000 upvotes - thousands of people ended up seeding the torrent and sales went through the roof. The website did end up dropping again, but mirrors popped up and the community came through. Reddit proved to be awesome!\n\nFighting piracy with piracy was the best strategical decision I have ever made.

Some cash-back (CB) sites are straight cash rebates, other's (like the credit card companies) give credit card statement credits, and other reward sites give points for shopping to redeem for rewards.\n\n**How Does It Work?**\n&gt;So I want to buy something from \"ABC Widgets.\" I go to a cash-back site, I see they have 10% cash-back for that store. I click the link on the site for \"ABC Widgets\" and after my purchase the CB site gets verification I spent $100. Since I spent $100, I get $10 cash back in my account.  When I want my money I can cash out and choose how I want my money. \n\n**How Much Do I get Back?**\n&gt;There are many cash-back sites that have different stores and % back for each store. Every CB site will list the stores they have and the percentage they offer back. But your best bet is to check a rebates comparison site to make sure you are using the site with the highest cash back for the store you are shopping (see comparison site list below).  \n\n**So What are These So Called \"Cash-Back Sites\"?**\n&gt;I've listed a few of my favorite and more well known CB sites below. The sites I've listed I know payout and have a solid reputation. There are a TON more, but I like to stick to just a couple so I can get a quicker cash out on smaller purchases. (Let me know if I missed any super cash-back site that should be listed below.)\n\n**Is This a Scam?**\n&gt;Not all \"cash-back\" sites are reliable. Some sites have come and gone, but most rebate and reward sites are legit and want you to be happy and keep using them. They only make money when you do, so they don't want to mess that up by upsetting their users. \n\n**I've Tried It &amp; Didn't Get My Rebate! It's a LIE!**\n&gt;Many people hear stories about not getting credited for their purchases and not getting their rebates. The rebate sites I've listed have all paid out without issue to thousands of people. The problems actually come when the rebate isn't credited to your CB site account. This is usually a \"cookie\" thing and most sites don't tell you the things you need to do to make sure your cookie is set for your rebate. I've listed some tips below to help with this.  The other issue usually is the person bought something that is not approved for a cash-back offer, such as buying gift cards on some sites. Many sites do not give affiliate credit for gift card purchases, so no affiliate credit, no cash-back credit.\n\n~\n\n**Quick Tips to Make Sure Your Rebate is Credited Correctly:**\n\n* Turn off ad blocker \/ info blockers \/ cookie blockers\n* Clear cookies on browser.\n* Don't use incognito (YMMV - though people have said they use it with no problem, rather not risk it for me)\n* Login to the rebate site you will be using and search for your store.\n* Read the details on the store to make sure the items being purchased qualify for cash-back.\n* Check for coupons listed on the rebate site (just to grab a few extra dollars if you can), and click through to the store.\n* Add items to cart &amp; check out immediately after adding items. \n* Many people will add everything to their cart first, then go to their cash back site and click through and checkout right away. \n*  If you have multiple browser windows open be sure that you make your purchase on the merchant's site from the browser window that was opened by the rebate site.\n* Don't surf other sites while shopping, you could over ride your cookie without knowing.\n* If you click a link from another website after clicking from the rebate site you might click someone else's affiliate link and void your CB... so beware. If you do start over.\n* Personally I start over from the top when buying a second time (clear cookies, click from link, etc) just to be safe.\n* After your order is placed wait a while and check if the sale is pending on the rebate site, if not wait 24 hours and contact them to fix it for you. \n* Rinse &amp; Repeat\n\nIt basically all comes down to making sure that no one else has set a cookie for the store affiliate on your browser (clear those old cookies!) and that a new cookie can be set from your chosen rebate site to give you credit for your sale (no ad block or cookie blocking). \n\n\n~\n\n**Misc Tips**\n\n* Check one of the cash back comparison sites to see the rebate site with the highest % for the store you are shopping (see below).\n* Depending on the rebate site you use, your cash back will come in 30-90 days. Most offer paypal, check, etc.\n* Each site has a way to correct a cash-back purchase that does not show up for you, a support ticket or online chat. Use them! Most sites will just check the order and credit you without issue. Don't let your money go without some effort.\n* If you are going to use a coupon make sure it is one listed on the cashback site. Many sites say you will not get your rebate if you use a coupon they do not have listed. *On the other hand*  I have never had this happen to me or anyone I've heard of even when using coupon codes from elsewhere. It's up to you to take the chance.\n* Some sites (eBates, CouponCactus) do not allow purchases with gift cards or store credits. Make sure to check first if you are using gift cards to pay.\n\n~\n\n**Cash-Back Sites To Try**\n\nHere are some of my favorite CB sites. I have received payouts from almost every site listed,  and at least know people who have gotten payouts from each of them.\n\n\n**Befrugal**\n\nOne of the highest paying. They pay. \n\n* Signup Bonus $5 using referal link\n* Minimum Cashout: $25 (includes your bonuses)\n* Cashout options: Check (us only), Paypal, Amazon GC, direct deposit\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.befrugal.com\/cashback\/?ref=XWTVUQE\n* Non-ref link: http:\/\/www.befrugal.com\/\n\n**TopCashBack**\n\nOne of the highest paying and one of my favorites. Site is easy to use and looks clean. They pay.\n\n* No Signup Bonus\n* Minimum Cashout: NONE! Cashout with $0.01 if you like.\n* Cashout options: Direct Deposit, Paypal, Amazon GC (inc 2.5% bonus)\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.topcashback.com\/ref\/JellyMuffin \n* Non-ref link: http:\/\/www.topcashback.com\n\n**Mr. Rebates** \n\nLooks bad, but reliable.\n\n* Signup Bonus $5\n* Minimum Cashout: $10\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.mrrebates.com?refid=996900 \n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.mrrebates.com\n\n**eBates** \n\nI've been a member since 1999 (really!) and they pay.\n\n* Signup Bonus $10 Macy's, Walmart, Target or Kohl's GC or $5 cash\n* Minimum Cashout: $5.01 - They will cash you out every 3 months when you are over $5.01 or roll it over for you.\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.ebates.com\/rf.do?referrerid=4iKlr6Ifl0g%3D&amp;eeid=26471 \n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.ebates.com\n\n**Simply Best Coupons**\n\nDon't really use them much, but occassionally they have the best rates. \n\n* Signup Bonus $5\n* Minimum Cashout: $20 check\/Western Union, $15 PayPal\/Amazon\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal, Amazon GC, Western Union\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.simplybestcoupons.com\/?refid=44824\n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.simplybestcoupons.com\n\n**ExtraBux**\n\nA newer site to me, many people like it and use it a ton. Love the fact that one of the cashout options is a refund to one of your credit cards with a bonus. \n\n* Signup Bonus $5\n* Minimum Cashout: $10 ($5 of it from purchases and not bonuses)\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal (5% bonus), Refund (statement credit) to any Visa, MasterCard or Discover card you own (5% bonus)\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.extrabux.com\/r\/55254c4d01\n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.extrabux.com\/\n\n**CouponCactus**\n\nAnother newer site to me, many people like it. \n\n* Signup Bonus $3, $5 if you use promo code CC2010\n* Minimum Cashout: $10, cashout is sent every 3 months if over $10, otherwise it rolls over to next payout.\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal (must use check first then paypal)\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.couponcactus.com\/?ccid=169895\n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.couponcactus.com\/\n\n**FatWallet**\n\nNot the highest paying, but a great forum community for deals and finding those unadvertised sale prices. \n\n* Minimum Cashout: $10 for check, none paypal\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal\n* Ref-link: http:\/\/www.fatwallet.com\/?referral=Tyranny \n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.fatwallet.com\n\n~\n\n\n**Credit Card Reward Sites**\n\nDon't forget that many credit card companies have \"Reward sites\" that if you shop through them you can get points or cash back on your credit card. Most do not pay nearly as much as the cash-back sites above, but worth checking on.  \n\n*Remember*, you can not double dip with the online \"credit card shopping malls\" and the CB sites. They require you to click through and use their affiliate link and that can only be one place, a CB site or your CC's shopping site. Choose the highest % back. You can use a credit card that gives you percentages\/points back for just using your card, but not if it requires a link click. \n\n* Discover https:\/\/www.discover.com\/credit-cards\/deals\/index.html\n* Wells Fargo Rewards https:\/\/emm.wellsfargorewards.com\/dhtdocs\/members\/benefits.php?sid=121XXdKrlo121&amp;view=offerslist&amp;rewards=t\n* Bank of America https:\/\/rewardsshoppingmall.bankofamerica.com\/home.htm\n* Chase https:\/\/ultimaterewardsearn.chase.com\/shopping\/\n* Barclay Card Rewards https:\/\/rewardsshoppingmall.fiacardservices.com\/allretailers.htm\n\n~\n\n**Points\/Reward Rebate Sites**\n\nThese sites give you \"points\" for shopping, then you cash out with your choice from their reward offerings. Most offer a cash option, paypal, and a variety of gift cards. Most of these sites you know of, but just tossing the most popular to give you an idea.\n\n\n\n\n**Swagbucks**\n\nReally easy site to get rewards from, shopping sections easy to use. You can also do surveys, watch videos, and play games for points. They pay and pay pretty quickly. 100 points = $1\n\n* Signup Bonus 150 points. \n* $3 minimum cashout\n* Cashout options: Paypal, Amazon, Walmart &amp; a TON of other gift cards\n* Ref link: can't post it, can PM to anyone who wants it.\n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/\n\n**Memolink**\n\nBeen a member since they started. They pay. You can also do surveys, watch videos, and play games for points. 16,000 points = $10\n\n* No Signup Bonus\n* $10 minimum cashout\n* Cashout options: Check, Paypal, Amazon, Walmart GC\n* Ref link: http:\/\/www.memolink.com\/index.cfm\/my.invite\/1166877\n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.memolink.com\/\n\n**Perk**\n\nThey pay. Shopping section has many stores, though sometimes it's not the highest payout compared to other CB sites. You can also do surveys, watch videos, and play games for points. Payouts are very quick, like clock work on Mon, Wed, Fri. 1,000 points = $1\n\n* No Signup Bonus\n* $5 minimum cashout\n* Cashout options: Paypal, Amazon, Walmart GC &amp; a ton of other gift card options. They are also coming out with their own Discover card to cash out to.\n* non-ref link: http:\/\/www.perk.com\/\n\n~\n\n**Places to Compare Cash Back**\n\n\nI usually use a cash back comparison site to see which rebate place has the highest % before shopping. I search for the store, and then just go to the rebate site that has the highest cash back %. \n\n* EvReward http:\/\/www.evreward.com\/ \n* Cash Back Monitor http:\/\/www.cashbackmonitor.com\/ - They show bonuses for your credit cards, miles account, and even swagbucks to compare for highest refund, too.\n* CashBackaholics http:\/\/www.cashbackholic.com\/ - Show miles, points and credit card rewards, too.\n\n~\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has more tips on making a smoother rebate site experience. I use the rebate sites all the time so any tips will come in handy for me far beyond the basics :)\n\n","136":"I am looking for advice, stories, and critique on monetizing a self-published E-Book.\n\nAnyone do this on Amazon?\n\nAnyone sell it on their own website?\n\nWhile it obviously varies book to book, how profitable is it really?\n\nIs it quantity, quality, or both that reigns king?","137":"Please check out my indiegogo life campaign, help me get my start selling private label on Amazon!

When I try to get analytical, I normally end up doing worse, so I'd like to learn how to properly evaluate a stock value.\n\nI'll put up [Anthem Inc (ANTM)](http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/q?s=ANTM) as a prospective example. Here are the numbers I'm aware of:\n\nPrice: ~153\n\nP\/E: 17.03 (Projected: 14.17)\n\nEPS: 8.99 (Projected: 10.8)\n\nMarket Cap: 41.13B\n\nDividend: 1.6%\n\nIf we project it the stock to go up proportionally to earnings, that gives a target price of around 184 next year.

My girlfriend recently moved to my town because she had nothing holding her down where she was from, but came with no money at all. I built up some significant debt getting her situated, but there are no more (expected) big purchases coming up immediately. \n\nSome background: I am a 22 year old student expecting to graduate in a year. I live with my friends where my rent is paid through May (350$ afterwards), and she found a house that she pays 900$ a month for. We are trying to get an apartment together (June at the earliest), where the deposit altogether with first month's rent will be 2300. I had near perfect credit until December at FICO 795, but recently it has been dropping about 20 points a month to a 720 now, which has caused me to panic a bit. I was paying her rent for the first 2-ish months, so I had to start making the minimums on my cards. My cards are listed as follows:\n\n* Chase Amazon: $145 - 0% Interest (1yr)\n* Best Buy: $1700 - 0% Interest (2yrs)\n* Discover IT!: $2300 - 18.99% Interest \n* American Express BlueCash Everyday: $2000: 0% Interest (2yrs)\n\nIncome is a bit difficult, since I work a school job right now at only 20 hours a week, but she just found a full time 13$\/hr job, and plans on putting in as much overtime as possible for the next couple of months. Take home for me for the next 2 months is $750 a month, then $3000 a month during June and July, then to $1800 a month after August. Take home for her before OT is $2000 a month. \n\nOur only expenses right now are her rent ($900), her phone ($90), card minimums ($200), gas ($100), one time vehicle registration fee that we just bought through a family friend (~$200).\n\nI guess my major concern is that we have been putting all of our food and living expenses on my cards right now, causing my balance to increase pretty rapidly because right after she found her stable job and could afford her own rent, we found ourselves needing to start pooling money for an apartment deposit so we can't put all that money towards our cards, which is my main concern. We can move in in June if the apartment is ready and we have the deposit money by then, or we can use Apr\/May income to pay off a huge slice of the debt so credit score stops plummeting, then use Jun income for all of the apartment deposit. Currently we only have $500 saved for the apartment. Do you think that we should stockpile the deposit now and only pay a small amount on the cards, or pay the cards full force until we meet the minimum needed time to bankroll the apartment deposit? \n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend and I moving in together, pay CC debt now, scramble deposit later to stop credit score plummet? Or stash away apartment deposit now and hope credit score drop slows until we can start attacking it. \n\n","192":"Hi everyone,\n\nI have an issue I hope someone here can help me with.\n\nI imported a product from China for sale on Amazon.com. I did not design or invent any part of it. I found a supplier on Alibaba, packaged it under my own brand, and listed it for sale. Before I did all this, there was 1 other company selling a similar product, but I could not find any relevant patents. The function of the device is not new or novel, so I thought I was pretty safe. Well, shortly after I began selling the item, my lawyer received a letter from a law firm representing the company selling the product I mentioned above. Their letter notified me of their Design Patent on the product. They demanded I cease selling, and they are now demanding that I destroy my remaining inventory or they will proceed with litigation. I ceased selling right away, but I do not want to destroy my remaining inventory.\n\nI did some research on my own, and here's why I think they are bluffing:\n\n* Design patents, unlike utility patents, are valid from date of publish, not date of filing. This patent was published after I imported the products.\n\n* Their product was not marked as patented, and I did not know it was until I received their letter. From USC 287(a): \"In the event of failure so to mark, no damages shall be recovered by the patentee in any action for infringement, except on proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and continued to infringe thereafter, in which event damages may be recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice\"\n\n* And from USC 271(g): \"No remedies for infringement under section 271 (g) shall be available with respect to any product in the possession of, or in transit to, the person subject to liability under such section before that person had notice of infringement with respect to that product. The person subject to liability shall bear the burden of proving any such possession or transit.\"\n\nSo basically, since notification I have sold 0, and even if I did, it wouldn't matter since I already had them in my possession when I received notification of the patent.\n\nDoes this hold up? What if they sue me anyway? Will responding to the suit with these references get me anywhere? Or can they just bleed me dry anyway? I have been very cooperative and forthright with them, but they want me to destroy the inventory or they will seek an injunction ordering me to.\n\nI really appreciate any insight you might have.","193":"[H] \u00a35 Amazon UK GC [W] TF2 Keys","194":"Buying all amounts of Amazon gift cards at 80% rate.

I love travel, dealing with people, and finding bargains, and the prospect of combining these with hunting down a variety of cool products to sell at a profit at home (UK) is like a dream to me. \n\nHowever, something I'm concerned about is specialist competition. For example, say I have found a really nice teapot on Alibaba that is already selling well on Amazon and ebay. For an order of e.g. 500 pcs, my total cost, including storage and order fulfilment, might be \u00a36. \n\nCurrently, 3 other companies sell this same product for e.g. \u00a315-\u00a320. These companies are all specialist kitchenware brands with well known names. I know I can undercut them on price with my own branded product. But the question is: will my lower price be enough to make sales, or will the consumer assume that it is a cheap knock-off product, leaving me with hundreds of units of stock that I can't shift?\n\nFurther, let's say I want to import and resell, I don't know, waterski's, because I know the margin would be good, based on local prices. These same units are usually sold by specialist watersport stores (online and in-person) with a range of other related items and good local reputations, at a high mark up. The same issue applies here - if I list these products online, is the consumer more likely to spend extra for the 'known' entity, or just buy the cheaper option?\n\nI would really appreciate some input on this, especially from people who have experience in buying and selling random unrelated items, rather than starting specialist brands. \n\nThanks,\nLee. \n\nTLDR: I'm thinking of importing random, unrelated products to sell at a profit online. My goal is to undercut the competition, be they a well known specialist brand, or a trusted specialist distributer. Is a lower price alone good enough, or do I need to specialise and build a brand reputation in order to compete?\n\n","265":"Basicly I can get you any giftcard from Amazon besides Amazon GC themselves. \n\nI need money for prom, so it would be great if you guys could do even trades with me.

I used to sell burned CD\u2019s. That\u2019s what I called them anyway\u2026 They were essentially mixtapes with songs that I downloaded from Limewire. I remember my mom would take me to the store and buy me a pack of blank CD\u2019s which would amount to roughly $.80 per cd. I\u2019d in turn sell the CD\u2019s for $2 or $3. At the time, I\u2019d just use the money to buy double lunch or a bag of chips for lunch at school. I had already downloaded most of the music for myself so the mixtapes that I \u201cmade\u201d were pretty much ones that didn\u2019t require any extra work as I would just make copies. I didn\u2019t take into account the fact that it was illegal. Nor did I really worry about electricity costs, etc. I just knew that burning these CD\u2019s got me an extra $30-$40 a week and all was good.\n\nOne summer in high school heading into either my Sophomore or Junior year, I was looking for a NFL jersey. I checked the team\u2019s website and found a jersey to cost around $75. I turned to eBay and began looking for cheaper jerseys. This is when I came across FOUR for $80. The first thing that came to mind was being able to resell these for at least $50 each; a profit of $120 before fees.  I did this through high school before I finally realized that what I was doing could get me some serious prison time. \n\nIn college, I took up Criminal Justice because I wanted to be a police officer which I currently am and have been for the past year. I still sold things on eBay but it would be random stuff\u2026 I\u2019d go through Sunday ads and if I found a deal that I could make a few bucks off, I\u2019d go for it. I eventually turned to Craigslist when I realized that there was a market for used cell phones. For people that wanted to upgrade their cell phones mid-contract, purchasing a used cell phone or even a brand new one from anywhere outside of a retail store would save them anywhere from $50 to a few hundred dollars. With that, I drove all over my state meeting up with random people hoping that I wouldn\u2019t get robbed or screwed over. I fortunately never got robbed in a sense that they took my money and ran off but I\u2019ve purchased phones that were either stolen or non-functional. I also put a ton of miles on my car. I learned a lot from Craigslist but that\u2019s another story\u2026\n\nIn the Summer of 2013, I started selling on Amazon. I didn\u2019t like how the payments were every two weeks because I was used to flipping money right away with eBay and PayPal. When I went to the police academy in October 2013, a lot changed with how I\u2019m selling things. I\u2019m completely off eBay now! Selling anyway. My feedback on Amazon went down! Temporarily that is. My feedback went down because I kept my Amazon Seller account active even though I was in a live-in, Monday thru Friday academy. However, going to the police academy allowed me to venture off and explore other ways to sell. \n\nI\u2019m currently doing Amazon FBA and it allows me to have a full time job plus free time. I realize that the harder I work, the more I make. But also, I don\u2019t have to stress with constantly making trips to the post office, or selling something just to think oh shit shipping is gonna cost how much!? I procrastinate a lotttt and it\u2019s worth it to me for Amazon to take a bigger cut of the sales in order to free up my time. I also like selling on Amazon more because of the speed at which I can list things. Amazon listings don\u2019t really need a description. I never had a light box or whatever you call it so I would usually take pictures in the daytime just so they\u2019d be more appealing. \n\nMy biggest risk during flipping is when I \u201cclean something out\u201d which I refer to as buying the rest of something. I also put myself in extreme debt with my credit card every month. I currently have $4.67 in my bank account. However, I\u2019m $30,000 in debt on my credit card. My Amazon deposit on Monday will cover that though. Plus some. My credit card is also not due until the 28th so I\u2019m fine there. \n\nIt takes money to make money! People will tell you to save for a rainy day and I agree that you should. I just take the risk of using all my money (minus $4.67) to invest.     \n\nAnd with that I leave you a pic of how I\u2019m doing on FBA:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/ZPCsl57\n\nAnd some advice going forward:\n\nThere\u2019s always going to be someone doing better than you. Don\u2019t compare how someone else is doing as whether or not you\u2019re successful. Do your homework on a potentially hot item. Crosscheck with eBay sold listings. If you do FBA, take 15 minutes out of your day to do nothing but create boxes. Overload on supplies. Buy containers\/drawers to keep your supplies organized. Save your receipts. Save money for taxes. Set a goal. My goals over time changed from $100 profit a day, to trying to sell approximately 50 items a day and make at least $10 on each for a profit of $500 a day. Look for things that you wouldn\u2019t normally sell. \n\nGood luck\n\nEDIT: I let my girlfriend read it and she said ''you're not in debt though.'' So let me clear it up. I have 3,000 items in inventory now and another 200 or so in my garage. I just tried to be tricky on words and say I was in debt by inferring that I run my credit card bill up and then pay it off. \n\nEDIT: I profited $58k in 2015","281":"[H]PayPal [W]Amazon UK GC \u00a3","282":"Selling Candy on Amazon","283":"$10 free for buying $50 Amazon Gift Card","284":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Although I am knowledgeable about the subject(s) I am not passionate about them. I do not wish to keep updating these blogs with new posts. I'd like to have them rank up high(er) in the search machine, so they pop up when people are looking for the subject. With 40+ articles there is a lot of information, who cares if I have compiled that in one day or over the course of years and who cares if I am going to post an update. I am not going to create a user-base that comes back for fresh articles, I'm building click bait for people clicking through to Amazon and making a purchase. \n\nWhy are you saying PLR articles are an issue?\n\nOne of these blogs might bring in $100-$200 a month. I'm planning to have a (couple of) dozen of them.\n\nThe blog I started (less than 24 hours ago) already has 50 unique visitors, around 80 page views, and 6 clickthroughs to Amazon (but Amazon only updates the stats once a day so it could be more). Waiting for the first purchase now.\n\nThis is not my primary source of income., This has nothing to do with me in personal and professional life. I have a professional career that I do not wish to have linked to this kind of work.

First thing to consider is this: what are you passionate about?  You'll have the best luck with things you know a lot about.  For example, I like men's clothing a lot and am able to make some good money off of them.\n\nSecond is research.  Look things up.  Look for \"what to sell\" threads and look things up before purchasing.  Always learn new things to flip.\n\nThird is the sourcing of things to sell.  Start with items in your home ($0 cost :P) or items that you're passionate about purchased at a thrift store.  Stick to low-cost items until you get the hang of things.\n\nFourth is the marketplace.  Research eBay, Amazon, and Amazon FBA and decide which marketplace is best for you.  Familiarize yourself with the fees, know how to navigate the website.\n\nFifth is shipping.  Get a cheap shipping scale off eBay, mine is an Acuteck 50lb i got for $15.99.  Go to your local post office (or order online) and pick up a variety of the free Priority mail boxes.  Once you get a bit more into it, you may want to consider purchasing other supplies.  When you list an item, weigh and measure it to ensure you get an accurate shipping quote from eBay\/Amazon calculators.  When it sells, box it up in an appropriately sized box (make sure it's well-cushioned, i used newspaper when starting out).  Print a shipping label using eBay\/amazon to take advantage of their discounts.  Attach the label to the package and either take it to your local PO or schedule a pickup on USPS.com.\n\nThat's about everything I can think of.  PM me if you've ever got any questions.","293":"In my experience, \"affiliate blogging\" almost always fails without at least a bit of passion behind it, especially if you want to make something that lasts longer than the next Google update. The two are more intertwined than ever these days.\n\nIt's important to realise that keeping the blogs updated (i.e. adding more content regularly) isn't the only part of the workload with these types of sites; the most time-consuming part is actually getting them to rank, and trust me, that'll be much harder with crappy PLR articles.\n\nIn fact, it might even be impossible...\n\nAs is typically the case with PLR articles, you're probably not the only person to use them on a blog. If this is the case, you've got to think this: \"why will google choose to rank my blog post (with a PLR article) over another sites blog post (with the same PLR article)\"?. \n\nThe answer is: they probably won't, as it's essentially \"duplicate content\".\n\nNow, not all duplicate content is bad (contrary to popular belief). For example, syndicated content is essentially duplicate content, but this is a perfectly legitimate practice. The thing with syndicated content is that it will usually link back to the original content, thus informing Google which piece of content is the original and therefore, which site should rank for that piece of content.\n\nWith a PLR article (if lots of blogs are using them), Google has to work it's algorithmic magic to try to best determine which site is the original publisher of said article. If any of your PLR articles are already indexed in Google (i.e. on other websites\/blogs), it's going to be pretty clear to Google that you aren't the original publisher and therefore, you'll barely rank in most cases.\n\nWhy? Because this practice looks no different from simply republishing\/stealing some other peoples articles and putting them on your own site (which isn't actually too far from the truth).\n\nSo, here's my advice, have some proper unique blog posts written for your site by a content writer and save the PLR articles for other uses (blasting out to email subscribers, free downloads, whatever). You can get articles dirt cheap if you really want to (we're talking a few dollars here) and although they still won't be incredible, you won't run into any of the issues associated with PLR articles.\n\nThe one caveat to all of this is if you don't intend to get traffic from search engines at all, which for these types of Amazon Affiliate sites, isn't usually the case. If you want to get social traffic or pay for it on Google AdWords or whatever, then go ahead and use your PLR articles (although I really wouldn't recommend PPC traffic for Amazon affiliate sites, as you'll struggle to recoup your investment thanks to a tiny commission on most products).\n\nI don't mean to come across as negative in anything I'm saying, but trust me, it's good advice. I've built sites that have been total flops, and also had sites that earn $1000+\/month (one of them was an Amazon affiliates site, actually), so I know many of the mistakes people make. \n\nP.S. Keeping your work\/professional life separate from all of this is 100% fine, obviously. My only point is that if you want advice from people on here (which you clearly do), we at least need to know a bit about what you're doing. So, pay for the private whois thing if you're really that paranoid we'll find out (or remotely care about) who you are, but share the damn website URL! You'll get a much more positive response and more importantly, you might actually get some actionable advice!\n\nP.P.S Install Google Analytics ASAP and it'll tell you where your traffic is coming from; it's unlikely to be search engines at this stage in my opinion.","294":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Something like \"Ok, you're going out, and you need a shirt for that! Buy this party shirt on Amazon\" or \"Ok, you're going out, but you need some tunes for that -- sign up for Spotify premium!\" or whatever. You can have the affiliate link just be text, like the [hipster business name generator](http:\/\/www.hipsterbusiness.name\/)\n\nThat being said, I'm doubtful that your site is going to get significant traffic after the initial interest from your college goes away. So you might just want to keep it as a portfolio piece and not worry about monetization :)","296":"In that case I recommend you throw an Amazon affiliate link up there.

Over the course of three months I saved enough to earn $20 in Amazon gift cards. The trick, like any couponing, is use it for things you were going to buy anyway.

Basically I only use FBA when I have a surplus of stuff that would not be worth the time to make tons of individual eBay listings for. That's really my only gripe with FBA.

I'm hooked.\n\nI've been scanning with the Amazon Seller App about four hours a day after work. Even on evenings I tell myself to go home and get some sleep, I find myself at a big box scanning. I'm wicked motivated.\n\nI don't have a lot of buying power - but I think I've nailed down a couple of awesome places to source within my means. They'll also let me branch out into areas beyond my niche.\n\nAnyhow, I have to ask - and I realize this is a YMMV question but - How long did it take you to achieve 21k yearly flipping?","332":"exactly. I have Amazon Prime and order from there regularly anyways so I didn't have to go out of my way to use the $40","333":"You can also buy giftcards on Amazon. Or sell them. Or use Amazon Pay. ","334":"Do you have control over how many fulfillment centers you send things to? Every time Amazon tells me \"split this into three shipments\", I just do it. I didn't realize I could tweak that.","335":"This. If you don't see the money coming in to your checking account you'll be less tempted to spend it. Learn to live on whatever after-savings amount you decide. If you get a pay raise adjust the savings direct deposit to keep your checking account amount the same. Only raise your standard of living when you are disciplined and it makes financial sense.\n\nWaiting for new purchases is a good idea. I usually do a 30 day wait. I save it in my Amazon wishlist which tracks the day I added it. A lot of times I go back to the list and am like \"why did I want that?\" and delete it after 30 days are up.\n\nLastly, the book Stumbling Upon Happiness (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert\/dp\/1400077427) has a nice section on why we like shiny new things but why they don't make us happy for very long.","336":"OP said that there is no fee when you get an Amazon gift card instead of a cash payout.","337":"Yeah, that's another face of the issue, too. Between gasoline, groceries, dining out, and various items purchased on Amazon, I'm able to get a good $50 cash back every month without changing my current habits at all. If you don't want to use retailers like these, then it's not going to make a bit of difference what cards you have or use, if any at all. There are tons of ways to get your money to work a little better for you. ","338":"I think both methods are great as tailored for the individual.  It really depends on the strong points and deficiencies of the individual's personality.  I'm more apt to spend frivolously if I have cash in my pocket rather than if an expenditure shows up automatically in my electronic budget.  I'm(and my wife) terrible about saving and organizing my receipts.  I also don't desire the level of breakdown beyond broad categories like 'grocery expenditures' because I spend pretty much the same amount month to month on each category. \n\nAll that said, I completely understand that if you want a more detailed tracking at the sub-total level, I get wanting receipts.  I use Mint.com to do my budgets and do, to an extent, break up totals here and there, but they allow you to do so electronically.  About the only time I do this is Amazon purchases where some are home goods, kid stuff, and personal entertainment in the same purchase.  They allow me to break up the individual purchase by cost into each category.  Takes me 30 seconds to do online.","339":"You talking sales, revenue or profit? If its profit (because, lets be honest, that's what really matters), you should be able to calculate, based off of your profit margin, how much you need to sell on Amazon to get there. From there, you can break it down to how much you need to sell each month. And from there, how much you need to spend each month to make that level of sales. Now youve got goals!\n\nIf you stick to the generally talked about rule of selling for 3 times your buy cost, you should be able to hit $21k of profit on around $55-60k of sales. \n\nDont forget about taxes, fees, office expenses, etc though. Build that in too.  :)","340":"So the military has already bought into this company's drones (for years now), and the next big bump will be when they are available to the public for sale on Amazon or for emergency services use. -Which hopefully is before the end of the year, or whenever the gov releases final draft of drone regulations. Do I have that correct? Its a CA company. Do you know the guys because you are from CA? Any idea from them how much of shares are owned by management or are employees offered stock options? I don't know what buyside means, but I assume it means you already work in investment. I need to take a community college class on finance or investing so I understand more lingo. ","341":"I'm a member of Prime and order a lot from Amazon anyways. ","342":"Seems like it, about time!\n\nAnd cashback? Discover it and Amazon\/Chase are amazing for me. Especially Amazon Chase. You get a dollar for every 100 you spend, but its also by points really, so on amazon purchases u get 3 for a dollar, and other offers change like 2 for food and 1 point per dollar on such and such. I usually end up with $5 towards shipping or what not every few purchases. Also I think now they run free amazon prime for a year or 6 months or something with certain cards.","343":"You're right, some things are cheaper elsewhere but considering that I don't have to pay sales tax on amazon, a lot of electronics and home goods I would buy anyway end up being cheaper through Amazon. ","344":"Is the Amazon seller app known to be inaccurate? I stumbled across a bunch of books today and while scanning using the app I was really excited about the lowest used price, but now that I'm listing the books many of those prices are very far off. ","345":"On Amazon you have to be approved in certain categories. I believe the receipt is necessary when you start in order to prove you aren't selling fake items. ","346":"You have to be approved to sell certain items on Amazon?  That is new to me, thanks for the clarification.","347":"The reason you don't seem to pay fees when using your credit card is that the shops are paying for it. Shops pay around 3% of your purchase price each time you swipe your card to pay for the goods\/services.\n\nWhen you want to convert credit into cash directly, you are the shop and you pay around 3%. So a $10000 cash advance costs you $300. Furthermore, cash advance has no grace period. You can immediately start accruing interest from the moment you take cash out of your credit card.\n\nYou could buy Amazon gift cards at grocery stores...\n\n","348":"Some do, some don't. Something like the Sallie Mae card offer 5% on the first $250 for groceries, $250 for gas, and $750 for bookstores (including Amazon) each month at no cost. Something like the Amex Blue Cash Preferred offers 6% on $6000 each year and 3% on gas for $75. So, at some point, the Amex passes the Sallie Mae card and it depends on how much you spend on groceries and gas each month.\n\nThere are other cards that will waive the fee for the first year, so go for the sign up bonuses and then close the card after the year is done. Most of those cards will offer you something after a year in order to entice you to renew. For example, Marriott will give you a free night stay at a category 5 or lower hotel in order to get you to renew for $85. Some might think that is a fair swap if they plan to continue using the card.\n\nIn the end, though, it only really balances out if you stay on top of the cards and make sure that you are paying them off in full each month.","349":"Yes there are certain categories like groceries and health and beauty that you have to be approved by Amazon to sell. In order to be approved you have to provide receipt of the items you plan on selling. Sorry for the confusion.","350":"I second this card. 5% back on gas, groceries (including anything at Super Target\/Super Walmart), and bookstores (including almost anything on Amazon).","351":"Well the two most useful ones for cash back are Chase Freedom and the Sallie Mae MasterCard. The former gets 5% on rotating categories and vendors (currently restaurants and H&amp;M, among others) up to $1500 quarterly and the latter gets 5% back up to $250 on gas and groceries and $750 on bookstores (including most Amazon purchases). Neither have annual fees.

And then I'll also be doing informational videos on things I feel I've learned well enough to give advice on. But the channel is still very new and I 100% expect it to evolve based on feedback. So if there is anything else you want to see just let me know in the comments! :)\n* For my descriptions right now I'm just rewriting them. I'm trying to do it in a way that I'm talking to you about the product and what I think of it rather than at you and why you should buy it. Once I finish them all though I will go back and try to target keywords for the more popular or more pricey products. (While also keeping that same kind of personal language.) And I'm doing this not only for conversion, but google doesn't like duplicate content on the internet. So the more original content your site has, the more likely you are to rank. If my site has the exact same things as Amazon, they will see no point in serving that up to people because I'm not offering any more value. A good way to check if the copy only our page is unique enough is by putting the URL [here](http:\/\/www.copyscape.com)\n* When I first started out I did Code Academy for HTML CSS Javascript and I did their practice projects. After then I just started coming up with sites to built and would build them for practice, google when I ran into problems, by the time I finished I would have learned a lot and then start over with something else that I wouldn't have been able to do before. So just getting the basics down with CodeAcadamy and then just doing and learning from practice.\n\nBut thanks for subscribing!

Well, the last time I checked, negotiation was an important skill in business - go check in the business section on Amazon just how many texts are devoted to the subject....\n\nBoh!","383":"Since you're close to standford (and by extension the Bay Area) you have a lot of opportunities (both Academically and Employment). There are a lot of courses on Machine Learning - but I don't recommend taking these until you're very comfortable with Linear Algebrae and some numerical theory:\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Numerical_analysis\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the material moving into Machine Learning won't be too difficult. You will get a lot of theory but as for practice I do not know how the professors at Stanford conduct their Machine Learning courses.\n\nI attended a University where we are given more practical hands-on applications where we build models to predict real outcomes. I received most of my training on-the-job where I was tasked with \"production-izing\" Machine Learning Models.\n\nWhat I learned help hone your skills in this area is to follow the basic (supervised) process:\n\n* Identify a hypothesis (Will someone upvote a post?)\n* Collect data\/\"features\" about the subject (Upvoted, words in the post, post length, sub-reddit, links destinations, subject, context)\n* Apply statistical methods for determining which \"features\" correlate with the outcome (phrases vs upvote, sub-reddit + phrases vs upvote, etc) - Tools like [SAS](http:\/\/www.sas.com\/en_us\/home.html), R, and [Python](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/2\/tutorial\/) can be helpful here\n* Split your data into two sets: A training set, and a hold-out (test) set\n* Train your model using computers and algorithms suited to the purpose (Amazon Elastic Machine Learning, Matlab, SAS, R, Python)\n* Test your model against the hold-out set for Accuracy, Overtuning, Undertuning\n* Repeat 2 thru 6 until you get a fine balance\n* Run your model and watch it predict with the degree of accuracy you trained it for\n\n\nPractice this process on progressively more interesting questions with more interesting sets of data. If you really get into data-collection you'll dab a little into programming (in addition to data-mining using SQL + Data warehousing). Programming unlocks more interesting features (especially when you can begin using Hadoop to crunch out more interesting features from large volumes of RAW data). \n\nAs for concrete resources - I unfortunately have none since most of my learning was hands-on and acquired as I went on along in the industry through mentors, peers and training. \n\nThat said you don't need to deeply understand how each machine learning algorithm works to be successful at it. You just need to understand what it is good for, and what it isn't good for - the types of questions it can answer. [Wikipedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Machine_learning) can help with most of that.\n\nAs for data-collection SQL is good if you have a bunch of structured data. Most interesting stuff is [unstructured data](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unstructured_data) (this is where you can rake in the dough) - so learning simple scripting languages like Python can help you massage un-structured data to be a little more structured (semi-structured). \n\nMost of the interesting stuff now is done with lots and lots of unstructured data. Using python, [Regular Expressions](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regular_expression) and scripts you can take some of this unstructured and turn it into semi-structured data. More complex methods such as [Natural Language Processing](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Natural_language_processing) can be applied (though this is a little risky since most practical NLP techniques apply Machine learning already).\n\nYou need to build \"features\" from this data with which to train models. If you're dealing with lots of semi-structured data, learning about [Hadoop\/HIVE](http:\/\/hortonworks.com\/hadoop-tutorial\/how-to-process-data-with-apache-hive\/), and [lucene search](http:\/\/www.lucenetutorial.com\/) technologies like [Elastic Search](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/products\/elasticsearch) will allow you to produce amazing (structured) features.\n\nMost of these technologies can be picked up by reading tutorials on the internet and experimenting with the technology themselves.\n\nModel building isn't trivial. It pays well above simple SQL\/Excel Data Analysts. Even within Model building there are various levels. The Data Scientists\/Analysts at the top are using a wider range of technologies and have skills passable as an entry-level Software Developer. As such they often interface well with the Software Developers who take their model and bring it into production where the model is invisibly applied to millions, or billions, or trillions of operations - think of Google Search autocomplete.","384":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

That being said, it's so tricky as music is subjective! I don't think your music recommendations are any good (to me at least) . Keep working at it as it's a constant process!

(It covers the sample tracks)\n\n3) I find it annoying (and a bit dizzy) how you can move around the recommendations.  BUT, I like how you can get recommendations for another artist in two clicks. \n\n4) I don't buy music (y'all can hate me but I don't have the money to spend on an album whilst I can get it for free- maybe when I have a decent income that will change). If you're giving me samples and telling me to buy it, 100% of the time I wont be buying it but sampling it and then getting it on YouTube. I'm not suggesting you get rid of the iTunes link, I'm suggesting you add a link to YouTube as well perhaps? Also, I have an android, why can't I get the songs on the Google playstore? Why cant I get them on Amazon (another affiliate channel)? \n\n5) I don't like the Twitter and FB icon, especially not in the middle of the Reset Graph button and the search bar. I would also suggest putting the search bar at the top and in the middle (perhaps also making the search bar a bit wider as well). \n\n6) I would also suggest separating your toolbar\/view.html Div from the rest of the website by a line. Right now it annoys me that all I have on my left side is 80% white and your blue logo really stands out. \n\n7) One thing I would like to see from websites like this is to have a \"genre\" page. Where I can click on the genre and get a list of all the artists that produced music in that genre. I listen to soooo much old school rap that I feel like I've listened to everything yet I know that I've only discovered 50% of the genre. Help me find more artists! That way I'll come to the website every time I want to listen to music! \n\n8) Ultimately it comes down to your music recommendations. Idk how you can satisfy everyone when music is so subjective but good luck! I hope you don't think my suggestions\/ opinions are too harsh! (For me it's best when people tell me what I can impove\/ what they would like to see rather than a simple \"It's cool dude\" because that doesn't help me improve.)\n\n9) Also, just though about this. It would be cool if I can make an account\/login with Facebook to save all my search history and that I can come back when I need to... If I need to. Or to save an artist\/ song. \n\nGood Luck!

They were far cheaper than box store prices, I was able to \"build\" the kit by getting what I wanted\/needed, and they matched prices on Amazon.\n\nThe added benefit has been a savings in frustration by just having something available that works and works well.

In Hawaii, is it really basically just Expedia that handles most of the tours and tourist information, or the concierge's contracted with Expedia?

If he doesn't take his medications he could head into physical problems if you are not careful.     INclude multivitamins if you find yourself making purchases for him.  \nMake sure he is eating in the major food groups and establish a plate method for making meals on the menu:\n50% greens, 25% starches, 25% protein and side dishes of milk and fruit.  Breakfast is usually a bit different with more fats and starch.  AT least two fruit choices a day, not in juice but whole fruit.   Five vegetables a day. Vary the  proteins.     \nWhen he cooks a chicken it can be divided for multiple purposes - sandwiches, chicken breast with gravy, chicken legs for lunches, and save the carcass\/bones to make chicken soup.  That means when he buys a whole chicken it serves four or more meals for one person and you need to spread those left-overs out thru multiple meals in a menu planner.  I cook chicken bones down to make broth for lots of other meals.    I use a spread sheet to make our meal planner.   \nSame is true when cooking fresh vegetables - every item you cook should be assigned by the menu planner to be used within a few days -in my house that means it gets used within 3 days if not frozen immediately for later use.  AFter 3 days it goes to the garden compost pile as wasted money.   3 days is the recommended limit when your fridge is older or not holding the cold very well.     I use lots of good plastic wear and glass based left over jars for the fridge.        \nYou can save a lot of money by not tossing good food out - by using fresh or freeaing portions out for later use and saving money by avoiding take-out and pre processed foods.

My mom called this \"back burner soup\" which was made of veggies up to 3 days old.   \nAs far as the rice goes, remember that there are combinations of food with rice that changes the complexity of the meal - beans plus rice counts to make a protein meal according to some vegans.  \n\nFor pure savings:  I favor the meal in a jar plan - available on Amazon.  You simply buy the dry ingredients and put them into mason jars and set aside in a dry pantry until ready to cook.   I started my son going this and they came up with their own recipes.  We open a jar up and toss the ingredients into a slow cooker and leave it for 6 hours.   When they come home they have a home made soup meal.    The advantage of doing this is when you open a bag of beans or rice you use all of the supplies to make up multiple meals in jars all at once.  Saves time and energy - plus you can add seasoning to your own taste right into the mason jar.  Ever see those prepackaged HOme Baked meals?  Same principle.  Just like the old Lipton Soup mixes.  The difference is you make it up yourself. i've been known to make up a soup using a prepackaged dry onion soup base, dehydrated onions and some pasta.   It's tasty.   We put 6 oz canned chicken into  the jars and that gets opened and added to the slow cooker an hour before you plan to eat.  I've fond of elbow macaroni and dehydrated vegetables in my mason jars with plenty of dehydrated herbs.   nothing like home made sun dried tomatoes. \nBuying fresh is great if he know how to preserve and cook the food immediately.  I have no problem with people buying whole food that is organic and free of pesticides.     Purchase a good multifunction slow cooker for him to begin to use in order to help him learn to save money and time - even if he is no longer working - a slow cooker is a blessing.  Personally I cook with a cast iron dutch oven as I need the iron in my diet and my family is used to the flavors that come with this type of cooking.

Yeah, I guess...\n\nMost credit cards are the exact same as all other cards out there.  There are a couple of bottom of the barrel ripoff cards, all from companies that are not major companies.\n\nYour best bet is to (i) get one card with a low interest rate, in case you do need to carry a balance (i.e. no rewards, just low rate), and (ii) get good rewards cards.  I use my Barclaycard Arrival+ World MasterCard for the 2.2% cash back (note: you must have some travel expenses to use this), and I use my Barclaycard SallyMae card (5% back on Amazon, 5% back on gas, 5% back on grocery, with certain monthly caps).

I bought a backpack Monday and had it shipped overnight for 4.99. Ebay (IME) can't touch that. \n\nTo be honest Amazon just comes off as a better place to buy things. Amazon gives off the feeling of a mall, Ebay gives off the feeling of a dirty old fleamarket. Is it fun to rummage through for deals? Sure.

(He owns a shop and diesel fuel injectors aren't just readily available around here.) All because sellers list crap like \"2-3 day shipping.\" Well that literally means it takes them 2-3 days to ship and it takes another week to actually receive it.

I test the front USB ports as part of my check out and they were working when shipped (I guess its possible they broke during shipping?

If he ships me back a 360 Pro with broken USB ports, do I have any options or do I just eat it?

","542":"It depends on what kind of website you want to build. \n\nIf it's something complex like a big app '\u00e0 la startup' and you want to build it yourself, well, learn whatever you have to. Would I recommend this? No. Building a big\/complex app is... complex!  And the thing is that building the app\/website is only a fraction of what you would need to generate money. You'll need marketing, etc... So, do you want to spend 1 year to build an 'idea' that will potentially not work? Especially if it's the first time you try something on the web. Trust me, been there done that.\n\nWhat I would recommend if you want to start a business on the web:\nEither start with Wordpress and a paid theme (some people have million dollar business just using Wordpress). You wouldn't even need to code anything. Read about content marketing, affiliate marketing, SEO, etc.\n\nOr, find an easy to implement idea. Like something that would be easy to integrate with an e-commerce store (shopify), for example.\n\nOr, if  you really want to code something, I would suggest you to find an idea that you can implement with a simple form. Check out the 7 days startup book (I think it's like 3$ on Amazon). You could simply buy an HTML theme from themeforest.net, add a form with PHP, and go from there. If it works, you automate it more. \n\nAnd, I don't see the point of going with Ruby if you're starting out and you don't want to become a professional web developer. Yes, ruby is the cool kid, but building something simple with Ruby will take more time than with PHP, I guarantee it (if you're just starting to learn programming that is). And, nothing prevents you to learn Ruby after you have your simple website done with PHP.\n\nAlso, you can take a look at \/r\/webdev, \/r\/php, \/r\/ruby, \/r\/seo, \/r\/wordpress\n\nGood luck!\n\ntl\/dr : Don't create a big complex app if it's your first try at a business on the web, you'll lose time.

You must pay estimated taxes quarterly. It's easier to pay in 4 equal amounts. (The IRS allows for changing the amount if your income is not steady, but it's a very complicated accounting.)\n\n2. You will owe more more that 10%. Your income from freelancing will be combined with your income from your 9-5 job, so you will be in a higher tax bracket. I don't know your total income, but you should set aside 40% of your 1099 income for taxes (fed + state + self-employment taxes). You might owe more than that if you end up being in one of the higher tax brackets. Using the IRS estimated tax worksheet might be complicated, considering the multiple sources of income. I would recommend that you just aim to avoid a penalty at the end of the year. You can do this by paying 100% of your 2014 tax bill or 90% of your 2015 bill. *This means the sum of W2 withholding amount and estimated taxes.* See details here: http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p505\/ch04.html#en_US_2015_publink1000194815\n\n3.

I'd set aside 40% for taxes. Higher if you expect to be in the 28+% bracket. Think of it like this. For every dollar you earn on top of your normal salary, 28% will go to fed, 5% will go to state, and 15% for \"self-employment taxes.\" The last one is for Social Security and Medicare, and is typically paid half by you and half by your employer if you are a W2 employee (but in this case you are both the employee and the employer and must pay both halves). That's almost 50% for taxes.\n\n5. You will owe state taxes. I think Mass is 5%. Probably need to pay estimated taxes to avoid penalty, but I don't know.

When vine members do reviews their review is tagged as being part of the vine program to prevent it from seeming like a natural review. \n\nI am a review blogger and at least among other well established review bloggers who I have networked with, doing amazon reviews outside of the vine program is not viewed as an ethical or an acceptable practice. When I have gotten such offers, they usually want to reduce the price to .01 and have me purchase with my account so that the review will be viewed as a trusted review (because the system will see that I used my account to 'purchase' the product) when of course, that isn't really the truth considering I paid .01 instead of the real price. I have always denied such offers.\n\nIf you're really interested in doing reviews i'd recommend that you start a blog instead. It takes a lot of time and dedication but if you're passionate about it, it's worth it. Most people who simply want free stuff and aren't interested in writing, blogging and social media will find that it's too much work \"just\" for free stuff. I enjoy all aspects of blogging so it so its worth it for me. Of course, \"free\" items are not really free because you have to pay income taxes on the value of the items and when you're self employed you have to pay your own social security based on that income as well because they aren't withheld by your employer throughout the year. While writing a review may only take an hour it can easily take another half an hour to an hour to take high quality photos of your items and edit those photos, watermark them, etc. Plus, most people underestimate how important promoting is for a blog.

(The underlying message is: if you just stopped screwing around and started reading my books, you'd be successful too)...\n \nSo for the martial arts bit, he was way bigger than most guys, and instead of fighting fair, he was just pushing them outside of the fighting area. And for the dancing contest, when you look at the video, it's just a bunch of old people dancing, with Tim Ferriss in there, with an older lady.  \n \nAnd when his 4-Hour Body book was released, it took 24 hours or so, and he had hundreds of vibrant reviews on Amazon. \n \nYeah, I don't really like the guy.","636":"Have a look at the show Shark Tank. Many people in your situation go on it to pitch their ideas, and the sharks decide if they want to invest. The show may seem corny and staged, but it is full with great business advice. \n\nWhat I would suggest is asking yourself how are you going to make money from it. Ask yourself this: \n1. What is your market size? My research indicates ~ 2 million people and ~ $3bn. \n2. Who are your competitors? Adidas is one of them.\n3. How will you reach your customers? The majority of them are people above 65. Most of the diabetics. Their age voids your kickstarter idea. You won't find your target there.\n\nI would suggest you start by using your size to your advantage, meaning you don't have large overhead chasing you. Facebook and Amazon are your friends, but remember the best marketing is the \"Word of Mouth\" one. Find people near you and offer them free prosthetics and in return, polish your product based on their feedback.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1. Think of a nice name for your brand.\n2. It is imperative for you to make your website. This is where you will get ALL of your sales.\n3. Forget about the patents. You will waste money of them and spend valuable energy. They are useful if you actually invent something specific, like owning the rights to installing keyboards in arm prosthetics, or LED lights in leg ones etc. In other words, prevent others from doing it. From what I understood, you are making them look nice, and that's not really patent worthy.\n\nFocus on developing a great product based on customer feedback as I mentioned above. And watch Shark Tank. :)\n\n","637":"[Michael](\/u\/michaelfinney1), you're welcome. \n\nJust out of curiosity, how much are you weighting feedback of expert users vs novice users?  I suspect that all your early feedback was from novices, because it's clear that there are aspects (Add Item for example) which novices would appreciate, and experts would simply find it's in their way. People are going to be a novice for a couple months, then an expert for hopefully a long time.\n\nTabbing through taking you into edit mode on the category name  is another example. Once you have your categories set up you will use them hundreds of times for every time you decide to change a name.\n\nI'd like to challenge your perspective that what I want is double entry accounting or EveryDollar to be a checkbook register. I don't use YNAB for banking - reconciliation is to make sure I've given every dollar a job. \n\nFor example Turbo Tax offered me an extra 10% in to be paid part of my refund as an Amazon gift card. So $990 of my income in March was that Amazon gift card, which went into a gift card account. Spending from that account all comes from budget categories: $75 for headphones from \"fun money\"; $20 for replacement electric shaver blades from \"groceries &amp; consumables\", etc. \n\nOne of the things I think you've underestimated about YNAB is the value of entering transactions. Entering transactions while you have the receipt in your hand seems like more work. That's what people who objected to test driven development said too. But we later realized that testing close to the point of coding made the testing easier. The same thing is true with receipts.  You've got that Target receipt - how much is groceries, and how much is a toy for little Johnny? It turns out to be much easier to answer that question right away than days later. And you are then relieved from the mental effort of saving the receipt to do the split when the transaction downloads. \n\nBut you need to get transaction matching in place. This idea of entering checks when you write them and then deleting the transactions when they download from the bank is confusing, and people aren't going to understand why to do that. Or they'll overspend their budget category because they will have money that's spent but not reflected in the budget because the check hasn't cleared yet. \n\nAnd I'd like your UX team to consider the cognitive load of scanning a list of categories trying to identify the one you want vs typing a few characters of the name you recall. Again, novice vs expert thing. Sure, you need to be able to get to the list while you're learning the categories, but after 6 months you will tire of scrolling. The fact that the category list doesn't start from the same place every time amplifies the cognitive load. So you scroll down and drop a transaction, then the next transaction causes a pause while you decide \"is the category up, or down from here?\", and you then start scrolling up, having to reorient your pattern matching to see things appearing from above. \n\nFinally, tell the genius that suggested the \"fund target amount\" that they missed the date! So close!  If you don't have the date, you can't suggest how much needs to be budgeted every month to achieve it. Everyone knows that there are annual and semi-annual bills, but YNAB and EveryDollar both require me to break out the calculator to figure out how much I need to save each month for that bill. I don't want it forced, but it sure would be nice to have a hint.\n\nCan you tell I'm a software architect with a background in interaction design? One who's spent a few hours noodling on how I would go about building a better YNAB? \n \n-Chuck (CarryWise)","638":"I have to say, I am a right-wing man for industry and business.

If it's the only review, or they only review related products, or only say the same thing in all the reviews I flag it.     \n\nAnother big red flag is when they use aspects of the product by name, or description use methods just like the seller, and even more obvious when they finish it off with a message to potential buyers.\n\nHere's an example of a company that does this to a nauseating amount:\n&gt;\"Holy smokes... I've tried many different metal polish products in the past. I've always been reluctant to polish the chrome on our cars because it just takes so flippin' long. Sheen Genie has totally changed my mind. I can just wipe it on the surface I want to polish and then immediately wipe it off. That's it. It takes seconds as opposed to minutes\/hours. Don't waste your time trying others when this will do better than what you can find anywhere else. Buy this polishing set!\"\n\nThis one's by \"Pen name\"   \n&gt;I got some of this stuff at a car show, it works just as advertised. I use it mainly on my motorcycle but have also used it on an old mustang. Worth every penny simply for how much time it saves! I will be ordering more of this without a second thought.\n\nYou'll love it!\n&gt;I just bought some at the Auto Show, tried it on my 2012 Harley Trike, Wheels and all the Chrome Engine, WOW, WHAT A SHINE, JUST LIKE WHEN IT WAS New, don't need a whole lot on the rag, it takes out the road grime, dust fro brake pads. You'll love it.\n\n you won't want to pass up on on this sweet deal!\n&gt;I purchased Sheen Genie last fall from Amazon to see if I could find a good way to keep my chrome from peeling or look bad from sitting all winter. It got to me within about 5 days from the date of order, if I remember right. I'm a big skeptic about this kind of stuff. When I read about the product I found they offer the sealer and protectant that's supposed to last for up to 6 months with just 1 treatment. I have to say that I'm quite impressed. When I hit all the important areas of my bike with the polish and the sealer I was curious to see how it would look. I was happy that only took about 5 minutes tops... Just yesterday I got into my garage to pull the bike out and all it took was a 30 second wipe-down with my terry cloth towel and the bike looked like I just polished and washed it. I'm super impressed and will be recommending this to all of my friends. This is a metal polish kit that you won't want to pass up on.\n\n\nEh, give me a break...","695":"Get some knowledge on how to build credit on your cc first before getting one. If you spend more on your cc than what you make you are not doing any favors for yourself. Go for a card with limits. A store credit card. Something you know you won't use a lot. PayPal has a pretty good starter one. Amazon store card is a common one. Jcp Macy's have a pretty high approval rate. Or just a chevron Texaco card. DO NOT PUT IN REQUESTS FOR ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. Wait a bit for a response. After you get one wait for 6 months or so before trying for another one.

There are services like [CraftCoffee.com](http:\/\/www.craftcoffee.com) and [others](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=coffee%20subscription). They'll send your coffee to thousands of coffee lovers. This could really boost sales of your retail coffee. Any incentives you throw in will help drive sales (coupons and such).\n\nYou could try listing on Amazon.com and\/or eBay.\n\nDo you sell to restaurants at all? There's a big market potential there.\n\nDo you give away freebies of your coffee? Small sample packs to consumers will let them try your coffee, risk free. \n\nAnd of course, you could try pushing into smaller super-market chains, or food distributors.\n\nYou could try hiring someone, who works on commission, who just focuses on your retail side. ","740":"Because if you're talking about grocery delivery, don't do it.\n\nBest case scenerio. You get a call, 2 minutes. You drive to the store, 5 minutes. You shop and check out, 5 minutes. You drive to their house, 5 minutes. You deliver, receive payment, and give change, 3 minutes. \n\nCounting minutes? That took 20 of them. Assume you can replicate that 3 times an hour (you can't, but we'll pretend you do). How much are you charging ? $5, you just made $15\/hr, minus gas ($3), income taxes ($3), and sales tax (~$1). That's minimum you're taking off. You just made $8 in that perfect hour. Charge $10 and you're coming out at $30\/hr minus gas ($3), taxes ($6 and ~$2) = $19 \/ hour. In a best case scenario.\n\nWorst case scenerio. Here's what will happen. You'll get a phone call, you're on the phone for 10 minutes, making a list, asking a lot of questions like \"What size of flour? A big bag.. okay. What brand of frozen peas? The ones in the white bag, okay...\". 5 minutes to the store. Now you're shopping, but you can't find this one item you've never heard of. You look high and low. Before you know it, you've wasted 15 minutes in the store. You get in your car, 10 minutes to their house. Go make the delivery, \"Sorry, I couldn't find item X\". They look through their order, \"This is the wrong flour. This is the wrong peas.\" You subtract them off the bill. They pay. You've wasted 10 minutes there. No you've got to go back to the store (10 minutes), return the peas and flour (oh yay, a line up at customer service! 10 minutes), and await another call.\n\nYou just spent an 1:10 doing one delivery. How much did you charge? $5? $10? Better be charging $30+, or you're not making money.\n\nYou'll be lucky if you can clear 2 calls an hour. If you're in a big city, the competition is fierce. Amazon is doing it for free, and other places are doing it for $5-10 a call. They do this because they are overcharging for the groceries, they usually partner with a particular store and get a cut of the sales. They have people taking calls, people picking items, and people delivering. They've got enough volume to make it work, but they aren't making millions. It's a job that pays the bills. If you're in a large city, you'll need thousands of dollars in capital to get you by, before you've got a customer base that will support you. Small city? Not a chance.\n\nYou'd have much better luck getting a storage space, installing some shelves, fridges and freezers, stocking it with food staples. Then offering people the option to purchase those directly from you, and have it delivered to their door. Sounds crazy, except you're operating at night, when grocery stores are closed. And you'll offer alcohol, because that'll be your biggest seller (and cigarettes). But have fun getting a license to sell liquor (in some places, it's a real pain in the ass).","741":"I just listed and made my first sales yesterday. Thanks to everyone for all of the great info. \n\nHow do you guys deal with \"policies\" on Amazon, like for shipping\/returns\/etc?","742":"Ups damaged one of my packages.  Amazon, since the item was returned to them, reimbursed me $50.35.\n\nCost of the items inside?  $9.  Cost of shipping?  $10.02.  Profit of $30 on slow moving items?  Amazing!","743":"Store credit cards like Macy's and Kohl's are probably your best bet if you can't get approved elsewhere. They'll approve you for a small credit limit, but you can request a credit limit increase in the future, often without another hard inquiry on your credit.\n\nAlso, Google around for first time credit cards. I got one when I was 18 from some random South Dakota-based bank. I've really never used it, but I've kept the account open to maximize the average age of credit accounts, which impacts credit score.\n\nIf you're a responsible spender, try for a Chase Amazon Visa or a Chase Freedom Visa. They accumulate points quickly if you use them for everyday purchases. Pay the balance in full each month and enjoy earning free money.","744":"I buy them in bulk on Amazon. I get 80 or 90 of them for $30. I drink one cup a day (sometimes I have a second, sometimes my boyfriend has one) but for the most part it lasts me as many days. It comes out to be about 35 cents-ish a cup. I get the San Francisco Bay brand, which are supposedly bio-degradable.","745":"If you drink more than one cup of coffee a day, anything is better than a Kuereg. I'm a fan of bunn myself - if you really like the Keurig speed, but drink several cups, the Velocity makes between 20 and 50 oz into a nice thermos carafe with whatever coffee you like, ground how you like and it's like 3 minutes for the whole pot. According to Amazon and other reviews - the Bunn method is one of the ways to make \"good\" coffee also. They are price competitive on Amazon with a lowish end Keurig and have a 3 year warranty. The downside is you pay in electricity cost.\n\nAnother, slower alternative is a French Press. The stainless steel ones will probably last forever, again you can use whatever coffee you like, and it's generally considered one of the better coffee making methods.\n\nIn anything food related, it's also a matter of taste. Do you like strong coffee? If so, I don't think the Keurig is ever going to match either of the above. But if you don't really care or notice - then it's unlikely all the grinding snobbery or coffee bean snobbery is going to be worth it for you. However, even in that case, why not just get a $9 pourover filter holder, heat the water however is handy, and call it a day? The Kuerig still doesn't make any sense.","746":"I'm not super familiar with Houston, but if it's at all bike-friendly I'd highly consider getting a bicycle. I've been biking to work for the past month (5 miles one way) and it has already saved me a shit ton of money (no gas and no parking tickets, lol). \n\nI've always had a safety blanket, but I know what it's like to be dirt poor. If you get a lead on a bike please remember me and PM me. I'd be happy to get you a pump or some other bare essentials from Amazon or something. Good luck OP.","747":"I started flipping Nintendo Wiis on eBay in 2006, but I don't think things got real until I discovered Amazon the next year. My first sale there was a new in package Wireless Wavebird controller for the Nintendo Gamecube which I bought at Walmart for ~$20 and sold for $60.  After I'd cleared the local Walmarts of all their stock, I began sourcing from eBay to sell on Amazon, then moved to flipping used video games sourced from local trade in shops (Nashville - McKays books used to be and probably still is a GREAT source) and Gamestops.  Things developed at a pretty slow, hobby pace and I wrapped 2008 shifting 144 units.  \n\nI sold 10 times that number the following year and in 2010.  2011 marked the beginning of my involvement with Amazon FBA; my first sale was Zumba Fitness for Nintendo Wii, which I had sourced from Amazon itself the month prior for $36.99 and sold for $65.97.  FBA fees were lower then, but even today the profit from a sale like this would be $16, ~24% profit margin and ~%50 roi.  \n\nI still source the same way now, looking for relatively common items with high demand online that I can acquire in bulk at retail or via wholesale\/distribution (though I have largely phased out my used video game flips).  FBA quintupled (~5500 orders) my emerging reselling business that year and I began thinking about potentially leaving my 9-5.  \n\nMy business nearly tripled (14,000+ orders) in 2012 when I went full time midway through the year, combining wholesale sourcing with FBA.  I was still firmly in the video games niche but branched out into odd accessories like Portal earrings and Minecraft necklaces.  \n\n2013 was my first year hitting $1,000,000 in sales, quintupling the income I had been making at my day job.  Today I still use Amazon FBA as my main income channel and hope to continue for as long as I can.  Good luck to all of you!","748":"Second this.

Companies know that the goodwill engendered\/spread (or at least, not having people talk smack about them) is usually worth way more than their cost of replacing it. \n\nFor example, I had the sound go out in my pair of Amazon headphones (the magnetic ones that come with their phone, I just purchased a pair of them a la carte) within 2-3 weeks of light use. I emailed them stating this and they gave me a full refund, without asking for the defective ones back. Could I have been some jerk just grifting them? Absolutely, but I imagine whoever writes policy has crunched the numbers and it makes way more sense from a sales\/marketing perspective* to give the customer the benefit of the doubt, especially over something so small. \n\nI also recently had an eBay seller sell me a \"30kg\" dumbbell set, which arrived labeled in pounds and actually was more like 20kg. They are claiming I'm the first person in ~50 orders to actually contact them about this, and are offering me... $5 to make it right. That one's probably getting escalated, I'd just return them for a full refund if the cost of shipping didn't exceed the cost of the damn weights.\n\n*This is Amazon we're talking about.

The tube was bent and when unbent it only reached halfway down the bottle.  It must of had a hole or tear so no product would pump out. I emailed Olay and they sent me a voucher for any Olay product. Can't remember the amount limit. Awfully nice of them. I ended up not using it. I just wanted them to be aware of the defect. I just unscrewed the pump and shook the product out.","791":"I personally take EAS 100% Whey Protein.  A 5lb tub was $40 on Amazon and since I'm aggressively cutting and have no notable muscle to lose it'll last me around 2 months.

So if you can float $500 at a place you are going to spend the giftcard anyway, you could instantly have 2k miles.\n\nAdditionally there is mileageplusshopping, a portal you can shop through online to earn points. You can use the giftcard you bought through MileagePlus X and double dip in points.","793":"I've found Amazon to degrade over time... The prices use to be awesome and Prime meant 2 day delivery.  Now prime doesn't mean jack shit other than its sold by Amazon,  and I find better prices at my local stores and on eBay.  I only ever shop there on a rare occasion.... I use the site mainly for user reviews before I go get a better price somewhere else... \n\nTheir customer service is top notch though,  never experienced anything better. ","794":"I've shopped there almost exclusively for the past 2 years- I'll post a bit later on with my weekly list, and my reviews! (Have a rented tiller at the moment, getting ready for garden season!)\n***\nEDIT: Here we go!\n\n#Some background about Aldi:\nThey are able to offer low prices on quality products in a number of ways.\n\n1. **Shopping carts are only available with the deposit of a quarter** - so bring one with! (You'll get it back when you return the cart). This eliminates paying for a cart wrangler.\n2. **You bag your own groceries**.\n3. **You pay for the bag.** :-) (a few pennies for either plastic or paper, I'm still using the same (large) plastic bags I bought on my first trip. They also have insulated bags for sale - around $1, still using those, too. Lately, I've been skipping the bags entirely, and throw a Rubbermaid tub and a soft-sided beach cooler in the back seat of the car, and just unload directly from the cart.\n4. **No scales** - all the produce is packaged and sold at the same price for each package (of the same fruit\/veg).\n5. **Small staff size.** I don't think I've ever seen more than 3 or 4 employees in the store at once. Since all the items are scannable, checkout moves pretty fast. All Aldi barcodes are HUGE, as in entire-side-of-the-box-of-cereal huge, and often printed on more than one side of something, to speed up checkout.\n6. **Limited selection, of mostly house brands.** You'll find some brand name items, but never more than 2 brands of the same thing. Means they can pack more items into their...\n7. **Small buildings.** Usually 5 - 6 aisles. Less overhead, and easier to stock.\n8. **No music playing overhead** - no XM\/Muzak license to pay for.\n(You can read more at [Wikipedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aldi#Business_practices))\n\n#Some general things to note - \n\n* They are able to offer a wider variety than what normally fits in the store with seasonal \"special buys\", that last only until stock runs out - sometimes a week, sometimes 6 months (I'm looking at you, spicy beef summer sausages that are still there on the \"last chance\" aisle), and sometimes only a few days, such as their \"Fresh Meat Special Buy of the Week\". If it's something you use or like, get it when you see it.\n* They have all manner of non-food products available on a rotating basis, 5-7 items that are special buys, things like SentrySafes (at 15% less than Amazon), Popcorn makers, Showtime Rotisseries, various tools, utensils, plateware sets, cookware, organizational accessories, etc. These can be hit or miss, but usually the former. Check the Weekly ad at http:\/\/www.aldi.us\/en\/weekly-specials\/our-weekly-ads\/\n* All the (huge and easy to read) price tags have the cost-per-unit clearly marked, which makes comparison shopping extremely easy. Take a week and write down\/calculate your per-unit at your normal grocer, and then compare. If you don't like the Aldi item, they'll refund your money, no problem.\n\n#My Findings\n\n* I'm just buying for my wife and I, but we usually eat 20 meals a week at home, each. Our weekly bill is usually around $75 from Aldi, $20 from Kroger, and about $50 a month from Costco.\n\n* While Aldi doesn't have \"sale prices\" (another way they save money - not paying someone to change all those goddamn stickers every week), watch the weekly \"Produce Picks\" - avocados for $0.59, 3lb bag of sweet potatoes for $0.89, $0.99 strawberries, etc. I usually buy extra, and work it into weekly meals or freeze (as appropriate).\n\n* Look over your produce. On occasion, there will be bruises or spots. Just pick another package. If possible, don't go first thing in the morning, the produce that's out, while refrigerated overnight, might have sat for a few hours the night before. Grab produce that's still cold (from having just been brought out) if possible.\n\n##What We Buy from Aldi\nOn my weekly \"keep in stock\" list: (in order of appearance as I'd walk through the aisles:\n\n* Baked Bbq potato chips\n* Multigrain Tortilla chips\n* Roasted almonds, dried cranberries\n* Peanut Butter\n* Gluten-free crackers with Sea Salt - they're just really really good with cheese.\n* Dark chocolate + almond protein bars\n* Quick-cook steel cut oats\n* Rolled Oats\n* All-natural Fruit spread (strawberry, raspberry, blackberry - I rotate)\n* Whole grain and dijon mustards*\n* Millville (Aldi house brand for baking\/cereal goods) cereal - the wife loves kids cereals\n* Duke's Mayo (Wife's belligerently picky about this, so I concede)\n* Wine - they usually only carry around 20 varieties. (Winking Owl is pretty good for a house brand, the Sauv Blanc in particular is nice (for under $3 a bottle)). Flirty Bird isn't bad either. And all the wines Aldi makes have a neat sweet\/dry and light\/full body chart on the back, which helps cut out the guesswork. The weekly Special Buy wines have always been pretty good, and I'm not going to get mad when one $5-7 bottle out of 10 isn't a huge winner. \n* Spice grinders - the \"Steak\/Chops\", \"Chicken\/Poultry\", and Lemon Pepper grinders are all excellent.\n* All my \"baking goods\/staples\" - veg oil, olive oil (light and Extra Virgin) flour, sugar, etc.\n* Apple juice\n* Cranberry juice blend (for drinking with vodka, obvs)\n* Energy Drinks - the cans, mini Red-bull style cans, and water-enhancers are all great for the price. Red Thunder especially is damn delicious, as mentioned elsewhere. The big cans taste pretty close to Monster.\n* Yellow, Red, and Green Onions\n* Sweet potatoes\n* Gold potatoes\n* Garlic\n* Zucchini and yellow squash\n* Romaine Hearts\n* Broccoli crowns\n* Cauliflower, when under $2\n* Green peppers\n* Mini sweet peppers - when $2.29 or less. They'll last for a few weeks in the fridge, easy.\n* Mushrooms (button or Cremini - 2 or 3 when on sale for $0.99)\n* Green beans*\n* Brussels Sprouts*\n* Avocados. When on sale for $0.59, I've been known to get 6 or 8. I'll leave on the counter until just ripe, then throw in the fridge for up to two weeks.\n* Tomatoes - when in season. Up until a couple of weeks ago, they weren't that good. Price fluctuates a lot, so I buy whichever kind (beefsteak, roma, vine, or grape) is the cheapest that week.\n* Strawberries\/blueberries\/raspberries\/blackberries* (extra when on sale)\n* Apples, especially when under 0.99\/lb.\n* Bags of lemons and limes (for cooking and cocktails)\n* Canned and dry beans (lentils when available)\n* Tortillas, (flour and corn) (for her, and I, respectively)\n* Fire-roasted tomatoes in can are excellent - stock up, they're on rotating basis.\n* Mexican style corn in can is pretty good, too.\n* Cheese - we've cut back lately for dietary reasons, but their cheeses are excellent and cheap. I usually had 6-8 kinds in the drawer at all times to feed our cheese plate addictions.\n* Sliced cheeses for lunch, all good. Shredded cheese (only three varieties...haha) as well.\n* Lunch meat - the stuff in tubs is good. The ones in 1lb bags are a little too processed for our tastes, and we've never managed to get through it in time, but if you've got kids you're good to go.\n*Take-n-bake pizzas, on occasion. They're huge, and pretty damn good for $5-6.\n* Light turkey kielbasa is a staple for us. \n* Chorizo - love the hot. Cook that with some onion, throw in some chicken stock, uncooked rice, and a can of black beans, top with cilantro. \n* Fresh Italian turkey sausage is really damn good.\n* Chicken breasts when on \"Special Buy\" for 1.89\/lb\n* Pork sirloin roasts when on \"Special Buy\"\n* Milk, OJ (not from concentrate, extra chewy (high pulp)), almond milk, coffee creamer - the Italian sweet cream is excellent)\n* Frozen Swai (like catfish), tilapia, and flounder\n* Various frozen veggies\n* Jasmine Rice\n* Pasta is always good, especially the limited time ones.\n* Bread - just keep in the fridge. Their raisin bread is pretty awesome.\n* Canned tuna\n* Zip-top bags - excellent.\n\n**When available - not always.*\n\n##What we don't buy from Aldi (from experience)\n* Balsamic Vinagrette - too damn peppery, period.\n* Bananas - they never seem to hit yellow, just going from green to brown. It's weird, but it's happened way too many times.\n* Coffee - it's just not that good, and one of the things I don't mind paying a bit more for, and Costco has excellent choices for $6\/lb.\n* Smoked turkey breast lunch meat - it's rubbery.\n* Cranberry chicken salad - while absolutely delicious, it's crazy high in fat and has panko breadcrumbs as filler.\n* Frozen salmon. Always fishy and poor texture.\n* Dried spices in jars - not so good. I go Penzey's all the way.\n\n##What we buy elsewhere\n* Green beans, one jalapeno a week, herbs, light frozen meals, beer, and anything that Kroger has on huge sale that week.\n* Cider vinegar (Aldi's just doesn't carry it.)\n* Bananas, bagels (Einstein Bros) and coffee from Costco\n* Most of my meats - sale prices at Kroger beat Aldi's normal price majority of the time.\n* Paper products - at Costco when on sale. Can't beat that shit.\n\n*****\n*TL;DR:* Aldi is awesome when you get into the swing of it.  Produce is generally very good, and a good value. Money-back guarantee (double even - they'll refund you AND replace it if you want another). Wednesday is the day to go if you want first pick at meat specials and non-food rotation items. \n\nI've still got another 1000 characters? I'll add more when I randomly think of it in the next coupla hours. :-)","795":"I just ordered a $10 watch on Amazon for my son (the one he wanted in a store was junk) that will get here Wednesday.  I would have paid another $5 to just have it flown here instantly, which would still be cheaper than the watches I saw at the store.  So I think it will have its uses.\n\nI wish we had giant vacuum tubes going all over the place, maybe a central distributor for each neighborhood that was big enough to transport groceries and other small items.  \n\n","796":"Download  Amazon Seller App. Buy low sell high. Watch some videos on YouTube  on how to ship products sold on Amazon and eBay.","797":"The reason I came here was because I somewhat agree with your initial point, but wanted to get a feel for what others thought.  Anyway, it seems situational.  \n\nMany products these days assume you will not read the instructions and I somewhat expect that it came with a sticker or tag on the pull string initially that warned against this.  It is possible that he had used it a few times already and removed that sticker\/tag, but failed to tell his wife how to use it.  In that case, if she broke it, I completely agree with you but may go for option #2 or #3 below.\n\nBut it somewhat sounded like she may have been the first to use it and it broke before they got a chance to use it.  The product should be engineered to not break when used like most similar products or have a warning.  In this case, any of these options seem reasonable:\n\n1.  Return it, which is easiest and will get the point across to the manufacturer because I am sure stores report returns.  That point, in case you are not aware, is that they should anticipate people are morons and put a sticker at the least warning about such things.\n\n2.  Contact the manufacturer via letter\/email and tell them what happened, maybe asking for a suggestion on parts to order to fix the problem.  This is usually the route I go, and what I did when I received something cracked from Amazon a few months ago, and they offered to send me a replacement part for free.\n\n3.  Contact the manufacturer through their warranty process, hoping for an exchange or something.","798":"I purchase Syntha 6 on Amazon. May not be the cheapest but it's got a great formula, tastes good, and mixes well ","799":"Every once in a while I'll contact a company about something like that.

Only, when I used them to make iced tea, a bunch of the tea leaves seeped out from the bags and into my pitcher of tea. I wrote to them explaining that I feel it shouldn't have happened when their product is supposed to be designed for being put in a pitcher of water to steep. They sent me a few coupons, which was nice, but kind of silly to me... \"oh you didn't like our product? Here, maybe you'll like it better if it costs less\"\n\nA couple months ago, I ordered a pack of the best-rated puppy pads on Amazon, because our dog was about to have surgery and we didn't want to carry her outside and risk hurting her. They were advertised as satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. When our dog refused to use them, even when I sprayed \"go here\" spray on them and rubbed one in her pee outside, I wrote to them asking about getting the refund. I even said that I'm sure their product works well for most dogs; it just didn't work for us. They were very pleasant in their response and processed the full refund right away.

So your Journey will get a bump in a few more months.","823":"Today at Good Will I saw a ton of boxes that had about 20 pieces of wrapped candy inside, still closed and sealed with plastic. Is there any risk in trying to resell these since it is a food product? They were .99 cents at GW and sold for $10.00 a piece on Amazon, but the liability scared me away from
