I just know that randomly last month I got so many reminders from this Pizza Lady..Dana Parker- to keep logging pizza surveys, and I would get a $5 Amazon GC if I did it just ONCE. \n\nWell, I gave in, and found out it actually only took me ~5mins to complete the entire survey. \n\n\nNOTE: Disregard the part on the page for the link I post at the bottom here where it claims you only get $5. I got an email a week ago saying they CHANGED the incentivizing for the survey and it's now $5 for your first submission and $1 for every one thereafter. \n\n\nThe survey is the EXACT SAME every time.\n\nThere are TWO control questions. The answers are \"Trucks\" (doesn't belong on a list of foods) and \"Green\" (the very last question specifically asks you to pick this as your answer).\n\n\nThe survey is easy, and manipulatable, and not very well monitored. You can just blaze through it. I don't want to get BANNED per-se so I only log 1 *extra* submission daily. So I complete my $5 submission on the 1st and do $1 everyday there after. I will be getting ~$35 per month in Amazon GC by doing this. However the surveying ends around the end of April 2015, so I figured instead of being GREEDY and keeping this to myself like I did when I loop-holed bing rewards to make $500 in three weeks, I am SHARING this time in hope that the REAL karma gods will help me out. Despite whether or not I get a lot of karma here :P\n\n\n\n\nGuys. this is SO easy. please don't miss out. Just go to this link:\n\nhttp:\/\/survey1.gongos.com\/DM140395S1\/default.aspx\n\n\nAnd then make sure to always use the same email address. Go ahead and try it. If you don't trust me, just do it ONCE. And on March 10th-ish when you get an email with a $5 Amazon code you'll be like FUCK, why didn't I do another extra submission for the other 30 days of the month?\n\n\nThe survey is exactly the same everytime! It has the exact same control questions! And it only takes FIVE minutes on a computer. I do it on my phone in 10 minutes during the last part of my school classes where we are just packing up listening to the teacher ramble anyway. \n\n\nThis takes so little time and pays guaranteed! And isn't sketchy at ALL. I have no idea how I got the first email, but I'm so happy I decided to take the survey once instead of unsubscribe from future emails because it turned out to be the biggest joke ever. Currently I have 12 bing accounts too that I only do daily searches on (not mobile) and get paid out $60 every ~30days. Plus this...I am now making the easiest $100 Amazon GC per MONTH... So easy I am baffled. I am going to save $600+ for black friday and get a TV (last year I got an Xbox ONE with that $500 I said I scamme din 3 weeks when bign had a loophole).\n\n\n\n\nI never found a more trusted and easy survey. It's like you're doing a 100 SwagBuck survey that takes 5 minutes, and you can do it repeatedly and you won't ever be disqualified...and the first one is worth 500pts... Amazing.\n\n\n\nPM for any questions or verification, but really guys just follow the link and ENJOY: http:\/\/survey1.gongos.com\/DM140395S1\/default.aspx\n\n\nThere it is again.

I seriously feel like fucking Santa posting this because it's SO easy and fast to do. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Think link isn't bunk but it says you need to be screened for the survey when entering a new email. \n\n\n**Current best suggestion** is to email the surveyor at dparker@gongos.com\n\nExplain to them you were told about the surveys froma  friend and you eat tons of pizza too and want to help their cause out. Tell them you need to be \"screened\" or whatever though in order to start and they should help get you started. These people WANT to give you their money, they aren't going to ignore someone emailing them saying they have tons of good data to provide them with through their surveys.","9":"70% Paypal, 80% Amazon rate.\n\n\nI don't need xbox live time, just xbox credit.","10":"Lots of previous Xbox\/PSN and Amazon trades, check out my rep here http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2mc4e0\/uthrew_it_to_ground_gcx_rep_profile\/","11":"Hello, I am selling various games as well as TF2 and CSGO Items in my steam inventory for Amazon Gift Codes. \n\nCurrent List of games\n\n* BIT.TRIP Collection\n\n* Darksiders II\n\n* Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine\n\n* Garry's Mod\n\n* Castle Crashers\n\n* 3DMark\n\n* Retro City Rampage DX\n\n* Left 4 Dead 2\n\n* Contraption Maker\n\n**Rep Thread**\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2wuj7h\/usaviorh_gcx_rep_profile\/\n\nI will consider other gift cards if they actually appeal to me.

","20":"[H] Paypal [W]Amazon","21":"[H] Paypal \/ Google Wallet [W] Amazon GC","22":"[H] Paypal [W] Amazon","23":"I\u2019ve been a semi-lurker on this and other startup \/ entrepreneurial subreddits for a long time reading some daily and picking some amazing tips and advice along the way. I\u2019ve finally got my own story to tell and would love to share back to the community how I used a collection of tools to bootstrap the build of my MVP which I guess achieved it\u2019s key goal which was to attract an investor. It\u2019s called [850 Sports News Digest](http:\/\/850sportsapp.com\/) if you\u2019re interested.\n\nI\u2019m convinced the single most important thing we did was build an MVP. It seemed to make the idea and vision much more tangible and understandable to investors and anyone else we were trying to get attention from. It also showed that the have the ability and drive to build something good on a shoestring.\n\nSo, to get the MVP built, I made the rather controversial decision to go with a pair of designers who know enough code to get it built, rather than take on a technical partner. I had worked with them before at eBay and Funding Circle and I knew they would be able to hack together a beautiful MVP at a rapid pace.\n\n**The tools and services we used to hacked together the MVP**\n\nSo here\u2019s the list of significant tools and services we used, in the order we used them. (We of course used your regular productivity \/ office tools like Trello, Skype, Skype screen share, Google docs and all that as well to run the operation and still do).\n\n**Static whiteboard sheets**\n\nToo often we only think of tools and services available on a computer but the biggest initial catalyst was a tool that enabled me to turn my living room walls into a whiteboard.\n\nI\u2019d had a sort of sports content model for mobile in my head for a while but finally the idea of a digest using sports strips came to me so I brain dumped the ideas down on these cool white board sheets that stick onto your wall with static, [check them out on Amazon](http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Magic-Whiteboard-MAGICWHITE\/dp\/B001P5UAV8\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424707463&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=whiteboard+sheets).\n\n**Balsamiq**\n\nOnce I had a workable idea down on paper \/ wall  for the build and onboarded my now business partner, it was now time to put the layouts and braindumps into a more structured form, which meant it was wireframing stage. A designer friend introduced it to me [Balsamiq](https:\/\/balsamiq.com\/) and it was so quick and easy to use, I can only laugh now at the days I used to use PowerPoint to create rough wireframes!\n\n**99 Designs**\n\nNext up, it was finding a design concept \/ theme to work with. I had a vague idea of what this should look like but I wanted my idea adapted into different concepts to ensure we were choosing the correct design direction.  This is where [99 Designs](http:\/\/99designs.co.uk\/) is brilliant. Rather than relying on one head (my designer) to come up with a concept, it was quicker and cheaper to put a design challenge out on 99 Designs, eventually coming back with 12 concepts worth choosing from after only 1 week.\n\n**Invision**\n\nI went through the design concepts with the designer and the final concept they created ended up being a mix of our two favourite concepts from 99 Designs and magic touch of class only a great designer like the ones I used can deliver. It is close to what you see today on the app. So with the design language in place, it was time to start building out all UI and interactive elements. The designers introduced me to [Invision](http:\/\/www.invisionapp.com\/) which we could use to test \/ debate \/ feedback on the UI decisions they were making. It looks and works just like an app on your phone, so much so that I almost started using this as a version to approach investors with. Invision helped us dramatically increase the speed of decision making of what can be a finicky phase and therefore helped reduced design and development costs.\n\n**Time to build with PhoneGap**\n\nOnce we were completely happy with the interactivity of the app in Invision, it was time to build. The designers started working on the front-end development of the app using [PhoneGap](http:\/\/phonegap.com\/). The major cost saving advantage here being that you build one app that then can get published to an Android and iOS version. There is also a strong ecosystem to help ease integrating common tools (eg Facebook and Google Analytics SDK) that really increase the speed of the build.\n\n**Wordpress**\n\nWe\u2019d need to update sports news pretty much daily so I lost a lot of sleep over how we were going to build the CMS we needed as the content of the app takes on a strict template format. A friend of mine said Wordpress, a platform I am very comfortable using, would do the job so we looked into it further. The designers found a brilliant plugin for Wordpress called Advanced Custom Fields which helped give us much more control over the template and content. Using [Wordpress](https:\/\/wordpress.org) in this way saved us thousands of Pounds and weeks \/ months of work developing our own CMS. \n\n**Release candidates with Hockey App**\n\nWe used [Hockey App](http:\/\/hockeyapp.net) to push updates of the build to our phones before making it available on the respective app stores so that we could scrutinise, look for bugs and test it across different OS versions and devices. But we\u2019ve since worked out that both the Android developer console and iOS offer beta testing options so this might be the way to do it going forward.\n\n**Pushwoosh for notifications**\n\nNow you can\u2019t have a sports news app without the ability to send notifications and as we had used PhoneGap, we couldn\u2019t use native app solutions but we found [Pushwoosh](https:\/\/www.pushwoosh.com\/) and it is a really good notification solution for your app if you find yourself hacking together an MVP like we did. The UI could do with improving though, the confusion and the lack of time to figure out all the advanced features meant we only used the simple push and schedule features.\n\n**Apptentive \/ Intercom for user engagement**\n\nYou need to get feedback from your users at this stage and [Apptentive](http:\/\/www.apptentive.com\/) is a great way to do this if you do not require your users to login. It also has a very clever rating request prompt where it finds out if the user likes the app first before asking for them to review it, helping improve the rating scores. If we already had logins in place, we probably would have opted for [Intercom](https:\/\/www.intercom.io\/) (or possibly run both) which has some very powerful customer relationship management tools.\n\n**Google Analytics**\n\nI\u2019ve been an advanced user of Google Analytics for years and I really feel that Universal has put them head and shoulders above everyone else and this should be a must-have install. There\u2019s almost nothing you can\u2019t find on GA if you\u2019ve installed it properly and know how to use it.  We\u2019ll look at supporting analytics tools like Kiss Metrics in the future but for now, we need to keep things streamlined.\n\n**Going forward**\n\nIf you use the app as it is right now in the MVP version, you will notice it does a decent job but it can be sluggish when swiping, scrolling and loading content. This is pretty much the best performance we could get out of PhoneGap which is great for an MVP but I\u2019d never be satisfied with this as a mass consumer offering so moving forward, now that we have some resource available to us, we are re-coding the app into native for Android and iOS. Likewise, to the make the CMS as efficient and scalable as possible, we will be building a custom CMS to help match our long term personalisation of content and growth ambitions. The CMS will also take control of the push notifications so we will be retiring Pushwoosh as well.\n\nI hope this helps you with your MVP ambitions and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask, we\u2019re busy prepping for launch so apologies if my replies are a bit slow.\n\n","24":"Riddle me this...\n\niPad Air, Verizon, 1st Gen, MF532LL\/A:\nAmazon used price: $445.31 (there is a refurb @ $400)\neBay selling prices (sold listings): $350-380, maybe a $400 once in a while\n\nI have an opportunity to pick one up that would make a decent profit on Amazon, but hard to see how fast they are selling.

I make more than I spend, have no debts, and generally make payments on time (with a lapse here and there, but not with my credit cards that I can recall). Otherwise, I'm pretty clueless. Maybe this should be 3 different questions, but they're somewhat related.\n\n1\\. How much does a recent credit check for getting a mortgage affect your credit score?\n\nLast month (&gt;30 days ago) I got in contact with my bank just to see how much I'd be able to receive. I genuinely had no idea because I've only lived in the US for ~2 years so I haven't built up very much of a credit history. The loan officer had run a credit check, and my scores were a bit lower than I expected (~ 685\/705\/725). I started looking at houses and I'm now interested in making an offer one one, which means I actually need a pre-approval. I'd like to actually shop around for rates, but that would mean a new credit checks. I got my free annual credit report from Experian going through annualcreditreport.com (the other 2 wouldn't provide it online for some reason) and the check from last month is listed. Because my scores are lower than I had thought I'm now concerned about doing a new set of checks just a month later. I read online that multiple credit checks for shopping for mortgage rates within 30 days isn't an issue, but this check is now more than 30 days old. How much of a problem is this?\n\n2\\. What could have caused a drop in credit score in the last year?\n\nI moved last year (~Apr\/May) and had applied to a couple of places. One had fallen through (unrelated to the credit check result from the application) but the landlord did send me the credit check report. It looks like it was through TransUnion and at the time it has my FICO score at 763. As I mentioned above, the check from my bank came back with numbers ~700 so I'm stumped as to why it would be so much lower all of a sudden. At the time last year I only had 1 credit card. I've since gotten an Amex (for Costco). I haven't applied for any others. I'm pretty sure I've paid all my CC bills on time and the report from Experian seems to show that as well. What else could be included that would have caused this drop, or am I missing something crucial? Are other bill payments factored into credit score at all (rent\/internet\/etc.)? I had some late payments for my internet package, but that's all I can think of.\n\n3\\. Do soft credit checks affect credit score?\n\nLooking online the answer seems to be No but I just want to confirm. In Aug. 2013 I had applied for an Amazon Visa but got denied because of short credit history (at the time it would have just been 5-6 months). From the Experian report I see a lot of soft checks since then from Chase. At least one every 1-2 months.\n","36":"[H] Steam Wallet [W] 80% value Amazon Credit","37":"Amazon GC for paypal.

So I'm reposting on this account.\n\nAlright, before you downvote on sight because this was already suggested, I know. However, those other posts really only said \"hey, download this cus it's cool, use this code.\" I'm going to go into as much detail I can with my experience.\n\nThis is an app called [Whaff Rewards](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.whaff.whaff). It's for Android devices only. It's sort of like FreeMyApps, where you download an app, try it for a bit, uninstall it, you get credits. It seems like nothing special, but it has a thing called Premium Picks. I'll explain that a bit farther down.\n\nWhen you first open the app, you'll need to sync it with a Facebook account. I would suggest just using some alternate account, as I always would, but it doesn't look like they're doing anything fishy with the information. It doesn't ask for anything too extreme with its permissions. After that, you put in a referral code if you have one. If you have one, it will give you $0.30 and whoever the code belongs to will get $0.30 too. If this post helped you at all, please use my code, which I put at the bottom of this post. \n\nNow you'll be on a screen with a bunch of apps to download. Here's an explanation of each tab\/panel\/whatever you call each swipe thingy:\n\n* **Lucky Picks:** It's basically a raffle for people who use the apps in the list. If you really want to fill your phone up with apps, go for it. However, I recommend you just ignore it.\n* \n**Premium Picks:** This is where you'll be making the most of your money with this app. Each app in this list will have an Install Reward, a Daily Play, and Daily Reward. The Daily Play reward is the greatest thing ever, since you can just put your phone onto 5 minute screen time out, put it to the side while it runs, wait until the screen turns off. In 5 minutes, there's about $0.06 to $0.10 for you. If you do this with every app in the list, you'll be making about $0.60 to $0.80 a day. That, and it's guaranteed that you'll get credits for them.\n\n* **Whaff Picks:** They're your typical \"download, install, use, uninstall\" apps. Some of them are surveys or free trials to random things. Here's one problem though: as opposed to Premium Picks, a lot of them don't give credit. When I first tried them, they worked fine. However, it seems that a majority of the apps in the list just don't give you credits. Best case scenario, you'll get them the next day when you forgot to uninstall it. I would suggest you still give each app a try, because the worst that can happen is that it doesn't give you credits. If it doesn't credit you in an hour, uninstall it or just leave it overnight.\n\n* **Other Picks:** No. Imagine those websites where you click ads, but 10 times slower.\n\n* **Attendance:** It gives you $0.01, and you can press the button once every day. It gives you more Whaff Picks apps to choose from.\n\n* **User Stream:** Basically a stream of other users' earnings. You don't need to use this at all.\n \nNow, for other important details. \n\n1. The amounts labeled in the first picture on the Google Play page is extremely misleading. You're not going to get $0.40 for playing 3 minutes of Clash of Clans every day (frankly, you probably won't even be getting any worthwhile apps to be using, nor any you already use). At most, you'll get around $0.11 a day ($0.10 for daily play, $0.01 just for keeping it installed) for each app.\n\n2. It seems that the amount you get for Daily Play actually increases the longer you use the app. It could be \nconformation bias, but I felt like I should mention it.\n\n3. I have earned $12.76 in total since the beginning of this month, mainly through Premium Picks. However, as of yesterday, I have run out of apps. I'll made an edit later on if I get more, but this is an important point. Please, if you make it to that amount, leave a reply saying if the same thing happens to you.\n\n4. The minimum payout for Amazon or PayPal is $10.50, then the next step up is $20. This is likely to prevent people from getting the lower rewards and go up higher, because I don't know if they (the WHAFF team) keep the extra $0.50 for their own profit.\n\n5. You can redeem your rewards for Google Play, Facebook, Amazon, Xbox Live, Steam, Playstation Store, iTunes, and Paypal.\n\n6. If you're going to do any Whaff Picks, only do the ones that say  \"Install &amp;amp; open app to earn credits.\" or \"Download and START\". They seem to be less suspect of not giving you credits. Things that require you to sign up, get to Level 2, etc. seem to be the main culprits. Again, could be confirmation bias, but it's an important note.\n\n7. Proxies are a no-no. I don't know how well they combat against them, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.\n\n8. Your notification bar will be full of things telling you to use the app. This isn't really a problem, it's just something that comes naturally when you have 10 random freemium games on your phone. \n\nSo in conclusion, I highly recommend this app, even if you'll only be able to make $10 tops. It requires little to no effort on your part, and you don't even need to keep track of some fake information. Yes, Whaff Picks might not be the most reliable thing, but Premium Picks will be great while they last. Thanks for reading.\n\nSo anyways, here's my invite code: **AU01505**. I would really appreciate it if you use that code when signing up. You'll get a head start of $0.30, and I'll be a step closer to a computer mouse that isn't shit.\n\nTL;DR: Whaff is good. Do Premium Picks, moderately do Whaff Picks. You might not be able to progress past $10 with Premium Picks.

It's not exactly proof, but you can at least see I'm not making this all up. http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/R0qxB** \n\n\n\nI'm currently a professional student, engineer, researcher and do these things on the side.  I've been looking for products to buy and then sell for several years. I've tried a lot of different things with mixed success. I'm fairly risk averse, didn't like investing a lot of capital into an idea without proven success, but am almost always willing to give anything a good old college try.  The goal was always to find an item that I could buy low and sell high in massive quantities.  I sell on eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, and my company website (link further down if you're genuinely interested). **I'll do my best to answer any questions with as little secrecy as possible in exchange for feedback on how I can improve my company.** \n\n**I've tried the following ideas and buying and selling the following items with mixed success:**\n\n* freehomespecs.com - an website from ~2003 that was attempting to help house For sale by owners list detailed specifications about their houses where a customer could go to www.freehomespecs.com\/12345 and get all the details they wanted about the house. Started to help sell my family home, then realized that it was better to write articles about and run mesothelioma ads on google Adsense  (before I got banned) and make money that way. Made a few thousand, closed it years ago.\n* Logging, tree removal and firewood sales.  Started when I was 15 and bought a Stihl chainsaw on ebay. Cut down several hundred trees and split most of them with a logsplitter bought from Tractor Supply Co. Cleared a few lots, took down a ton of trees on my highschool and college breaks\/vacations. Sold some off as timber, lots as firewood.  Mostly discontinued due to the nature of my  new career - my hands are extra valuable now. \n* screen protectors  - bought several thousand Iphone 4,5 and GS4\/5 protectors for pennies on the dollar, sold enough  to pay off my postage and purchase cost, ended up with a bunch left over. Source: DHgate.com\n* cell phone cases - again, bought 30-50 knockoff Spiegens and sold them as generic phone cases, yet ebay kept flagging them, so again, made a profit, not worth pursuing. Spent a few hundred bucks and made it back, but not much beyond.  Source: DHgate.com\n* CNC laser cutting business - one of my current side hobbies  - I designed(ish) and built a CNC laser and now sell custom cut stuff on etsy. Looking to use some wordpress experience to build a site to do more custom stuff from. I've been cutting wall art, signs, religious texts (considering some non-religious stuff too) and just general stuff. Here's a small gallery of stuff I've built over the past few weeks. \n\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/zEcsE\n\n\n* hearing protection earmuffs - bought them for $1.99 each, was able to sell for between 8-10 each, with shipping and postage, profit was in the $1-4 range. Not worth it, couldn't scale. Source: http:\/\/www.harborfreight.com\/industrial-ear-muffs-61372.html \n* buying, repairing and selling cars - I've done this with mixed success and ~20 cars over the past 7-8 years. No dealers license, I buy, retitle, repair and resell. Everything from Audis, Lexuses, $380 beaters, and more. Even sold a car back to its original owner once. Not a ton of profit (a grand here or there, but enough to keep me in spending money and an excuse to buy more tools.) I find cars on Craigslist by searching the keywords \"blown engine, head gasket, blown motor, leaks, needs engine, mechanic special, and not running\" and when I find a good deal, I bring cash and buy the car, put it in my trailer (used to rent Uhaul tow dollies) and take it home to fix it.\n* electric toothbrushes - bought over 200 OralB 5000 toothbrushes for approximately $53 each, sold for between 95-105 each. Well worth it, shipping was simple, limited only by the fact I couldn't get more toothbrushes at that price. Source: OralB's student dentist portal. \n* DeWalt 20v power tool combo packs - bought $3500 in combo packs the day after thanksgiving on a tool sale and split them up piecemeal on craigslist and ebay. Netted some credit card miles and profited in the neighborhood of $600 and kept some for myself. Source: HomeDepot and Lowes using 10% off coupon I purchased on eBay. Lots of fun - I love tools and it got me in touch with some interesting people that I could bounce ideas off of. \n\n\n**Finally, what you came for - my biggest successes have been kayaks and stand up paddle boards. This is the short story of taking an idea and running with it.**\n\nBack in Feb 2013 I saw an ad for kayaks priced what I thought was extremely cheap($169+tax, down from a regular price of $259 and an MSRP of $399). I convinced my S.O. to let me purchase 4, attempt to sell 2 and cover most of the cost of us having 2 nice kayaks to use on Sunday afternoons. We purchased them from a local home improvement retailer (Menards) and put 3 in the back of an old minivan and strapped one on the top. I listed them as new with a paddle on Craigslist for $250 each and they were all sold within the week. Remember this is the beginning of March in the Midwest and not exactly prime kayak season. I immediately petitioned my S.O. to buy more, which we did. I bought 12 more, transported them using said minivan, and promptly sold those as well. The sale price ended, going back up to $199. I contacted the manager of the store and asked if he would give me the sale price again if I purchased everything he had left in stock, since they weren't selling very quickly. He eventually agreed, and I had bought out my first store. I went around the Midwest buying out stores using rented UHauls and trailers and racking up lots of credit card miles (using a Chase Ink CC to purchase Home Improvement giftcards at Staples for 5% rewards).\nFrom March to September I sold 402 kayaks with an average selling price of $246 with an average purchase price of about $183. Most of my customers bought 2 kayaks, some 3, and I think the most I sold at once was 6.\nSelling kayaks last summer was one the best training in sales, negotiations, and customer interactions I've ever had. In all, since then I've sold a total of over 650 kayaks. \n\n**As I was selling all of these kayaks, people started asking about standup paddle boards. I couldn't find  a great source for them so I decided to try my hand at the import game.** \n\nAfter some limited market research and finding that SUP was the fastest growing sport in America, I decided that I wanted to start my own line of standup paddle boards and focus on  bringing a good quality board to the US for a reasonable price. The market seemed saturated with absolute garbage that was cheap (inflatable boards and really poor quality walmart stuff) and really high end boards that were quite expensive (&gt;$1500, with not too much in between. The big guys (SUPATX and the like) were still selling boards for $1000+ regularly, with no accessories included). I wanted to hit a target of selling a complete board combo (board, paddle, leash, and finset) for that price or less, delivered. \nI started looking on Alibaba and solicited quotes from about a half dozen of the better vendors I could find. I asked them to quote me a few different boards, queried them about minimum order quantities, etc. I narrowed it down to two and decided to order some samples from one and continue talks from the other. I had a close friend sketch up a logo and we decided to call the company\/brand Skyline Watersports. I then picked and spec'd out a half dozen or so board designs, mostly by picking the best selling boards elsewhere and sticking pretty close to the design, adding logo, color, different deck pad material, etc. I found that everything takes much longer than you anticipate, with the samples not arriving until almost Christmas of 2013. After I got the samples tested in a college pool, I decided to go ahead with an initial order. After computing the container size and pricing, I opted for a run of 150 board, enough to fill a 40' high cube container. I'm skipping over a ton of details here, but after shipping, deck pads, paddles, leashes, tariffs, taxes, duties, shipping stuff, etc, my average cost per board delivered to my storage locker ($200\/month) was still well under $500. \nThere was some concern on my end about wiring the initial 40% to a bank in China. I was really concerned about perhaps being scammed, not knowing if this was all legit, etc. I had a Chinese friend do a lot of research on the company, dug up some cell phone numbers on the internet and called them and apparently got on of the owners on the line. After some tense moments, I got a call from my agent\/rep\/salesperson that said why don't you trust me, my boss was upset, etc. etc. They got the money, started making my boards and then sent pictures throughout the process, putting me at ease. I sold 2 kayaks to the owner of a company that handles logistics of importing things from Asia and he offered to help me with the shipment. They sent reps out to the factory and made sure that there was a container with Skyline paddle boards in it, took a few more pictures, and I sent over the remaining balance.      \n\nWhile this was going on, I purchased www.skylinewatersports.com, added some security certificates, had a friend help me learn a bit of wordpress, and set up a very basic e-commerce site. It takes CC payments, displays my boards, and I openly admit it's not what I want it to be, mostly for lack of proficiency on my part. I started advertising the boards on Craigslist and a bit on facebook and have had moderate success. The boards arrived from Asia late June of 2014. This was unfortunate because I missed the beginning and middle of the season and started from behind. At first most of my sales were from craigslist but they've recently shifted to my website. I'm now split about 50\/50 on craigslist\/website sales with the last 10+ orders being either from Amazon or CL. I listed the boards on Amazon as well, but it kills me to get hit with a $150 fee when I sell a board combo for $999 and then have to ship it as well. \n\nAs demand slowly  picked up, I realized I would need a way to ship the boards so I found a local box manufacturing company that would make me a custom box that was 11'6\" long and super sturdy. My cost per box was about $16, but they're triple wall cardboard and I haven't had a damaged board yet. I started evaluating shipping options and found a decent number of companies but one was located near me and would ship a board in 4-7 business days to most of the US for about $100. All I had to do was box up the board, email for a quote\/shipping label and drop it off at their distribution center about 15 minutes from my house. I do all the packaging myself and it takes me less than a half hour to get, package, and be ready to run the board to the shipping center. \n \nAs 2014 went on, I was steadily selling boards, but not at the rate I'd like to. I've gotten great feedback on the boards, people like the price (especially locals who can get a bamboo board picked up for $850 + tax) and are overall satisfied with their purchase. Since June of last year, I've sold about 60 boards. This may not sound like a ton, but it still represents a monumental amount of effort and learning, and I still consider it moderately successful. I've formed an LLC, worked with many other companies, designed and imported a product, successfuly sold online, etc. I've also realized how much I don't know about SEO, marketing, and getting past the point I'm at now. I know my website kinda sucks and I've been overly dependent on word of mouth and Craigslist to get my products to the masses.  Earlier in this post I mentioned a number of less than $500 per board. In actuality, it's less than $450, and that includes optional board bags that sell for $100 extra, as well as a lot of fees, misc expenses and things that wouldn't be included in the second shipment. The actual cost per board, without a paddle is in the $330 range, with paddles running between $50 and $90. So when I sell a nice painted board (non bamboo, slightly cheaper cost to me) for $999+50 shipping, it represents close to $600 profit. However, when I sell a 11' bamboo board on Amazon for a similar price, pay $150 in fees, $125 in shipping, and pay more for the board, the profit is considerably less.  My warehousing solution is a storage unit near my house and costs me about $200 per month but other than that, my overhead is rock bottom low. \n\n***At the end of the day, I have about 85 boards left (some demos and personal boards, some that were damaged by me, etc) and they're selling steadily, albeit slowly. I haven't ordered a second container yet, but would like to if I could create the demand. Anyways, I know this all was pretty fragmented but it mostly captures the gist of how things went down in a reasonable level of detail. I'm willing to answer pretty specific questions as the level of capital investment to start something like this is &gt;$50,000 and will probably take you close to a year to catch up. I'm very interested in honest constructive feedback and specific suggestions on how I can improve.*** \n\n**So I've found it pretty difficult to stay on top of responding to questions, so here's a few more details and salient points from the comments and answering other questions.** \n\n**Experience** - people ask if I knew a lot about SUP and kayaking. No. I came in cold, learned fast and read widely, talked to experts and asked millions of questions. I literally went paddle boarding 2 days of my college freshman year spring break in Florida. That's all folks. \n\n\n**Sourcing** - I didn't really have a great way to vet suppliers. I mainly went with the best communicators that had good products and had a reasonable price. \n\n**Marketing** - I posted lots of ads on different craigslists manually. It took time and wasn't very effective. I also set up a FB ad campaign to promote demo days where I took the boards out and let people ride for free. All my friends came, nobody from the internet came. \n\n**Keeping expenses low**: One of my personal idiosyncrasies is taking crazy measures to keep my monthly costs down. I hate monthly recurring fees and right now I think all I have is storage locker ($210), Amazon ($40) web hosting (&lt;$10), and that's about it. Other capital expenditures I can think of were a 20' enclosed trailer ($4200 new), a 4x8 trailer ($350), a racecar that I sponsored for a local track (dumb idea, never heard a peep from it) ($250), vinyl banners for the demo days ($95), and about $1500 in cardboard boxes. \n\n**Best\/worst stories** -  A friend was taking a dozen boards to his lake house to demo them with his buddies and try to get some sales. The trailer ended up flipping at 70mph on an interstate at rush hour on a Friday afternoon.  7 boards got some road rash. Nobody got hurt, no police involved, I drove out and met him and we righted the trailer, cleaned up the boards and he ended up going on without the trailer and just took a few boards with him. The trailer was pretty much OK, minus some scuffs and a light broken and that was about it. To date I still have a few scuffed boards and am going to take up fiberglassing when the weather warms up a bit.\n\nWas on a pleasure trip to Philippines and was flying home through China last May. Contacted my suppliers in Shanghai and set up meetings and everything. I was set to go, got into the airport and wasn't allowed into the country because I didn't have the correct paperwork. Something about not being allowed to travel within China without a visa. I was banking on using the 72 hour rule, but that only counts if you're going to travel within a single city. Since I landed in Beijing and was then going to fly to Shanghai, I was traveling in China without a visa and they wouldn't let me through. Ended up having to get on a plane straight back to the US and cancel all my meetings. \n\n**Finally**, I have at least 3 pretty solid other business venture ideas I'm going to write a post on in the next few weeks. As teasers, I'm going to leak that one heavily involves CNC lasers, the second involves design and manufacturing a new product for cordless power tools, and the third is in the plastics industry working with custom plastic blends for 3D printing. \n\nFuture Goals for Skyline Watersports:\n\n* develop a better website \n* develop and implement a marketing plan\n* work with someone to set up an Adwords campaign or work on some marketing stuff\n* add some accessories to the product line \n* work with a few contacts that I have that are interested in becoming small scale dealers (starting with ~10 boards)\n* if demand keeps up, work with a warehousing company I know for them to start boxing and shipping the boards. \n\nThoughts? Questions?\n\nEdit: added links and sources to some of the products I've sold.\n\nEdit2: I'm really hesitant to do this (not trying to use this newfound popularity to sell boards), but if you're interested in doing something along the lines of becoming a dealer or discussing this further, I'm very open to it and welcome a PM. I'll shoot you my email and we can have a discussion in the next few days. I want to make sure that I'm posting quality content, not just trying to sell you all my product. \nEdit3: Added some additional content just before future goals and a photo gallery of some laser cut stuff.

I have been struggling with debt and personal finance since I was 20 years old.  I had kids early, unplanned, which led me to live well beyond my means for many, many years and still do most months.  I want to get off this train so bad but it seems like every time something good happens I sabotage myself by going back in.\n\nFor the record, I'm probably what you would classify as a high earner.  Currently I make around 175k a year.  We pay a mortgage on a modest house worth about 215k.  We also have a second mortgage of about 60k that we took out to pay off bills but then just ran them all up again.  I have over 20 open credit accounts with varying balances and use most of them every month in some way or another.  I play the shell game with 0% interest cards, moving stuff around, bonus comes in, pay a bunch of them down then just start charging them up again.  We currently have around 55k in loans and credit cards.  We don't have car payments, both of them are paid for but they are older cars and both over 100k miles.\n\nWe've robbed ourselves of our 401k several times but currently we're back up to around the 20k mark, I put in enough to get the company match so at least I have that going for me.  We are never late on anything, the couple of times that we've missed payments have been true oversight because there are so many bills to pay.  Every time I have been able to get the fees reversed.  The credit situation is about 650 for me and about 670 for my wife, not good but not bad.  Most creditors say that we have too much credit and balances are too high which is why either denials or requests for more credit are denied.\n\nI am completely knowledgeable about everything regarding our situation.  I have a detailed spreadsheet that I agonize over almost every day and could tell you at a moments notice where we stand.  The crazy thing is that from the outside looking in we are in fine shape.  No one knows our situation, my wife would die if anyone knew so I keep quiet and just keep plugging away.  Every one I talk to seems to be just fine with their finances and no one has any debt, which I realize is probably a lie but not having anyone to talk to about it is probably the worst problem of all.\n\nMy job I guess is relatively secure but as I age I keep thinking that one day this house of cards is going to collapse and I'll be in terrible shape. You would think this would be enough to get me motivated to get out of this hole.  Every month I promise myself that I will make changes but it is not easy.  I guess I am the classic case of always living to the edge of my means since my 20's.  \n\nI probably seem like I'm whining to some of you.  Oh what a terrible problem to have, he just can't manage his money, he is a spend thrift.  Bastard.  I can hear you all now in my head.  I have tried accountability through other forums.  I guess the only thing I really haven't done is go to a shrink and determine just what the hell is really wrong with me and my relationship with money.  I'm actually fearful right now that someone will determine who I am here on Reddit and my secret will be out.\n\nI really don't even know what I expect from this sub that I just started reading a week or so ago.  It seems that most people here are doing great as well, asking about investments and how much money they should have in their emergency funds.  People paying off their houses.  It all just makes me feel even shittier about the situation that I have put myself and my family in.  So I guess my question is, what can I do?  Where do I start?  How do I make progress and not move forward 1 step and then fall 2 back?\n\nedit 1 &gt; High Level Budget\n\nMonthly take home\t$8,500.00\nMortgages\t2400\nHousehold\t1650\nCredit Cards and Loans\t2200\nExpenses\t1750\n\t\nLeftover\t$500.00\n\nin terms of luxury items I'd throw the following into those categories:\n\nMonthly House Cleaning - $99\nSpotify - $11\nNetflix - $9 (We don't have cable TV)\nNew York Times - $20\n\nI put everything into a monthly spreadsheet including upcoming bills so I have a pretty good idea of how much, if any, money is left at the end of a particular pay cycle.

The app has you scan bar codes in select stores and unlock points. Every 250 points equals about a dollar. I was earning $20-30 in gift cards a month, for about 10 minutes of work a day. (You don't necessarily need to go to the store to earn points). After leaving the country for about a year, I completely forgot about the app, and after stumbling upon this fantastic community was instantly reminded of it and have re-downloaded it and signed up again.\n\n\n\nUpon signing up I found that they're running a promo for the new 6 days, were you earn at least 500 points just for installing the app, creating a profile, and scanning your first item. (You can scan ANY item that has a bar code, I used Clorox Wipes I had in my office). That alone good for 500 points, IE: a $2 gift card at Target. Apparently you can earn up to 2500 points for that first scan, I however was not that lucky. \n\n\n\nThey currently offer gift-cards to Target, and if you collect even more points they have gift cards at higher increments to Nike, Redbox, Starbucks, AE, and many other places.\n\n\n\nThe gift cards show up right in your app often times instantly, and at least at Target you have the cashier scan the card on your phone. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately they don't offer Amazon gift cards, which I'd prefer, but I shop at Target enough to make it worthwhile, and I'm pretty sure I could just pick up an Amazon gift card at Target no?\n\n\nREF: [Shopkick](http:\/\/get.shopkick.com\/wedge49136)\n\n\nNONREF: www.get.shopkick.com","77":"Hey guys, looking to get Amazon.

I'm not going to sugarcoat this - it was damn hard and took a ton of trial and error to make $1k and I had multiple failures along the way. Hopefully this will inspire some of you to go for it, for others, hopefully you learn something new about my process and how I did it. I might gloss over a few points so if I leave anything out just leave a reply and I'll come around to clarify. \n\nProof: http:\/\/imgur.com\/N1SGNal\n\n**Who I am**\n\nCollege student. 20 y\/o - no prior knowledge to niche websites, CPC, extremely limited Wordpress experience. I took a intro class to HTML and CSS my Sophomore year and got a B passing grade, so I had decent experience in just that. I learned everything from scratch and trial and error. \n\n\n**Backstory**  \n\nAug 2014 - I stumbled upon www.blackhatworld.com - A undergroundish website where people talk about different ways they make money online. NOTE: Some of the stuff on this website is very unorthodox and might get you banned from AdSense\/Amazon, weed through the crap and you'll find the gems.\n\n I eventually led to a post on that forum by a guy named Bluematter, where he talked about making money with AdSense niche websites (notice this is NOT amazon related, as many others are doing). This post is now deleted I believe, but there is a copy of all of his posts [here](http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/184280158\/Bluematter-PDF#scribd) that you can read through. Everything relating to what niche to choose, to how to do research, to how to monetize is in this thread, me repeating it all will not help you, Bluematter did great. \n\nI started getting heavily involved in keyword research as Bluematter described in his post, as in what makes a good keyword, how much the competition is, and the average CPC of each keyword as well. **I made a massive mistake by not doing enough research and chose an incredibly difficult keyword to rank**, but I didn't give up because I had already bought hosting and the website, so I said \"screw it\" and decided to just work on it anyway. My website and niche is related to providing information to private investigators in order to lookup information about people. All of my articles contain info about people that can be found on the internet using common tools such as Facebook, Google, etc, etc. It's very common sense and very easy to write about. \n\n**Tools I used for keyword research:**\n\n* Google Keyword Planner (so many guides on how to use this, I recommend looking at a guide [like this one](http:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-keyword-planner) to see the layout and how it works\n\n* Spyfu.com - Good for determining CPC and related keywords you can use.\n\nA week later I bought a domain, setup Wordpress, and started writing articles related to my niche. I wrote **one article a day for two weeks** and then after one month I started to monetize using Google AdSense. I placed three ads per page (max amount allowed by Google). My friends said I was an idiot, that \"No-one clicks on ads on the internet\" and that I had wasted my $60 hosting fee for the year. Whatever. I figured it would be cool to say I had a website (nerdy, I know), even if it was about something really random. \n\nFirst week of monetization I made **a whopping $0.56** - parents called me dumb and said to get a real job, friends said \"told ya so\" and went back to playing GTA V. I didn't give up and just kept writing articles... day after day. It was hard writing so much but I got more efficient the more I wrote. \n\n**October 2105**  \n\nI had my first double-digit day, making $10 a single day. At this point I was making roughly ~$50 \/mo from the single website, just from AdSense. I was writing one article a week, and spent about 2hours a week on the site just doing cleanup and fixing spelling errors and whatnot. \n\n**November 2014**\n\nUp to $100\/month - started getting nervous about AdSense being my sole source of side income so I tried to throw in some Amazon affiliate links to products that were *directly related to my niche*. After a week I got a purchase and my **Amazon Affiliate Account was banned because I forgot to include the amazon disclaimer in my privacy policy.** Rookie mistake. I signed up again, cleaned up my privacy policy, and was accepted after a week. \n\n**December 2014**\n\n$175-200\/mo - Amazon Affiliate running smoothly (EDIT: People have pointed out this is confusing, what I meant is that I had finally been accepted by Amazon Affiliate and had a few ads on the site, however 99% of the $200 I made that month still comes from AdSense). Stopped writing articles because I got really lazy. Site continued to make money each day even though I didn't even touch it. I saw no drop in monthly earnings so I got spoiled and decided not to write anything for another month just to see what would happen. To my surprise the site did fine and traffic continued at a steady pace. \n\n**Current Day**\n\nTraffic is strong, over 7k unique visitors a month, averaging about $250\/mo just from AdSense. I've been pushing really hard for Amazon Affiliate - so I have written most of my articles with Amazon links inside. I've started reaching out to industry related websites to see if they would be willing to advertise on the site or allow me to become an affiliate. \n\n**SHAMELESS PLUG TO MY BLOG HERE**\n\nYes I know you all hate blogs. I have a blog. You can read this post I made about how to make a Wordpress website that goes through step by step one of the hardest processes I found beginners have with this process, which is how to actually buy a domain name and get the website up and running. Here it is: [So, you want to make a website](http:\/\/www.wiyre.com\/so-you-want-to-make-a-website-how-to\/). \n\nIf you have questions please ask them. Thanks. \n\n**TLDR: Read an article on a shady website, got really bored and made a website after doing a ton of research, site now lets me play around with an extra $250 per month doing very little. You should try it.**\n","89":"I've been flipping with a partner for a while, and we are now splitting ways.

However, about a day later, you'll get a message saying that your Prime trial has been canceled because you didn't give them a payment method. At this point, you can do the thirty-day trial again pulling the same shit.\n\nNow, I know if you try to pay for an order with a voided card they'll remove it, but I'm assuming that because you didn't agree to put your new card as the payment they can't legally charge it or something.

In fact in America a lot of businesses hang the first dollar they ever earn in a frame on the wall. Now honestly I don't get it, I mean sure it's a milestone and all, but what use is the money if you're not going to spend it. So onto the actual point of this: your first 1 pound (about 1.5 dollars) earned online. It was definitely the hardest \u00a31 I've ever earned.\n\n\nIf you were to work out the time to money ratio of the first \u00a31 I earned online, it's probably be around 5p an hour. Just let that sink it. I would've earned more working an hour at McDonalds than I did my first 20 hours working online. Although the majority of my time was spent researching hundreds of different ways to make money online.\n\n\nSo how did my experience go? Well I started out on Survey sites, now at this point I was a complete fool when it came to earning money online. I saw an advert saying Local mum of 3 earns \u00a3350 an hour doing surveys online, and I believed it. I genuinely thought that some company would pay \u00a3350 for an hour of my time. Wow was I wrong. The first site I signed up for was Swagbucks, it seemed really fun and welcoming and I enjoyed seeing all this new stuff. As soon as I signed up I got 20 free points, which is the equivalent to around 7 pence. This excited me, If I could earn that much just by signing up, imagine how much I could earn by actually doing work.\n\n\nThis is when the surprise came, I spent an hour or so filling out my information, everything from my living arrangement to my dog's name. Then once I'd finished that, I was told I had qualified for a survey, \"Great\" I thought, I was told I could earn up to 1000 Swagbucks for  every survey I did. So i went to the survey and filled out every question as accurately as I could, I spent 4 or 5 minutes on some questions, just make sure the information was 100% accurate then after 25 or so questions and 2 hours of my time, do you know what I got? denied.\n\n\nI thought I'd finished the Survey, when I got told that everything I had just written was just the qualifier and I had failed for some reason completely out of my control. It was fine though, because they compensated me 3 Swagbucks for my time. They literally said that the 2 hours of my life I spent filling out ther \"qualifier\" survey was worth the equivalent of a penny. One pence. At a \"real\" job I could earn that much in the time it takes me to sneeze.\n\n\nThis was a real blow to my confidence, I decided to go sleep early and wake up tomorrow, less sad about the life. The next day I came across the video section of Swagbucks. I was amazed at the fact that I could get paid to watch videos, so I spent the next 5 hours or so watching videos on this website. Looking back I realize just how mind numbingly boring the videos were, but at the time I didn't know what \"enjoyable\" online videos were, so I just took it for what it was.\n\n\nOnce I'd finished watching all the videos, I decided it was time to cash out my earnings.

But my old phone broke and as of a month ago they changed their rules to only support phones that I buy from them, and those phones are overpriced and have terrible reviews on Amazon. Now I'm looking around for another provider and the cheapest I can find is $35 a month per line, with a package of way more minutes than we would ever use. Can anyone suggest an alternative service?

This weekend I decided to take the plunge, all in, and created the site. Hopefully I can inspire and help some of you guys out there on the fence to give it a shot. My aim for this post is to \n\n1)\tGive you a look at all the aspects of creating the site (hosting, domain etc.)\n\n2)\tActually creating the site (themes, wordpress, plugins etc.)\n\n3)\tSetting up Google Webmaster tools, Google Analytics etc.\n\n4)\tCreating content\n\n5)\tDetailing all the costs\n\nI\u2019ll go through all these steps in \u201cPhases\u201d, just as I went through them when I was creating the site. If you see a gap of how I went from Phase 1 to Phase 2 or anywhere in between let me know and I\u2019ll try to fill the gap. I want to throw as much knowledge as I can on here to help some budding entrepreneurs.\n\n**Pre-Phase: Background**\n\nI am a college student with an interest in e-commerce and entrepreneurship. Before this I had no experience with hosting, domains, wordpress or web creation in general. You can look at my post\/submission history and see that I\u2019ve been asking for quite a bit of help and advice (and that\u2019s okay!). I probably could\u2019ve avoided the majority of the mistakes I made if I did some google searching. Alas, I\u2019m the type of person who would rather learn as I go and take the hits and get back up. I just really wanted to make something out of nothing and see where I could take it.\n\n**Pre-Phase 2: Finding a Niche**\n\n\u2022\tIn my opinion this might be the most time consuming and tedious process. The way I found my niche was pretty clich\u00e9. I thought to myself, \u201cWhat is something that I use every day?\u201d \u201cWhat is something I know a little about?\u201d I ended up settling with fitness and headphones. I am passionate about fitness because it is something that has become a part of my life (look way back in my post history) and headphones are something I use every time I go out for a run or hit the gym to lift weights. I decided to sell the headphones aspect of my niche for obvious reasons (small, medium-priced, keywords, accessibility). For a more in depth write up in choosing a niche take a look at u\/humblesalesman post. At the end of the day, no matter what niche you choose, the process of making your site successful are very similar.\n\n**Phase 1: A Domain**\n\n\u2022\tWhat I did here was I simply googled, \u201cregistering domain.\u201d Which brought up 100\u2019s of different links to sites that are available to register your domain. My domain name was not a result of keyword searches (which you should do) but a merger of my niche.\n\n\u2022\tA more methodical way of choosing a domain name is to go on expireddomains.net and search for keywords pertinent to your site. Then, looking for domains that have backlinks and are relatively clean.\n\n\u2022\tOverall, the actual process of getting a domain is easy once you find the company you want to use. I settled on one that cost $0.99 for the first year. Once you have your domain, you\u2019re ready to move on to a host.\n\n**Phase 2: Ok, so I have a domain, now what?**\n\nAlright, so many of the posts on Reddit focus on (and do a really good job at) explaining how to choose a niche and how to get the affiliate process started in general. Therefore I\u2019m not going to spend a whole bunch of time covering it, instead I\u2019m going to go through the process of choosing a host, registering a domain and setting the foundation of your site. What I write here is by no means the \u201conly way\u201d to do things, a google search will probably bring up 10\u2019s perhaps 100\u2019s of different ways to find a host for an affiliate site etc. I will cover what worked for me and what I found to be the easiest way to do things.\n\n\u2022\tI knew I wanted to start an Affiliate site, which left me with the question \u201cwhere do I start.\u201d A few of the very helpful posts I found on Reddit say that \u201cyou need a host,\u201d OK. After, googling for about 30 minutes I find that a very efficient way to do this is by choosing a host that is \u201coptimized\u201d for WordPress. In simple terms, what I found that to mean is that, you can set-up install WordPress by simply clicking one button. I settled on Site Ground, but there are many other hosting companies that offer integration of WordPress. Too find a list of them a simple google search of \u201chosting for wordpress\u201d will give a good set of links that detail the bevy of different companies that off easy wordpress hosting.\n\n\u2022\tThe process was simple, the registration was straightforward. I settled on the cheapest plan, because for now that\u2019s really all I need. Total costs for domain were: $49.26 (for one year).\n\n**Phase 3: Domain, check. Host, check. WordPress?**\n\n\u2022\tWordPress seems to be the go to for Amazon Affiliate site and blogs. What is WordPress? WordPress will be the engine of your website. It is how you will make new posts, create pages and ultimately make money.\n\n            \uf0a7\tFor this section I will focus how I did it with my host, and I would imagine it\u2019s a pretty similar process with other hosts.\n\n\u2022\tSince we (I) choose a WordPress friendly host the \u201cinstallation\u201d of WordPress was very easy. All I had to do is go to my website\u2019s CPanel and scroll to their \u201cInstall WordPress\u201d option and with one click my site \u201chad\u201d WordPress. Going to my site landed me on a landing page for WordPress, at that point you are in business.\n\n\u2022\tMy host allows me to sign-up for a WordPress when installing it on my website. It was an easy and streamlined process.\n\n**Phase 4: WordPress and setting the foundation of people are going to see.**\n\n\u2022\tFirst thing I did was head to TailorBrands.com to create a logo for my website. I\u2019ve been reading that creating a nice, professional and presentable logo will help you convert. I heeded that advice and created the logo you now see on the site. I opted to purchase the high-quality version of my logo. The total cost of this was: $24.00. This is not absolutely necessary but makes your site aesthetically pleasing.\n\n\u2022\tNext, a very important step in the process is choosing a theme. Like other successful associates here, the easiest way to do this is to simply to google \u201cbest wordpress themes.\u201d I did just that but filtered it by date. Looking at only blogs\/sites that have posted the best wordpress themes in the past month. I like the unexperienced person that I am, decided to buy a theme that in retrospect was a bit of a waste. [**MISTAKE 1]** I could\u2019ve easily saved that money and put it to better use but that\u2019s a lesson I had to learn the hard way. My theme cost: $47.00. The way I chose my theme was very lay, I saw one I liked, and chose it. There are themes out there optimized for AA sites, which again, probably would\u2019ve been better but I\u2019m going to stick with what I had because it cost money. Do research, find one you like, good to go.\n\n\u2022\tSomething else I wished someone else compiled was a list of plugins that would make my site better and more efficient. A quick refresher, plugins are \u201cprograms\u201d you can install on your WordPress admin page that can do a variety of different things (display ads, SEO etc.) they are very useful. Here is my list of plugins that I have installed on my site and that I find to be very useful. I\u2019ll go in depth about what each one does in a later post, for now, if you want a greater in-depth explanation feel free to ask!\n\n1. Auto Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n1. CommentLuv\n1. Hello Bar (Official)\n1. Google Analytics by Yoast\n1. Login LockDown\n1. Quick Adsense\n1. TablePress\n1. WordPress Database Backup\n1. WordPress SEO\n1. WP Super Cache\n\n\n\u2022\tI also signed up for an AdWords account to advertise my website. Google has a promotion for new account to earn $75 in credit after you spend the first $25. It credits your account once you reach $25 dollars, then you have $50 worth of advertising money. In my campaign I spent a total of $107.87 with a credit of $75, I spent a total of: $32.85. Looking back I should have saved this money for when my site was more developed. Though it did give me traffic, it wasn\u2019t not worth the conversion it provided me.\n\n**Phase 5: The technical schtuff**\n\n\u2022\tGoogle has created a host of very useful software to analyze the traffic that is coming to your website. Google Analytics and Google Webmaster are two very powerful ways to monitor your sites growth and operation. As with most things Google, registration and set-up are straightforward. In an over-simplified manner, Google Analytics will allow you to keep track of the visitors of your site. Information like country of the user, time spent on site, bounce rate will be delivered. Google Webmaster Tools will allow you to submit sitemaps and optimize how you\u2019re site on the net. I am still learning about these, but as a I nice primer I wanted to add this section in.\n\n\n**Phase 6: Content Creation**\n\n\u2022\tChances are you know that content is king. I\u2019m not going to reiterate the same advice because it\u2019s true. Your chances of being ranked on google, having your site indexed and ultimately drawing steady and return traffic depend on what you put on your site. That\u2019s why I chose the niche that I did, I already have interest and experience on what I\u2019m trying to sell. I enjoy writing and this has given me a medium to practice my writing and has been a nice side effect of starting this venture.\n\n**Phase 7: Money, Money, Money**\n\n* Total Costs\n\n        \uf0a7\tRegistering Domain: $0.99 (one year)\n        \n        \uf0a7\tHosting: $49.26 (one year)\n        \n        \uf0a7\tLogo: $24.00\n        \n        \uf0a7\tTheme: $47.00\n        \n        \uf0a7\tAdvertising: $32.85\n\n\u2022\tTotal Revenue (thus far)\n\n        \uf0a7\tAmazon Ad fee: $0.84 (one sale through my link)\n\n\u2022\tNet Revenue\n\n        \uf0a7\tDebts: -154.10\n        \n        \uf0a7\tAd Fees: +0.89\n        \n        \uf0a7\tTotal Net Revenue: -$153.21\n\nAs you can see I still have a lot to make up before I can turn a profit.\n\n**Phase 8: Where am I at now?**\n\n\n\u2022\tI have small twitter presence that I am trying to expand\n\n\u2022\tMy goal is to write at least one article per day\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m trying to improve my SEO and search engine ranking\n\n\u2022\tI have submitted my application for AdSense as another way to monetize my site as traffic increases.\n\n\u2022\tSince I have stopped my ad campaign I am focused on organic growth, the reason for starting a campaign was to see what would happen if I started channeling traffic to the site. At least in my experience it wasn\u2019t very fruitful\n\nAs you can see, you can\u2019t really mark this as a success, yet. I just wanted to share my experience in this as it will probably help some of those of you out there who are thinking about starting an affiliate site. As of now I can say that it is not easy and will require time to nurture and grow, at least at the start. From my readings, it gets significantly easier after you get the ball rolling and that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for. I\u2019ll post more over specifics as I learn more about them, as for now, if you have any questions, any mistakes or any comments please let me know. I want to help the community that helped me get off the ground! \n\nsite: http:\/\/thebestrunningheadphones.com","137":"Hey, so as the title says, I have a 30$ Amazon gift card but I'd prefer cash, so I'm trading for a 25$ Google Wallet transfer.","138":"Hey guys, looking to get Amazon.

When I do function, I'm a superstar and have literally made millions. But alone, I have trouble even caring for myself. Almost all my money is now gone and I'm starting over with some cash on hand and some sellable products on hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find the right person?\n\n\n\n\n**My skills and expertise:**\n\n\n\n\n* Identifying a product niche.\n* Developing the product.\n* Getting the product made.\n* Selling and signing up distributors to buy and carry our products.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What I need someone else, or more than one person, to do:**\n\n\n\n\n* Chat with me daily or multiple times per day to plan my\/our next steps and our strategies\n* Bookkeeping\n* Web stuff (handle Shopify, Amazon, Stripe, etc.)\n* Read and post on related forums (example: if we made audio equipment, read and post on stereophile, electronics, and home theater forums)\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**LONGER VERSION:**\n\nI have a successful background developing physical products in one specific category. \n\nAbout 15 years ago I used a few thousand dollars to start a company that grossed over $800,000 its first year at 40% cost of goods sold, very low non-recurring costs, and very low operating costs. Soon after, I was wooed by a large company to sell out to them, integrate my products into their line, and come aboard to turn around their sales and existing products. Which I did.\n\nI grew the company greatly and made lots of money for myself (because of my compensation package) and them. They soon went public, and I was ousted (although I did leave with a lot of money), and we both suffered dearly for it.  The company and I lost out on a great situation, since my skills and knowledge, combined with their company, were a great match. Without each other, we both paid a heavy opportunity cost of how much more we could have been making.\n\nI took the very lucrative opportunity to try out a *totally* different realm than my past. I'll sum it up by saying I again made great money, but it didn't last forever.\n\nI don't want to get into my traumatic experience(s) as they are irrelevant. Please don't thank me for my service as I was\/am an American civilian getting paid; I was not obligated out of military duty.  \n\nAfter the traumatic event(s), my marriage of over 20 years ended and with it went all, and I mean ALL the money and assets.\n\nAt present I need an employee\/right hand man, or a partner. As long as another person is present for me to interact with (even by phone), I'm totally functional. If they weren't told, they'd be unaware I'm a PTSD sufferer because I'm only dysfunctional when alone. \n\nI already have products developed and have inventory on hand (at home) but my PTSD stops me from going live.  \n\nI know these products will sell for 2 reasons: 1) This is what I do. I've made millions knowing the market, understanding the customer, and making it happen. It's no different than Kobe knowing he can get the ball in the hoop, or U2 knowing they can make a hit album.\n\n2 ) On days when I've happened to muster functionality on my own, I have tested these products in the market. I have sent samples to multiple distributors, who then each begged me via email for months to sell them a batch. But alone, my symptoms have prevented me from acting on it.\n\nHad I had another person (employee or partner) to team up with (meaning, talk to daily about events and discuss next steps, such as \"Ok, tomorrow, I'll ship 5 to _____.\"), I would have simply taken the orders and started shipping product.\n\nBut at present I'm like the rock star or actor who locks himself in his mansion and neglects everything from personal hygiene to mail and phone calls, ordering pizza late at night, until his trusty manager\/right hand man, or even just a friend, shows up.\n\nOnce that person arrives, I am able to act. I suddenly feel the chains are off, and I'm able to think clearly.\n\nI quickly clean up, straighten up my house and affairs, and am able to put in work on anything, way past when others are exhausted. \n\nI also am able to perform at that at which I'm a superstar. I can make millions and handsomely pay those with whom I'm teamed up (meaning either employees, partner(s), or shareholders), and I have done so in the past.\n\nPost-divorce I now have only a few thousand dollars left (sounds crazy, but it even happens to Hollywood celebrities who have made far more money than I ever did), and no longer have the money to hire my former right hand man. \n\n\n**MY QUESTION:** How do I find a good fit of a right hand man \/ worker \/ partner to do the things I'm weak on, and also just have a teammate?\n\nThank you so much.

This is 4% better than the 56% forecasted at the end of last year. The company attributes this growth to growing expansion of the business and brand, an uptick in new customers who are discovering Stand Up Paddle boarding, and a strong boost in online sales. Final revenue from Amazon sales increased 73% year over year while eBay was even stronger coming in with a 109% increase over 2013.\n\nFirst quarter of 2015 is continuing the trend in growing online sales. Both sales on Amazon and eBay are up 78% at the midpoint of Q1 compared to the same time period in 2014.\n\n\"We are proud of what we accomplished in 2014,\" commented Frank Ornelas, CEO of Vitamin Blue. \"We plan on adding new channels and opportunities in the next several months to help us keep the foot on the gas in successfully continuing to drive even higher online sales in 2015.\"","171":"Hi all. Sorry for the somewhat throwaway account but I don't really want this information out there under my main account. I'm 25 years old and my wife is 43 (que any questions...) We have a 14yr old from her side obviously. I'd like to get our finances in order. We definitely don't hurt for money but we're not exactly stable or future-proof.\n\nIncome: Between the two of us we take home about $8,000\/mo after taxes, health care, dental, etc. Additionally, we get $400\/mo child support and I often get some extra money from freelance but I don't like to budget that or count it towards anything. It usually just gets spent on my hobby.\n\nRetirement: We both work for the state of Florida so we have the FRS plan. I've been in for around six years and my wife a bit longer. We don't contribute anything more than what we're required and we don't have any other sort of retirement planned.\n\nSavings: $1200\n\nCollege for Kid: We have the 2+2 tuition plan for Florida Prepaid College and it's paid off.\n\nMortgage (mortgage + home &amp; flood insurance + property taxes): $1320\/mo or ~17% of take home.\n\nCars (just the two loans for purchase, no lease): $795\/mo or ~10% of take home.\n\nWe have a VISA credit card with a $1500 credit limit. I use it routinely but pay it off every paycheck -- haven't paid a penny in interest. I know my credit score is upper 700s and my wife upper 600s.\n\nMonthly budgeted bills:\n\nMortgage $1320\n\nTruck $410\n\nCar $385\n\nElectric\/Sewage $250\n\nCell Phones $190\n\nCar Insurance $185\n\nInternet &amp; Home Phone: $115\n\nTimeshare Mortgage (to be paid off next month -- been chipping away at it... my wife had it before we met, 18% interest!!): $120\n\nStudent Loan (~5-6% interest, around $5000): $100 (minimum payment $66)\n\nMattress Loan (interest free): $100 (minimum payment $80, $100 required to pay off in promotional period)\n\nSignature Loan for a Pool (~9-10% interest, ~$7000 balance): $350\n\nAmazon Credit Card (interest free): $200 (minimum payment $25, $200 required to pay off in promotional period)\n\nTotal budgeted bills that I am making with no issue: $3725 or 47% of take home. I don't count income from freelance or child support here. The money from child support is essentially spent -- after a year of debating priorities (wife likes to travel, I do not), we agreed she could have the $400\/mo to travel and do as she wants with it.\n\nThe rest of the money gets spent on hobbies, food, entertainment, shopping, etc.\n\nBasically I'm looking for a direction here. I know I'm supposed to have a savings of some sort. I know I'm supposed to be investing. I know I'm supposed to be doing \"extra\" for my retirement. I don't know how or what, though. What I have been doing is targetting some of those monthly bills. I like to purchase tools on my Amazon CC interest free. The last time I paid off the card I took the $250 monthly payment from it and put it towards the PITA time share that I hate so much. It will be paid off next month. Then I plan on taking the $250 + $120 time share payment and putting it towards my signature loan, which is the next highest interest bill. The current $200\/mo Amazon bill will get added in here as well at some point, but that's not for another 10 months or so. I don't know if I should stop after the pool or attack my student loan at ~5.5% interest, or even go further after that and hit our car\/truck loans at 3.25-4.25%.

And I would like to add some more information, tips and a few other things about this forum. Forgive me for any mistakes made, grammer, words or any others and point them out.\n\n**What is FormCoin?**\nForumCoin is a forum that rewards you in ForumCoin's for hanging out at the forum, earning in the form of ForumCoin's and exchanging them for real world money, Paypal, Amazon, domain names, hosting, etc.\n\n**How should I join this site**\nWell, if you decided to join this site before reading the wall of text below, you can proceed. I provided this for those people who read this wall of text already, hate reading :P, or any other reasons.\n\nBut I will be very appreciated if you can spend some time reading those below.\n\nHere are the links, I hope you could use the ref link but its fine to use the non ref-link. Your preference :) :\n\n[Ref Link](http:\/\/forumcoin.com\/index.php?r=295)\n[Non-Ref link](http:\/\/forumcoin.com)\n\n**What will we cover here**\n* About the forum\n* How to earn ForumCoins\n* What to not do in ForumCoin\n\n**About the forum**\nForumCoin as it name says, it is a forum. That means asking things, opinions, discussing. But it also rewards you for posting and doing things around the forum which is in ForumCoin's, and you can exchange them for rewards.\n\n**How to earn ForumCoins?**\nThere are four top methods for earning ForumCoins.\n\nYou can earn ForumCoins by:\n\n* **Posting and creating threads**, this is the most common way to earn but it is also the slowest. But you should try to post quality content. For example: Instead of posting \" Thanks \", you should try to post \" Thank you for giving me the information about \"\".\n\nHere is a copy-past of text from [here](http:\/\/forumcoin.com\/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=108), i'm sorry if this is not allowed and point me out, all credits of this reward chart goes to Fergal, the site admin.\n\n* Forum Set-up, Management and Admin: 5 ForumCoin per topic and per post\n* Webmaster Questions &amp; Discussion: 5 ForumCoin per topic and per post\n* Forum and Webmaster Industry News: 5 ForumCoin per topic and per post\n* Off Topic - Everything Else: 3 ForumCoin per topic and per post\n* New Member Introductions: 5 ForumCoin per topic and 2 ForumCoin per post\n* Posts in other forum sections also reward ForumCoin, but in smaller amounts, generally 1 or 2 ForumCoin per post and per topic.\n\n*  **Doing stuff and work for other people's**. You work for other's like doing a simple advertisement or graphics design, uploading image to a image hosting site etc. This rewards you a lot ForumCoin's, however some may require some skills.\n\n* **Participating in ForumCoins giveaways.** Each day, the forum administrator rewards user's for posting in a specific thread or doing a specific activity. A few examples are posting in a specific thread, using Alexa toolbar to view the site and take a screenshot.\n\n* **Referring people** By referring a people, and that people have made at least 20 posts on ForumCoins, you earn 25 ForumCoins. This is not a lot but a little stacks up. :)\n\n**Do's and Dont's**\nThere are a few things you should do and not do on ForumCoins.\n\n**Do**\n\n* Post quality content\n* Read the FAQ, Rules\n* Be comfortable around the forum\n* Be respectful to the others\n\n**Don't**\n\n* Spam\n* Post malicious links\n* Post for rewards ( This is a site which rewards you for posting, however, you should not post to get rewards intentionally. This will reduce the overall quality of the reply on the forum )\n\nThanks for reading this long thread. I hope you will have a nice day today. If you do join the site I wish you a warm welcome.

I will be in Vegas today through Tuesday at the trade show.  I am actually meeting another Redditor there that I met last year.  Last year I met a guy from \/r\/Entrepreneur and then we met up at this trade show in Vegas (July Show).  Ever since then we email back and forth weekly, throw around ideas, and share the same contacts.  We are meeting again at this trade show and then actually going to Canton Fair together next month.  Just thought I would throw it out there if any other Redditors want to meet up in LV over the next 3 days, I will be available.  I am going to this show to meet some contacts I already work with and to get new product ideas.  I import products from China and sell them on Ebay, Amazon, and other MPs.  The trade shows I have been to are listed below.\n\n*  ASD Las Vegas -  This show happens every March and August.  It is one of the biggest general good shows in the US.  They have some name brands, a huge e cig section, a section for China exporters, and some US closeout companies.  I enjoy the show and always walk away with 5-10 new contacts.  Show is free.\n\n*  Orgill Show Orlando (Feb) and New Orleans (August) -  I went to this show for the first time last week.  It is a show put on by a distributor (Orgill) and there are crazy promos at the show.  The only issue is you must have an Orgill account which also requires a storefront.  I could have easily bought 200K worth goods that sell very well online.\n\n*  Home and Housewares Show Chicago -  This show is in March.  It is 90% big brand US companies.  It is a very big show.  It may be hard to navigate if you are just a small online seller.  The show has become a bit of a pissing contest.  Companies like Hoover and Dyson show up, build a booth with walls and literally will not let people in without an invite.  For this reason, I skipped it the last 2 years but am going back this year to see what I missed.  There are people there to do business with but just because you see a big brand like Sodastream or Keurig, does not mean they will talk to you or sell to you - I can all but guarantee they will not.\n\n*  Catalyst by Channel Advisor -  This is a good show.  They have speakers from all the big Ecomm companies and it is easy to actually get 1 on 1 time with CEOs and higher ups at these companies.  This show is every April and cost over 800.00.  The booths at this show are all software and tech related so you can checkout freight forwarders, inventory software, and other tools that help you streamline your Ecomm company.  This show can get a little crazy.\n\n*  Global Sources Electronic Show -  This show is every June in Miami.  I have only been once and I went because it is close to where I live and it's Miami.  This is a smaller show and 99% exporters from China.  They have more than just electronics though.  This show can easily be walked in 1 day.  It is easy to make deals at this show if you are already importing.  Also may be a good show for a first timer that would be overwhelmed at the bigger shows.\n\nThe above shows are the only ones I have been to.  This year I am looking to go to IRCE and an affiliate show.  If anyone has been to one and has any advice, I would appreciate it.\n\n","225":"[H] $30 Amazon.com credit [W] $25 Paypal","226":"I love price matching!

Rent came out to be around $800-$900\/month per room. There were 4 rooms\/apartment. You had a kitchen. Same going home on breaks and car points apply.\n\n3. Live in off-campus student housing. Pay around $600-$650 to share an apartment with 3 others. These apartments tended to have very high crime rates and lots of bugs\/noise issues. There were shuttles to take you to class, but they were irregular. Still need a car to get anywhere else. You have a kitchen. With these you can usually stay year round. \n\n4. Live in a non-student apartment. Pay around $450-$800\/month depending on how many people you live with. You get a little more privacy. These tended to be safer and cleaner. You will need a car to get anywhere. Obviously you can stay year round.\n\n5. Live in an off-campus house. Pay $200-$500\/month in rent. Once again, you need a car. You'll have a kitchen, more privacy, and can live there year round.\n\nThe biggest advantage to having a kitchen is that you can save some serious cash cooking for yourself. Rice, beans, potatoes. When I was in college I could feed myself on $150\/month. I brought lunches to school on days when I had to be on campus around lunch time. \n\nBasically my biggest point here is to research what living is like at your school. At my school, it was MUCH more frugal to live off campus in non-student housing of some sort. You really couldn't get by without a car anyways, so that additional cost was not significant, and being able to work during breaks can make a huge difference (instead of having a job at school and a job at home). It also encourages you to take more classes during the summer which helps you graduate faster. All of my friends who went home for every break and most weekends are still in school and on average seem to be in more debt. ","283":"We cut the cord last July and have had no regrets.

Read the end for edit on sensitivity. \n\nCrest whitening strips would be the most frugal option but the result would depend on how white you want your teeth and if you have any filling in your front teeth. \n\nFillings do not whiten so if you were to whiten your teeth and you have big fillings, they would stay the same color so if you whiten several shades lighter the fillings would be noticeable. \n\nThe two things that determine how white your teeth get are contact time and concentration. \n\nI would not recommending on using a very concentrated product(eg 20% carbamide peroxide) because they leave your teeth very dehydrated and sensitive. Sensitivity that comes with whitening sucks because no meds will really help. \n\nStandard dentist office whitening uses a 10% carbamide peroxide gel and are used with a custom tray overnight. I would not recommend on using crest strips for very long time because since they simply use a strip and not a custom tray, the material can get on your gums to cause irritation and also the gel will leak out and cause you swallow it. \n\nThe most frugal option might be to ask dentist for a prescription version of crest whitening strips called crest white strips professional strength that you an find on Amazon. They produce a better result than regular strips. \n\nLastly, whitening tooth pastes and mouth rinses do very minimal. Do not expect them to noticeably whiten your teeth if your teeth were not white to start out with. They are fairly good for upkeep but definitely not to white. \n\nEdit: if you experience sensitivity go get some sensodyne and apply a pea sized amount across all your teeth and leave it on all day and all night while you sleep.

I think a lot of people are more comfortable buying high dollar items off of Amazon, though. Check out Camelcamelcamel.com to see more information about selling frequency.\n\nIf I were you though, I'd sell locally. Assume that at least 15% of the final selling price is going to be eaten up in fees with whatever venue you choose... 15% of $400 is $60. That's a lot, when you could just do it yourself. Additionally, there is a high-ish scam risk on eBay with Apple products. There's a risk on Craigslist of getting stabbed, but if you do the transaction at a police department, that risk greatly diminishes.\n\nLastly, if you're absolutely set on selling online, I'd use a service like swappa. I've never used it, but I hear that it's free for the seller, and costs $10 per device for the buyer. It looks like they're going for $399 over there.","297":"Amazon adjusted their API about a year ago. Every 3rd party scanning app basically feeds you the same information. Much of the love\/hate will boil down to these few choices:\n\n1. Fees associated with the app\/service\n2. Your font preference\n3.

I use IL as my processing and reporting suite and the app is a value add. The only time I will not use it is when I am checking restrictions on certain listings. I will use the Amazon Seller app for this.\n\nAll apps will suffer the same pitfalls of misreporting, lack of data, etc. It all depends on where you want your money to go.

If you like to just sit and watch the random shows instead of marathoning Family Guy, check out your local TV lineup.  One of the local channels here plays 2 episodes each of Family Guy, King of the Hill, American Dad, and Cleveland Show starting at 9pm.  \n\nThere's also a new service called Sling TV.  It's $20 a month and is live television.  It includes Cartoon Network\/Adult Swim and is supposed to include AMC \"soon\" - though I don't know what soon means, exactly.

","337":"Have Amazon","338":"I am a CC for all purchases person, and the pursuit of \"good or perfect Credit Cards\" is one I have been on for years. I can share my opinion.\n\nFor starters, rewards come in typically 2 ways. Cash back (or store credit for specialty cards), or points. I had\/have a points card that is just too difficult to actualize any value out of. I only recommend cash-back cards (or frequented stores Credit Back). Otherwise you tend to be looking to find what you can use your points on and getting things you probably wouldn't have spent normally. \n\nCompanies that offer Credit Cards should still be rated higher than the reward themselves. If you have problems, or start getting hit with fees from annoying company practices then that eats up the small purchase margin of rewards you get effectively negating the rewards. \n\nFor starters I would recommend a basic 'Cash back' on all purchases (usually 1%) from your trusted back (I prefer Credit Unions almost exclusively). This can get you some rewards on any and all purchases and hopefully stay hassle free. Great blanket purchase rewards cards that allow straight cash back instead of specialty cards store credit are ideal IMHO. This uses the reward to lower the cost of purchases made instead of facilitating new purchases.\n\nSecond I would recommend one specialty card (Amazon, Old Navy\/Banana Republic etc.) where you ALREADY are spending your money. These rewards cards will typically max at around 5% of purchases (and give credit to their stores) when used AT their respective establishments. 5% seems to be the highest reward amount and only on specific purchases, never all purchases. So getting a card where you perhaps spend the most can leverage this specialty reward effectively. You will usually only get 1% from regular purchases elsewhere (not at their establishment) so the general 1% card recommended previously would probably be preferred for non establishment purposes (to lower the costs of general purchases). I recommend getting for a place you have to, or need to spend money instead of a place you spend electively to maximize the reward and honor a frugal mindset.\n\nAnything that offers 1% blanket AND other higher discounts is probably an above average card worth looking into. For example I had a Credit Union card that gave cashback 1% across the board, 2% on groceries, or 5% gas. I have not seen one better since, and that card is no longer. \n\nThe amazon card is pretty good if you put a lot of money through amazon, but the bonus of that card comes from spending AT Amazon (5%). Otherwise it is like a general cashback card that can ONLY be spent at Amazon. Still usable, but for all non Amazon purchases you should be able to get 1% Cash back instead of 1% Store Credit.\n\nMy 2 cents. :)","339":"You could try QuickRewards, it's a site that sends you surveys to your email according to your profile. I usually do two surveys a day that pay $0.75 each. You can cashout in Amazon gift cards or in PayPal with cashouts as low as $0.01 and within 24 hours. \n\nQuickRewards [[Ref](http:\/\/quickrewards.net\/?r=danzchief) | [Non-Ref](http:\/\/quickrewards.net\/)] ","340":"I just started\/launched my Amazon Affiliate and would love some feedback!

You can redeem the cash back as either a statement credit or a credit towards any Sallie Mae loans  \n5.  Do not need to have any student loans to apply for\/qualify for it.  \n\nI easily spend $250\/month on Gas, and another $250\/month on groceries so it's pretty much a guaranteed $25\/month back.

Good luck.","346":"Amazing post. \n\nAdvice I guess:\n\nTypically you're supposed to spend 10-12% on advertising. You've made alot of profit so yeah you need to start using it on advertising and making your site look cool. How come you didn't just get a theme? http:\/\/themeforest.net\/\n\nAmazon is great for traffic and all but think about it, they're charging you $150 fee per sale. Instead of selling on Amazon you could use that 150 bucks on advertising and I bet for that 150 bucks you're paying Amazon in fees, you could use that on advertising and gain at least 3 more customers [this is assuming that it'd cost you 50 dollars to acquire each customer].\n\nStart an instagram. Look for some cool watersport related IG accounts with alot of followers and use the pictures they have as a reference for how you should take your pictures: https:\/\/instagram.com\/realwatersports\/\n\nThen follow this guy's guide to gain followers:\nhttp:\/\/austenallred.com\/user-acquisition\/book\/chapter\/instagram\/\n^^ quick, easy, and simple to setup [should take no more than 30min].\n\nInvest in making your product and site look more appealing. \n\nIm not an adwords guru by no means so take this next advise with a grain of salt. The keyword \"SUP\" ~50,000 times a month and there aren't any ads running for it currently. But \"stand up paddle board\" is searched for ~22,000 times a month and there are 6 ads for it. Idk how to properly assess what's going on there but it's something to look at. Also look at the keyword \"stand up paddle\". The cpc for that term SUP was like $2. So let's say you take that 150 in fees Amazon is taking from you and you use it for an adwords campaign for  the SUP keyword. That means you should get 75 clicks onto your site and if you just sell 1 board from that you would have ben better off doing that than selling on Amazon. This is why I believe selling high margin goods like this on Amazon isn't the best idea unless you just have alot of inventory you need to turnover. Amazon is charging $150 per customer when you can get customers on your own for much less than that.","347":"I've put in an order to redeem a $5 Amazon gift card.

If I have a profitable item that I buy from eBay and flip on Amazon FBA(Start with this probably, bigger margins), there's no reason for me to say the niche or type of product as it makes it harder for me to snipe the eBay items if I contribute to my competition.\n\nOne guy I will ALWAYS reccomend is The Profit Junkie on Youtube, I'll link you a video where he does some online stuff, but the principle remains the same. Do what he does, but for multiple items and categories.\n\nAlso, don't even bother with 90% of the Amazon FBA videos, they are filled with scummy salesmen type like Raiken Profits or Cody Hawk who cannot go a video without trying to sell you something or get you to buy something using their Amazon affiliate link. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-p-qk4BAHo4\n\n","349":"You're basically looking at drop shipping.

As a fellow business owner and E-com\/Amazon seller, some tips on Amazon:\n\n1) Don't let Amazon eat all of your profits. If you're not making enough, raise your price. If your price isn't competitive, figure out why and fix it. You'll have to give away some margin to them to make the sale, but don't make it get to the point that you're selling for charity.\n\n2) Use amazon to do market research. What is selling the most? Based on what I see, it's an inflatable Tower Paddleboard. Its sales rank is 8,900 in Sports and Outdoors. I'm also in this category and I can tell you that this sales rank equates to selling around 6-8\/day. Can you offer a similar product of better quality or cheaper price? Without screwing up what your brand stands for? On a $500 product that might be $100 profit\/sale and now you're talking about an awesome income on just one product if you can make it to the top.\n\n3) Advertise on Amazon if you aren't already. The clicks are ridiculously cheap and the additional sales boosts your ranking there, which then drives additional organic sales. It's a no brainer.\n\n4) Consider other products you can offer. Just based on the sales ranking of the top product, I would consider other markets. I've got at least 10+ products that could potentially be under 10k sales rank in Sports and Outdoors (some that already are, others I just need to keep in stock long enough to get there). If your product category isn't selling well enough on Amazon to justify your time\/energy investment, consider other products. Based on what I see with SUP, it's still a tiny niche market and I would be looking for other options and\/or ancillary products that you could add with more sales potential.","423":"It speeds things up, reduces errors, and centralizes order shipments if you sell on more than one channel (Amazon and a website for example). Once you're processing more than 5 orders a day or so, you'll want it badly. I would use it from day 1. The time savings alone more than pays for itself.\n\nJust think about the time it takes you to manually put in someone's address, the package weight, dimensions, etc... tedious. Accessing USPS website and\/or UPS website or Worldship...just so much slower and all of that info is then spread out everywhere. How much it cost to ship, when you shipped it, etc...a  mess.","424":"This has to do with ACH vs credit card auth\/capture.\n\nACH (Automated clearing houses) is the same system checks work on and is an antiquated system for verifying payments.  It still has manual parts to it despite it being \"automated\".\n\nWith credit cards there is an auth and a capture.  The auth is done to verify you have the funds to pay for the thing.  Auth responses happen quickly.  This puts a pending transaction on your account.  This step can happen with seconds.  The capture is the second step which actually captures\/transacts the transaction.  This is when it moves from pending to finalized.  This is when tips can be added to the card, etc.  Gas stations will do a $1 auth and then capture the actual amount.  The capture is the part that can take a while but the up front check or \"auth\" verifies you have the money and sets it aside.  If the merchant doesn't capture the auth it will expire based on your bank's terms.\n\nSource: I work for Amazon and deal with payment processors.","425":"I've used it a couple of times. The prices are very comparable to local stores prices sans beverages they're *way* more expensive on Amazon. Nothing is cheaper but the same price as local.

I'm a big guy and lift a fair amount of weight at work all day long but the way they pack the boxes it feels like dead weight when lifting. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't use it unless you really have to. It's a nice service and if you have the money to spend on normally priced groceries it's nice to stay in the house and not have to worry about going to the store but overall I wouldn't call it a frugal service with any frugal prices.","426":"My experience: Amazon Prime Pantry prices are lower than regular store prices, higher than sale prices. Convenience factor is high. The biggest difference vs regular Amazon shopping is that with Prime Pantry you can buy one of something, such as a bag or chips or a can of tuna, instead of six or a dozen of the item. Not really a *frugal* resource, but I do find it a convenient resource for (get ready) pantry staples.","427":"I love using Shipstation, unfortunately I won't be using it in the future due to lack of integration with some things I need...but while I used it, it was amazing. \n\nThe best part as everyone said here is so much easier to print shipping labels.

Stuff on my stuff I fulfilled via Amazon, but Amazon does not fulfill international orders.

Considering Amazon affiliate program for a site in working on. Need to know more before I commit to it though","449":"Imagine for a moment that you a young American, just moving out of your parent's house.  For a period of time, you were given money to stave off expenses for the basics.  Now, as you decide to expand outward and independently, you start getting a job.  From this job, you make more money than you would have had you stayed at your parents house.  In theory, because you make more money, your net income should be higher, right?  \n\nWrong.  Because you are expanding, you now assume additional costs for things that you ordinarily did not have to pay for, but now do.  Therefore, despite making more money, your net income is actually decreasing. \n\nThis is what is happening to Salesforce.com.  For a period of time, the company was living with angel and venture investors who would have been willing to pay for basic expenses of said company.  Now, however, as Salesforce.com is growing, said company needs to expand.  This costs money; and despite making more money, expenses is what is causing net income to decline.  \n\n   The difference between the above story and Salesforce revolves around going public.  An average person will not receive continually flowing money from investors if they do well.  Because of this, the average person is not dependent on money from others to survive.  This is key for Salesforce.com, since if the company loses funding from investors, the company will break. Thus, if Salesforce.com wants to survive, they must continually produce positive growth.  In the long-run, losing net income in the face of increasing expenses will be seen as disadvantegous, especially during a market correction when accountability is emphasized. Unlike the anomaly of both eBay and Amazon, today's market has competitors who are willing to bite further into the company's revenue. \n\nThere, hope it made sense. ","450":"Alibaba, and its sister site Aliexpress (where these probably came from), let you buy directly from China. Alibaba is more for industrial sized quantities of things, where Aliexpress is more individual sized amounts. There are also Chinese sellers that list things on Amazon and eBay.\n\n[Here](http:\/\/www.npr.org\/blogs\/money\/2014\/09\/03\/345310125\/episode-565-the-story-of-alibaba) is an episode of the radio show Planet Money about Alibaba.","451":"I have been doing this for years.  First making money is not easy. You have many ways to do it which many people have already mentioned. I will say the best way to have a chance for a newbie to have success is to be an affiliate. Being an affiliate you do not need the same amount of visitors to make some $ as you would ad sense or other advertising.  I would rather get paid $3 to $50 to sell one thing then get .10 a click for every ad someone clicks on\n\nThe secret is to make a super targeted website that sells something that not everyone else sells. Amazon gives you 4 to 6%.  \nMake the most of your site and niche. An example site may be breastfeeding pumps (sorry my wife just bought one). They are expensive, not a saturated market, and easy to buy\/ship. You could have a website like bestbreastpumps.com with affiliate to amazon.  One of my old sites that is an example of this is cheapkitchenaid.com ","452":"yeah yeah, this is funny, but this shit is why people are leaving eBay is masses. These are the type of sellers eBay needs to get rid of ASAP.\n\nThe next time that guy needs something, he's going to Amazon or a B&amp;M store.","453":"I used to run a network of these sites. I no longer do but here's my advice.\n\n1. I always built around a category. There are many different niches you could tackle but I usually kept it pretty small focus.\n2. I don't think you'll have enough margin to arbitrage PPC for one of these sites. These only tend to be ROI positive if you can get free traffic. PPC is just too expensive to recoup the cost from the small commission Amazon pays out. You need to focus on building organic traffic. You *may* get lucky with higher cost items but ultimately those are a harder sell usually.\n\nThe only upside to Amazon is that once you set the cookie they can come back and buy anything and you get commission but I'm not sure how long their cookie lasts. I think it might be 7 days now. I never wasted my time handwriting content I always automated it and scheduled the site to slowly post content over a couple years. If you hand write something for each item you probably have a better chance of ranking now.\n\nAt one point I had automated the entire process. I would supply keywords to a list. My tool would buy the domain, point it to my host, install wordpress, change the theme, install required plugins, do some basic on page SEO and hit the amazon api to pull info for the niche and schedule posts with varying dates over the next few years. Then it would pass the data off to another program to start link building. I never made much from this method but I think I got to $1200 a month at one point. I think I also used AdSense and eBay for additional monetization. Niches starting dying, I got a lot of trademark infringement threats that I didn't have time to deal with so I killed those sites. Ranking penalties started killing them when I got creative with \"link creation\". I made much more promoting cost per action\/sale via paid traffic sources.

Only use credit for planned expenses.\n\nYou may also wish to call your bank and ask how they report authorized users. Not every bank is the same with this.","455":"Nobody loves Amazon (or Ebay) because of their fees.  Most people suck it up and sell there because that's where the customers are and -try- to build up non-Amazon and non-Ebay business to increase margins.  But if you basically have an unlimited amount of boards, you might as sell them.  Steer customers to your site, but take lower margin sales from elsewhere, too.  Right now, you're working for every sale you make.  With Amazon, especially with FBA, you barely have to think about anything.  \n\nI would think that at least some of the stores in your region would be somewhat receptive to include a local brand.  Maybe you could have some sort of meetup\/howtos for customers and make it feel like they are supporting a local business\/etc.  Talk to local clubs?  Etc.  \n\nSome people also underhandedly use Ebay for advertising.  They list their items at higher prices on Ebay but work into the descriptions enough info that customers go to their websites directly...  \n\n***\n\nI was curious about mesothelioma because I read about it too.

Here's my 2 cents.\n\n1.  I would build a single site around the related products first, and then if you have a few great single keywords, build those next.  I've made money both ways, but building a multi-product site is usually easier.  That said, experiment - and track your results!\n\n2. I'm terrible at PPC, for me it was a guaranteed way to lose money.\n\nExamples (these are general and fake, but are similar to what I've done in the past):\n\nMultiple Keywords: If I found a bunch of good pirate keywords (pirate party favors, pirate gifts, pirate costumes, pirate hats, etc), I'd find a good pirate domain with the keyword in the domain, throw up a Wordpress site, and create pages for each keyword.  Then SEO the crap out of it.\n\nSingle Keyword:  I've created a few different single keyword sites.  Generally, I just get a good domain and create an official looking site.  For one medical product I made it look really corporate and clean.  For one game I made it fun and quirky.  Both of those sites did (and still do, I think) well enough ($10 - $100 per month), and I rarely update them.\n\nNow that I think about it more, I actually might build the single sites first.  They are easier, quicker, and you can pump them out and then work on the bigger multi-product sites.  Anyway, let me know if you have any questions.  I don't really do the affiliate game anymore, and might as well impart my knowledge.","458":"There is no such thing as the \"best\" card.

Some cards give great rewards at grocery stores and gas, and OK rewards elsewhere. Others give bonuses on rotating categories, while others give bonuses on restaurants. Some are a flat 1.5% or 2% rewards cards.\n\nFavorite cards around here: Sallie Mae Mastercard (5% on bookstores (includes Amazon), groceries, and gas (capped at relatively low amounts but good for many)); Amex Blue Cash (preferred or everyday, depends on spending); Capitol One Quicksilver; Citi DoubleCash; Chase Sapphire Preferred; Barclay Arrival Plus.\n\nAlso, don't knock a card just because it has an annual fee.

Beans are an amazing, healthy, hearty meat substitute. They last a long time (dry) in the pantry and are really cheap, especially at international grocery stores or on Amazon. Just soak them overnight and you can boil them for any dish imaginable. Add cumin and chili powder to black or pinto beans, and use them in tacos or fajitas.

You have $1000, plus $400 on Amazon. Do you mind saying what city you live in? You need to be in a place with good public transportation (even if you get the car, b\/c gas is expensive), that is cheap, and has jobs.\n\nStep 0) Sell everything you don't need. This includes the guitar, excess clothes, everything. If you absolutely cannot part with stuff you cannot carry on your back, you need to find one of those storage rental places that gives you your first month for $1 or some great deal like that. But be careful not to sign a contract for longer than that period. If you end up needing longer than the month, \n\n1) Do you have a laptop? If so, you need to find places with free wifi. Usually McDonalds have free wifi so look there first.\n\n2) Get a library card to waste time, read, and use their computers.\n\n3) The $400 on Amazon is now your food money. They have Amazon lockers that you can get your items shipped to so you don't need an address. Buy small items that can fit in your backpack, and shop cheap.\n\n4) Join a gym. Usually YMCA will give you a membership based on income. Check there first. This is now where you shower, shave, etc.\n\n5) If you don't get the car, you need a place to sleep. Homeless shelters can probably be nasty and dangerous. If I were you, I would buy just an absolute junker of a car off Craigslist to at least sleep in. You can probably get one for $300. If you don't want to do that, start researching nearby shelters. I hear Walmarts are good at letting people sleep in their parking lots, but don't take that to the bank. Otherwise try to find deserted areas that don't look too dangerous. Warning: Don't sleep in the storage locker listed above. It's probably illegal and there are all sorts of dangers of freezing\/heating to death, not to mention lack of oxygen if its airtight, etc.\n\n6) Do you have a cell phone? Will your mom continue to pay for the plan? If not, then go buy one of those cheap phones with the pay as you go minutes and only buy the minimum and never text anyone. This is strictly for work contacts.\n\n7) You need an address to put on job applications and where you can receive mail. Buy a PO Box from UPS. They have ones that look like real street addresses (http:\/\/www.theupsstore.com\/mailboxes\/Pages\/personal.aspx).\n\n8) Now you have all your immediate needs out of the way. And honestly all the above steps shouldn't take you more than 2 days. Now you start job searching. Apply everywhere. You cannot discriminate. It's already likely going to be 2-3 weeks before your first paycheck arrives. Fastfood places generally have high turnover. Put on a button-up shirt if you have one and make your hair look good. You walk in and ask if the hiring manager is working and tell them you'd like to apply. Another good place to apply would be CVS or Walgreens, basically small drug stores. They also generally have high turnover. And this is actually a good time to be applying. There's not a lot of competition from high school\/ college students like there is in summer.\n\n9) After you get a job, you want to get a place. Don't waste time finding an apartment you can't afford right now. Go find a rent a room situation on Craigslist. Shouldn't be more than $500 including all bills. And make sure its a month-to-month situation.\n\n10) Now you can start looking at community colleges. I'd start with 1-3 classes you can take when you're not working. Seriously, college goes faster than you know. Think of it as 40 classes. That's all you need to graduate from a 4 year college. Or even start looking at trade professions your community college may offer if you're interested. You already applied to FAFSA, great!! Take any aid offered. Aim to start this summer! You'll be done in just a few years. If you want to transfer to a 4 year college, do your first 60 credits (20 classes at community college) before you transfer. If you take 3 classes each term, and don't skip summers, you'll be done in 2 years + 1 semester. That can be your Associate Degree or your step to transfer to a Bachelors.\n\n\nWhile my situation wasn't as dire as yours, I went through something similar, getting kicked out, on 1 weeks notice, when I was 18 and still in high school. I ended up working and taking community college classes for some years before transferring to a 4 year school and graduating with a double major. I'm now on a full scholarship to law school with a fiance and a cat. I'm telling you this so you can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better if you put in the effort. Feel free to respond on here or PM me if you have any other questions.\n\n\nEDIT: Just saw you lived in rural Pennsylvania. That can't work. You need to get to the closest big city. It looks like Philadelphia is the biggest city in Pennsylvania by a lot. So you need to get there before any of these steps can happen. Try to get a ride from your mom since she's moving, but if not you need to use a tiny bit of your money to buy a bus ticket there.\n\nEDIT 2: Just saw someone from Philadelphia say the job market sucks there. I looked up the lowest unemployment rates in the US and Salt Lake City, Utah is at the top with an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But they have a very small population. The city on the list with the highest population and lowest unemployment rate is Minneapolis, Minnesota or Austin, Texas. I looked at a Greyhound ticket and they're $108 from Philadelphia to Minneapolis or $139 to Austin. They are both big cities with low unemployment rates under 5%.","499":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

A lot of these categories balloon to around $200 for one month, then go to zero for the next ~3 months, so I've budgeted so that every month I expect to spend about 200 more than my predictable every month expenses.

A 52 ft truck showed up with an army of moving guys who **packed** everything, put it in the truck and took off.

Sometimes there's just not a deal to be had and feeling like you have to walk away with something is a great way to talk yourself into a bum deal.\n\nEveryone makes bad buys now and again, and when you're just starting out you're probably going to make a couple that you lose money on and quite a few where you really  don't make too great of a margin. Like anything else, it takes time and practice. Just think of these mistakes as the price of a lesson learned. Going forward you need to get your phone situation sorted out, and not buy anything you haven't thoroughly looked into and know how much it's worth and how often it sells. The last thing you want to be doing in this line of work is 'quick searches'. It can be real easy to overlook things.\n\nI don't know what your expectations are or what you want out of flipping, but I would suggest finding at least a part time job ASAP that can cover your basics (rent, food, transportation). If you're relying on flipping to cover some of these necessities it will be incredibly stressful. It'll be easier to shrug off mistakes, endure periods of low sales, and you'll feel less pressured to make iffy purchases.\n\nGood luck, work hard, &amp; use your head. Don't let your emotions dictate your flipping. The worst deals I've ever made were ones I let my greed make me overlook things. At first glance it can be easy to see $$$ where there really isn't any.\n\nPS: Become very familiar with what it costs to ship things, it will make or break you. Don't neglect the cost of boxes if you have to buy them, tape, bubble wrap, packing peanuts, Ebay fees. Use USPS' calculator to get a feel for how much different weights cost to ship (rule of thumb is destinations within a state of you generally cost 1\/2 as much as something across the country - but that isn't always the case). If you don't have one already, get a postal scale for $20 off Amazon, it will pay for itself within a couple sales due to the reduced rates by printing postage through Ebay. Also keep an eye out for free shipping supplies. Hit up stores for boxes, keep an eye on Craigslist for packing peanuts\/boxes\/bubble wrap.","556":"I think retail arbitrage is fine.  Buying and reselling elsewhere isn't an issue.  It's standing in line and buying something, moving back in line and selling it to someone who might have been able to buy it had the scalper and others doing the same not been there (ran into this a multitude of times with sports events in college) that kind of ruffles feathers.  There's a service in buying it and reselling elsewhere as it allows a wider audience to have access to that item even if it's just Amazon --&gt; Ebay or vice versa.  \n\nI don't believe that flipping and scalping are the same, but you could categorize scalping as a type of flip, a flip of opportunity as the scalper had the time and put in the effort to be closer to the front of the line.","557":"Yea on Amazon they are $399 ouch.

Thrifting is relatively simple as well: call in to find out when they stock, Google everything you see that looks good (what looks good requires a bit of skill). That's it. I never said it was hard, it's also pretty easy, just requires a lot of patience and Googling. I can only tell you what everyone else knows about Amiibos. Fortunately \/r\/amiibo compiles all of that information.

Very few people go to thrift stores. I'm competing with flippers when I go to thrift stores rather than the people who might actually want the thing, but are unwilling to dig through a thrift store.

You see this in some of the crazy overpriced sellers. \n\nIn short, buy carefully.\n\nI've been selling books online since the olden days before we had Amazon. (get off my lawn!) Been trying to figure these guys out for years, and this is what I've managed to glean.","661":"Amazon lets you \"Refill your Gift Card\" for as low as $0.50 on this page:\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/gc\/create?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=br_imp\n\nEven if it's only $0.50\/mo ($6\/yr) the credit card company can't say \"no activity\", right?! :)","662":"There's no Amazon fee on shipping costs. ","663":"Yes, but I checked and there's still a $1.34 Amazon fee on selling a book at $0.01. ","664":"Not sure what to tell you, since I don't know how you are *not* getting discounts.

I don't really like spending money to spend more money. It's gotta be cheaper and better than Amazon Prime (which has other perks such as student pricing at $50\/year and streaming) ","668":"Agreed.  I exclusively sell games individually on Amazon unless it's more valuable complete in box on Ebay.  I never bundle.","669":"No clue. I checked Amazon for a few things. The charger I got was going for $30. Everything else was just slightly cheaper than Amazon or not even on there, like the Radioshack brand speakers.","670":"If a seller ships more than 300 pieces per day they can pay USPS an annual commercial pre-sorted mailing permit fee that allows a much lower rate per parcel than 2.69. It still varies by zones, meaning the further away it's going the more it costs, but it will average out to much less than the 2.69. You are correct that the commission rate does not go over 1.30, since the rest is a percent of sale price, ie .01. When our Amazon store looked into the penny book market, we figured we could average about .15 to .30 margin per book as long as we could have enough inventory offered to make 300 sales per day. The bigger factor here is that to 'Bag&amp;Tag' 300 per day takes a lot of material cost and labor hours, which were mostly tied up in print speed for the labels. The cost analysis versus FBA made it clear that penny selling is only viable if you have a huge warehouse for cheap rent and are sitting on over 100,000 books, preferrably closer to 300,000. Then take into account the labor hours need to create the listings, which even if you are using uploader software like Neato or FBAPro, you're still looking at about 500-800 per 8 hrs of labor - &lt;insert-math&gt; that's 4,800 labor hours to upload 300k listings. All said, it's still a tight margin but can be done with high volume. The quality of the book itself and the seller descriptions of said quality will be all over the place, feedback will be terrible, customer service after the sale is difficult to non existent, but if you have cheap rent and pay less than .10 per pound for your raw inventory it can be done.","671":"I just price matched Amazon at Best Buy.

They're all the same basic premise (\"find 3 of *x* symbol to win *y* dollars!\").  Find 3 of the symbol, get the money plus some tokens from a bonus box on the side (I'll get back to tokens in a second here).  Fail, and all you get is the tokens in the bonus box.  Cash cards are worth anywhere between $1 and $1,000.  \n\nFor those of you who decide to play the scratchcards and win, there's three options for cashing out, with three more *supposedly* on the way:\n\n* Cashout to Dwolla (instant, any amount)\n* Check ($10 and up)\n* Visa gift card ($100 and up)\n* AMEX gift card (coming soon)\n* Walmart gift card (coming soon)\n* Best Buy gift card (coming soon)\n\nBack to the tokens: every card you play gets you some tokens (anywhere between 3 and 15 from my experience), which you can use a number of ways:\n\n* Entering contests (for things like gift cards, cash, etc.)\n* Token scratchcards (which cost anywhere between 10 and 50 coins per go with winning payouts between 250 and 1,000 tokens)\n* \"Instant rewards\" (explained in detail below)\n\nAlong with the token cards you pay to play, there's also three free cards available with the cash cards (worth 25, 50, and 400 tokens respectively).  \n\n**In my experience, though, the best way of earning tokens is by just remembering to open up the app every day.**  If you open up the app for two or more days in a row, you start earning tokens for every day you check in:\n\n* Day 2: 250 tokens\n* Day 3: 500 tokens\n* Day 4: 750 tokens\n* Day 5: 1,000 tokens\n* Day 6+: \"Mystery bonus\" (explained below)\n\nThe coin bonuses stack, so just for checking in for 5 days, that's 3,000 tokens!\n\nThe mystery bonus can be anything, but it's generally not worth it; a majority of the time, your bonus will just be \"*x* entries into whatever crappy contest we're trying to push right now.\"  Sometimes, it'll be tokens (anywhere between 500 and 1,000 from my experience), and once in a blue moon, it'll actually be cash (50 cents the single time that happened to me).  \n\nIf you want to rack up coins faster, then your best bet is to check in for 5 days in a row, skip the 6th, and then check in for 5 more days, skip the 6th again, etc. etc.\n\nTheir instant reward section is sort of lacking, but the gist is that the longer you save up your tokens, the more bang you get for your buck (e.g. a $5 Amazon card goes for 16,000 tokens, while a $50 card goes for 75,000 tokens).  Rewards in between the two Amazon cards (yes, those are the only values they offer of those):\n\n* AMC movie ticket and popcorn voucher (18,000 tokens) OR 2 AMC movie tickets (25,000 tokens)\n* $10 Target eGift card (25,000 tokens)\n* A choice of one of three different eGift cards at 35,000 points (Gamestop, Domino's, and Toys R Us)\n\nMost of the gift cards are e-mailed to you right away (they're generally in your inbox within 5 minutes), but the $50 Amazon card and the AMC vouchers have to be snail mailed to you (how long that takes, I wouldn't know, because I haven't redeemed for any of those).  \n\n[eGift card proof](http:\/\/imgur.com\/E2PfpYc) (don't try the code, I've redeemed it already)\n\nRef: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1G4OQ3s\n\nNon-ref: http:\/\/lucktastic.com\/","675":"[H] Paypal [W] Canadian Amazon GC (about 60 dollars)","676":"[H]$10 Amazon [W] $10 Nintendo Eshop","677":"[H] 10$ Amazon [W] 9$ PayPal","678":"Hey all,\n\nI started selling on Amazon FBA and have sold about 20 items and in the Amazon seller app I can see that I have done around $400 in sales but unlike eBay I can't just click \"sold\" and see what has sold. \n\nI've basically just been looking at my inventory and figuring out what isn't in there any more but if there was an easy way of doing that it would be great.\n\nI'm selling 5-10 items daily buts it's hard to track for me.\n\nI appreciate the help fellas","679":"[H] $20 Domino's Gift Card, [W] $20 Amazon Card","680":"As some of you may know by my previous posts, I have just started a offline business.

This one is solely online and I will be integrating Amazon affiliate links into it soon. I just need to get more content on the site. \n\nSo I chose several different themes in Wordpress but ended up ditching them basically because I have no idea how to work them. One I couldn't get the entire background from being purple (purple...really?) and another I didn't like because I don't want just one 5 mile long page. So I chose another theme with page tabs. Now the font is tiny, I have really set at the largest it would allow...I guess I can go change all my text to heading style but I would have to do this with every post....not feasible. \n\nNow my comment box is not there even though I have it ticked in settings. Is it because it is a static page? My idea is to make separate pages (in tab form) for different areas I want to cover. Like one for shoes and one for socks type thinking. Put all the shoe reviews or anything to that nature under the shoe tab...this tab will hold multiple posts and each post should have the ability to take comments.\n\nAlso I keep reading about no-follow links. How exactly do I make these? Do I use this process with my affiliate links? I saw somewhere that if your front page has small tidbits leading to your other posts that Google will see this as duplicate content....this is why I was making the pages static...am I thinking right?\n\nI would also someday add a forum to the website. How do I handle that? I know there are plugins and things but don't know how to use them exactly. \n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.","681":"Bear with me, I don't know how to get this on paper (electrons) being a hardcore INTJ and introvert.  SGM, lower 40s, solid career, no consumer debt, no car payment in the last decade (Toyota durability FTW!), just a mortgage payment well below market value for location and I'm already appraised at double value from original purchase (I got lucky as %$#@ in the real estate bubble). 10% of income to 401k well exceeding the company match for the last 20 years.  Learned about the Roth 8 years ago and and have been doing max contribution since.  2 years of salary socked away in an emergency fund.  I put everything else in additional savings through brokerage.

Spending is very limited in that I don't shop retail unless forced, and often mostly thrift\/second hand sales.  Seriously 75%+ of my house is everyone else's cast off hard furniture or thrift purchases.  Soft furnishings (bed, sofa, chairs) all were purchased new for obvious reasons.  Clothing I avoid \"too trendy\" so as to be less time\/fashion sensitive for longer life.  I don't eat out more than 2x a week (strict functional diet so as not to undermine years invested in gym work).  I don't drink when I go out mostly because I refuse to pay the excessive costs.  My budget indulgences are a $45\/mo gym membership, $75\/mo smartphone, and insurance on a vintage motorcycle.  I don't do vacation travel since it makes no sense to go alone...wtf do I do by myself?  My passport is current but empty.  I can't justify things like Netflix, Amazon Prime, cable TV, the typical money-suckers.

Bear with me now, I'm not saying this to be boastful at all, but to set up the scenario.\n\nI should have everything squared, right?  My FA says I'm ahead of the curve for others my age, but I also know how terrible the \"average\" middle-age person is with kids mortgage and normal life contributing to a typically lousy retirement planning.  It doesn't convince me I'm going to be ok.  I can't spend without a huge guilt complex unless it's something essential that I haven't justified as a \"need\" item.  If I had extra money in my hand, I seriously couldn't tell you what I'd spend it on even if forced.  My brain locks up even thinking of possibilities.  I know it's not supposed to be like this.

I have been selling on Amazon since November, and was lucky to get in on the holiday rush before it was too late. I was mainly focusing on  flipping things I found at retail stores, and did well enough that I caught the bug. Anyways lately I have been focusing on books I find from Goodwills in my area and have doing okay for the amount of time that I put in. I haven't worried too much about customer feedback because I read in Chris Greens book Retail Arbitrage that messaging customers after a purchase can sometimes result in bad feedback. So far its worked out and after about 60 retail flips and 60 book sales I have 7 people that have left feedback.. 100% positive with 4.9 Stars. \n\nToday I received noticed that my account has been put under review. In the email it states, \"We conduct reviews when sales volumes or inventory are not supported by sufficient buyer feedback or an established history. These reviews are a routine part of our commitment to improving the customer experience.\n\nThey also say, \"For information on how you may be able to expedite this review, please search on 'Velocity Limits and Account Reviews' in our seller Help.\" I took a look in there and it seems like they are implying I should have more feedback than I do.\n\nMy question is whether this is something I need to worry about?

The lowest price on Amazon is 139 dollars, but on ebay it's been selling for 75 bucks (see sold items rather than listed which is 96 dollars).  If I listed it on Amazon it'd be sold in less than a week. If I kept the low price, it'd be sold within a day of arriving with a 9k sales rank.  I don't check every item's price, but it seems every single time I do, Ebay's \"sold\" prices are much, much lower, and there are always a lot of listings lower than Amazons.  People pay premium prices on Amazon for some reason, people go to ebay looking for a deal.\n\nEdit: on ROI, I got this for ~14 dollars, so it's pretty high","720":"I'm talking mainly about the one off stuff people buy like clothing, vintage items, etc. that sell well on eBay vs the the common items sold on Amazon \n\nYes, a lot of stuff sells higher on Amazon than eBay, but that doesn't mean the ROI is higher than the one-of-a-kind items you can sell on eBay.","721":"My husband is:\nLet's buy quality pallets and OA's for new items and ship to Amazon\nMe:\nBut I like hunting for treasure :( especially this brand new  ATE Brake a master Cylinder for a Mercedes.... \n http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xKRIgfc.jpg ","722":"Yeah, I'm not saying it's every item, I don't do much in the way of vintage, no clothes (I don't know brands or anything), no antiques, and don't get very much luck in finding the stuff I know (books, games, etc).  \n\nBut nerf, toys and games that are RA and new?

I just factor that time into paying off my credit cards so I'm not paying interest and It doesn't even affect me.  \n\nEither way, I guess it's a preference.
