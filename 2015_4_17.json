Lurker here. I almost never post on Reddit, but I'm finally trying it out: I wanted some advice on my outlook, and since the demographics thread shows that there are a few others who are young, are just starting out, have low expenses, or are some combo of the three, I thought I should post about it and see what people have to say. I'm giving a ton of data here because I know we all hate when posters expects us to mind-read their situation\/history and I don't want to overlook something helpful; so, sorry for the rambliness.\n\ncredit cards I own, with opening date, CL, HP bureau, amount charged to card since Aug 2014:\n\n* Dec 2010: Discover It ($6.5k; don't remember; $2k)\n* Aug 2014: CSP ($12k; TU; $5.5k), Arrival+ ($5k; TU; $14k), Blue Cash Preferred ($2k; Experian, I think?; $1.2k)\n* Nov 2014: SW RR Plus ($12k; TU; $2.5k)\n* Feb 2014: Barclay USAirways ($5k; TU; $100)\n\nI plan to cancel these (except the no-AF Discover of course) after a year.\n\nmiles:\n\n* American: 75k (mostly from the 50k USAirways sign-up bonus.)\n\n* Delta: 70k (I haven't flown Delta in years; this is from childhood\/family travel.)\n\n* United: 275 (I recently booked a 35k award.)\n\n* Southwest: 25k (I got the 50k bonus from the RR Plus, and used 25k for a trip already.)\n\n* [irrelevant miles on Spirit and Frontier.]\n\n* Chase UR: 30k (after transferring 22k to United)\n\nother info:\n\n* credit score according to Credit Karma: 750-775\n* income: $55k\n* nearest big airport: ORD (home airport: MSN; instead I often take a bus to\/from ORD\/MDW)\n* fare class: economy\n* travel type: all leisure. flexible dates. domestic travel about once a quarter (on Southwest and United typically); planning travel to Europe and South America going forward, hopefully once a year; I take vacation time every May that ends in flying into EWR.\n* preference between cashback and points\/miles: slight preference to points\/miles, now that I'm trying to make more int'l travel happen.\n* preference between airline and hotel cards: airline. I haven't considered hotel cards because I use AirBnb, hostels, Couchsurfing, and rarely, cheap hotels.\n\nHere's my situation:\n\n* My monthly expenses are relatively low: $1200 or less, including $900 rent, &lt;= $100 utilities, $45 internet, &lt;= $75 groceries, &lt;= $75 dining; by the end of this year, rent may be even lower if I move into a new apartment. I'd been relying on Serve, monthly expenses, and vacation expenses to meet min spend. I got skittish about using Serve for my rent when the January check disappeared (Amex said they sent it; it didn't arrive after a month) and it was very stressful to try to put a stop payment and get my money back. But I still use it to pay Serve-recognized payees: utilities, Internet, and CC balances. I'm single, so there's no one I feel comfortable making an AU; and everyone I know either doesn't care about travel or thinks this hobby is weird \/ a hassle, so I'm too shy to rope anyone into putting some of their purchases on my card.\n\n* I also don't have a car, so going to Target or Walmart is at least a 2-hour roundtrip (with the $3-roundtrip bus fare eating into any profit). And the grocery stores and gas stations around here are nearly impossible to buy VGCs at anyway -- I got a $25 VGC in September when I was first testing things out, but I think it was only because the cashier that day couldn't care less, because my subsequent attempts, of higher denominations admittedly, have all been shot down.\n\n* One shining light is that I was able to buy 2 $500 VGCs at a Walgreens in December when Discover had a \"Choose One of These Stores to get 5% CB on up to $1k\" promotion. But the cashier guy was very sweet and guileless. So I don't know if, if I happened to get another cashier, I'd be able to do that again.\n\n* I was considering [starting a UFB Direct account](http:\/\/freequentflyerbook.com\/blog\/2014\/9\/23\/ufb-direct-airline-rewards-checking-accounts-amazingly-still-available), but I'm wary of the reliability\/hassle. Likewise with most checking account possibilities, though I did make a Discover checking account in March to get a $50 bonus.\n\nSince [it seems to me] my MS situation is pretty bleak, I try to rely on my vacation spending to meet min spend. I'm going on vacation in late May, partly international (estimation of remaining expenses: &lt; $1500), but I can't decide if I should apply for a new card, and if so, which one. Given a) that you don't really want to accumulate more miles than you can burn in, say, two years, b) ability to min spend (RIP Serve), and c) the spreadsheet of current offers, my options with best offers are:\n\n* Amex Platinum Delta Business or Delta Reserve: I don't think I need more Delta miles any time soon.\n* Amex Everyday Preferred: I don't have any cards with MR currency, but I haven't considered them because I have Star Alliance covered with URs, and my current balances with AA and Delta seem quite enough.\n* Alaska Business: I already have AA and Delta miles, and I'm not going on Emirates or Cathay any time soon. (one day! just not the next 3-5 years.)\n* Virgin Atlantic Black Card \/ White Card: I don't know that Virgin Atlantic would be useful to me.\n* Bank Americard Cash Rewards: I get better grocery\/gas rewards with the BCP.\n* Sallie Mae: I get better grocery rewards with the BCP. I can stock up on Amazon gift cards for the year in December with Discover at 5%. Plus I thought I read that Barclay doesn't like when you have more than two cards with them at a time, and they've already given me low CLs for both cards.\n* Frontier: they fly out of MSN, but their fares are mad cheap already, so why waste an HP?\n* Hawaiian: I'm planning on going to Hawaii in Sept 2017, but that's a while off, and inter-island travel is super cheap with them already.\n* CapOne Quicksilver: I wouldn't want three HPs from applying for a CapOne card. I also don't understand why you'd apply for this instead of Citi Double Cash.\n* SW Premier: maaaaybe this one? min spend is definitely doable. but with my current balance, I won't need RRs for a year at least, and the scale of the devaluation is as yet unclear.\n* United Explorer Business: I could use more United miles, and min spend is doable. but I have all those HPs on TU, and I wanted to have a year of history with Chase before I attempted a business card.\n* British Airways: I'm in the Midwest, so the sweet spots aren't of much use to me (BOS-DUB or West Coast to Hawaii).\n* Citi AA Plat or Plat Business: as mentioned, I have lots of AA miles already.\n* Citi TY Premier: TY Points seem like something I should get into, and I guess the 3x travel is better than the CSP, but $5k min spend would be nearly impossible to meet at the moment.\n* Citi TY Preferred: I already get 2x dining, but maybe since I'm cancelling the CSP in Aug, I should try this one? Also, is there a reason to avoid getting the Preferred if I will want to apply for the Premier someday?\n* Citi Prestige: I don't want to risk not having $250 in flight expenses to reimburse this year to end up coming out ahead of the $450 AF. It's definitely possible, just not a guarantee.\n* USBank FlexPerks: seems not worth it.\n* Wells Fargo: seems not worth it.\n\nI was thinking I should wait for the Freedom to have a higher offer, and wait till a year's history with Chase to apply for the Ink Plus. I was going to cancel Arrival+ after a year (unless someone can explain to me why you would downgrade when you can cancel then reapply?), and apply for Citi Double Cash at that point to continue having a 2% CB card.\n\nSO. could I get some wisdom? I don't mind moving slowly; I know this is a marathon, not a sprint. I just feel a bit stuck. anyone have any thoughts about this?\n\n*EDIT, sort of: right before I was going to hit submit, I saw someone post about the Premier min spend being lowered to $3k. I think that gives this one an edge among my options, but I'm going to post this anyway, because I would appreciate if people could check my general thought process \/ give advice otherwise.\n\n*EDIT 2: formatting fixed.","2":"[H] $25 iTunes GC [W] $17 Bitcoins, Paypal, or Amazon","3":"Hello!

Something we could build and launch in one week. Something that was economical. Something that people wanted.\n\nWe saw that Redditors had a strange existing behavior: they \u201cgild\u201d other users\u2019 comments for $3.99 a pop. All you gotta do is click \u201cgive gold\u201d on any reddit comment, and voila, the author\u2019s comment becomes emblazoned with a little gold icon.\n\nYea. People are actually paying $3.99 (enough to buy a sandwich and a drink from Safeway) to put a gold icon on a random stranger\u2019s comment on the Internet.\n\nAccording to Reddit Gold\u2019s about page, having \u201creddit gold status\u201d means you also get access to some exclusive features, but after studying the list of services, you realize these are features only a truly hardcore Redditor would appreciate, but most casual Redditors probably don\u2019t find super valuable.\n\nSo then, giving Reddit Gold is about all creating feelings of goodwill. This makes sense, since studies show that spending money on other people makes us happier than spending it on ourselves.\n\nSo given this behavior, we thought perhaps people would want to \u201cgild\u201d users with something more tangible: they get mailed a toy gold coin along with a card.\n\nWe dreamed that if this service proved to be valuable, people would also want to gift each other flowers or even real gifts on Amazon. We thought perhaps people would want such a service for Twitter as well. However, in the interest of launching quickly according to lean startup philosophy, we decided to focus on toy coins for Redditors, and expanding to these other ideas and social networks if there was demand.\n\nSo in 1 week, we built and launched Gildme.com.\n\nWe marketed it by submitting to a few different subreddits. We didn\u2019t actually get that many upvotes (I think we had a score of only 16 on our top post), but we got quite a few visitors this way. We also got some love on ProductHunt, with 59 upvotes. On launch day, we ended up getting about 2,000 unique visitors, 34% from Reddit, 24% from ProductHunt, and the rest from other sources. We had a small percentage of traffic (1.24%) from Facebook, even though we spent $5 on a Facebook campaign and posted status updates to our friends. And we got basically no traffic from our LinkedIn status updates. We didn\u2019t get around to tweeting about it, although a few strangers did when they found out about our service.\n\nIronically, the night before our launch, we learned about redditgifts.com, a service that\u2019s gotten a lot more traction by organizing \u201cSecret Santa\u201d gift exchanges, and helping out charitable causes like giving to schoolteachers\u2019 classrooms. We watched their founder\u2019s TEDx talk.\n\n\u201cDoh!\u201d\n\nThat was definitely a \u201cDoh!\u201d moment, as we smiled goofily at one another and realized we just spent a week building something that already existed. It was the same vision of giving a stranger a gift without having to know their address. Although they say it\u2019s all about execution not the idea, I don\u2019t think we were going to be more passionate about \u201cgift-giving to strangers\u201d than these guys.\n\n**Lessons Learned**\n\nThis week was really a lesson about user acquisition channels.\n\nWe naively thought that since giving gold was an existing behavior on Reddit, that Redditors would magically adopt the behavior of mailing toy coins and notes. It turns out we have to think more carefully about how exactly that process of adoption actually happens.\n\nFor Reddit Gold, there\u2019s a \u201cgive gold\u201d link on every single comment, inviting people to give gold. There\u2019s visibility after someone is gilded, in the form of a gold icon. And very often, it\u2019s good reddiquette for the recipient to edit their comment to then thank people for the gold. This creates an enormous amount of visibility, that a service like Gildme currently doesn\u2019t have. In fact, we probably won\u2019t have many repeat visitors to our website after our initial launch.\n\nOn the other hand, redditgifts.com\u2019s way of organizing Secret Santas and gift exchanges around charity and other causes is a much more viable approach: you get to repeatedly launch to users, whereas we can\u2019t repeatedly keep posting to Reddit that our service exists.\n\nSo in short, it\u2019s not enough to be able to get users to know about your service, you also need a strategy for retaining initial users and building a real community around using your service. For a service like this to succeed, we really need to learn to be deeper thinkers about community-building.\n\nIn the end, we had a couple Redditors try to place real orders, but only one went through because of a bug. With a grand revenue total of $5, this is not enough traction to justify further investment. So we\u2019re moving on and building a grocery delivery service next week. Stay tuned.","23":"Hey guys, I've been using this site for quite some time now and received a bunch of Amazon gift cards.

After reading the posts on this site, I've been focusing my efforts more on CL\/thrift\/yardsale\/garage sale flipping.\n\nSo anyways, I Picked up a Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 NIB from a older gentleman on CL last week. I was surprised it was in the free section and that people weren't beating down his door to pick it up so I managed to pick it up first. AFTER emailing to pick up but BEFORE actually doing so, I did a quick check on ebay and I couldn't believe it. These things are going for upwards of $200! (its an older version) So I sold it within 3 days on there for $299. I probably could have gotten more for it somewhere else (Amazon) but I'm trying to stick to what I'm familiar with and I have great feedback on Ebay.

We stayed for dinner and didn't get back until around 8:30 pm. \n\nI walk in the door and hear water. Lots of it. Turns out that my 5 year old son had ran inside to use the bathroom and for some reason (5 year old impulse) left the faucet running with the drain closed. \n\n10 hours of running water. It was mostly contained to the bathroom and hall way by the bathroom (first floor). \n\nI turn off the water, run to the basement. It's raining. Water pourin through the floor. Fortunately, the area isn't finished and has a floor drain. \n\nSince it was late Friday night, I do my best to get the excess water soaked up with towels. So many towels, we're still not caught up on laundry.  I get a fan blowing upstairs and have a dehumidifer going full blast in basement. \n\nSaturday morning, I call my insurance agent, but they're not open so I call the 24\/7 service number. They tell me it's not covered because it wasn't a water backup. \n\nSo we're looking at several thousand in restoration costs out of pocket. I'm freaking out. I'm worried about my house falling apart, gettin mold, etc. \n\nI contact a local water damage contractor, owner tells me that waiting until Monday would be ok. \n\nToday the guy comes out, says it looks pretty dry and that since damage has already been done (didn't get to it immediately) that using industrial dehumidifers would be best course of action and he recommends that if I'm paying out of pocket I call Home Depot to rent and save some money. \n\nI contact my actual insurance agent and they tell me my policy DOES cover \"sudden and accidental water damage\" with a $1000 deductible. \n\nSuch a huge weight is lifted now that I can actually have the restoration folks come out and actually fix the water damage instead of just trying to dry it out and hope for the best. \n\nI could have avoided a lot of stress in a few ways. \n\n1) Known my homeowners policy better. Would have been helpful, but since I'm not an agent, I would still hesitate to say to myself \"oh yeah, that's covered\". It's best to actually contact your agent\n\n2) having a bigger emergency fund. I'm still working on building it up while paying off student loans. If it were larger, I would have been more comfortable having the restoration\/damage control done immediately and still be able cover it if insurance doesn't end up covering it. \n\nAnyways, now that I actually have the guys coming out to do a through inspection and replace some carpet and w\/e is damage, I'm able to stop worrying so much\n\nTL;DR- have an emergency fund! The ABSOLUTE minimum it should be should be enough to cover your homeowners insurance deductible.   \n\nEDIT: Costs so far: \n\n$170 to rent an industrial dehumidifer. This was recommended by Restoration guy (Chad). Theirs were $120\/day + labor to setup. The rental place down the street was $80\/day. I should have done this Saturday, but I was also dealing with my car being in the shop to have rear brakes done and I had to have it ready by 2 to get to work. \n\n$60 to replace some library books that were in a closet and got soaked. Two of the book I managed to dry out, but they are obviously water damaged and I won't return them in that condition, but I'll use them myself. I managed to get the books on Amazon and will take them to library when I have them. I think there's a $5\/book processing fee to put them in the system, which is going to be another ~$20","42":"Hello! I'm interested in trading PayPal for US Amazon gift codes (any amount).

Long and rambling post ahead\n\nRetail receipts are totally fine.  Most people know this.  However, the rep MUST be able to see the date of purchase, and it must be recent. Blur out the pricing info, and make sure there are NO other items on the receipt.  That means if you go to Target and buy 6 bars of soap and 6 boxes of dryer sheets to resell, don't also buy a pack of gum and a loaf of bread for personal use.  Even if you blur those items out, it will delay your approval at best, and at worst, that receipt will be rejected, and they will want another one.  They want a clear line between business and personal.\n\nAnother thing about receipts is that they must be able to tell what the item is that you purchased.  Sounds obvious, but I noticed when looking at various store receipts that some stores are better about this than others, and it can be item specific.  Target and Walmart receipts end up being fine on MOST items, but sometimes something slips through, and something shows up on the receipt, and you have no idea what it is, usually for newer products from my observations.  For example, there were some face wipes that when they first came out Target had them with just the partial name (seriously like 5 letters--it was kinda crazy short), but a few weeks later, they showed up as the full product name when I bought them again.  Other stores, for some reason, put some strange stuff on receipts, and even if you tell the Amazon rep what it is, they need to be able to verify it.  I couldn't get any Shopko receipt to work, for example, and I'm sure it was because you couldn't tell for sure what the items were just by reading the receipt.\n\nI also noticed they seemed to be iffy when the quantities were 3-4, but when I upped them to 6 or more, it was boom!  Done.  I was told by the support rep that they want to see that you have \"stable sources and resaleable quantities.\"  This means they may be iffy on some local store or small regional chain that they've never heard of, but Target and Walmart are everywhere, so those are good to go.  It's fine to source from those other places after you get approval, of course, but I would stay away from using them for the approval process.\n\nAnother tip is in the body of the message, give the reps the UPC code, name of the product, and the ASIN number for each item on each receipt.  Otherwise, they have to look through the catalog to find it, and if they aren't absolutely sure they have it right, the receipt will be rejected.  If you tell them what it is, and it looks reasonable to them, you're good to go.  For example, if the receipt just says \"Scott's,\" they don't know if it's toilet paper or lawn fertilizer.  You want to make it clear for them, or they'll reject it if there's any doubt.  \n\nAlso, since it's a human looking at your documents, the easier you make their job, the more likely you will get a quick approval.  I'm guessing they only have a certain amount of time to work on each approval, so if yours is gonna take a while because they aren't sure about something, they'll just reject it and move on.\n\nI had two of my first 3 receipts approved, but they wanted another one because the third was from Shopko, and you couldn't tell exactly what the items were just from the receipt.  However, another important point is that these approvals are cases, so you need to be prepared to respond quickly if they have any questions.  If you do not respond within 48 hours, your case is closed.  Period.  That means that you shouldn't submit your initial approval application unless you are able to meet that deadline until you are actually approved.  You may have to go to the store again, you may have to take better pictures, etc.  That all takes time, so make sure you have some time available over the next few days just in case.\n\nAlso, once I was approved, they sent a sort of form email, and one of the things it said was that they have seen that sellers are most successful when they have more than 40 items in each category.  Seems obvious on the surface, but you might also infer that when getting approval, you would want several different items rather than just three receipts of all the same thing.  \n\nApologize for being long and kinda rambling, but the last thing I'll say is that if pictures are required (for some categories), they are STRICT on the image requirements.  Meet them or else.  \n\nNah....I lied.  One more thing.  I have read on the Amazon forums as recently as last week with people saying it can take weeks to months to get approved in certain categories, and in my case, someone said weeks for Health and Personal care, but I got approved in under 24 hours even with one receipt rejected, and I believe it was because I was proactive, knew the rules,  and made the job easy for the person who got my case.\n\nHope this helps!\n","76":"[H] 2x$25 Amazon Giftcards [W] $40 PayPal","77":"Hi.

My current status: 3-4 y\/o BofA Cash Rewards CC w\/ $900 limit, no income other than SSI &amp; modest family aid but looking for my first job soon, no debt, credit score ~705 (should be higher, but need to clear up some discrepancies on my credit report). I\u2019ve been pretty careless about paying off my credit card on time, but am trying to make it more of a priority. \n\nI\u2019m interested in acquiring 1 or 2 more credit cards with better rewards programs and no annual fees, as well as increasing my credit limit on my existing card (it\u2019s only been done once the entire time I've had it). Would love feedback on if these are good moves (my mom said that I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for a credit card without an income). The cards I am interested in are Sallie Mae Mastercard, Citi Double Cash, Capital One Quicksilver, and Chase Freedom (was planning on picking 2 of these to apply for and assuming at least one rejects me, not sure if that\u2019s smart). I don\u2019t really buy gas or travel or spend much on groceries, so would use the cards mainly for bookstores\/Amazon and generic shopping. Are my chances good with any of these cards, or should I be looking at others?\n\nMy current plan is, in order, to **1)** fix the credit report discrepancies (a couple collection accounts that were paid off but are still listed as \u201cpast due\u201d) **2)** wait 3-6 months to build up a brief but consistent history of paying my credit card bill on time, and **3)** apply for both credit cards at once to limit the impact on my score. I just can\u2019t figure out when to ask for a credit line increase (in tandem with the new card applications?) \n\nIs this a sensible plan, or there something I\u2019m missing? I guess I'm mainly concerned about the timing of everything so the applications go through and without overly impacting my score. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time reading the sidebar, but since I\u2019m not sure yet what my employment prospects are with SSI restrictions, it\u2019s been a bit confusing to plan my financial future (tackling my Roth IRA is next, which seems even more complicated). Would love any advice!\n\nEdit: in case it helps with getting a better picture of my financial health, I have about 2k in a savings account, have never overdrawn or hit the max limit on my card, and have never taken out a loan of any kind.","97":"I have an Apple store gift card that I'm willing to trade for the amount listed above in Amazon credit. **Note: This is Apple STORE and not iTunes.

I always round up a lb so i paid for 7lbs for the new in box one. I check my invoice today and i was blown away at my current charges for shipping. I looked and the box that was sent with the loose guitar went from 5lbs to 17lbs. The new in box one went from 7lbs to 32lbs.

They have an energy drink that is 100% legal (no illegal substances in it) and all they are doing is capitalizing on the marijuana boom.\n\n#2. They've signed some distribution deals including with Dr. Pepper.\n\nNow I've tried asking around whether anyone has heard of Totally Hemp Crazy drinks before. Can't seem to find anyone from Colorado that has heard of them. Apparently they sold these drinks on Amazon recently and they sold like hot cakes.\n\n#3.

They signed a deal with the same marketing company that promoted Redbull and Monster\n\nNow Monster Energy drink was once at .25 cents back 10 years ago or so. Could this be the next Monster?

Anyways, lets get started.\n\nIncome:   \nI own a few websites and make about $900-$1800 a month via Google Adsense and Amazon Affiliate Program. Along with that I work in the summer and make another 2-3k in the summer. So Im getting about 20k a year in income. I have about $55k saved up so far.  \n   \nExpenses:    \nI spend about 4k of that a year to help my parents pay for college, 1k on expenses such as phone\/entertainment\/gas. the remaining 15k goes into my bank.\n    \nMy Goals:      \nI want to help my parents pay for college as more of a pride\/kind gesture thing, and I'm a freshman right now. One of my goals was to get an Audemars 15400 Watch before I graduate ($9k-$12k). I'm studying engineering right now and my expected starting salary is 75k a year. My next goal was to get a 04 Ferrari 360 before I'm 30. ($80k).\n    \nMy questions:    \nMy parents are co-signers on my bank account and I don't like it, what is the nicest way to get rid of that?     \nI was wondering what I can do with the money I have now so I don't lose to inflation, and maybe get a return on it.    \nHow much would one need in the bank to be able to afford a $70k car?     \nIs there any other smart advice you can give me?    \n","135":"Hi, I'm the guy that told you about why I prefer product-based business check out my post \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhere:http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/32qc9b\/why_ill_always_choose_products_over_services\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday, I'm going to save you $5000 (keep in mind there are many complexities to Amazon you wont' run into 99.9% of them)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf any of you have Facebook, and have any entrepreneurial aspirations you\u2019ve seen it.  It\u2019s Amazon course season and the prices are more ridiculous than ever.  So I\u2019m a going to tell you to push the pause button on buying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese causes promise you the world.  They after \u201cmasterminds\u201d cool software, and fancy getaways to Vegas maybe even Miami.  Well, I\u2019ve made this post to steer you in the right direction and tell you everything yo need to succeed in the products business. Start small $500 could set up you up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmazon\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo profit massively and have free time on your hands use FBA, Fulfillment by Amazon, service.  You need a Professional Seller account. It\u2019s $40.00 bucks a month. Don\u2019t cry. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCreate a Brand\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe nature of any internet marketing is the niche.  Pick a product category you are interested in and makes money. The top categories on Amazon are Supplements, Health and Beauty, Kitchen and Dining, and Mobile Accessories.  There are other categories but these are the major players.  Choose a category with low competition your rise to the top will be quick.  Choose a high competition category and moderate success can still set you up.  It is best to aim for a mix of both, although it comes down to preference. So you creation of multiple brands is a must.  Two low competition categories are \u201cSports and Outdoors\u201d and \u201cTravel\u201d\u2026you\u2019re welcome. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe In-Demand Product\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is the hardest part of the journey.  Luckily, Amazon has a ranking system.  Additionally, you may want to make Google Trends your best friend.  To find products past the 100 BSR mark use this search string: [\"Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #200 in Kitchen &amp; Dining\" site:Amazon.com] Use Google Replace the number you want Replace the category you want as well Sometimes the number you want won't come up, the results will jump around, this is because of Google's algorithms concerning traffic for the most part.  Any product that is in the 1-1500 range is good. Do not get hung up on trying to find the \u201cperfect\u201d product. You want to build a brand, you\u2019ll be investing in many products. See your products as stocks or investments.  Make sure your product is light weight and small to help you when it comes to shipping cost.  Do your research on regulations on and certifications for your product in your country (Supplements, I don\u2019t suggest these on your first go around).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSourcing \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother level of difficulty, but you can make it easier if you know what you\u2019re doing.  \n\nTwo ways to source:  You can Google [private label\/wholesale\/OEM  (insert product name here)] \u2013or- you go to these sites:\n\nAlibaba.com: Gold Supplier over one million in sales to avoid getting scammed use  Paypal\n\nAliexpress.com: wholesale marketplace\n\nDhgate: Wholesale, full OEM services sometimes, free shipping sometimes, FREE SHIPPING A HUGE PLUS\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nALWAYS ASK FOR SAMPLE\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShipping\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you can get free shipping go for it.\nShipping is a lot to fit in here.  But it is not complicated at all.  \nCourses try to confuse you, to make you think it\u2019s super difficult but it is not.  Factories have a lot of experience and can guide you through the process you follow.  \n\nWant more details you go to: http:\/\/www.chinaimportal.com\/blog\/sea-freight-shipping-from-china-guide\/\n\nCalculate custom charges and shipping cost before it arrives, you don\u2019t like surprises.\n\nYou need help talk to a freight forwarder. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFBA Requirements\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMake sure you aren\u2019t shipping more product than you are allowed you have.  You\u2019ll begin with 5000 unit limit unless your product is oversized like a yoga mat. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHave your supplier limit any additional instructions or papers on outside of the boxes shipped.\nAmazon provides a shipping label, tell your supplier it should be the largest thing outside the box.  Amazon likes an invoice like document on top of products shipped (inside the box).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYour product should have what\u2019s called a UPC, you buy one here: https:\/\/www.cheap-upc-barcode.com\/bc_cheap.php\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf this isn\u2019t present in barcode form on your packaging, you will need stickers applied to the packaging  of each item you ship.  Sometimes your factory will provide this service free, or Amazon can apply them for you for a fee. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI usually have my first package from a new supplier shipped to my house first to see if they followed my instructions.  After the initial shipment, which should be small send them off to the assigned FBA warehouse. \nAfter correcting the factory you should be able to have them send it direct to the FBA warehouses. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow your Products on Amazon\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4 things matter on Amazon, NOTHING ELSE.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPICTURES: Picture quality correlates with sales stock photos aren\u2019t going to cut it. Get pictures that feature your packaging.  Follow Amazon\u2019s rules regarding pictures.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nREVIEWS:  You will need them to get sales.  Start with friends and family if not supportive.  Offer a giveaway and come to Reddit, get there email address, bug them until they leave a review.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSALES:  You\u2019ll need to bump your BSR.  This raises you for keywords your product should appear in .  After about 20 or so reviews from redditors, friends, and family then go to a\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLaunch Service\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe \u201cbig\u201d secret courses are pushing.  You probably heard of Zonblast, great but overpriced.

Just wanted to pass along my recent experience with Amazon Warehouse Deals [AWD].\n\nSo maybe I'm the only one who doesn't know this, but AWD is not considered to be \"Amazon\" as the seller.  What that means is that though Amazon will back up their return policy, which is pretty sweet, they will in no way take any responsibility for the sale of the item, no matter how misrepresented or inaccurate the description was.  \n\nI recently purchased a Shop Vac for what I thought was a great deal, and it was described as \"with 5% or less of surface area with cosmetic defects.\" Sounded pretty good to me, as I am personally afflicted with a much higher percentage of cosmetic defects.  However, they didn't mention that it was missing the tool rack, the wet filter, and the liner bag.  So I did what I usually do and gave Amazon a ring.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm just an idiot who doesn't understand how things are supposed to work, but I was under the impression that this was actually inspected by an Amazon employee working at an Amazon warehouse somewhere, and that by their oversight I would be assisted in finding replacement parts.  However, the customer service agent explained to me that Amazon Warehouse Deals is really just a shipping service and that though Amazon would honor the return\/refund\/exchange policy, they were in no way responsible for the misrepresentation of the condition of the item being sold.  Sad face. \n\nI suppose maybe this might have been common knowledge and I was a fool for not reading the ultra-fine print at the bottom of the website, but I thought this to be a bit of a deceptive practice.  So much so that I broke my silence to the frugal audience and thought it should be passed along to you all.  Please correct my ignorance if I'm the guy in the wrong.\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon Warehouse Deals is a shipping division of Amazon, not a seller, and not responsible for the labeling or description of the products being sold, no matter how inaccurate or misrepresented it may be.\n\n**EDIT\/Clarification:** I felt that because Amazon performed the inspection of the product and advertised it as complete that they should have been responsible for either replacement parts or an exchange, but because it's a Warehouse Deal they can only issue a refund and do not hold themselves responsible in any meaningful way for selling an item with an inaccurate inspection report.  At the moment there are no replacements for the Vac at the price I paid, so I'll either have to pay more to get a replacement or wait until another shows up at the price I paid.\n\n**EDIT2:**  So I may have spoke too soon.  Amazon contacted me and offered to give me 30% off the price of the vac if I could find the replacement part on my own.  They took ownership of the mistake in their product inspection and offered to amend it.  Once again they rank as my personal favorite in customer service, and I'll be left eating my words.

The primary goal was for it to be an Amazon affiliate marketing site in a very niche industry, refrigeration. I didn't necessarily come from the refrigeration industry but I ran an eCommerce business in 2013 selling refrigerants and figured why not try affiliate marketing? **(For those asking, my eCommerce business was not stable enough to stay afloat, long story!)**\n\nAfter about a month of having it up I realized that it affiliate marketing was no easy task. I wasn't getting anywhere, maybe 3-5 views a day at most. There had to be a better way.\n\nWell, I had always read content was king. So, I set out on adding as much content as I could. I have about 110 posts\/pages now and am starting to average about 250-300 views per day. I know it's not much but it is a definite increase to what I was seeing. Linked In has been a godsend when it comes to views. Their industry groups are great. I provide relevant information and they come visiting.\n\nOn top of blog posts and news articles I have been trying to think of other ways to draw viewers to my site. One great idea I had last month was create practice certification tests for HVAC technicians to take on my website. This would allow them to test their skills without having to pay for a test. Since I launched this last month I've had over 700 quizzes taken with each visitor hanging around the site for 10-15 minutes at a time. (Taking their time on the quiz.)\n\nAnother feature of the site is the ability for customers to request bulk refrigerant by the pallet. I have arrangements made with various refrigerant distributors that I will forward on any bulk requests in exchange for finder's fee if the customer orders. (5% is negotiated amount.) I've had a few people ask for bulk and I've forwarded them on but have not seen any actual deals yet. (A lot of people just shop pricing.)\n\nBesides the quiz and the bulk purchasing I went ahead and added a bunch of other affiliate products to my site recently such as refrigerant racks, refrigerant scales, recharge kits, etc. I've seen some success with these products, but nothing crazy. (Sold 2 racks yesterday)\n\nI am trying to think of absolutely anything and everything I can add to my site to get people coming. My questions to you are:\n\n* What features do you feel my site is lacking?\n\n* What do like about the site?\n\n* What don't you like about the site?\n\n* And, the most important how can I earn more per month on this site?\n\n* Can you think of a way I could capitalize on users spending 20-25 minutes on one page taking a quiz?\n\n\n**For those of you wondering about profit April has been my best month so far. I've made $75 on Amazon Affiliates and another $250 for writing an article for a refrigerant distributor. So, this month so far I've made $325.**\n\nMy goal is to have this site getting 25,000 views a month or more in 2016.\n\nWebsite: http:\/\/freonshopper.com\n\nThanks,\n\n","200":"On one of my accounts I can't order a bing reward.

I'm a part-time student in Web Development, full-time mom to two boys under 3. My husband is a full-time student with a 3.7 GPA and a full-time worker ($12\/hour, 40 hours a week.) I worked part-time until I gave birth to our second child. We can't afford childcare. My husband deserves a gold medal for the hard work that he does. He's currently majoring in economics and minoring in statistics and hopes to graduate next fall. He hopes to pursue a Masters in Analytics (or Statistics).\n\nSo there's hope for our financial situation, but right now we are basically struggling to put food on the table and keep the lights on. I keep making unrealistic budgets and we never stick to them. I know that we don't have room for a lot of savings right now, but I'm having trouble planning for unexpected but necessary expenses. Right now it's not even close to the end of the month and we have $20 in our bank account. $20! So, I'm coming to you to see what we can do to better our monthly situation.\n\n**Monthly income: $1773.12** (it's usually a few hundred dollars higher because he usually has to work overtime if a worker doesn't show up for his shift, but this is pretty much the lowest it would be)\n\nMandatory expenses:\n\n* Rent = $700 (tiny 2bed\/1bath. rental prices in our city have skyrocketed in the past few years, we probably couldn't change this)\n* Electricity = $83 (house is old and poorly insulated)\n* Water\/Sewer\/Trash = $68\n* Internet = $47\n* Car Insurance = $66\n* Gas (Heat) = $57\n* Transportation ~ $80\n* Food ~ $350\n\nThis leaves us with about **$323** left over after our bare necessities are covered. \nHere's where I think it's going:\n\n* Phone - $60\n* Gym - $20\n* Entertainment (media subscription services like Hulu\/Netflix) - $20\n* Diapers\/Wipes - $35\n* Dog food - $10 (we buy in bulk)\n* Costco Membership (annually $50) - $4\n* Amazon Prime Student Membership (annually $50) - $4\n\nThis leaves us with about $170 at the end of the month in our worst month. On paper. I've even used Mint to track spending but I'm still unable to account for where our money is going.  Unexpected or irregular expenses come up all the time and I'm not planning for them (a birthday, an oil change, holiday, buying a sale item in bulk, parking ticket, fast food etc)\n\nWe don't need a lot of money to survive, but where are we going wrong? I lay awake thinking about how we're going to make it to the next paycheck. We always do, but our finances feel out of control. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","203":"How To Get An Amazon Affiliate ID In Less Than Two Years","204":"[H] Amazon GC 5$ [W] 5$ PayPal","205":"3 Ways Amazon.com Proves Its Spot as a Customer Service Champion","206":"Amazon's Web Services boosts 1Q revenue","207":"H]Paypal\/Starbucks [W]Amazon GC","208":"[H] \u00a310 Amazon GC [W] Paypal 80%","209":"[H] $50 Amazon E-Gift Card [W] $50 itunes E-Gift Card","210":"Amazon Fire TV Stick Review \u2013 A Cord Cutting Solution?","211":"[Here's the details.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gnL6wFh.png) 100 50\u00a2 Amazon gift cards could net me $50 Amazon credit for $30 per month.

Please make note that this is in REAL TIME, not a fictional story in any way. I\u2019m going through this as i type this. I'm utilizing this as a form of therapy, information to those interested and hopefully some insight from successful entrepreneurs. So for everyone out there with any advice, I'm all ears.\nI have been running a \"start-up\" for right under 3 years. My venture in \"start up\" world started late 2012 around July. Long story short, i became a \"product designer\" by accident, i designed an idea for a product that didn\u2019t exist. I put in R&amp;D time, did some manufacturing researched, hired an engineer to design my cad, received manufacturing costs, set up a base $ amount needed, included other costs id inquiry yet trying to kept the total $ amount as low as possible. Once i allocated my total, i make a video and setup a KickStarter page. After 45 days of running i managed to hit the targeted goal, raising $36,750, out of the $34k goal i set. I wanted to keep the backers happy and assure a quick turn around of the products so i sent payment and began the manufacturing. Keep in mind, i have ZERO knowledge in retail manufacturing business, at the time i had a part time job at a media company. At this point I thought of my self being fairly good with the computers and figured I could design the retail packaging and the insert design, along with the company logo, \u2026the website, \u2026\u2026take the product photos, i decided to do EVERYTHING besides manufacturing and engineering the cad... and i did exactly that. I made the box, the insert, the logo, the website, took all the product photos. All this took me almost 4-5 months. I received the manufactured goods 3 months after the campaign ended. My mold was at the factory and for the first order we made 3000 pieces, half of which were KS backers. I took it upon myself to packaging each product retail wise, and prepare for shipping and printed shipping label and send out. At this point i have to mention that i quit my part time job. The only thing I had in mind while I was doing one task was thinking about what my next move is.\n2013, KS is all done and I set my mind out to \"hit retail stores\". I have zero clue about how I will go about this, all i knew is i have to reach someone in a retail store with buying power. Some how i drew attention and i got a \"distribution\" deal. They sent me a contract that was very big and very wordy, so I hired a lawyer who specialized in this matter, I'm ashamed to say it but it cost me about $10k for a fancy lawyer to review over my documents (over 38 pages of legal language) and basically to be sure that if i ever honored a PO from this distributor that i would not get fucked and they wont hold my product or not pay me. So in my mind, i justified spending that money was right, \"if this would get me into Best Buy and Target, then its worth it.\" I told myself. So at this point in my mind, i feel like I'm doing all the right things. Family, friends, former co-workers are all telling me to go on Shark Tank, or \"ill be a millionaire\" and all i would to is cringe. I HATED hearing that. Hell making a million would be fucking awesome! but all bs aside, just making a living doing what i enjoy and providing for my family is all i can ask for. Lawyer said contract is good, i had nothing to worry about, send me a formal typed up letter explaining what he read, i signed the contact sent it back to distributor and they began sending me POs. Id get their PO, send products to one of their 2 distribution centers and from there the distributors sales people would try to sell my product to buyers. Got it on Best Buy DOTCOM, not in store, as a trial. Apple was interested but my products packaging they said had to change and not show non-Apple brand products on the box which meant NO, or redo packaging\u2026. At the time I couldn\u2019t afford to redo packaging for an unsecured-deal. I was barely getting out of the door I needed to get some business first. Mean while, independently from the distributor, i managed to secure 2 other retail store chains (not huge types, the kind that are state wide with 3-4 locations) and i sent orders directly from my warehouse to their main store\/distribution store. My orders quantities were not like how EVERYONE imagines of 10,000 - 100,000 pieces... i wish. These were 40-100 pieces per PO, nothing major but I was happy. I felt like everything is going the direction a business should be going.\n2014, I spent a lot of the business money. From designing prototype, manufacturing mold, manufacturing pieces, shipping, packaging, cost of living, lawyer fees i was down to a few thousand left and i had to put in a follow up order. Which i did so in order to have inventory to ship out, with the hopes that there are more orders to come................. this is where i got desperate. I felt that i played all my cards..., i felt that i played it as right as i can, to the best of my knowledge... but i knew something was wrong. Something was not happening to me, i wasn't getting a boom of sales, i wasn't getting social media hype, i have zero education in this aside from what i have self taught my self up to this point and i feel that the time is coming where my money will be gone and i will be broke and fucked. I need a job....... ......thinking about that feels like falling from the tallest building. Not because having a job sucks, its because i came this far and i assumed i did it all right but i can't survive. This is the world of being an entrepreneur, but shit i thought i was starting out this \"start up\" thing right. So i did what id assume any business man would do and began to \"promote\" (i say that in quotations because i have zero fucking clue what I'm doing, just assuming). I began emailing and DMing anyone who would listen to me, id offer famous people free product, anyone with large following for \"shout out\" anything......................... non of it helped. Still no boom in social media, no plugs, one artists asked me how much money I have in my wallet to take a photo with my product with him, he ended out letting me take a photo of him with my product but he told me to post it myself, but then that means only my 200 followers would see it, lol how useless is that? Aside from literally giving away product, non of that helped me get attention social media wise or get sales. During the time of contacting artists and meeting with their managers, one manager asked me if i can help make something, i asked what, they described it to me, told me that the artist wants this product, can't find it, wanted to see if you can help make it. Of course i said yes, and i assumed id duplicate the same steps i took for my product. The manager told me the product idea, i did R&amp;D, confirm it didn't exist, and its possible to be made, with 100% doubt in my mind gave them a BS quote (no clue what i was charging for aside from the actual cost of material with it slightly increased charges, so i make some money.... i know i charged them wrong), they accepted and wanted to do it. I wrote and tried to be very clear to the manager that they are paying for a mold, and the designing of a product that does not exist. I wanted them to be clear so they will not be under the impression that they are ordering tee shirts and its just printing an image on a tee. Manger said they are clear, they understood they are paying for a mold, and designing, and parts, and assembly and retail packaging and shipping etc. They ordered 10,000pieces,..................... sold out. They obviously used their fame to sell the items which it clearly did. They never gave me or my company any credit, which is fine, no favorable plugs for MY product, the product that we met over and you know what, i swallowed my pride and was thankful for the opportunity and mentally knowing that i created a second product, one that i did not come up with, yet i designed and manufactured, heck i even have the rights to the mold, we never signed any documents or anything. Yet i try to live correctly, i don't plan on manufacturing the item i made for them and selling it independently, but i do contact them and ask if they're interested in re-ordering supply? They reply with \"No, it cost to much.\", which bothers me because when they received their product i tried to explain to them the retail value for this can range from $60-$100 and they under priced it to $50, of course i can't tell them how to do their business but they must have not made enough or don't understand the concept of a mold, which i tried to explain, but its fine. Now i am stuck again with low funds because i under changed this job with hopes of it helping me get noticed for my product and \"making products for clients\", but no, again i notice there isn't any follow up POs coming in, my social media and online orders aren't up, and I'm running low on funds............ i need a job. Then fall came, and i was prepared. I had products sitting around waiting to be shipped, i felt the \"holiday\" season coming, at the same time i was introduced to a person who worked at a place where they basically do \"online distributing\", they setup online stores at major e-commerce sites like Amazon and NewEgg and sell products, but they use their SEO magic (SIDETONE, i have ZERO knowledge behind SEO, i understand what it is sort of but don't get how to utilize it myself) which will help sell my product, they just take a fair % to cover their cost and for the sale, I reviewed over their agreement and agreed, i figured why not, they have a 30 day termination notice, so i can cancel the contract anytime without any penalty. At the same time I also finally set up an Amazon store (this was one of the last things i did, which i know i should have done first) along side this other company who had magical SEO skills. Well the holiday was good, sales were up and consistent and i was happy but nothing outrageous, it was like $2,500-$3,000 for the month (non B2B, just direct online orders), but again that was the holiday rush and it made sense. Another round of follow up POs from the tiny retail stores came in, and the on line sales we had from the holidays allowed me to place another order to restock our inventory. Immediately after the holiday rush, online sales dropped, those retailers haven't sent any follow up POs, and funds are draining... which brings us to today.\n2015. Right now shits bad, i don't know what i will do next... at this point i guess i am starting all over. How i feel right now is that my product is 3 years old and to me, it just feels like an old movie. I'm able to set that aside and tell myself \"to other people this is a new product dummy!\", but at this point I'm scared, I'm scared of doing this cycle all over again and still being a one man start up. At this EXACT MOMENT, i am working on re-branding my company, taking it from one product and brand, to a new brand name, new domain and adding 1 additional product to the one we already have. All this is costing money, the web designer, the graphic artist, the guy that I hired that is making my logo, all this is costing me my last cents. I am operating as a cash-forward format. I don\u2019t have any invested funds and have no idea where to go for that. Unfortunately I feel like these modern investment companies are looking for App based ideas to invest in yet I\u2019ve been operating and sustaining all out of pocket, which tells me there is room for profit, I just don\u2019t know how put myself in front of someone with that power. With my new plan and product, I have intentions of hopefully get notoriety. I want to get investors to support me. If I am able to get the attention of the retailers, bloggers and sustain this many years, id imagine if i had some quality help, and was not left to do it all alone i can definitely earn back the invested amount. If i could do $37k in 45 days, alone... imagine what i can do with quality help.\nI know i have what it takes, i know I'm just as smart as the last guy who got invested, but i don't understand what i am lacking, and most importantly.... my social life....

No pity party here, just venting because right now being a one man start up is very tough and i don't know who or where to turn to for advice.\nQuick Bio Info: Im a Male lol, 32, live in Los Angeles area.

I wrote this free flow form, with no hesitation or conscious effort in grammar or punctuation. I KNOW i made many errors, sorry to all you English majors out there.","236":"Brace yourself for a lengthy read. I want to be thorough for anyone considering beginning a startup. Please make note that this is in REAL TIME, not a fictional story in any way. I\u2019m going through this as i type this. I'm utilizing this as a form of therapy, information to those interested and hopefully some insight from successful entrepreneurs. So for everyone out there with any advice, I'm all ears.\nI have been running a \"start-up\" for right under 3 years. My venture in \"start up\" world started late 2012 around July. Long story short, i became a \"product designer\" by accident, i designed an idea for a product that didn\u2019t exist. I put in R&amp;D time, did some manufacturing researched, hired an engineer to design my cad, received manufacturing costs, set up a base $ amount needed, included other costs id inquiry yet trying to kept the total $ amount as low as possible. Once i allocated my total, i make a video and setup a KickStarter page. After 45 days of running i managed to hit the targeted goal, raising $36,750, out of the $34k goal i set. I wanted to keep the backers happy and assure a quick turn around of the products so i sent payment and began the manufacturing. Keep in mind, i have ZERO knowledge in retail manufacturing business, at the time i had a part time job at a media company. At this point I thought of my self being fairly good with the computers and figured I could design the retail packaging and the insert design, along with the company logo, \u2026the website, \u2026\u2026take the product photos, i decided to do EVERYTHING besides manufacturing and engineering the cad... and i did exactly that. I made the box, the insert, the logo, the website, took all the product photos. All this took me almost 4-5 months. I received the manufactured goods 3 months after the campaign ended. My mold was at the factory and for the first order we made 3000 pieces, half of which were KS backers. I took it upon myself to packaging each product retail wise, and prepare for shipping and printed shipping label and send out. At this point i have to mention that i quit my part time job. The only thing I had in mind while I was doing one task was thinking about what my next move is.\n2013, KS is all done and I set my mind out to \"hit retail stores\". I have zero clue about how I will go about this, all i knew is i have to reach someone in a retail store with buying power. Some how i drew attention and i got a \"distribution\" deal. They sent me a contract that was very big and very wordy, so I hired a lawyer who specialized in this matter, I'm ashamed to say it but it cost me about $10k for a fancy lawyer to review over my documents (over 38 pages of legal language) and basically to be sure that if i ever honored a PO from this distributor that i would not get fucked and they wont hold my product or not pay me. So in my mind, i justified spending that money was right, \"if this would get me into Best Buy and Target, then its worth it.\" I told myself. So at this point in my mind, i feel like I'm doing all the right things. Family, friends, former co-workers are all telling me to go on Shark Tank, or \"ill be a millionaire\" and all i would to is cringe. I HATED hearing that. Hell making a million would be fucking awesome! but all bs aside, just making a living doing what i enjoy and providing for my family is all i can ask for. Lawyer said contract is good, i had nothing to worry about, send me a formal typed up letter explaining what he read, i signed the contact sent it back to distributor and they began sending me POs. Id get their PO, send products to one of their 2 distribution centers and from there the distributors sales people would try to sell my product to buyers. Got it on Best Buy DOTCOM, not in store, as a trial. Apple was interested but my products packaging they said had to change and not show non-Apple brand products on the box which meant NO, or redo packaging\u2026. At the time I couldn\u2019t afford to redo packaging for an unsecured-deal. I was barely getting out of the door I needed to get some business first. Mean while, independently from the distributor, i managed to secure 2 other retail store chains (not huge types, the kind that are state wide with 3-4 locations) and i sent orders directly from my warehouse to their main store\/distribution store. My orders quantities were not like how EVERYONE imagines of 10,000 - 100,000 pieces... i wish. These were 40-100 pieces per PO, nothing major but I was happy. I felt like everything is going the direction a business should be going.\n2014, I spent a lot of the business money. From designing prototype, manufacturing mold, manufacturing pieces, shipping, packaging, cost of living, lawyer fees i was down to a few thousand left and i had to put in a follow up order. Which i did so in order to have inventory to ship out, with the hopes that there are more orders to come................. this is where i got desperate. I felt that i played all my cards..., i felt that i played it as right as i can, to the best of my knowledge... but i knew something was wrong. Something was not happening to me, i wasn't getting a boom of sales, i wasn't getting social media hype, i have zero education in this aside from what i have self taught my self up to this point and i feel that the time is coming where my money will be gone and i will be broke and fucked. I need a job....... ......thinking about that feels like falling from the tallest building. Not because having a job sucks, its because i came this far and i assumed i did it all right but i can't survive. This is the world of being an entrepreneur, but shit i thought i was starting out this \"start up\" thing right. So i did what id assume any business man would do and began to \"promote\" (i say that in quotations because i have zero fucking clue what I'm doing, just assuming). I began emailing and DMing anyone who would listen to me, id offer famous people free product, anyone with large following for \"shout out\" anything......................... non of it helped. Still no boom in social media, no plugs, one artists asked me how much money I have in my wallet to take a photo with my product with him, he ended out letting me take a photo of him with my product but he told me to post it myself, but then that means only my 200 followers would see it, lol how useless is that? Aside from literally giving away product, non of that helped me get attention social media wise or get sales. During the time of contacting artists and meeting with their managers, one manager asked me if i can help make something, i asked what, they described it to me, told me that the artist wants this product, can't find it, wanted to see if you can help make it. Of course i said yes, and i assumed id duplicate the same steps i took for my product. The manager told me the product idea, i did R&amp;D, confirm it didn't exist, and its possible to be made, with 100% doubt in my mind gave them a BS quote (no clue what i was charging for aside from the actual cost of material with it slightly increased charges, so i make some money.... i know i charged them wrong), they accepted and wanted to do it. I wrote and tried to be very clear to the manager that they are paying for a mold, and the designing of a product that does not exist. I wanted them to be clear so they will not be under the impression that they are ordering tee shirts and its just printing an image on a tee. Manger said they are clear, they understood they are paying for a mold, and designing, and parts, and assembly and retail packaging and shipping etc. They ordered 10,000pieces,..................... sold out. They obviously used their fame to sell the items which it clearly did. They never gave me or my company any credit, which is fine, no favorable plugs for MY product, the product that we met over and you know what, i swallowed my pride and was thankful for the opportunity and mentally knowing that i created a second product, one that i did not come up with, yet i designed and manufactured, heck i even have the rights to the mold, we never signed any documents or anything. Yet i try to live correctly, i don't plan on manufacturing the item i made for them and selling it independently, but i do contact them and ask if they're interested in re-ordering supply? They reply with \"No, it cost to much.\", which bothers me because when they received their product i tried to explain to them the retail value for this can range from $60-$100 and they under priced it to $50, of course i can't tell them how to do their business but they must have not made enough or don't understand the concept of a mold, which i tried to explain, but its fine. Now i am stuck again with low funds because i under changed this job with hopes of it helping me get noticed for my product and \"making products for clients\", but no, again i notice there isn't any follow up POs coming in, my social media and online orders aren't up, and I'm running low on funds............ i need a job. Then fall came, and i was prepared. I had products sitting around waiting to be shipped, i felt the \"holiday\" season coming, at the same time i was introduced to a person who worked at a place where they basically do \"online distributing\", they setup online stores at major e-commerce sites like Amazon and NewEgg and sell products, but they use their SEO magic (SIDETONE, i have ZERO knowledge behind SEO, i understand what it is sort of but don't get how to utilize it myself) which will help sell my product, they just take a fair % to cover their cost and for the sale, I reviewed over their agreement and agreed, i figured why not, they have a 30 day termination notice, so i can cancel the contract anytime without any penalty. At the same time I also finally set up an Amazon store (this was one of the last things i did, which i know i should have done first) along side this other company who had magical SEO skills. Well the holiday was good, sales were up and consistent and i was happy but nothing outrageous, it was like $2,500-$3,000 for the month (non B2B, just direct online orders), but again that was the holiday rush and it made sense. Another round of follow up POs from the tiny retail stores came in, and the on line sales we had from the holidays allowed me to place another order to restock our inventory. Immediately after the holiday rush, online sales dropped, those retailers haven't sent any follow up POs, and funds are draining... which brings us to today.\n2015. Right now shits bad, i don't know what i will do next... at this point i guess i am starting all over. How i feel right now is that my product is 3 years old and to me, it just feels like an old movie. I'm able to set that aside and tell myself \"to other people this is a new product dummy!\", but at this point I'm scared, I'm scared of doing this cycle all over again and still being a one man start up. At this EXACT MOMENT, i am working on re-branding my company, taking it from one product and brand, to a new brand name, new domain and adding 1 additional product to the one we already have. All this is costing money, the web designer, the graphic artist, the guy that I hired that is making my logo, all this is costing me my last cents. I am operating as a cash-forward format. I don\u2019t have any invested funds and have no idea where to go for that. Unfortunately I feel like these modern investment companies are looking for App based ideas to invest in yet I\u2019ve been operating and sustaining all out of pocket, which tells me there is room for profit, I just don\u2019t know how put myself in front of someone with that power. With my new plan and product, I have intentions of hopefully get notoriety. I want to get investors to support me. If I am able to get the attention of the retailers, bloggers and sustain this many years, id imagine if i had some quality help, and was not left to do it all alone i can definitely earn back the invested amount. If i could do $37k in 45 days, alone... imagine what i can do with quality help.\nI know i have what it takes, i know I'm just as smart as the last guy who got invested, but i don't understand what i am lacking, and most importantly.... my social life.... I'm surrounded a bunch of people who lack the same drive and motivation as me. No pity party here, just venting because right now being a one man start up is very tough and i don't know who or where to turn to for advice.\nQuick Bio Info: Im a Male lol, 32, live in Los Angeles area.

This has been a ton of fun so far, and I enjoy learning something new everyday. \n\nI ran into a problem the other day that involved an unexpected (to me, at least) shipping cost to ship a large toy (the toy weighs about 18lbs with the box). I have been moving several of these toys over the week and every time I've had to ship them there was always a priority mail (choose your own box) online option with the usps that would end up costing me around $15 to ship. This allowed me to maintain a profit with each shipment. \n\nOn this particular occasion, the same option was available, but the cost was upwards of $50. At the time I thought the best option was to cancel the order because I would have taken quite the loss had I followed through with shipping. Unfortunately, my seller account on Amazon took a hit as a result of the cancelation. \n\nAny idea on how to handle this situation better without suffering the consequences of negative marks on my seller account?

This sub has helped me go from having zero financial knowledge to feeling like I could maybe become a financially secure adult. I'm an 18 year old high school student who will be attending college soon. I have a checking account and use my debit card for all my purchases. One of the things I knew absolute nothing about was credit cards. It seemed every financially secure adult (and even the not so financially secure adults) have a credit card. So I read up on the sub about credit cards. What I learned was...\n\n\u2022 High APR is not so important as long as I don't hold a balance and pay on time. (Which I plan on doing)\n\n\u2022 Rewards are nice and float around 1-2% and maybe up to 5% for specific purchases.\n\n\u2022 A higher credit line means I can spend more money a month.\n\n\u2022 I need a good credit score to be able to receive a good credit card.\n\nIf anything I have is wrong or I'm missing something please tell me. So with that knowledge, I was able to find a few credit cards I thought would fit my needs. \n\n**Amazon Rewards Visa** - This card has a 3%, 2%, 1% rewards system, for Amazon, gas and restaurants, and everything else. I shop on Amazon fairly frequently so this card seems great.\n\n**Sally Mae MasterCard** - this card seems really good with a 5% on gas an groceries and 1% everywhere else. However, I'm worried I will not get approved for a card like this. \n\n**Journey Student Rewards by Capital One** - this has a 1.25% rewards for everything.\n\n**Citi Thank You** - This card has a 2% reward on restaurants and entertainment and 1% everywhere else.\n\nSo I was wondering if there are any other cards I should consider or which of this cards are no good. I would also love any advice about credit cards in general that I may be missing (like some hidden fees or maybe a credit card initiation blood ritual) that I should take into account. My biggest worry is my credit score. I have no prior credit cards so I assume my history is zilch which is why I want to start building it now. Also, I heard applying for credit cards and being rejected is bad for my score. Also, I was wondering how my decision for a card now would affect me in the future (does my student card evolve into some adult card after college?). Any advice would be helpful and I hope other future high school grads find this thread helpful as they begin a new chapter in their lives.

Seems like its too complicated to start selling online. Too many risks with things like PayPal locking my account or taxing on my parents' accounts. I appreciate everyone who has helped me. I think it's time to start my research for something new :)!\n\nHello Reddit. I'm having a little trouble setting up so I'd like to turn to you guys here at \/r\/entrepreneur for a little assistance. I'll try to go into as much detail as I can, so please bear with me.\n\nI've found a supplier in China, who can provide some good quality goods at a fair price - I've ordered a few and I was very pleased with the quality. I've done some research and I've found similar items selling for about five times the price I'm going to pay for them, so I'd like to proceed and start a business.\n\nI have some knowledge in business, as I took a course before I graduated secondary school. But heres where I'm unsure;\n\nI planned on using Amazon's FBA service as well as selling on eBay, too. As well as that, I'd like to make a e-commerce website and accept payments on PayPal. It seems that you have to be 18 to use Amazon's seller central and they also require me to upload some kind of ID like a passport or driving license (this is apparently something they now have to do under EU law for taxation and such). However, eBay and PayPal will supposedly allow me to sign up if I just use a false date of birth. \n\nHowever, I don't think it's appropriate for me to be using false information in my sign up. I figured that they can close my account at any time and freeze it with any amount of money in there at the time.\n\nI need a little assistance because I could certainly use either of my parents' eBay and PayPal account, however I don't want them to be liable for any errors I make which may lead them to have to deal with negative feedback or disputes (which in hope that wouldn't happen anyway) if something were to go horribly wrong.\n\nI know I can make a website and accept card payments, but I don't really think people will be willing to enter their card details on my website to order a \u00a310 item just yet.\n\nIt's tough because I understand that under EU law, people aren't able to make minors sign agreements, hence why I can't legally have a PayPal. Is there any alternative method I could take? I know some of you may say 'just wait,' but I have a brilliant idea and I'd rather start doing it before there is more competition to deal with.\n\nThanks very much, I really appreciate any support here!","279":"[H]$41.32 PayPal [W] Amazon offers","280":"Hey, I need about $20-25 Amazon GC.

When you go into the more expensive or more electronics territory it's best to go with a well known and better brand (flash storage, Apple cables, etc.).\n\nSo far my laptop bag from AmazonBasics is pretty good since my older bag wouldn't fit my 17.3 inch laptop.","306":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I with they would add that to the sellers app because I cant tell you how many weird hits I have gotten off the buyers app (i.e. $6 for a book, then look on sellers and its .01!!!! When you look at the price on the sellers app it shows the book it $6 not including the $3.99 shipping so I dont understand what is happening there). My galaxy S3 has so much difficulty quickly going from the sellers app back to the buyers app. Maybe it might be the way the programs are written but their are some frustrating delays.\n\nYoull need a bluetooth scanner for the phone and then youll have to use something like scan power which does not require access to the internet it has an updated database stored on your phone. It will probably allow you to scan books 2-3x faster if they have a barcode. Worth it? Up to you.","311":"Amazon itself","312":"*Note: my post only applies if you have a BBR card, if you don't then paying Netflix through gift cards is definitely the way to go.*\n\nI disagree on this.\n\nThe main point of putting Netflix on a BBR card is automation: if you set it up right then you don't have to worry about it ever again, you just collect your $30 every quarter. Although you would technically get more rewards by paying Netflix from gift cards bought at grocery stores, you would also need to spend time making a transaction on your BBR card every month.\n\nAssuming a $8 monthly Netflix subscription and a 6% cashback rate on the gift card, that gives you less than $6 back every year. In my eyes that is a small price to pay for automation. I bought a year's worth of Spotify gift cards at a grocery store and I sure as hell regret it every month when my reminder to buy a $1 Amazon gift card with my BBR card pops up.","313":"Monoprice.com is awesome for that kind of chargers\/cables\/misc. electronic stuff too. \n\nNot sure if the prices are quite as competitive as Amazon, but they still beat the brick-and-mortars.","314":"Correct as I have both. \n\nThe Amazon-branded Chase card has been 3% cash back for years now. \n\nThis is a newly released Amazon Store Card, which isn't affiliated with Visa, Mastercard, or Chase.

These are worlds apart when it comes to prices. You have to remember that the market on Amazon.ca is MUCH smaller, and therefore completely different. For this reason, many things can command a bit more money on Amazon.ca, but you'll be waiting a **long** time to get top dollar on items like these, because you need the correct Canadian buyer to come by.\n\nFor the vast majority of things I find Amazon prices highly inflated.

When you scan an item with the Amazon Seller app, what does it mean when the item:\n\n1. Shows \"Low Price\" but not \"Fees w\/ FBA\" or \"Gross Proceeds\"?\n2. Shows all of the above information but does not have a sales rank?","343":"Great idea - is there a way to see actual sales volume for products on eBay\/Amazon, or are you just talking about how many sellers or something similar?\n","344":"No, it's just [a 2% rewards checking account](https:\/\/www.coastal24.com\/offers\/go-green-checking.html).    Many CUs have similar rates.\n\nIt's easy to make 30 purchases by just loading small amounts at serve.com or buying 50 cent Amazon gift cards for yourself, assuming you buy things at Amazon.  It can even be automated.","345":"Sorry I know this is old...\n\nAre the $750 spent \"at eligible book stores\" mean $750 spent on *anything* at Amazon.com? TV's, microwave, whatever?","346":"&gt; A retail credit card such as Amazon won't have that big of an impact on your credit.\n\nThe Amazon Visa from Chase will have just as much impact on credit as a Discover or Freedom. I don't see OP mentioning a store card anywhere. \n","347":"Okay, I'm confused. If I'm selling something in Canada, do I have to post it to Amazon.ca? I thought I could post to Amazon.com so long as I'd ship to anywhere?","348":"I've had that card since 2009 and it isn't messed up. You are probably reading reviews for the Amazon Store Card issued through Sychrony Bank. \n\nHuge difference between the two. One is a Visa issued by Chase. The other is a store card. \n\nThe Amazon Visa is a good card, even if it isn't an amazing card. 3% from Amazon, 2% on gas and some other shit and 1% everywhere else. It's a good all around card that's easy to get. ","349":"Do you get the 5% back on anything purchased at Amazon, or just books? ","350":"THCZ seems to have  a website that is not even responsive. Try making your browser width narrow, or using a smart phone to visit the page. Plus, they cant even sell it to you from their \"website\", just Amazon. No reputable company would launch a product in this way.  By short imo.","351":"Figuring out what to buy is simple, the item doesn't really matter, it's all about purchase price. Purchase any item cheap enough and you'll turn a profit though sometimes you'll have to hold the item very long if it's not in demand.\n\nSourcing and selling online is hard, people do it between eBay\/Amazon as some people simply don't use both sites, but you're better buying in person and selling online. Do the work other people don't want to do and you'll make the most money, taking the easy way means you get more competition as everyone is trying to take the easy way.\n\nBasically if you're willing to get your hands dirty, you think somewhat outside the box when purchasing and get good deals, you'll make money. If you want to sit at home flipping stuff entirely online, then you're just a glorified drop shipper... and most drop shippers don't make that much money. Some do, most don't.","352":"I have AmazonBasics Speakers. Would highly recommend to ANYONE 10\/10.\n\nJust know beforehand that its a ~$10 speaker that performs like  $40 ones.

According to the librarian a dealer came and bought over $600 worth of books and paid in cash. Soooo which one of you was that?\nI did manage to buy up 4 bags of used CDs and 2 bags of lower margin books. \n\nAlso had a 20% off coupon for goodwill valid all weekend. Visited 4 different goodwills, and managed to pick up a sony CD player, a palm visor pda, 2 evo joysticks, and 11 guitar hero\/rockband guitars (two of which are worth over $130 on Amazon?!). \n\nOverall a pretty good weekend for sourcing, spent only $120 and will make a profit of $700","354":"Amazon Prime does more than just free shipping, I use their instant prime videos as a substitute for Netflix, they also have music and a selection of free digital books available through Prime. The cost per year is a little less, and it has a larger selection of documentaries. ","355":"I bought an AmazonBasics HDMI cable and USB hub. Both still work years later.","356":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Amazon card only able to be used on Amazon?","357":"Does anybody know who the manufacturers are for the Amazon brand?","358":"No, it's just a Visa card co-branded with Amazon and handled by Chase.","359":"Misleading.\n\n1.  \"Live\" and \"DVR\" aren't the only way to watch programming on a TV.  Between Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Chromecast, HTPCs, any recent Bluray player or any recent Smart TV there are plenty of ways to watch streaming video on a full-sized TV.\n\n2.  TV sales is a laughably absurd metric.","360":"The consistent layout is such a big deal that I'm surprised it isn't the default strategy for large chains in every market. I get that legacy stores complicate the concept to the point of being unworkable for a number of locations but you can see that every new location built in the past 15-20 years has a nearly identical footprint. The problem is the constantly changing corporate \"identity\" that results in a small wave of locations built to the \"new and improved\" look only to be superseded by a wave of \"even newer\" look building a few years later. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to buy something at a different location of a major chain (I'm on the road a lot) only to give up and buy the product on Amazon because the layout and inventory are wildly different from my normal store. I came to the store with money in hand and left because I couldn't find it in a reasonable amount of time or they didn't have it. How much business is lost when a slightly fresher look creates inconvenience? The most valuable part of shopping at a chain is supposed to be consistency and constant redesigns eliminate that value.\n\nMcDonalds and many auto manufacturers have half the strategy right in that they choose a design, incentivize their franchises\/dealers to update their location, and then *stick with it* for ~10 or so years. I wish more people caught on to the power of real consistency.","361":"Makes sense, I'll have to start getting out and just use my phone and my brain and see what I can get\/find. I've already got the Amazon Seller App + Ebay's app. \n\nJust gotta actually go look...","362":"Time is n your side.\n\nNow....between now and then, you could try sending a dispute, goodwill, or pay-for-delete letter (Google those) and try and get it removed sooner.\n\nI was relentless in my letters and managed to get all negative marks removed via dispute and goodwill letters.\n\nI never sent any to the credit union about my repo, because they never sued me for the outstanding balance, so I just let that one set and ride.\n\nI was able to start rebuilding my credit year-over-year with it reporting, and when it finally fell off, my FICO scores jumped nearly 100pts across the board.\n\nWhat are your scores?\n\nWhat else is on your reports?\n\nTry and get a card from a department store that is backed by GE\/Synchrony bank.\n\nNo annual fee and you can request a credit limit increase every 4 months without a hard pull on your credit.\n\nWalmart, belk, Amazon are 3 that I carry just for that ability alone. (Plus Walmart gives free TU FICO monthly, too)","363":"You should visit online stores that try to agregate US-made products. Amazon has a lot of (but it can be difficult to filter). ","364":"Had my best haul since I started flipping. Did a few local garage sales in my neighborhood, first one I saw a stack of GameCube games and found several games worth a good chunk on Amazon. Sold Super Smash Bros Melee within an hour of listing it, and sold Zelda Ocarina of Time + Bonus Master Quest the same day and still have ~$100 more worth of games to sell all for a whopping $5 spent. \n\nEnded up picking up a few old PS2's for $5 each, plan on trading in for $20 credit at GameStop until I have enough saved up for a PS4. Traded in a few already. ","365":"I accidently listed a video game as \"Like New\" and it has visible scratches, but seems to work just fine. The order is pending on Amazon, do I cancel it, message the buyer and let them know the actual condition, or what? I was the lowest price regardless of condition, it was a $10 gamecube game. ","366":"My biggest blunder taught me more about flipping than I could imagine.  \n\nOver 250 new still sealed collegiate DVDs.  Almost all of them were in 2, 3 and even some 4 DVD holder cases.  Looked them up on Amazon and they sold for $40+ each.  Nabbed them all for $50.\n\nTook them home, sorted them.  Then learn about sales rank.  Lowest rank was 3million plus.  That hurt.\n\nThen look elsewhere and on ebay and half.com, they sell for $2.25 if that each.\n\nLots of 20 on ebay for $15 and not selling.\n\nIn a fit of rage, I took them to a dumpster and enjoyed hearing them get crushed and destroyed.\n\nThen I found out that the cases, since they held multiple discs, would have sold for $15 or more in lots of ten.  I could have made $150 or more on empty cases alone.\n\nLots to learn...","367":"They're not always the best value purely on price - think, for example, iPhone\/iPad Lightning cables, where many cheaper options are available - but anything you might need them to stand behind might be worth a few extra bucks. My wife is super hard on charging cables, and Amazon has stood behind their cables whenever I have had to contact them.\n\nSo while I could buy about 3-4 no-name skeevy cables for the price of one Amazon Basics lightning cables, with the Amazon cable I can online-chat them and they will send me a replacement in advance of returning the bad one. Assuming they even ask for it back, which they do not always.\n\ntl;dr: be frugal, not cheap.","368":"Amazon has amazing batteries!  They have these rechargeable batteries that hold a charge for years!","369":"Overall fees are still quite a bit higher on Amazon, though...","370":"You might have better luck on eBay.

The last time I went to Lowes I was looking for a wire stripper. The floor is a ghost town so I asked at the customer service desk, they didn't know what that was but they directed me to the Hand Tools aisle. There weren't any wire strippers in that section so I checked Electrical where I also found nothing. There wasn't an associate in sight so I went to leave and on my way out I found a section of wire strippers and electrical test tools in the *lighting section*. Yes, those tools are needed for installing lighting but they were in an aisle filled with bulbs, no sockets or wire in sight.\n\nYes, being at the store should be more convenient than buying from Amazon but I don't have time to scour every aisle.

This item is very highly ranked, so I know if I get the buy box, they'll sell in a matter of hours. However, Amazon is selling the item, and at their price, I can't make any money.  The only way I'd make money is to match the next highest FBA seller.  So is it worth it to send these items in and wait until Amazon sells out (in which I'd then be next in line for the buy box), or just return them to the store and save my time and $100.  Thanks!","414":"Which benefits are you talking about? I think they can put Prime next to third-party sellers if the item is actually fulfilled by Amazon (which is not the same thing as sold-by Amazon), which gets you the free expedited shipping.

Because Amazon has stellar customer service (in truth sometimes too stellar if you are a seller) so I can only think you aren't saying the right thing to the CSR.\n\nIn fact the only real benefit is free 2 day shipping if you purchase through prime: all your other protections are the same. \n\nDid you perhaps purchase a non-prime item, select expedited shipping and are now unhappy about the cost?","418":"Check camelcamelcamel to see how often Amazon sells out.","419":"Agreed.

I strongly suspect that Amazon's algorithms hide books by (self-published) authors who haven't released at least 5-7 books, so just get some stuff out there. They don't have to be long, and they don't really have to sell. I'm currently working on some extended analyses of a few of my favorite albums, I'm going to throw them out under one of my non-erotic pen names, might make a few cents directly but if it makes that pen name have a more impressive back catalogue for Amazon's algorithms, it'll make the more important stuff I release later more profitable.\n\nSocial media is easy, just put links in the back of your books.

The biggest non-restricted categories are probably Toys and Home Improvement.\n\nYou'll get a bunch of items together, add them to a shipping plan, and Amazon will divide them up into individual shipments going to typically 2-4 different warehouses.

My focus was going to be mainly on my site and use the 350 subscriber audience I've acquired over the past few years on youtube\/instructables to drive traffic to the site. Adsense will help with some of the hosting costs but I don't expect it to pay out $1000s a year. What my long term goal idea was, was to get a larger audience interested in the projects I am working on and building and then possibly setting up a shop page on my site. Square space makes it incredibly easy to set up inventory, shipping methods, and payments. The shop would include main components used in my projects. For example, I built a $25 sous vide controller for cooking (compared to $200-$300 devices you can buy). The main component is a temperature sensor\/relay. I could source, say 10 of them, from China for cheaper than you can buy them on Amazon.  I could then direct people towards those products and make a slight profit off of items like that relating to projects I post. I just check page views every now and then. Not terribly concerned with them at this point. When I first started the site 1.5 years ago I was getting maybe 1 or 2 unique hits a day at the most. Most weeks would only show 1 or 2. After a bit of pimping out the site on youtube\/instructables I am now up to 15-17 unique a day and about 750 a month (Some days I'll have 30 or more hits for some reason). I make about a buck a month on ad revenue from adsense on the site. I multiple that a few times over and it'll pay for the annual hosting fees.","518":"As an ex Amazonian (from another area) I can confirm that reps have to average a set number of transactions per hour in most business functions so this should be no different; if something is hard and they have a reason to reject it is advantageous for the rep to reject.

Concentrate on expensive brands that you know.  You're going to be using eBay and Grailed because clothing's a restricted category on Amazon.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst, subscribe to \/r\/Flipping.  Second, get to know your local thrifts like the back of your hand.  Figure out which ones are worth continuing to go to and which ones aren't.  Third, buy a shipping scale off ebay.  Search \"Accuteck\", they work great and they're like $16.  Mine paid for itself in 15 days with the money I saved on postage.  Fourth, head up to the local PO (assuming you're in the US) and grab a few priority mail boxes.  They're free.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo now you're all set up and ready to sell stuff.  Don't go out and start buying stuff yet.  Look around your house and find some old clothes you don't wear or some random crap you never use and throw it up on ebay.  Try to get a couple sales so you can get a feel for how the whole selling process goes down.  Once you feel like you've got the hang of it, start thrifting.  Go to at least one store a day on the way home from school.  Not gonna list brands because I'm assuming you know those but pick up some nice brands and try em out on eBay and\/or grailed.

That is most certainly not the case. How long have you been working for Amazon? ","525":"**tl;dr:** It depends. \n\nMost of what they offer is the about same price (or slightly cheaper, or at most a few pennies more) than the local store, for me at least. Sometimes Amazon Pantry has a coupon or deal, and for *that item* it is definitely cheaper. However, their selection is really limited. For example, last I looked they offer Cheerios but not Chex. If you're more of a Chex fan, that sucks. If you're a Cheerios fan, awesome. If you don't care, cool. \n\nYou'll have to go to the store *anyway* for perishables like meat, eggs, fruits, and vegetables, so one could argue you're not really saving any trips. But you could be making your trips smaller (walk or bike to the local store rather than drive to the larger one farther away?). As the other person put it, you'll have to do the math to see whether gas &gt; shipping. Also factor in time: Amazon pantry is *convenient* and saves you potentially an hour of your time driving and shopping that you could spend doing something else productive.\n\nFor me? I used my $5.99 promo credit, and it was awesome. I felt like the amount of stuff in the box for what I paid was a good deal. I might occasionally do it once in a while when there is a promo or coupon for something I use a lot of. It's really convenient and saved me from having to pick up *everything* at the store for a couple weeks. The convenience factor was more valuable to me than the actual cost. However, it's certainly not something I'd rely on for my groceries, since again the selection is limited and there's only non-perishables. \n\nEdited to add: To maximize the value, try to fill up their \"box\" as close to 100% without going over. I think I got mine to 98% or something like that. Each item takes up a certain amount of space. A small canned good might be 1% but laundry detergent might be 10% and cat litter 20%. Each box is $5.99, so the more in your box, the better the deal.","526":"Are the fees different from selling things outright and shipping them from your home? \n\nAlso is there a good reference of items that are easy to sell? For example, I just looked and Amazon sells Ralph Lauren Polo shirts for $75, which I have bought before at TJ Maxx for around $30. Other than the fees Amazon takes this seems like it could net quite a profit. ","527":"First, make sure it isn't expired or won't expire soon.

Your child needs you far more than ANY employer. Since you decided to have a child, it is NOW your overwhelming priority for the next 18 years or so. End of story.\n\nGet rid of the car. If it's too late to return it, sell it, trade it down etc. etc. What ever you need to do. With your current income you car should be under 10K. Hoping that if you can trade in, add the loss to the cost of a used car trying to stay under 10K if possible.  If not stay as low as possible. You need as much income as possible so dropping nearly $500 a month on a car is not only WAY out of your league but detrimental to your family unit. \n\nPAY OFF that card as quickly as possible. IF you don't have the discipline to use if ONLY for emergencies or convenience but PAYING OFF ENTIRE BALANCE EVERY MONTH then yes cut it up. But frankly if you keep it in a drawer not in someones wallet resisting shouldn't be a problem. I guess you'll find out what you can and can't do, but pay it off ASAP.\n\n\nLastly, there are many different ways you can add to your families finances by working from home. Look into the different options, even things like eBay or Amazon selling. It's relatively easy to make another 500-1000 a month from either of those options.

A life full of love and memories on which someday you'll look back and wonder how in the hell you made it work.\n\nBTW...if the two of you do marry, remember that you're on the SAME team so disregard the small stuff. \n\nI truly wish your family the BEST of luck but remind you that without hard work and sacrifice you'll get nowhere. \n\nBe well\n\n","550":"I don't think it's arguable.  eBay may as well not have customer service.

However, according to the website, I can pay in person at the post office for $6.99 for Standard Post (apparently I *can't* purchase this online?), which would be cheaper than the $7.55 for Priority Mail that I *can* buy online.\n\nObviously a $.0.56 difference isn't going to make or break me, but the shipping credit from Amazon is only $5.49, so I am trying to save as much as I can.

We have family all over the us, so we're flying several times a year. We went ahead and got the card with the yearly fee (not usually recommended on here, tho) because we earned double miles with that card. We get maybe two flights for free per year. And if we don't use the miles we can get cash back or use it on other transportation stuff like my monthly train card. I believe the one without the fee is just one mile per dollar spent. You need 10k miles for a hundred dollars toward whatever. Oh, and for rebuttal cars, the credit card has insurance already, so you don't have to buy the insurance when get a rental if you pay with that card. Supposedly. Testing this out in a month. Unless someone here has a word of caution on the insurance that Capital One provides.\n\nAs for fraud protection, Chase has been amazing. We actually did have someone commit fraud on the card.

First off, we started stocking up on diapers of all sizes months before the birth so we could spread the cost out over time and also before hospital bills and such started coming in.  When we bought diapers it was always in huge boxes from Amazon or Target (when target offers buy 2, get a gift card).  You'll use a massive amount of newborn and size 1 diapers as the baby will go through at least 8-10 every day.  \n\nWith clothing, we buy and sell 90% of child clothing second hand at semi-annual local consignments.  We've bought and sold strollers, infant swings, clothing, toys, etc.  The advantage here is you can almost always sell it for what you paid for it this way unless you really wear something out.  We'll spend $1-3 for shirts instead of $10 retail so you can imagine the cost of a closet full of new clothes.  \n\nNone of this accounts for the massive amount of clothing also provided by grandparents and friends either.  We always asked for either diapers or wipes as those are the things you'll use the most of.  Like TONS of diapers and wipes.  \n\nFor us, the largest expense is daycare and where we live it is relatively cheap at $500\/month.  So buy used, then sell it when baby outgrows it and use that money to buy more used clothing.  It's a wash mostly over time.  Baby doesnt know or care if their toys or clothes are used, so this is the way to go.","566":"Spend the extra $0.56 as I can pretty much guarantee if you send it with standard post (no tracking) you'll be out much more when the person says they didn't get the item and Amazon refunds the buyer. You got no proof it was sent, only that you printed a label, so they will be refunded. The buyer will know you sent it standard as the label says this and it likely took much longer than priority.\n\nAlso know the shipping credit is rarely enough with MF. Figure out what approximate shipping is before you list so you can calculate it into the purchase price.","567":"I am wanting to try and get approved for clothing on Amazon. One of the requirements is a company description. Any ideas to on how I could write this to make flipping sound as best as possible. ","568":"I know you said there's probably not enough money in them to be worth shipping, but check anyway. I know a fair amount of people that have sold similar items on eBay and Amazon. ","569":"What is the difference between ebay and Amazon? I always thought that Amazon required some sort of LLC but now I'm not so sure. Are there stipulations to sell? Tell me if you prefer one over the other.","570":"There have been a lot of good answers. But to determine which is the \"best card\", you first need to define your goals. Some people fly a lot. For these people, there are some cards with amazing signup bonuses, that pretty much make it so they can fly for free wherever they want. Check out \/r\/churning for more on this.\n\nPersonally, I very rarely fly, so I stick with cash back bonuses. The best cards for this are the Citi Double Cash (basically 2% on everything), the Fidelity Amex card (2% back on everything), and the Sallie Mae Master Card (5% on $250 of gas, $250 of groceries, and $750 of Amazon\/bookstores each month). If you spend a lot on groceries, the Amex Blue Cash Preferred is good (6% back on $6000 of groceries per year, with a $75 annual fee). If you spend *a LOT* on groceries, there is an old version of the Blue Cash card that gives 5% back up to $50,000 a year, after the initial $6500 in spending.\n\nThe rotating 5% categories on the Discover IT and the Chase Freedom can be useful for some people as well.","571":"Thanks all. Took a minor step yesterday by not taking $2 for a drink and snack during my volunteer time; instead I skipped the snack entirely and took a bottle of water from home to drink, and will try to do that for the foreseeable future. Of course, if I get one of the positions I applied for there, it might turn into a different story, but at this point I don't know how things will turn out.\n\nI calculated how much I have total between checking account and cash now. In about a month's time (starting Memorial Day weekend) is when I'll start getting my summer allowance, so I'll be getting a little more (not much, though. Roughly half of my total allowance will be going toward loans.) Between now and then I have: 2 monthly phone bills to help pay (only $5, so $10 total), 1 refill on wax filters for my hearing aids ($5; I should get enough to last for about 3 months if I can keep 'em cleaned out some, usually change them out every 10 days along with batteries), and socks\/ toothbrush (less than $20, probably). Do not know at this point if I will have to purchase work clothes before Memorial Day, as job interviews at the science museum haven't started yet.\n\nHard part's going to be resisting the impulse to buy a movie or book on Amazon. I haven't dumped the $100 into my account yet because I'm worried about that precisely happening. I have a very minimal amount in there right now and am deliberately keeping it low so I won't be tempted.","572":"I have: \n\n* Amazon Rewards- 3% on Amazon, 2% on cerrtain categories, 1% on everything else\n* Citibank Double Cash - 1% when you buy, 1% when you pay it off, no limit. 2% seems to be the best for no categories and no limit\n* Discover - Varying percentages for certain categories. I use it primarily for Black Friday purchases because they offer a price guarantee that includes Black Friday events (i.e., go buy a hard-to-get item before black Friday at full retail price, price goes down on Black Friday, you send them receipt and BF ad, they give you the difference).\n* Chase Freedom: 5% on revolving categories (up to quarterly purchase limit), 1% on everything else.","573":"I hadn't considered checking Amazon and will do so now, thank you!","574":"If you haven't already, you should contact the school's financial aid office and see if they can offer you any more aid (aside from loans, since I see from your other posts that you don't want those). Financial aid is negotiable in some cases. If you can present evidence to the school that the parental income listed on the FAFSA is a poor depiction of your actual situation, you may be able to obtain more aid. Since you have already accepted an offer and are enrolled (or will be), it might be too late to do that this year, but you should still try and definitely keep it in mind for next year. At the worst, you will end up with the same package you have now. Also, if you haven't yet, look into independent scholarships (ones not provided by your school). There are tons out there and you can find them through a bunch of different websites (Fastweb.com was the site of choice a few years ago, when I had to deal with this). Get involved on campus as well because many organizations offer small scholarships each year (usually $500-$2000).\n\nDo you know when your tuition is due? Oftentimes it is due in full before classes start. Will you have the $6000 you need by then? My school had a payment plan but it was still only two installments. Half was due first day of classes and the other half was due a month later. If you won't have the money, you will need to take out a loan or not enroll in that school and instead consider a community college or someplace cheaper. People tend to think or all loans as the worst possible thing in the world, but when used correctly they are not. If you're studying humanities, don't take out a loan. If you're studying engineering, a few grand in loans will be totally manageable after graduation with your job that pays $50k+ per year.\n\nOnce you finish high school, will you be able to work more hours? Can you get another job? It will suck and it will be hard, but if you can manage to get your hours up and get a second job, you can save a lot of money. You likely won't be able to find a job to give you over ~35 hours because that comes with all sorts of benefits and things the company won't want to pay for, so you would need to look for another job if you have the time to work 40+ hours per week. Also, when you say you put the $100 in your piggy bank, is that a metaphor for a bank account or do you literally mean a piggy bank? If the latter, open a savings account ASAP! If you have an account already, make sure you are the only one who can touch those funds. With your family in dire financial straits, you don't want to find your account drained by your mother when it's time to pay your tuition (I saw your \/r\/raisedbynarcissists posts). That's not to say you shouldn't help your family, but you should be in full control of when and how much you help.\n\nAs for how to spend your money once you get to campus:\n\n* Don't buy books until after the first day of classes \/ after you email your professor to ask if you REALLY need to book. Often, you don't need it, or you only need it for certain pages for homework problems. If you will need it only for hw assignments, buy it, copy the pages you need, and return it (note: this isn't legal, but no one is going to stop you from copying pages out of a book so...). I suggest buying on Amazon or torrenting. Never buy from the bookstore unless you absolutely have to! Also ask your prof if you can use a past edition of the book. Usually they just update the pictures or page numbers, but the information is the same. I didn't buy a book until my junior year, and even then I only bought a few.\n* Learn how to maximize your meal plan. Learn which places are cheaper or give you more food for the price. Go to a discount store and buy a bunch of non-perishables like poptarts, muffins, ramen, etc. before you go or right after you get to school, that way you won't be tempted to buy that stuff at the inflated on-campus dining prices.\n* Take advantage of the union. Mine offered free events and discounted tickets to events in the city. We got free or discounted concerts, food, ball games, festivals, etc. These can help improve your quality of life so that you don't feel as frugal as you really are.\n* Work on campus. They know you are a student first and will work around your classes and finals schedules more than an off-campus company would.","575":"I sell fiction ebooks. Here's what I would do if I had a children's book.\n\nI'd toss it up on Amazon and only Amazon. Sign their exclusivity agreement so people with Kindle Unlimited can borrow it for free. You get paid for the borrows. If things go well, it'll be popular with kids and\/or parents. Being able to get the book for free is a big plus with kid's stuff because parents get sick of spending a fortune on entertainment for little Johnny only to hear \"I'm bored\" an hour later.\n\nIf your book does really well on Amazon you might get contacted by a publisher (put an email address in your author profile). If they offer you more money than you're making on Amazon, take the deal. This isn't likely to happen but it could.\n\nMinimal effort to do this, potentially high rewards. Amazon has a tool for formatting kid's books to make it even easier - https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/feature.html?docId=1002979921","576":"They're only relatively high when compared to actual terminals. It looks like Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30. This is below fees for similar services. \n\nThis is especially true considering OP runs online business and likely isn't swiping the customer cards him\/herself. In cases like this when you (or, more likely, the customer) has to manually enter their info, and there are often times higher fees. \n\nFor manually entered transactions:\n\n* Quickbooks: 3.4% + $0.25\n* Square: 3.5% + $0.20\n* Amazon: 2.9% + $0.30\n\nSo Amazon is the only one that is comparable. And their fees look like they include a card reader to keep on hand in case you ever do need to swipe a card ($10 initially but that money is credited back to your account once you accept one payment using their service, essentially making the reader free). It doesn't look like Stripe offers an actual reader, which probably doesn't matter to most people running online businesses.\n\nNot trying to split hairs with you at all, but even that small percentage makes a huge difference if you're talking about even a few thousand dollars in sales. \n\nOn another note: I appreciate everyone who recommended Stripe. I have been using Quickbooks Payments (mostly as a result of convenience as I also use their accounting software) service since launching my web consulting business a few months ago. That percentage they take out really adds up. Haven't really had time to research alternatives and had never heard of Stripe. Considering their lower fees and what looks like some useful features, I'm definitely going to look into switching here soon.","577":"Is is possible to flip items online only (or remotely by phone) using Amazon FBA?\n\nScenario 1: I see item X online and buy it.

Even cooler is that apparently Amazon is coded as a bookstore so if you buy things through Amazon that are sold by Amazon and not a 3rd party, you get that 5% back. I might consider getting this if you spend a large portion of your money on groceries and amazon. Not sure if the Sallie Mae card works with Apple Pay, but if that's a priority for you, you just have to know you may be paying for the convenience by using a less lucrative card.\n\nThe other thing to think about is signup bonuses. At 2% cash back instead of 1%, X card would take you $10,000 in spending to get $200 back instead of $20,000. A card like Chase Freedom gives you a $100 signup bonus after spending $500 in 3 months (sometimes it's a $200 bonus, but looks like not at the moment). So depending how much or little you spend, that extra 1% from the Double Cash Card may not be as powerful as getting a good signup bonus.

She takes public transportation to get to us so we'll give her bus money, plus a few extra groceries each week for her lunch\/snacks. \n\nFriend with older boys is always giving us clothing and toys. Clothing and shoes is probably the biggest expense to date, but we are managing fine. I find the best clothing deals at Macy's on the clearance rack. Our second is a boy, so anything new I buy is an investment for two. \n\nI breastfed for the first year until he started whole milk. I had to supplement with formula at some point. Breastfeeding was a huge savings. ETA: my insurance also covered the cost of a brand new breast pump.\n\nI buy store brand diapers and wipes at Target or Costco. The only name brand I buy is for nighttime diapers because we were having way too many bursts (he sleeps 12-13 hours). For that, I use Amazon subscribe and save.\n\nWe put $100\/mo into a 529 plan. \n\nSon is on my husband's insurance at no additional charge. He got really sick and we had a hospital stay, but after some back and forth with the insurance we got them to cover it fully. ETA: child well visits for immunizations have a $0 copay. So far, the only medical expense is his monthly vitamin at $14.\n\nWith the second on the way, we're enrolling my son in daycare. It will cost us $1140 per month. I'll be maxing out the dependent care FSA. Plus I started a new job and my insurance isn't as good as my previous one. I will owe 10% on the delivery, but my max out-of-pocket is $2k and I expect to put that full amount in my health care FSA too.

So, back in the 1940s and 1950s it was discovered that soybeans can be harvested and crushed in order to yield the soybean oil within it.  So, as the increase for meat, eggs, and dairy climbed, the demand needed to be met but, there was insufficient grassland to raise the animal.  At this point, farmers had already been using grain but, eventually wanted to optimize their yields and found that if they replaced their livestock meals with 20%\/80% (soybean\/corn) composition, the yield for animal protein would be far greater than that of a purely corn-based meal.  So if you take a look at the chart on the [second page of this report] (http:\/\/ageconsearch.umn.edu\/bitstream\/92573\/2\/20091023_Formatted.pdf) (or [this]( http:\/\/imgur.com\/9krkt4x)) , you see the large ramp up of soybean production which, oddly enough, you might notice that a lot of the western diet is not actually made up soy foods or soy beans, but rather soy-fed products.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n  \nAt this point, countries like Brazil, Argentina, U.S. and China all produce soybeans primarily to feed their livestock as it has had the largest yield for the animal protein.  \nIn recent years especially you see that a majority of the production of soybeans has been offshored to South America [(Source)]( http:\/\/apps.fas.usda.gov\/psdonline\/psdReport.aspx?hidReportRetrievalName=Table+11+Soybean+Area%2c+Yield%2c+and+Production&amp;hidReportRetrievalID=906&amp;hidReportRetrievalTemplateID=1) in an effort to keep the diversity of crops and livestock at home (Canada, US, EU, etc.).  However, as our demographic\u2019s diet shifts to a less meat (beef in particular diet), other nations have taken over that and essentially shifted the demand to them.   [(Source)]( http:\/\/apps.fas.usda.gov\/psdonline\/psdReport.aspx?hidReportRetrievalName=Beef+and+Veal+Selected+Countries+Summary&amp;hidReportRetrievalID=1639&amp;hidReportRetrievalTemplateID=7)  US and Canada have now demanded more poultry options which are still grain heavy operations.

In the event you are interested in more research, just search Brazil in r\/worldnews and filter out anything about protests.  It\u2019s usually about their lacking water supply and the deforestation that has been ongoing for years.  There have been ongoing murders of land activists for over 20 years [(Source)]( http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2009\/apr\/08\/brazilian-murder-dorothy-stang) who have been protesting the deforestation but, it doesn\u2019t get much publicity as a Big Mac hits much closer to home than the death of 1100 individuals sticking up for their land.\n\n\n**TL;DR** - Soybeans have taken over most crops.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Just formatting stuff","603":"How do you like your Amazon card?

I guess I should have mentioned that it wasn't for ebay, its for Amazon selling.","608":"The problem is your credit union not doubt their job right and you being inconvenienced because of it. \n\nWhy no address the problem first and then maybe worry about if you need a credit card or not. IMO everyone should have a credit card handy. If you get in a real pinch you can always use up your credit and not pay if you have to and like it or not that is more fiscally responsible than not using credit and losing your house, job or car because you didn't have credit handy.\n\nAmazon rewards is OK.. I don't see how it matters much which card you use, they all have very similar stats these days. If you use Amazon then that's a decent enough choice. I wouldn't go with Discover or American Express unless you have to. \n\nThe reason your having these issues is because you don't use a big bank and your credit unions fraud software is crap. I had this issue with a certain credit card when going to a certain walmart, I told them to stop doing it and they basically said they couldn't, so I canceled the card.\n\nIf you want quality services you have to MAKE the bank work for you, you don't just settle on whatever bullshit they throw at you. There is no reason to have a debit card that is overly sensitive to fraud, especially after you've clear the problem multiple times.\n\nIf you get into trouble with the credit card American Express and Discover will go after you more aggressively. Plus they are accepted at fewer places, so it's a lose lose scenario really. They are dicks and less people use them, probably mostly because they are dicks and charge too much. As a consumer you have no incentive to support a company like that, imo. \n\nBut the fact you won't stand up to your credit union suggests you don't care about things like that. I find reward cards mostly overrated personally. If your the type who likes clipping coupons maybe you'll like them, but it seems to be more of a game to try to get people to pick their cards. It's a credit card, it doesn't have to be complex. Get one.. get two.. get three.. try them out. Stop being so afraid of life.","609":"You put it well.

There is no invention necessary, you find a factory that already makes a product you saw on Amazon or on a niche(pet supplies, hiking, etc.) site.  You then create a brand and have that product made.  You create the packaging, promo pictures, and set up the listing on Amazon.\n\nThis is not reselling or retail arbitrage. You could consider it buying wholesale but that's not it either.

After all, what high-quality website will link out to a site that just redirects visitors to Amazon? They may as well just link directly to Amazon themselves (and earn some money in the process).\n\nLike I said, the caveat to this is providing value to your visitors. For example, whack your postcode into this page and you'll see a similar table: http:\/\/www.uswitch.com\/broadband\/\n\nMost of those are affiliate links, but the table actually adds a tonne of value for the visitor. Choosing broadband is an absolutely nightmare; the table makes it simple. Plus, it looks nice and thus, the site has a top-qual UX.\n\nWhatever you're building, it's not going to rank without links, and if it doesn't rank, it's not going to get visitors, and if it doesn't have any visitors, you won't get any affiliate clicks, and if you don't get any affiliate clicks, you won't make a penny.\n\nThe low commissions offered by Amazon (4% - 8% typically) are usually too low for PPC traffic to make sense, so SEO is your only option really.\n\nSo, I'd say just focus on making something great that is actually useful; if you're making something solely to get your Amazon commissions, don't bother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","642":"No, but ecommerce is our top channel.

You recommend to get the first few reviews that you can have your family and friends do this. So do they actually have to purchase the product to write a review or can people just write reviews without buying? Thanks.\n\nEdit: One more question haha. How do accounts on Amazon work for these multiple businesses, can you have an Amazon account for each product or do you create a brand and each product falls in the same niche and brand name? Thanks.","645":"As tempting as this is I don't feel like I make enough purchases on Amazon to make it worthwhile. Furthermore, any money spent on Prime would be less money for actual goods.","646":"Thanks for the reply. So the flow of product (for the first run, so you could check the everything) would go supplier -&gt; packaging factory -&gt; air-shipped your doorstep -&gt; Amazon. Right? Then for a larger run, you'd use a freight forwarder and ship directly to Amazon?\n\nHave you had an issues with packaging factories? I find it a bit worrying since you never really see how the process is done. Have you ever had products damaged along the way?","647":"I'm not sure how this really matters. Even with your own example, if you had purchased a vacuum directly from Amazon and it was missing parts, I'm guessing they would likely do the same thing: allow you to return it - not go parts hunting for it, right?","648":"Amazon mom is your friend.  I spend $28 (after tax) a month on diapers and they're delivered to your door. ","649":"My point was that I bought it \"used\" through a Warehouse Deal where it was supposed to have been inspected by an *Amazon* employee (not the actual company that sells the product) and that Amazon, though advertised as the seller of the product, is not in fact the seller.  The vac was sold under an inaccurate description and there is no recourse other than refund and return; I can't exchange the product because it's a Warehouse Deal and there are no other Vacs at the moment that are listed at the same price.  \n\nI suppose I could have included more details but it was getting pretty wordy as I was writing.  My main point is that AWD is not a seller but a shipping division of Amazon, and there are no protections beyond refund against items that aren't delivered in the condition in which they are advertised.  Caveat emptor!","650":"1.  You can send it to them free through muli-channel fulfillment (manage orders are of seller central) when they review it should count as a verified purchase, have them send you the email they use on their Amazon account and input it into their order.\n2. You can have reviews from people that haven't bought but people see them as less trustworthy.\n3.  Some people do it different ways.  Some have multiple accounts for each brand. But you have to talk to Amazon and get their approval for multiple accounts.  I personally have just one account, I just find it easier that way.  ","651":"I understand your issue but fail to see the \"concern\".     Even if it was sold directly from Amazon there is no guarantee that they have another damaged unit ready for sale.    Your answer would still be the same:   Wait for another deal or get a refund.   ","652":"Its that simple. I essentially did this with more steps, and more crap than I needed to ~~way~~ but I learned from my mistakes from it, a learning process. I did this while working a full time 50-60 hour work week, a then pregnant wife, and a mom\/grandmom that I look after. \n\nWith all the other responsibilities I sold my own stuff that I no longer needed on Amazon FBA as used products, I went yard sale\/garage sale hunting, thrift stores, and craiglist\/facebook  until I got enough working capital without having to use my savings. \n\nOnce I had actual money to spend, I found a product that I had recently purchased as gifts in Kitchen Wares, and sourced a few samples. Cost me less than $1000 for a few hundred units from different suppliers. \n\nLaunched website on Squarespace for the brand, bought UPC's, printed out thank you cards with website and a chance to win a $50 giftcard if you signed up to our newsletter.\n\nProducts arrived from China, I added the thank you cards, sent in to FBA. I asked every person I know to buy it on Amazon, review it, and I will give them the money back. Most of them actually kept it and didn't want the money, they needed one anyway and were willing to help. Those that did want the money, I asked for it back to resell, some decided to keep it, no worries all part of marketing.\n\nAfter going from unranked, to ranked, and then to trending and eventually good enough to sell 50-100 units a month, I feel accomplished.\n\nYou can do it too. \/u\/blakmirror isn't crazy, he is pissing off a lot of people that would rather sell you some $5k course. Those that are angry are the type that would rather win and if not, not let you win either.","653":"Manufactured and imported from China. Too expensive to manufacture locally unfortunately. Had shipped directly to Amazon.com so that I could leverage their FBA service (fulfilled by Amazon) so that I didn't need to exchange time for money (factored into my selling prices). Works well but takes time to make it successful; takes some hard work and several cashflow negative months to make it happen.","654":"My point stays the same: even if it WAS actually an Amazon item, you'd still have no other recourse, so I don't see how it matters significantly. If it was sold by Amazon, Amazon Warehouse Deals, or Acme Corp, if it was damaged or missing parts, your only recourse would be refund and return.\n\nI'll give you that you can't return it for exchange, but when you are buying something that has to be a one-off every time since it was marked as damaged, I don't see what else you'd expect regardless of if the seller was really Amazon or not.  It's not like they could just cross ship you some other \"5% cosmetic damage\" matching item.\n\nAll that being said, AWD has the same policy when it comes to returns as any other Marketplace seller. They still fall under the same A-to-Z protection and return policies.  And I still don't see what other \"protections beyond refund\" you are looking for regardless of who the \"seller\" is.","655":"I took the same course and I have some things to add.\n\n* Here is a direct link to [Amazon's best sellers](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Best-Sellers\/zgbs\/ref=zg_bs_unv_hg_0_1057794_0) root page. Anything in the top 1,500 is great, but don't shy from anything in the top 10,000 in its root category. A shower curtain may be #400 in \"bathroom accessories\", but that doesn't mean anything if it's #25,000 in the root category of \"home &amp; kitchen\".\n\n* Something that they don't stress enough in the course -- **once you pick a product you have to improve upon it in some way**. You have to separate your product from the pack by offering some feature your competitors don't. Read the 1 star reviews from your competition -- why did their product receive a horrible review? Can you fix that problem in your product?\n\n* Restating that you *must* get product samples before purchasing any sizable order. It's easy to be impatient and just order, and that can set you back months if you pick the wrong supplier. \n\n* Friends and family are a great place to start for those initial reviews, but so is Facebook advertising. You can give away a batch of your product initially and you should get a decent response rate. After that initial surge is when I'd look into launch services.\n\n* I had not heard of Zonblast or Viral Launch, those were not around when I went through the course. I went and took a look and Zonblast is using insecure assets on a supposedly secure site -- that defeats the purpose of the SSL certificate and does not fill me with trust. \n\nI have some concerns about how the launch services work. When Amazon finds out about this type of thing they can remove valid reviews even if you did send the reviewer your product. At that point you're out of the product and you're out the fee to the launch service. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n","656":"I didn't intend to suggest a \"concern\", rather to use my experience to point out that Amazon the company and Amazon Warehouse Deals are two different entities of which return\/refund\/exchange policies are not overlapping or necessarily the same.  Amazon the company will ensure that if the price of most products changes but Amazon is the seller they will still exchange the product.  AWD is a shipping distributor, and the inspection of a product listed has no guarantee.  When Amazon is the actual seller they have a whole separate set of product return policies, and by the way AWD presents itself I thought when buying my shopvac I was buying from Amazon, not some third party shipping company.\n\nI suppose I should also state that I use Amazon largely because of the prior experiences I've had with their return policies and the ease of which I've been able to get replacement parts (e.g., shoelaces, missing USB cables) for items I have bought from Amazon.  If you've ever dealt with their customer service when they are acting as the seller it is superb.  AWD is not bound to the same set of rules as Amazon \"the seller\" is, and that makes for a totally different set of expectations of which I was unaware.","657":"I suggest 1,500 for beginners because the demand is there.  If they get early success they'll continue the journey.\n\nI don't see Amazon stopping launch services.  Email list subscribers aren't penalized for not reviewing, its just suggested that they do review.  Its like a coupon club, like slickdeals and fatwallet. They just charge and have more reliable buyers.","658":"&gt;I\u2019d probably end up being a bit more expensive.\n\nThat won't stop anyone from buying from you. If you're a reputable expert people will trust you more than others. You could also partner with a company that sells your hobbies supplies.\n\nI would suggest going the Amazon affiliate route. Read up more about it if you've never heard of it. \n\n&gt;It\u2019s unique in that sense specifically for the city.\n\nHave an event. You could charge for entry, request donations or sell products at the event. You could put yourself at the center of the hobby for your city this way. You'll further establish yourself and make more connections this way.","659":"I have had the experience with Amazon as a seller in previous transactions that they will replace missing parts and\/or offer exchanges despite disparities in price.  AWD does not have that same policy.  I also expect (expectations that were largely built by previous experiences with Amazon) that if Amazon screws up the quality report of an item that there be an effort to amend the issue, not a flat \"oops, our bad, you can return it\" policy, but since AWD is not Amazon \"the seller\" they don't have that set of policies in place.  In my past experiences with Amazon as a seller they have always done so, which is largely why I use Amazon, but when buying from AWD I was unaware that they are not Amazon \"the seller\", and are not bound to the same set of customer satisfaction requirements.  I like Amazon, I use it all the time and buy from it all the time, and mostly because they are the absolute best in customer service, but AWD looks like Amazon is in fact NOT Amazon.\n\nI have typed the word Amazon far too many times.  I get what you're saying, I'm not arguing, but I suppose that we have different expectations on how problems should be settled, and these expectations obviously come from different past experiences.  I'm a fan of Amazon and my expectations are super high because of how awesome they have been in the past, I am just attempting to share with everyone that AWD doesn't play by the same rules and if your expectations are as high as what you might expect from Amazon you should be more informed (which I was not). ","660":"It's not reselling, it your product...your brand.  You set the price see buying your product as simply buying material for your art project (brand).  The factories box it.  The factories can ship straight to Amazon's FBA warehouses.  Or you can have them ship your inventory to your house and you yourself can ship it to the FBA warehouses. FBA warehouses hold your product and fulfill your orders.  The only job you have is getting the product, having it packaged by the factory or a packaging facility and then once its shipped to a FBA warehouse they take care of the rest.  Of course, you have to handle marketing and promotion as well. ","661":"I double the Chase Amazon Rewards (Chase is the providing bank).The 2% is for gas and restaurants... and drug stores, I think (not sure on that last part).\n\nThe thing about Chase is their amazing customer service. I had a fraud alert sent to me while I was at the gym lifting. So I finished up and called them on the way to the hot tub. They credited everything and issued me a new card before I left the hot tub (about ten minutes). No hassle. No liability. Also, this card has no annual fee.\n\nI also have a Capital One Venture card. Their customer service (and fraud department, as I unfortunately learned last week) is excellent. Very similar to Chase... except for the fact that they Overnighted me a new card. Chase sent it standard mail. Rewards are a flat 2% back on all purchases.\n\nI've heard great things about American Express's customer service. It's supposed to be the best. Fortunately... I haven't needed to deal with their fraud protection department. I have the Blue Cash Preferred card (6% back on groceries, 3% back on gas and department stores, 1 % back on everything else).

These products are OEM, some may be low quality some may be high, but if the customers are happy, who cares?  Its all about preference, will your brand inherit a bad reputation over time maybe but you may also have some loyal customers. \n\n\nSome people fake their reviews, I'm not saying its okay or that they are right to do so, just that they are there.   Amazon's buyers are more aware than you are giving them credit for, they can spot and call out fake reviews just as well as you. ","663":"Amazon partnernet?

The ebook allows me to answer questions of those that are truly interested.  I said myself, you can find everything you need to know for free.  The ebook cuts through the fluff and gives pure content...its this post times 70+ pages.

It's no different than ingesting in any other category.","668":"Flipping expensive items is good as long as you're sure you can find a buyer. If you end up buying an iPhone you can't flip on CL, you'll end up just eating eBay fees to sell it back for the same or slightly lower price. You'll probably still come out ahead on your 10%, but that's a lot of work.\n\nYou can also ask your parents or family to let you know when they'll be buying stuff on Amazon and just buy the stuff for them, letting them pay you back. Not everyone needs 2k in Amazon cash, but a lot of people buy things here and there that can really add up.\n\nLook at the 'categories' list on Amazon and see what categories you typically spend money in. For example, I buy phones, shoes, and electronics pretty frequently, and Amazon sometimes has the best prices on those items. I find that most of the grocery items I can get cheaper in a cheap grocery store (ShopRite, for example). Search slickdeals.net for deals on items from Amazon, and see if any of it is something you want\/need.","669":"I suspect you are likely to lose that 10 percent bonus in time and effort flipping things (also taxes for resold goods) but here is a great deal on a really nice light fixture: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Aurora-Lighting-Bronze-Finished-Pendant\/dp\/B00E0KL5IC\/\n\nPerhaps not a fast mover or an easy flip, but with a current price of ~$130 there may be an opportunity with these.

It won't summon a brand if your company isn't aware of what branding is. And, due to the widespread misunderstanding of logos and branding, it's not safe to assume you have a branding campaign in the works. \n\nThe problem is everyone is picking #97. And that version limits you to mosaics, which you say is going to be just part of your line. So your branding is going to push mosaics at first, entrench this in the mind. It's a little like if Amazon had started with a logo highly reminiscent of books, which is their starting category. \n\nAnd then the work you did will work against you, if you are at all successful branding. Because, for all the talk of rebranding, we are talking about your market and customers. And that mindset doesn't change just because you want it to or some flunky opened Illustrator a second time. \n\nOn the other hand, most companies do not have a brand. They have a logo. And if that is the case, and you're just stamping it on your stuff, it matters little. Most companies do not have the faintest clue about how to brand, so half the marketing they do contradicts what the illusory brand was supposed to stand for. And the half that fits was an accident. \n\ntl;dr A logo does not magically summon a brand, and certainly not be the cheap substitute for a skilled branding campaign its owners wish. Based on the paltry context and accidental information, the popular choice is not the right branding choice. ","671":"I'll just tell you what I've learned from doing research and some of the answers I've gotten from here since I've recently started planning as well.\n\nFirst the most important thing is to figure out your costs and how much you can distribute to each product. It's better to have a couple products that are relatively well manufactured, that you can keep up with, than it is to have a wide selection that aren't doing so well. Figuratively speaking it's also a good idea to stay local as a test scenario. Try going to swap meets or something like that to see how people react, although it might be different depending on your local culture. Then from there if you have a somewhat strong grasp on what products you want to make after some testing and questioning, you can think about getting involved in ecommerce.\n\nSetting up shop on either your own website, or an existing one like Amazon, or Ebay or something of that nature is a good place to start. Even if you do a mixture of both to sort of split your risks into two different baskets, it's a nice way to get a foot in the door in terms of creating your business.\n\nSo to put it much simpler.\n\n1. Figure out what you want to make initially.\n2. Figure out the costs that making these products would entail on your finances. Also, if planning on setting up some sort of ecommerce network\/online store, figure out basic shipping costs.\n3. Do some local testing to see what people like and what they don't like.\n4. Slim down your selection to the basic essentials to start out, and then include more later on.\n5. Run a second test at a swap meet or somewhere you can make local sales to get a small starting point on your possible income. (Might fluxuate if this is an uncommon culture where you live locally)\n6. Create an online store, or sell through some online retailer\/market\n7. Ebay\/Etsy is a good place to start if it's personally being shipped by you, and even more so if you're personally creating it. Amazon is a good place to start when you're not adept at the processing and creating large orders and shipping those out to your customers as necessary. (I'm in that amazon boat too) Yet, FBA allows you to participate in the manufacturing, selling, and shipping of your products at a lower cost, while giving you a taste of what it's like.\n8. Finally, if all goes well you should start your own online store, and if that goes well you can think about possibly expanding to mall booths or something of that nature.\n\nAgain, I'm relatively new as well to the scene so take my advice with a grain of salt. Yet, this is what I've learned from research and the comments of many other fellow members of \/r\/Entrepreneur. Good luck :)","672":"Making $180K a year at 23 is not only close to impossible, it is improbable.  Secondly, when credit agencies evaluate your credit history, they look at your current debt holdings to income ratio.

Use it, pay it off, use it, pay it off, rinse and repeat.\n\nEdit: I refuse to believe that someone that can achieve $180K annual income by the age of 23 has garbage credit, and is looking for additional credit (with $0 current debt).

You can check [camelcamelcamel.com](http:\/\/camelcamelcamel.com) to get some sales history and price stats for different items. Anyways, check out individual items and figure out if they are worth selling in your country. If people need\/want them. \n\nThen what I'd suggest you do is check a site like [aliexpress.com](http:\/\/aliexpress.com) and see if that item is available there, from a reliable seller.

There's a reason I don't post country of origin on my pages. \n\nBut it is a frustrating misconception. Like all things in life, there are good and bad in every bunch, and you get what you pay for. You have to vet a lot of suppliers and inspect a lot of samples to find one that will tick all the right boxes. We have a good factory, they know that quality is the long-run key to success. Some want to shove cheap crap on you.\n\nYou also have to consider their end--they get a million emails from unprofessional wantrepreneurs quizzing them about their products and trying all sorts of tactics they read in blogs and ebooks. So your ability to find and get good stuff from China will depend on how you research and conduct yourself in communication and how much stuff you have actually bought from them or at least credibly plan to. People who just shotgun email and are hard to work with are bound to be stuck with suppliers who manage their business equally as poorly. \n\nEdit addition: I see evidence of this phenomenon among my competitors on both Amazon and eBay. They are also sourcing from China. They are sourcing crap from China. Theirs doesn't sell very much. Mine does.

But we found the factory that let us add in a simple feature that the rest don't have. This was intentional. Thus, you could fairly say that our current success on Amazon is mostly tied to isolating this little edge and executing on it through market research and extended supplier vetting.

And when I order lower quantities this usually still turns out to be the case. There are always products priced like 10-20% cheaper than Alibaba when you include shipping and everything else.\n\n2) Because I live in Australia, Amazon doesn't allow me to sell things, so marketing is a bit tough. Besides google trends, do you do anything to make sure you can sell products before you spend thousands of dollars buying 5000+ units? My biggest fear is not being able to offload stock.","699":"Not so far, the courses that are currently being promoted would fall apart if they did. \n\nI doubt Amazon will take action against these services.

At one of the yard sales  I was at, there were 4 automatic home thermostats, retailing about $60 on Amazon. I knew they would be worth somehting, but as I was looking them up, another woman came over and grabbed two of them before I could. I had been standing there for over a minute, so I should have put my hands on all of them before I looked them up. Rather than paying $4 for all 4, I only got 2, losing a potential $100 in profit.\n\nThe next day, I stopped by Goodwill before I headed into work. As I was standing in line, I noticed a Wii behind the counter but couldn't see the price. The guy in line ahead of me asked how much ($15 - my eyes lit up!), asked about the return policy (24 hours), said \"okay,\" completed his transaction and then got on his phone, presumably to call someone about the Wii.\n\nWhen I was next, I said I will take it no questions asked. The cashier thought he was still looking to buy it, but once he realized his mistake he let me have it. Not a minute later, the guy behind me asks how much I paid and said I was so lucky. The cashier told me  I was making enemies (supposed I'm doing something right)!\nWhen I was walking out, the original guy in front of me was walking back in and saw I had the Wii and walked right out again.\n\nBasically it can pay to not to be hesitant. While I got burned (burned myself really) on the yard sale, I quickly learned my lesson and applied the same instincts that woman had when I saw the Wii.\n","716":"If you have Amazon prime, bulk beans, split peas and nuts can be great deals","717":"You honestly think ZonBlast or Viral-launch is the key to making a private label work?

Getting the products, image qualities, UPC barcodes which is required to list clothing on Amazon (I used these guys https:\/\/speedybarcodes.com\/), having them listed accurately and then competing with other sellers in the same genre was a lot of hands on work.

Amazon FBA is a great service if you only sell a handful of products but it gets pricey to store, stock and sell hundreds of items of lingerie in 4-6 different sizes and maintain inventory at their FBA, a bit of a headache.","723":"Most orders were fulfilled by Amazon FBA even though I could have manually done so. The reason for this was simple. I live in Canada and most my sales were in the US and I didn't want my customers to incur customs\/duties fees and be unhappy. So I absorbed the cost of the FBA as a cost of doing business to keep my customers happy &amp; loyal. Also Amazon FBA can ship way faster than I ever could (and for less cost per shipment as well so there were savings in this manner also).\n\nUnfortunately due to NDA I cannot share links to either of the two sites I sold. They've redirected the domains to their much larger and much more well known website now, I suspect they bought me out for the organic traffic cause they strategically setup 301 redirects on a page-by-page basis thereafter (sending corset traffic to their corset page; g-string traffic to their g-string page, etc.) ","724":"I worded that poorly, I buy the meat\/fish from Costco to seal.

Meanwhile, you've got friends that invested in hyped stocks and they're bragging about 30% returns.  I do several things:\n\n* Step back and take a break if you feel like you need one.  Play some hard videogames instead.  Try to beat some Koreans at StarCraft.  Realize that competing against people is hard, and even if you're losing at it, at least you're learning things and coming back for more lessons.  Nobody started out good at anything.\n\n* Start blogging or journaling your trades.  Analyze why you've made the choices you've made, and ask yourself how you could have made that trade better.  Usually, you'll notice trends.  For me, after a few successful trades, I get excited.  I see the exact same setups as a previous winning trade, and enter that trade, expecting the same results.  When they don't happen, I stay in 'a bit longer' hoping they will, and get stopped out.  You end up discovering your weaknesses faster when you keep track of each trade.\n\n* Go 'back to school'.  Check Amazon to see if there are any highly rated books on trading that you haven't read.  Go read them.  If anything, you'll be inspired back into the game.  If not, at least you've put more relevant material behind you.\n\n* Next time, start with a smaller account.  After all, if you're losing money, try to lose less money.  If that means commissions are going to affect you more, maybe it's time for a cheaper broker?  Find a way to trade with smaller accounts.  That way, while you're feeling down about that 20%, at least it's not eating into your bottom line, and you'll feel better about that $100 loss than you would about a $1000 loss.\n\n","726":"I am selling some video games on Amazon.

I am in the U.S. So cost may be different for you.\n\nBut around here when I did the math comparing the Huggies PER DIAPER PRICE vs what I can get on Amazon\/Walmart\/Target. Costco is no cheaper and after you factor in the membership its not worth it. However, if your kid fits the Kirkland diapers that are about 10 cents cheaper PER diaper than pampers. Then yes, there is savings to be had. \n\nI also think we have a different concept of what \"barely shopping at costco\" is. 2500 bucks a year to get $55 back is $208 per month. Thats 1\/3 of our average monthly food bill. So for us, its quite a lot vs for you spending that may be a breeze. \n\nBut more to your point, Costco is a tricky store. You really need to be careful with it, some things like meat(not all) are a great deal if you can buy in bulk and store. Cereals, peanut butter, eggs, milk, vegetables(if you can consume those volumes before they go bad) are great deals. Some things you buy and they are more expensive, though more often the same price, than if you just got it at the supermarket.  Its easy to get carried away and think you are saving when you are really not. \n\nBut now we are just going in circles. The bottom line is, its important to do the math when it comes to Costco.

I know that you're a single person but the meat savings alone will pay for a basic membership, and buying the right items besides will also help cover that cost.\n\nChicken breast 1.88-1.99\/lb for fresh versus 4.99 and up per pound at Cub.  Hell, Cub thinks that 5-6 bucks for a 3lb bag of IQF breasts is a great deal, but the breasts you get from Sam's are fresher and higher quality than those.\n\nWhole pork loins at Sam's are 1.68-1.78\/lb and they even have a picture showing you how to cut it into two roasts and 6-12 chops (depending on size of loin and thickness of chops).  The only time I see pork cheaper than that at traditional stores it's off the shoulder (less tender and thus less valuable).\n\nFreeze everything you're not going to use in two days after buying it, this means the day you buy your loin you butcher it and freeze what's not being eaten immediately.  I recommend cooking the chicken and slicing it (after an appropriate rest to maintain juiciness) before freezing so you have quick and easy protein accompaniment for your meals.\n\nAlso at Sam's, buy your frozen vegetables.  The steam bags of broccoli, northwest blend, and Normandy blend are cheaper there than you'll generally get at traditional grocery, even with coupons and sales.  Canned tomatoes, in diced, sauce, and paste varieties will be cheaper at Sam's, and rice and pasta are pretty much unbeatably priced. (If you use the ibotta app for shopping rebates you can currently get some money back on hunts tomatoes and Sams pasta too).\n\nBonus: here's my healthy lunch I eat almost every day and can prep a week's worth (or more) on weekends.  Take your Sam's chicken breasts, season how you like (I use the Ruth Anne's seasoning from Penzey's Spices), cut into thin slices after they're cooked and rested.  Take a one pound bag of frozen veggies, portion it into fourths in zip-top sandwich bags, and toss in 2.5 ounces of chicken on top of the veggies.  Toss that in the freezer.  Then make a cup of couscous (I buy mine from Trader Joe's for 2 bucks per kilo, next cheapest I've found is Amazon if you don't have a TJ).  Divide the couscous into sixths and put one portion in each bag of veggies and chicken, then toss them back in the freezer.  Reheats in the microwave in 2-3 minutes, 270ish calories, less than 5g of fat, about 25g of carbs, and 28g of protein.  I normally portion 12 bags at a time, and I tend to eat a double portion since I'm 6'8 and 270 pounds.  The savings on buying lunch (even as cheap TV dinners) alone will pay for the Sam's membership before you know it, and your waistline will thank you too.

I'm usually a dedicated long-term employee.  The layoff happened after six years with a defense contractor who weaseled out of paying severance to 77 employees. The next employer weaseled me into supervising and subsequently firing a girl after I made it clear in my interview that I wasn't trained or qualified to be a supervisor. They are also a very greedy family-owned business that offered a very unhealthy environment with no benes. I could barely pay my bills, but I took the job because it was the only one I could find and I didn't want to be unemployed.  The next employer literally couldn't pay his employees on time. Every payday he was asking us to hang in there because the money was coming. I don't know how he's still in business.

However, my dad taught me TI Basic programming in junior high and I really enjoyed it back then, so I guess I'm not completely opposed to it.  However, with two others in the household with disabilities, I really need to be at home.  I've tried going to school, but going to class keeps me away from the house, and online classes are actually a lot more work because of how often you have to post or reply to other posts during the week.  The last online class I took had me posting or writing something six times a week on different days, and I couldn't make that work with my schedule.  It might be a little easier now, but I'm also 46 years old and learning just doesn't come as easy anymore.  I don't have a problem working, but I DO have a problem giving my 110% to an employer who is greedy, treats me like dirt, uses me to get ahead, doesn't pay enough, or any number of other bad characteristics.  I don't want to be stuck in a dead-end job where I come home miserable every day.

Volatility is obscenely low.  Amazon has rocketed up 50% ytd simply on some extra disclosure (I like the company don't get me wrong, but this is starting to feel like Apple circa 2012).  We've got significant headwinds from the dollar for MNCs and there's growing data suggesting that there hasn't really been a matching bump in consumer spending yet (not to say that there won't be at some point).  Markets in China are soaring off of slowing growth and Europe is doing the same off the hopes that Draghi is going to be able to fix everything with his rather limited box of tools.\n\nNow I'm not crying doom here, but the optimism really seems undue at this point, especially given how far we are into the business cycle.  Expectations and prices really need to be lower than they are currently and while I don't think a recession or crash is eminent, a correction in the markets should be.\n\nEdited: *Not* crying doom","858":"This idea that any online marketplace that exists to connect merchants to consumers will ever be anything other than customer-centric is absurd.\n\nI see tons of comments making the claim that sellers are ebay's \"bread and butter\" or the like. While it IS true that without merchants there can be no customers most people who make these sorts of claims fail to carry the logic further and consider that where there are no customers there will be no merchants AND where there are customers there will never be a shortage of merchants wanting desperately to sell them things. It's only logical for a business in Ebay's position to appeal to buyers over sellers, they would be stupid not to do so.\n\neCommerce channels like Ebay and Amazon are not only competing with each other, they are competing with brick and mortar stores right down the street from their (and YOUR) customers. To do so they have to create a space where they can confidently buy goods hundreds or sometimes thousands of miles away from them SIGHT UNSEEN. They've done a pretty good job of that. \n\nYes I agree that there are some overly-strict guidelines and some pretty poor decisions that effect me made without my knowledge or approval. But it's a fair trade for a ready-made world-wide customer base. When it's stops being so, I'll move on to other marketplaces. Not that it will ever be the case because of how they bend over backwards to keep that customer base happy.","859":"That sounds pretty good too.\n\nBread machines are generally pretty easy. I have a Zojirushi (I think it's like HAB-10 or something for the model number), and they are pretty great, so if you see one of those cheap, snatch it up. The 1lb version cost like 200$ but I got it as a gift. \n\nBest advice for picking one would probably be scan some reviews on Amazon. I often do this for stuff when I'm in the store looking around. Keep an eye on the store's return policy if there is one though. In addition, if it's a newer model item, the company will often not even ask\/check when you bought it (I've had this happen recently with several warranties for small appliances). They will just send a new one, or a new part.\n\nEssentially with mine it goes, wash out the container part for the ingredients, then dry it thoroughly (yeast becomes active when wet, this is what you don't want). Then and this is most important for mine, put the mixing blade back in (I can't count how many times I've forgotten this, and gotten startled by a squealing machine, then had to reach down into the dough and pop the blade in). Then just put in your ingredients. My recipes generally go water\/milk, flour, and then everything else. Then make a little dip in the top of the dry ingredients and set the yeast there.Then set it to whatever your recipe says, shut the top and press start. Recipes for mine advise powdered milk a lot too. ","860":"Are you playing $AAPL earnings? I'm short a May $120 and $135 calls.

Google missed again but people give them infinite chances to redeem themselves because their revenue is so high, and AMZN is basically the same story minus the miss.\n\nAll of those combined for very good odds for the one day after their earnings.  AAPL is on a Monday so you'd be in it until Friday, lots can happen in 4 days.  AAPL isn't likely going to miss, all we hear is good things about their China phone sales, so I would bet that they knock it out of the park if I had to pick one way or the other.\n\nThe last time I traded AAPL was just for a week.

Back then it was just a marketplace for stuff you couldn't find locally, collectibles and rare stuff. It was a much different environment from what we have today. Ebay took great pains to stress that they were just an intermediary. Buyers really didn't have any recourse against errant sellers other than to write off their money and leave some negative feedback. If you decided to buy something more than a couple hundred bucks without using Ebay's escrow service it was because you were insane and thought money was how evil got inside you. It evolved from that to a place where you can buy ANYTHING with a 99% expectation you will get what you initially bought and have some form of recourse in the other 1% of cases. This evolution is solely attributed to the policies that \"plague\" us as sellers. Why anyone hoping to make a profit would want to roll that back boggles my mind.\n\nI guess it's because a lot of reddit users are pretty techno-savvy that some of the people on this sub don't realize what a tremendous hurdle it is to convince someone \"Hey, no don't buy that at Best Buy 2 miles from your house, take it home immediately and if something goes wrong take it back right away for a hassle-free return. Buy that shit online, wait a week for it to come in the mail and cross your fingers it works or else it'll be a month before you have a working product. That way you'll SAVE 10%\". Ebay, Amazon etc. put that work in for us, and because of that we get to sit in our apartments in our underwear and snatch customers away from Wal-Mart, and probably make a higher % profit per unit in the process.

Products in wal Mart or Amazon are standardized, with markups\/prices often being dictated or at least heavily directed by the manufacturer itself. A used car, like many other large pieces of \"previously owned\" property, is going to have myriad factors affecting its market value and influencing its price. Each car is unique in this sense, and each seller is driven by different concerns when parting with its property (unlike Wal-Mart trying to sell, say, as many rolls of toilet paper as possible)\n\nThe sale of a used car necessarily entails negotiation, and THAT is the difference","921":"Success!

Ebay is the only one that has an option for the Flat Rate Padded Envelope but you can fit quite a bit in there (also if you need some structure\/protection the 1096L box fits nicely inside).  Otherwise all of the sales platforms have the option for the Small Flat-Rate box.  Sometimes the Medium Flat-Rate Box can be the cheapest (there are 2 shapes) especially if the item is smaller but heavy.  Rarely will the Large Flat-Rate Box be a good option unless the item is going all the way across the country.

For example, use the Freedom for 5% categories only, and the Ink Cash for 5% on cell &amp; tv. Then, using your Sapphire Preferred, you can transfer these points to an airline, let's say Southwest, at a 1:1 ratio. Well, each of these points is worth 1.4cents, so that comes out to be 7cents (5 * 1.4) per dollar (NOTE: There was just a devaluation so I'm not sure if the points are worth this, anymore, or not). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLast quarter the Freedom had 5% on groceries, so I used my wife's Freedom for groceries (maxed) and my Freedom on gift cards at our local grocery store (not MS'ing, I bought some Amazon and others at places we shop normally to max out my rewards). I will then use these points for travel later on.","932":"Bread machines are heavy so it's better to grab those on Craigslist or a thrift store.

It has a lower cap ($250 per month on groceries and gas, each), but gives 5% back on gas, groceries, and Amazon with no annual fee.","938":"Amazon has their own stock so if the seller says amazon then you are buying from their own personal stock. Now if you are buying from someone else and it's fulfilled by amazon you are either buying from a mixed stock that is combined from all the FBA sellers or you are buying from that specific FBA seller's personal stock depending on which option they choose when they sent in the items.","939":"I understand now.

Another entrepreneur\/developer that probably won't deliver on their promises.\n\nBasically what we want is an app that makes flipping super easy for us, but not for anyone else so that it doesn't flood the market. What's been mentioned before is a Google-glass app where we have to do zero work what-so-ever, and we can just walk through aisles of stuff and it would just tell us what's profitable. Of course if everyone has it, then it will be less than useless, because everyone will be using it and saturating the market. So just make it for us... maybe a total of 10 licenses. Also make it free, because we're cheap as fuck.\n\nSorry for the sarcasm, but we've been down this road several times before. I don't think that making an app to make an already pretty simple process even simpler is your key to riches (because many have tried, and many have failed). Personally, what would be of value to me is an app that makes my book-keeping easier. I know that receipt scanning apps already exist, but what I'd like is one that makes it seamless to attach information from the eBay, Amazon, or Craigslist listing\/sale to the scanned receipt. It would make my least favorite part of this business much easier. The plus-side of this is that there exist APIs for all of the major selling platforms. The negative side of this is that this is probably a limited market. I, personally, would pay good money for an app like this to make life easier... but most people here are indeed cheap as fuck. It's a byproduct of spending our days in thrift stores, auctions, and secondary markets. Additionally, eBay, Amazon, and Craigslist book-keeping apps already exist... just not with that handy feature. You might be ripped off immediately if it takes off.\n\nIf you're serious about this (and I mean REALLY serious, not 'flash-in-the-pan' serious), I'd be happy to work with you on this.
