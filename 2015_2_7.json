guys, I was browsing Reddit a couple months back and I seen a couple people wishing that they had an iPhone app that would track prices of items on websites like Amazon, Walmart, BestBuy, etc.\n\nI made Price Watch to do just that - to track the current prices of multiple items with ease.  With price watch you can save as many items as you want, and track the most up-to-date prices with the tap of a button.\n\nIt currently works on just about any website that displays the price of an item in text, such as, Amazon, Walmart, BestBuy, Finishline, Champs, Etsy, ..just about ANY online retail website, my app will work with it.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can visit http:\/\/www.getpricewatch.com\n\nOr on the App Store at: https:\/\/appsto.re\/us\/s-_l5.i\n\nThanks guys and I'm open to any and all feedback. If you have a suggestion for this app that would make your life easier, let me know and if it's feasible it will definitely be implemented in a future update.\n\nEdit:  Update coming soon within the week, Price Watch Live - get up to date prices without even opening the app.  Screenshot: http:\/\/imgur.com\/wkQNrAP","1":"[H]$75 in Amazon Cards [W] any steam cards worth $95.","2":"I know many people here won't have this amount of Amazon GC but there is a chance.

First thing is that I live in Dubai. So, most of the finance tips here wouldn't really apply as they are for folks in US. If anyone knows of how things work here, that would be great! \n\nI'm 24, I earn a pretty mediocre wage (8K a month), BUT! I have no liabilities right now, I live with my folks for now (planning on moving out sooner or later obviously), no car just yet (planning on getting a car for cash soon). I split the rent with my dad, and pay for fuel for the car (since I've basically stolen it from him, until I get my own). \n\nI've also realized that I spend close to 2K just on food for myself. This is because I end up eating outside every single day at work (I work 6 days a week). The rest of my pay goes into buying new computer parts, random shit I don't need off Amazon, and my girlfriend, online subscriptions (Adobe Cloud, VPN, online storage), gym membership (FitnessFirst), and video games and stuff. \n\nWhat I want to know is, how do I start saving? What's the best way to do so in UAE (is this even possible? Do people actually save here?)? How do I still have a normal functioning social life and friends without having to spend everything I have? Should I just put everything I have into a savings account? Does the whole national bonds (nationalbonds.ae?) thing actually work? \n","21":"Hello all,\n\nI'm new here so sorry if I type this up wrong or what not.

Members of the town are given unlimited access to these books - they can take as many of them as they want. If you don't live in a small town like myself you might be out of luck with this post :(\n\nAnyway, two or three times a week I check the books and look for college text books or relatively modern programming books. I study computer science so I'm able to tell at a glance which books will have dated information in them, and which books contain information that is still applicable for today's world. \n\nAmazon has a program where you can mail (for free through UPS) books to them and they'll give you money into your amazon account for each book. The price varies from book to book, but on average you can make ($15-$20 dollars per book). Books that amazon will not take can be returned back.\n\nSometimes I don't get anything, other times I've made $40-$50 dollars a week or so. \n\nIf you're pressed for time, this method is valuable. I'm a full time student right now so it's hard to make money on the side, but having a little bit of spending money for almost no effort makes life a lot easier. Unfortunately, the payments are deposited directly to your account and are not in the form of Amazon giftcards, so you can't exchange it, but still free money to buy always stuff helps out.\n\nI hope this post is helpful.

So here is a follow up post, to touch on a few more of the more common questions people have had. Its a wall of text, (like my last post) But should help out people interested in starting their own Cell Phone Repair Business. I started small when I was 22. I am 26 now, fixing stuff is all I do, and it pays well. \n\nHaving a smart phone is a pretty big thing nowadays.  Everyone and their 9 year old child has one. If your own personal phone does not have a cracked screen, chances are someone in your family, or close circle of friends DOES have a cracked screen.  There are soooo many broken phones are out there.  And it is actually really easy to fix most of them.  Especially iPhones. \n\nI noticed a need for cell phone repair about 4 years ago while working for a major cell phone provider. Even if someone has insurance on their phone, it is usually cheaper and easier to get it repaired by a third party, instead of pay a 200 dollar deductible. (iPhone 5 screens are $25 dollars on Amazon right now, and only take about 30 minutes to install. If you charge 50 bucks total, boom, you're making more than you do at your day job.) It's not unrealistic to make 25-50 bucks an hour if you can keep the broken phones rolling in. \n\n**How the freak do I learn how to take apart cell phones?**\nYouTube is a HUGE resource for learning how to to take apart phones. Once you've seen the inside of a any device, it makes it so much easier to take apart on your own.  I personally have close to 200 phone repair videos posted to my YouTube channel [JerryRigEverything](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/JerryRigEverything). Feel free to subscribe if you are into that sort of thing. Another good channel to subscribe to is Le55ons.  His repair videos are longer, but touch on every aspect of the repair. Mine are more 'to the point'.  Maybe with a lame joke or 2 tossed in somewhere. \n\nThe knowledge you learn from one phone, can be transferred to the next phone, and even laptops, or gaming consoles.  If you've built computers before, you already have a foot in the door.\n\n**How to start out and advertise:**\nCell phone repair is pretty much a local gig. (That's why I have no problem telling you what worked for me and my business. The chances of you taking my clients are pretty small.) So you have to handle your business like a local gig. Nobody wants to send their phone anywhere to get it repaired. They want to drop it off and wait an hour while its done in their own home town. **WORD OF MOUTH IS HUGE!!!** I wish I could make that font bigger. If you don't have friends telling their friends about you... Your business will not do as well as it could. Think about it... the first thing someone says after seeing their friend drop a phone, \u201cOh hey! Dont worry about your cracked screen, I know a guy...\u201d Boom. Business for you. Hand out business cards. Or better yet: Fridge Magnets. Or better better yet, make sure you are listed as a contact in every single phone you repair or sell. (Have the customer enter it by themselves into their own phone. Don't just enter it in yourself. That's weird. Don't be weird.)\n\nI started off my repair business while in college, repairing my own phones. I would buy a phone with a broken screen or charging port from a friend, or from craigslist, fix it, and sell it for profit. Use whatever other local classified you have in your area. (The prices are pretty high with eBay at the moment, because everyone is doing the same thing; buying, fixing, reselling. But profit is still there.) You can usually get broken phones much cheaper from friends and family.  Especially because most of them will end up selling them back to Sprint, T-Mobile, or their own cell provider, for WAY less than they are actually worth. Offer them a few bucks more for their device and suddenly you're the good guy, even though you are still going to come out ahead. If you have ever sold your old phone to a major provider... you definitely got screwed. \n\nOnce I felt confident with fixing my own phones, I branched out and started fixing friends phones. (Granted, I didn't exactly plan it this way, this is just what happened. There was a need, and I was filling it. Natural entrepreneur style.) My 'clients' would usually be fine waiting a day or 2 for parts to arrive. (Yay Amazon Prime!) I would fix the phone, and give it back to them within an hour or so. It was a good way to start. No overhead for this college kid. \n\nOnce I had enough business going with my repairs, I partnered with a another local guy who bought and sold phones as his day job. Both of us in the same physical brick and mortar location helped both our businesses a ton. (If you are looking to partner with someone, look for a local computer repair company, an mobile accessory store, or even a cell phone vendor that isn't a big chain.) In my city, another repair guy joined up with an electronics store that sells TV's and stuff, and hes doing pretty well for himself.\n\nOther things that helped my business (besides the WORD OF MOUTH that I mentioned so strongly earlier.) were hitting up all of the other cell phone related stores in town. T-Mobile, Sprint, At&amp;t, Verizon... Most of them do not have 'in house' repair centers.  Plus if a customer doesn't have insurance, they cant do much at all for them.  Having my business card to hand to the customer helps them defuse a crappy situation. \u201cWe cant help you because you dont have insurance, but this guy can!\u201d Everyone is happy. Plus... I check in on the bigger stores every month or two, and bring doughnuts.  Everyone loves the doughnut guy. Other places to hit up are 3rd party cell phone vendors. Radio Shack, Best Buy, Any place electronics related. Cell phone accessory kiosks in the mall. Networking can make your business take off. Don't be weird though. Seriously. \n\n**Shiz. What if I permanently break a customers phone?!**\nThis is a legitimate concern.  Cell phone repair is not all daffodils and daises.  You can legitimately brick a customers 700 dollar device.  Especially if you are still learning the ropes.  You should really *really* practice a lot before jumping into repairs on the more expensive phones that you don't actually own.  Another good idea is to have the customer sign a waiver before hand.  \u201cHey... Just so you know, I am pretty good at what I do, but with complex fragile electronic devices like this, there is always the chance that something could go wrong. This waiver just lets us both know that I explained the risks before opening up your device.\u201d\n\nProvide a backing up service or contact transfer for an additional $$.  Teach them how to use Drop Box. Or Google Drive. Or hey, learn how iCloud actually works. Nobody ever knows anything about that. \n\n**WAYS TO BLOW UP YOUR PROFIT MARGINS:**\nScreen protectors.  Holy crap.  If you want a business with insane profit margins check these out.  You can get the cheap plastic ones for 20-50 cents each in bulk (Buying 100ish at a time) and turn around and sell them for 5 or 10 bucks each in your store (With the install).  You can get the more expensive tempered glass ones anywhere from 2-5 dollars each, and sell those for 15-25 bucks a piece. Zagg\/InvisibleShield sometimes charges 50 freaking dollars a pop for those bad boys. They are making serious bank. \n\nBuy accessories for dirt cheap from Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba, or AliExpress and sell them for 100-300% profit in your store. \n\nAs you repair phones, you will gradually grow your very own bone-yard of devices. This is a good thing. **NEVER THROW AWAY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE REUSED**.  The more spare parts you have laying round, the more likely you are able to 'JerryRig' a customers phone back into existence. Buy one of those plastic shelf thingys with a million little plastic drawers to help separate all your harvested parts.  People don't really care HOW their phone started working again, as long as it stays working.  Plus, if you didn't have to spend money on a new part, you don't have to charge the customer as much money, and they leave happier, bringing more business to you later on. Its a happy cycle. \n\nNow keep in mind, for this post I just kept with the business side of things.  If your goal is to make side money by fixing phones for friends... great.  Its a wonderful option for some quick cash. BUT if you decide to work on strangers devices, I would make sure to have an LLC, Business License, maybe even business insurance if it is required. All those things sound daunting, until you actually do them.  They aren't that bad. Just require a little research. \n\nIf you want to learn more about the TOOLS that I use in my own shop, I made a post about that HERE: www.JerryRigEverything.com\/2014\/04\/want-start-cell-phone-repair-business\/\n\nAnother link to my YouTube channel for those interested in learning about cell phone repair: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/jerryrigeverything\n\nThanks a ton for reading!  Hopefully I was able to shed some light on repairing cell phones. \n\nI am on Reddit way too much, so feel free to ask me anything. I'll respond to everyone. ","85":"Hello!

After getting my priorities straight within 2 years I started to pay off my loans more aggressively and last year got married and pulled off a wedding party of 200+ people on a modest budget.  Talk about changes.  Today I'm at $75K and on track to be free of this debt in 3 years.\n\nThis is sort of a bragging post.  Whether it's impressive or not to some of you is a different story.  I'm proud of myself and happy at where I'm at today.  I also hope this inspires others in educational debt or not to tighten their belt and get on a path of being debt free.\n\nMini wall of text here of story and strategy:\n\nBack in 2010 I graduated with a Masters in Architecture, private school, and with $126k of loans.  The economy tanked at the time and the building industry was in bad shape due to it.  I worked contract jobs, permanent jobs were hard to come by then, back to back based off connections I had while paying the monthly minimum and eventually in 2011 I ran out of a job to piggy-back off of.  I wasn't living at home nor did I want to be a boomerang kid so I applied for a loan deferment.  It was then were I literally felt the weight of these loans crushing me and I knew I had to do something about it.  \n\nI was looking for jobs and eventually landed one outside of my profession.  I'm going to keep it general and say it was for a Fortune 500 company in consumer products.  Using my creative background and skillsets in Architecture I leveraged my abilities and landed the job.  It was a contract position that involved both creativity and education, and paid more than Architecture.  I thought it was temporary and I'd wind back in Architecture but I ended up sticking to it from then until now.  I didn't study something creative for nothing right?  \n\nFor about the next half year I did the math and saved enough money to live off of for half a year if shit hit the fan which was my priority and should be for anyone, for me that was roughly $5k.  I ended up amassing $7k just to be safe.  During that half year I also removed my deferment and started paying back my loans at the monthly minimum.  Once I amassed $7k I immediately moved out of my apartment in the heart of Downtown, Los Angeles, that I shared with a roommate to live with my girlfriend, now wife(!), in a neighboring city saving me $350 dollars a month that could easily go into my loans.  I realized living the high life of hustle and bustle is much less important than living a wise one.  This new neighborhood was also much less glamorous with low-income families, gangs, and rehab facilities.  I figured since I just worked and stayed away from all that trouble it was worth it financially.  All this happened in 2010-2012.  I really call these first two years as getting the building blocks together to set the foundation from then until now.\n\n2012-2015 is actually dry and boring despite the wedding. The only exciting part was watching my loans drop.  I was addicted to logging in and checking my balance.  Something about the number down made me happy.  I did a lot of math in the beginning of 2012 in trying out different payment options for paying off my loans by number of years.  3 years was obviously not realistic with my salary of $64k so I settled between a 5-6 year plan.  A couple of things I adopted:\n\n1.  Pay my loans weekly because in the long run I would be paying less interest since student loan interest adds up daily instead of monthly.  \n2.  Try to keep %50 of income focused on student loans.  If more, better.\n3.  Be frugal.  Buy things in bulk from Amazon or Costco.  Don't go out.  Abandon your drug habit if you have one.  I used to smoke and drink socially but I got that out of my system after I did the math.  Make home cooked meals for the week and bring them to work for lunch.  Clothes don't have to be dry-cleaned just dedicate time to iron them.  Don't buy stuff you don't need.  Just get essentials.  Carpool if you have co-workers living locally.  All the little things add up.  \n4.  Buy a good pair of leather shoes where the soles are repairable and find a reliable cobbler.  They do wonders to your shoes.  I've been wearing the two same pair of leather shoes for 3 years now and the upkeep per year is roughly $50.\n5.  Learn to cut your own hair.  The average male haircut is $28 without tip.  If you map that by habit on 2x a month or 1x a month you're saving $336-$672 or more a year.\n6.  It's okay to tell people your financial story, not in concise detail of course, and they typically respect and honor your financial dedication.  This is typical for the case where your friends or co-workers give you dirt for not eating lunch or hanging out with them after-hours.\n7.  If you get a bonus, put it in your loans. \n\nThe wedding in 2014 was a headache because I knew it would be a financial setback if planned improperly.  I fought with my family; Argued for something simple.  Swear words and abandonment was tossed in.  My parents are very traditional and culturally, I'm Chinese-American, the relevance of a wedding party was important to them.  Yes, I had a Chinese wedding despite the fact that my wife is White.  The good thing about Chinese culture is that weddings pay for themselves since guests bring red envelopes.  The caveat was simple: The more you spend on the wedding the odds of your return would be harder to gain back.  With this in mind, I cut as many corners planning this wedding to save money.  I don't want to go into the details since this is more about finance but in the end we planned roughly a $12k wedding for 200+ people and walked away with a $3k profit in our pockets after paying back what we fronted.\n\nToday, I'm making $76k at the same company and as of the 2015 have been putting 62% of my monthly income into student loans.  My loans are totaling right now at $75K and I am confident and comfortable with the way I currently live to pay them off in 3 more years.  After these next 3 years I plan to start investing and becoming financially independent while living modestly.  I may ask for advice back in this thread then.\n\nI guess my last pro-tip is to find a significant other that is aligned with your financial goals.  It will make both your lives much happier.  Thankfully, my wife is very supportive of my financial endeavors.  \n\nI look back at it all and many will criticize and say: Well, why did you go to school for Architecture if you didn't end up using it?  Well, it's because I genuinely enjoyed design and that architectural design is really about finding creative ways to solve problems, building relationships with clients, and presenting your ideas effectively which I do today despite being in totally different profession.  Quite frankly, I don't think I would be in my position today without my creative background.  I do miss designing buildings, maybe my own home in the future.\n\n*EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the responses.

I've made a few posts in the past few months about this, but so much has changed since then that I wanted to check-in again and see if there are any new opinions.\n\nMy goal is still basically the same:\n\n* Spring 2016 (April) to Europe, from NYC.\n* Roughly two weeks long.\n* Two adults.\n* We plan on flying into one city and then hit a few cities\/countries on our way to another city to fly back.\n* The cities on our radar are roughly Paris--&gt; Zurich--&gt; Vienna--&gt; Budapest (maybe)--&gt; Prague--&gt; Berlin (maybe) or reversed.\n* We likely plan to stay two nights in each city (most or all nights will be using Club Carlson, buy one get one!).\n* I know a significant amount of our time will be on trains going between cities. The cities above are just a rough estimate of our stops, I will likely plan a little better in the coming months.\n* **We'd love to fly business\/first or first for both flights, but at the very least we'd like to do business class one way and economy one way.**\n\n\nCredit Cards (Card, Date Opened, Credit Line):\n\n* CapOne Platinum - 03\/08 - $4,500\n* Kohls - 04\/11 - $1,000\n* Chase SW Personal - 03\/13 - $6,000\n* Chase Amazon - 05\/14 - $5,000\n* Chase Freedom - 06\/14 - $9,000\n* US Bank Club Carlson Premier - 11\/14 - $14,000\n* Barclaycard US Airways Premier World - 11\/14 - $7,500\n* Citi AA Platinum Select - 11\/14 - $8,500\n* CitiBusiness AA Platinum Select World - 12\/14 - $20,000\n* CapOne SonyCard - 12\/14 - $7,500\n* Chase Marriott Rewards Premier - 02\/15 - $20,000\n* AMEX SPG - 02\/14 - $2,000\n\nPending Cards:\n\n* US Airways (2nd card).  Because it is pending, I doubt I'll get it based on reading others' experiences.\n* Club Carlson Business.  I was denied, called recon. He said he'd see what he could do after moving around some credit (currently $14k, he said maybe $7k &amp; $7k).  Keeping fingers crossed!\n* Bank of America Alaska Airlines. Didn't really have a plan for this yet, but I wanted to get it.\n\nCurrent Points Balance:\n\n* AA - 113k\n* US Airways - 50k\n* Club Carlson - 106k\n* Marriott - 2k (will get the 75k bonus in a month or two)\n* SPG - 1k (will get the 25k bonus in a few months)\n* Freedom\/UR - 7k\n\nCredit Scores:\n\n* FICO - 769\n* TransUnion - 766\n* Equifax - 781\n\nOther notes:\n\n* The Club Carlson card is my everyday spend card. If I can get the business card, I will feel better.  I'm estimating 38k Club Carlson points each 2-night stay (5 to 7 stays). I haven't planned it out closely enough to decide on specific hotels yet. We aren't dying for the best Club Carlson hotels but don't want the Category 1 hotels each night either.\n* We might decide economy roundtrip is acceptable and save our miles for other trips.\n* I see it would take 200k AA to book four one-way business class MileSAAver tickets in April.  I don't know when we'll be booking. I know the earlier the better, because of availability. I think if I do my regular spend and some Redbird\/Serve with my AA cards, I'd be able to get to 200k, I just have to hit some other minimum spends as well. \n\nWhich brings me to my main question right now:\n\n* **Should I forget about trying to hit 200k AA and move my focus over to Ultimate Rewards (use AA to Europe and UR back, or vice versa)?  Time seems to be on my side here (other than I'm going to have several minimum spends to hit in the next few months), so getting enough UR might be possible.  I'm more worried about getting more Chase cards.**\n\n* I guess another option for me is to transfer my Marriott and SPG points (when I get them) to AA, which would get me another 50k or so AA. This really didn't cross my mind until just now.\n\n\n\n\n  \nSorry for the long post!  Just trying to be thorough.  All opinions and suggestions are welcome. Besides my one question above, I'm not sure exactly what I'm trying to accomplish with this post, maybe just some feedback on my plan and other ideas.  \n\n","107":"I'm looking for $50 gift cards in one denomination.\n\nI send all payments as a 'gift' unless requested to do otherwise.\n\n[My GCXProfile](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2rxe4p\/uonlyyagmai_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n\nI only accept Amazon gift card codes.","108":"[H] Amazon CG $50 [W] Steam Wallet","109":"I am filing my taxes for the first time this year and I am a college student who never learned how to do any of this stuff before.

Just found that interesting!","162":"Hey \/r\/beermoney,\n\nI thought you guys would be a great community to help give some feedback regarding an app I just launched.  For now, it's US and iOS only.\n\nAbout a year ago, I realized how many rewards I was missing out on by not filling out receipt surveys.  I also realized the businesses are missing out on valuable feedback which would help them run their operations because receipt surveys are so awful.  Most people don't give their opinion to a store when they were served soggy fries, their favorite item was out of stock or their waitress was super friendly, and the store is unable to rectify bad situations and unhappy customers.\n\nBecause of this problem, I created an app that rewards you for liking or disliking a list of your credit card transactions.  The UI is super simple, simply swipe left to dislike a transaction (or transaction element) and swipe right to like that transaction.  You can also send a comment to the merchant if you'd like.\n\n**The benefits for using the app:**\n\n* Get 50pts per transaction (takes 7 swipes and a comment).  Rewards start at 2,000pts.  A $3 Amazon gift card is 5,500pts.\n\n* Analyze your spending at the places you go.  We show you how many times you've been to a place, your average and total spend as well as the average spend of others who go to that business.\n\n* Get personalized recommendations based on what you like \/ don't like (still pretty basic here, as we need more data to improve the recommendations)\n\n**Security info**:  You first connect a credit card to your account to enable us to pull in your transactions.  The method we use is very similar to how Mint.com works.  We never store your username and password, your credentials are always encrypted, we never receive your credit card or account numbers, and your data is always anonymous.\n\n**Download**\n\nFeel free to check out the app (iOS only)  [here:](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tellthem\/id954203474)\n\nI'd love to hear any feedback you have about the app.  Why did or didn't you download the app? Are the benefits enough to entice your continued use? What did you think of the process for using the app?\n\nI'd also be happy to answer any questions anybody has.","163":"Totally Noob question, I don't even have an Amazon seller account yet.\n\nI want to start selling on Amazon, merchant fulfilled at first.

I have ordered stuff (bags, labels) and am sourcing cardboard locally to make small boxes.\n\nQUESTION: Is there any way to add inventory items into your Amazon Seller account without actually making them active for sale? A \"hidden\" option for example, maybe under another keyword?\n\nIf not I was going to start filling in the Amazon provided \"Flat.File.InventoryLoader\" spreadsheet for now and wait until I was ready to ship anything before starting a Seller account and uploading the inventory file to Amazon.

Some rebates are confined to one store, but most are available at any store. \n\nIn the Ibotta app, you can look through products that provide rebates, and upon clicking on one, there is a button to \"learn a fact\" (which is usually just an advertisement for the product you're looking at). After clicking on that button, you can take a picture of your reciept, movie ticket, etc. and earn the money. \n\nThe rebate money that you earn can be redeemed for PayPal, Venmo, Best Buy, Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, Regal, iTunes, EXPRESS, or Aeropostale, all with a $10 minimum.\n\n[Referral Link](https:\/\/ibotta.com\/r\/nfgfekt) (Referral code is nfgfekt)\n\n[Non-Referral Link](Http:\/\/ibotta.com\/)\n\n","207":"I have some aged inventory in Amazon FBA.

This may result in a delay for sellers' inbound and outbound shipments that pass through these ports.\n\nIssues such as this occur from time to time, be they related to inclement weather, labor, or other factors, with limited to substantial impacts of varying duration. Sellers have mitigated similar situations in the past by choosing air freight for their shipments, switching to other ports, or exploring other alternatives to expedite shipment.\n\nIf you suspect that a port-related delay may affect your shipments in the future, it may be wise to monitor communication from your carrier partners, as well as local and national media reports, for up-to-date information for your area.","212":"[H] $7 Amazon [W] $5.50 worth of BTC","213":"[H] $5 Amazon [W] 4.50 paypal.","214":"I'm looking to buy Amazon for PayPal at an 88% rate.

I am from the US, so I know that it works there but am not sure about international. I tend to maximize my earning by only cashing out when I reach the best value, so I added a section called max point conversion, which is the best value you can get. Also I included a min point conversion if you like to redeem as soon as possible. Let me know what other useful information I can put.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Ibotta**\n\n* **Description:** I use Ibotta when I go groceries shopping. They have many stores such as Jewel, CVS, and Walgreens and products that I would buy. Sometimes they have a generic product like buy any bread or milk. Most of the time, they are specific products. You can scan the bar code to see if you are buying the right product, so you don't have to regret the purchase for buying the wrong one when you get home. They also have a wide range of rebates for other things like movie tickets and buying x amount at Bestbuy. Your purchase is verified by taking pictures of your receipts. The added benefit of using Ibotta is the teamwork that they have each month. Last month, it is if you get $10 worth of rebates and your team gets $20 worth of rebate, you get an extra $5 back. This month it is if you get $6 and you and your team gets $10,  you get an extra $2. \n\n* **Cash-Out method:** Paypal, Venmo, Gift Cards\n\n* **Cash-Out min:** $10 \n\n* **New Rebates Appears:** Every Day\n\n* **referral bonus:** I know when I signed up, I was able to earn up to $10 in bonus for completing x rebates, but not sure what the current bonus is for new users.

One must decide whether to pay the rent and bills, food, and books. Although renting is another good way to save money, you still would have to pay for a small percentage of the book without ever keeping it. Instead of spending any money at all, by just taking a few minutes out of your daily schedule, you could make enough to buy more than just textbooks! A website that I have been a part of for a while is Tellwut. All you have to do is literally complete surveys for points. How I got started was that I was looking for a way to make extra money online (especially since I never had an allowance growing up). By the way, Tellwut is a GREAT way to have teens earn money online for completing short surveys, instead of asking their parents for money!\n\nI have been a member of Tellwut for over a year now. However, after enrolling in graduate school, I did not have as much time to spend on the website compared to previous years. However, I was able to earn a good amount of Amazon.com gift cards! At 4,000 points, you can redeem a $10 Amazon.com gift card! The surveys take less than 30 seconds to complete. This is great for any passive user.\n\nAnother great website is Vizio Rewards! Whether you buy their products or not, users can complete little tasks daily to earn rewards such as TVs! High-quality speakers and autographed merchandise are other rewards that they have to offer. Vizio Fandemonium is another great way to get items such as TVs, speakers, and memorabilia, all just for a few clicks a day!\n\nOverall, whether you would like to save up money for textbooks or to just have an allowance, both websites are great resources to get items literally free by just doing little tasks every now and then daily for a few minutes. :) \n\nIf you would like to join using my referral links, click here: \nhttp:\/\/www.tellwut.com\/guard\/register\/?refer=SyntaxPentax\nhttps:\/\/rewards.viziofanzone.com?_cts_=gKAnaCk5\n\nIf you would like to join, here are the non-referral links: \nhttp:\/\/www.tellwut.com\/\nhttps:\/\/rewards.viziofanzone.com","242":"(H)Amazon $5x2 (W)BTC $8","243":"[H] $360.30 Amazon Balance [W] Google Wallet \/\/ 85-90% (Bulk Discounts!)","244":"(H)Amazon GC $5x2(W)BTC $8","245":"I am getting into flipping, and I have bought a few items so far and I was curious what steps you guys take to decide if you want to list it on ebay or send it in to FBA? \n\nI started with things I owned, and then took $100 and started buying some small items I found are worth at least 2-3 what I have put in.

We sell our products online via Amazon, ebay, and our website. We tie them all together using Stitchlabs and ship them using Shipstation. Currently they are not being entered automatically into our accounting solution, QuickBooks Premier. That's problem 1.\n\nWe also sell our products to businesses and schools, who usually request a quote for larger purchases (that we generate in Quickbooks), then they issue a PO to us, we issue a PO to our distributor (for items not in stock), then they are invoiced on delivery.\n\nWe're also starting to get a few phone orders per day from tax-exempt entities (schools, military bases). To process these orders is time-consuming. I currently go into Quickbooks, create an invoice, tell them the order total, create them as a customer in Stripe, get the CC info, run the transaction, then enter the order info into Shipstation so that it gets shipped out. This seems very excessive and is impossible if I'm not sitting in front of the computer when the call comes in.\n\nOn top of all of that, we are starting to have walk-in traffic. These customers want to purchase items right now, with a credit card. Right now I've been entering them as a customer in Stripe and charging them for their order total. Many of the walk-in customers purchase a custom service from us (we do 3D printing), so we need the ability to vary what we charge them. But we want to be able to see what % of our overall revenue comes from custom 3D printing.\n\nAll of this wrecks havoc with our inventory numbers, as there is no central place for all of the inventory. Our online sales are fine because we track inventory with Stitchlabs, but if a walk-in or phone customer purchases something, it usually isn't subtracted from inventory.\n\nIdeally everything inventory-related would be tracked in Quickbooks, so that when we purchase new inventory, we can have a better handle on our COGS.\n\nDoes anyone know of a solution or service that could tie everything together?\n\nThanks!","252":"Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit.

I only use my debit card to make online purchases like Amazon, Steam Games, etc. I have no plans to make any loans, make any automatic payments... nada. I will be using it for checking and savings **only.**\n\nI just have *no idea* how credit cards work. Sorry if this sounds stupid. I just turned 20 and I'm living on my own, and I feel like I should know this by now.\n\nI'm with a credit union. I am doing this mostly for security reasons. I will be using my credit card exactly how I would be using my debit card. I am prepared for monthly fees to have such a card.\n\n\nEDIT: Maybe I should get a safety deposit box instead","253":"will go first with high rep trader. http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2rw24g\/u2008ol_gcx_rep_profile\n\nLooking to buy Amazon GCs at 80%\n\nHave games from [Steam](http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198077193611\/inventory\/) up for trade for amazon\/paypal and other offers","254":"Data points and heads up about Personal Capital $10 Amazon gift card","255":"May I ask, what the best way to quickly earn $30 Amazon is?

I bought a car over 2 years ago, and make monthly payments on that, and I made student loan payments in the two years between undergrad and law school. \n\nMy problem is that I'm **terrified** of credit cards. I grew up in a household with two fiscally irresponsible parents, so credit cards have always been a bad, scary thing to me and my reluctance to get one has become kind of a bellwether in my 7+ year relationship . The thing is, deep down I know that a credit card is not a horrible thing for me because I have a summer job lined up that will pay me $37K (gross) and the firm has a historical 100% offer rate for inviting its summer associates to work for them after graduation, so I would be making $160K after graduation in 2016. I know that this puts me in a better position than most to pay off whatever I borrow now.\n\nWhat should I look for when choosing a credit card? What should I be concerned about? What do you recommend for a first-time user like me? I heard something about Amazon credit cards which sounds appealing because I use Amazon prime for my entire life.

You'll have a prompt of what to post about (e.g. \"what's your favorite snack food?\").  You post a message with a brand, a mood, and a picture (although some missions only need one or two of those), and you earn anywhere between 100 and 200 coins normally for those (after so many messages it'll reduce the values, but they'll return to normal after a while). \n\nI honestly can't tell you too much about that, though, because the main draw for me has been their daily reward system.  For each day that you check the app, you earn an increasing amount of coins:\n\n* Day 1: 25 coins\n* Day 2: 50 coins\n* Day 3: 100 coins\n* Day 4: 200 coins\n* Day 5: 400 coins\n\nand it resets back to 25 coins after that.  The coins stack, so that's 775 coins for remembering to check in for 5 days in a row!\n\nA $5 gift card goes for 7,510 coins (and they have Amazon gift cards, for the record), so even if you do nothing else with the app, that's still a $5 gift card for you every 50 days or so.\n\nNote that gift cards are paid out through [Gyft](http:\/\/www.gyft.com\/).\n\nRef-link: https:\/\/www.yappem.com\/profiles\/29411\/twentington\n\nNon ref-link: www.yappem.com","279":"I have one Sears gift card ($17.27) and one Bath &amp; Body Works gift card ($23.13).

I'm in fine financial health.  I have a good emergency fund, I max out my 401k &amp; IRA, and have taxable investments and some savings bonds as well.  I've been using Mint since it debuted, and like how it lets me keep an eye on my finances.\n\nMostly I'm one of those people that just is fairly naturally frugal.  I don't get tempted to go blow money at bars or on fancy stuff usually.\n\nI've noticed that if I overspend a category, I can pull that money out of another without problem.  Some months I spend more on household goods, some months I overspend on travel, or entertainment, but I just find myself shifting dollars around and not really 1) seeing any changes in behavior or 2) feeling any better about my finances.\n\nI'm honestly not looking to change my saving or spending rate too much.  I feel good about how much I save.  I was hoping this would help with #2 above, especially for purchases with a frequency of less than a year.  I have no problem letting my Amazon Prime bill come up once a year, but when I want to buy a new laptop every three I usually have to line it up with bonus season (not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that, I guess) or borrow from savings for a couple months.\n\nI agree that YNAB would certainly help with this.  I would budget $40\/month or whatever for my Laptop fund, and every three years it should have enough to make the purchase.  However, it seems like since there are really only very few of these categories, it might make just as much sense to spin off a few savings accounts, or even one savings account and use a spreadsheet to track internally, for these purchases and have the budgeted amounts be direct deposited into the account(s).  All I can really think about that needs to be covered here that is non-emergency is laptop, car, and phone replacement funds.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is, it seems like I can get the benefit of using YNAB and \"giving every dollar a job\" by investing like I am already, directing the medium-term savings goal money into off-budget accounts, and just not really caring about how my daily living money is spent--because that's basically what I'm doing now.  Moving budgeted amounts around and not really feeling bad about it.  And this seems a lot easier.\n\nDoes anyone else do something similar?","287":"We saved an extra $200 on a 55\" LG smart TV.

I weighed this product against 15 criteria and graded it for each one(much like u\/ABetterLemonadeStand has done in one of his posts) to help me decide.\n\nYou can use these same criteria to grade and analyze a product idea that you have. I hope you find them useful.\n\n**Criteria 1: Potential to add value**\n\nDo you have something to offer the market that isn\u2019t already there? If you are making your own product, is there something about your product that other similar products can\u2019t do?\n\nIf you are reselling, is there something you are doing to the buying experience(educating, curating, presenting, etc) that your competitors aren\u2019t? If you can add value, you can set yourself apart from everyone else. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be a \u201cme-too\u201d merchant.\n\nInstead, why not be a \u201cME!\u201d merchant?\n\n**Criteria 2: Potential market size**\n\nHow big is your market? How many buyers are out there looking for your product or solution? Knowing this will help you figure out whether your time and effort will be justified through the profit you can make.\n\nWays to gauge: Google Keyword Planner, # of competitors, social media mentions, blogs talking about your product\/niche\n\n**Criteria 3: Trend**\n\nIs your product something that\u2019s dying out? You may find there is no competition for selling DVD players anymore - but that\u2019s because people have moved on to Blu-ray and Netflix. Find out if your product is trending up or down.\n\nUse Google Trends and search for keywords around your product, and see the data it shows you.\n\n**Criteria 4: Competition**\n\nHow formidable is your competition? Are the others selling what you sell the absolute best in the business? Have they been around for years with a cemented market share and constant innovation? Or are they leaving a lot on the table to be desired?\n\nYou want to go up against something you can easily compete against - so the battle isn\u2019t too uphill.\n\n**Criteria 5: Local availability**\n\nIs what you are selling found everywhere in Targets or Walmarts? Or do people have to really look to find it?\n\nIf it\u2019s found everywhere, not everyone wanting that product will look online. If it\u2019s a rarity, then people looking for it will have to search online, and the chances of finding you are higher.\n\n**Criteria 6: Markup and price**\n\nHow much can you make per sale? Markup and price are tied together and form a sweet balance. A markup of 100% is useless on a $5 product unless you can sell it in large quantities.\n\nA markup of just 10% on a $1000 product is still $100.\n\nHow much markup you have and what you are selling your product for will show you how much room is left for marketing and other expenses.\n\n**Criteria 7: Repeat sale potential**\n\nWhat if you could get a customer once, and then they\u2019d keep coming back to buy from you? Does your product have that potential? Is it consumable or perishable? If it is, and your customer likes what you sell, you\u2019ve only got to sell it once, and they\u2019ll keep coming back.\n\nThis is why subscription ecommerce is so cool.\n\n**Criteria 8: Size, weight, durability**\n\nSize, weight, and durability will affect your shipping costs and transit damage risk. The heavier the product, or the bigger, the more costly to ship.\n\nThe more sturdy your product, the greater chance there is of it breaking(getting to you or getting to your customer).\n\n**Criteria 9: Seasonality**\n\nIs your product something that people only buy for a few months during the year, or is it year-round? The longer your buying season is, the better for you. Even if sales are slow, you still have bills to pay, so it\u2019s better to have a product that sells well for as long as possible.\n\n**Criteria 10: Turnover**\n\nHow many times does your entire product line have to refresh? If you are selling clothing, probably very often. If you sell tools, probably very rarely. High turnover bites you if you stock products and still have product left over even though the manufacturer has come out with a new line.\n\nIf you drop-ship, this won\u2019t affect you as much.\n\n**Criteria 11: Perishability**\n\nIf you sell food items, you have to sell them very quickly, otherwise they can spoil and your money is basically gone. Perishability may also be a problem if you sell reactive chemicals, but then again, if you are, you\u2019ve got a lot more things to worry about.\n\n**Criteria 12: Barrier to entry**\n\nHow difficult or easy is it for someone to set up the same thing you are doing? If it\u2019s just pulling a feed of products and throwing up a store, you\u2019ve got a lot of competition to deal with. If there\u2019s a lot more research, effort, and investment involved, you\u2019ll be more serious about the business, and you\u2019ll be dealing with fewer competitors - which is good.\n\n**Criteria 13: Suppliers**\n\nHow is the customer service and support for your suppliers? Are they responsive and good communicators? Any issues that may arise have to be dealt with promptly, and the better your supplier and your relationship is, the easier it will be to keep a smoothly sailing ship.\n\n**Criteria 14: Target market**\n\nDo you know exactly who your ideal customer is? Can you find a sub-niche within your niche and appeal even more directly to your customers?\n\nDefining a target market is not easy, and it may become clearer as you start getting sales and see patterns and trends. Don\u2019t sweat it if you aren\u2019t completely sure up front - just make sure it\u2019s high on your list of priorities.\n\n**Criteria 15: Growth and scaling**\n\nFinally, you want to build a business that is designed to scale and grow. If you have to spend hours to get one order out, what will you do on the day you suddenly get a hundred orders because of a press mention?\n\nSo there you have it. Try and grade your product ideas against these criteria and see what average you get. The higher your score the better your odds are.\n\nThis post has already gotten quite long - if you\u2019d like to read the even-longer version, [you can do so here](http:\/\/bootstrappingecommerce.com\/how-i-chose-the-niche-for-my-new-online-store\/).\n\nEDIT: It was pointed out that I had incorrectly used the term \"margin\" instead of \"markup\" in Criteria 6, and I've corrected it.

I might keep this limitation throughout all the sites I push this week, what do you think?","327":"$50 Best Buy for Amazon","328":"After budgeting my monthly income and cutting back expenses, I was still looking for ways to be more mindful of my discretionary spending. It seemed like I would always fall victim to impulse buys when grocery shopping, stopping to eat on my way home instead of cooking, ordering that gadget off of Amazon I had been eyeing (It was only 30 bucks, and I just got paid, no harm right?). All of this added up to me spending more and rolling over less of my income into my discretionary account at the start of the month (where my saving for big purchases go, rolls into emergency account\/savings at increments) . I\u2019ve been tracking everything with mint and monitoring my accounts and purchases like a hawk, yet I would still be leaking money in random categories. I should clarify that I\u2019ve been trying to establish a pattern of having a discretionary budget of 100 dollars that I use for things like Netflix, Spotify, and anything else that catches my eye that month. This is was already a fairly challenging goal as I used to spend about $250 or more on randomness each month. I never saw much of an issue with spending up to $300-$400 since it was normally left over after the month\u2019s bills and other obligations (Car note, savings, emergency fund etc.).  Then I had an epiphany I wanted to share that has helped me live more frugally than I thought I would ever be comfortable with (no more new gadgets every month!)  \n\nI had just recently paid down all of my credit cards to $0 balances (2 cards) and remember the dread I felt of owing $1500 on a $1600 credit line. I was thankful I could always make a little higher than minimum payments but was just able to recently wipe out my credit card debt in its entirety. Credit card debt has always made me uneasy, and I cannot stand the idea of owing money to someone. That\u2019s when it hit me. Instead of spending my money I had with my debit card, I should look at spending my discretionary income as debt. The easiest way for me to do that was to use my credit cards for my monthly spending. I leave my debit card at home, and have my credit cards with me for purchases. Having only a credit card at my disposal, every \u2018extra\u2019 purchase I make from the month gives me the same cringe as my credit debt used to. This really makes me think twice about whether or not I want to stop and get something to eat instead of cooking what I have at home. Those bad spending habits are associated with a feeling of dread and are now few and far between. This fear of credit has helped me stay on point with my spending goals while helping boost my credit. I also use cash back cards exclusively that roll over rewards into my discretionary account, so it gets a little (yes, very little, but still something) boost every so often. \n\nNow the disclaimer \u2013 Not everyone can manage credit responsibly and end up putting themselves in a position where they cannot pay off their cards every month. In cases as such, this method is not for your, do not attempt at home. \n\nFor the rest of you that have had a similar issue and a healthy fear of credit cards, I hope this helps you as much as it has me. \n\nI would like to know how some of you guys' use methods in preventing yourselves from over spending each month. I'm always looking for ways to tweak my method","329":"Hi, I'm looking for Amazon GC, will trade it with Verified PayPal @ 90% Rate. Please comment and pm me if you want to trade.

Let's break your numbers down.  You have $2000 in profit over 5 months and according to your website there are five of you in this venture. That means you've each earned an average of $25 a week.  People who are serious about online earnings are bringing in many times that.  I also suspect that many of them know how to minimize their taxes.  As a small business owner, you'll learn that the tax man comes to you first. (And second and third!)  For every $1000 in business profits I make, between $300-500 goes to the government. I actually cut back on the amount of work I was doing because half of everything was going to taxes.\n\nNow it is true that your business may grow bigger but with only 6 products and not much to speak of in profits from the past holiday season, you've got some challenges ahead of you in what is now the slowest season of the year for most retail businesses.

Sorry, I'm just not following.\n\nWe haven't had any complaints from people who gave their Amazon gift card away for a lower rate, only to see the person they traded with trading away their Amazon balance for a higher rate, and we're glad about that in itself because it means people are happy and content. If we did get complaints about that, we'd honestly just tell them they could have always said no to the original trade\/not to trade with that user again, but like I said, that's not the main issue. The problems is a small percentage of the subreddit doing a very large percentage of the community's trades, with the intention solely to flip the cards for a profit.\n\n\/u\/yuv9 summed it up well in another comment on this thread:\n\n&gt;The problem we have here is that a handful of traders are literally purchasing every bit of amazon available and then selling it at a higher price. They are purchasing, just to sell and we feel it goes against the philosophy of the subreddit to do this. On top of this, many of these purchases come from less than trusted sources, so people selling it are passing the risk unknowingly to their buyers. \n\nBear in mind that this would only be a limit on *balance* trading. Flipping can still happen, but it will be much harder, and more dangerous. If someone wants to buy an Amazon gift card for 80%, not redeem it, and flip it for 90%, that's fine. We could never stop that. They'll just have to assume the risk that the card is usable when they try to trade it again. I personally wouldn't take that risk.","340":"I don't think converting works.

That's where we stand right now.\n\nRight now, it's just a few complaints here and there from third parties who notice that people are consistently flipping, and they feel that it isn't in the spirit of this community, and we agree with them.

(If that is not the case, then you didn't make that clear.) That's a lot of money for a bar of soap. You don't justify the premium.\n\n2) You make claims that are specious, at best. For instance, vitamins in oils used in soap are not readily absorbed through skin. A keen investor will ask how you will manage a lawsuit if someone, as another example, sues you because your coffee soap gave them a rash.\n\n3) You have very little information about the soap itself other than the brief description on your site. Though I'm very skeptical, I don't think $30 soap is impossible; I just don't think your soap is worth more than the Dial or Dove soap in the supermarket. I think you need to tell a better story and create a kind of legend around your product.\n\nFor instance, if you were to use a certain type of root or plant extract in your soap, something you had to import and cultivate by hand, yourself, that might differentiate it enough. Put it all together in a cohesive story. Pack the soap into a hand-made bark box. And let's say the story is that there is a particular tribe in the Amazon that is famous for their hunting prowess. Their secret is that they use a particular root, that only grows near their land in Brazil. This root, when rubbed onto the skin, repels mosquitoes and kills odor such that you become \"invisible\" to animals, hence the improved hunting ability. So you put a tiny bit of this root (in powder form or as an essential oil) into the soap, and wrap the soap in the bark of the tree that the root is from. That's a legend. That's something that can make soap worth $30.","348":"To keep this on track, remember, we're only talking about Amazon balance, and trying to make sure that there is as little risk as possible when trading it. Whether it's sold for a profit, loss, or break-even is not the main point. It's just that most people here have good basic business sense, and flip for a profit. We know that's a major incentive for trading Amazon balance, and when something goes bad in those trades, it gets ugly fast.\n\nThe crux of this is that we want people to only trade for items that they actually want and will use. This is a free market in terms of buyers and sellers setting rates, as opposed to some sort of external force (mods, stock market, who knows) setting rates for certain types of trades. If someone is buying gift cards with the sole intention to sell them for a profit later, that's fine in itself, but this is not probably the place for it. Plus, they should probably consider flipping something more tangible, other than a gift card, given how many issues we've seen with this kind of thing.\n\nAmazon balance trades are the trickiest, most dangerous trades that are still allowed in this community, which is why we have to manually approve each one. If flipping is involved and there is an issue, the original seller, the flipper, and the final buyer are all affected and need to talk to us. The risk is spread among three people. If there is no flipping and the trade stays between the original seller and the original buyer (only two people), it's much safer because there are just fewer variables in play. Simple as that.\n\nThe fewer balance trades that happen here, the safer this place becomes overall. Hope that explains to you why we think it should be limited, as well as why we already manually approve this sort of thing, since it's already been limited in that sense for quite some time now.

My personal favorite is this brand of [Jasmine Rice](http:\/\/images.ttcdn.co\/i\/product\/300\/0\/196351-e9d7b0112fda4446ae2e50d2e43137cf.jpeg), with the three green elephants on it.  In Chinatown here, a 20lb bag costs I think just over $15.  I haven't bought since last year.  It's white jasmine rice, we just steam it in a rice cooker. I'm usually cooking for 2, and try to aim for 0.5cups for the two of us for dinner.  Any more and we get leftovers.  I see on Amazon that other 20lb bags are wayyyy more expensive than this!  Note.....cuz of my family's disposition towards diabetes, I try not to eat *too* much rice.  Some people can stack up bowls of rice in one meal, I keep it rather proportional to my meats.\n\nI don't think I've ever had rice go stale.  Don't worry about it. :)  We don't refrigerate it, it just sits in a covered trash can in the cabinet.  I hear you can add some bay leaves to make sure bugs don't get in to it, which is something you can do with flour as well.\n\nOther rice recommendations: BLACK rice.  So this will be more expensive than regular white or brown rice, and there are many varieties within \"Black\" - there's Jasmine too, and sticky black rice and regular.  You might also see it listed as \"Forbidden rice\".  It has this beautiful purple color and has the same antioxidants as blueberries (similar coloration).  It's supposed to be healthier for you; when my uncle was told he is at risk for diabetes, we switched to using this.  Its texture is similar to brown rice, and it's kinda tough, so we pre-soak it in water for a couple hours before steaming it in a rice cooker.  Another uncle of mine is fond of chopping up some Chinese dried sausage (for the fat so you can probably use anything fatty) and putting it on top of the rice, then steaming it in the rice cooker.  You can also mix it - half purple and half white rice; it'll stain the white stuff purple too and be very pretty :)  While not as nutritionally bereft as plain white rice.\n\nEDIT: If you're just starting out with rice, I highly recommend just getting some smaller, 5lb bags till you find a certain strain and brand that you're fond of.\n\n","364":"&gt;By banning flipping [***of Amazon balance***], you are removing a service this subreddit has for little to no benefit.\n\nNo one is denying that there is a tradeoff here. We wish there was not a tradeoff. But to say there would be no benefit is inaccurate: people besides mods who are opposed to it would be happier (minor, but noteworthy), the free market would see some more free market-like activity and kind of normal out from what we've observed lately, and of course, scammers would have less incentive to scam knowing they would have no way to move their stolen goods to get cash.","365":"Glad it wasn't sarcastic, I always ask and give benefit of the doubt haha.\n\nIs it the majority? That's what this town hall discussion is for, and so far, even if we ignore the opinions of the mods, it looks pretty evenly split.\n\nIf you still don't see how this would hurt scammers, I don't know how to phrase it any differently.

I resorted to eBay where I paid a whopping $98 for one, which is the cheapest I could find it with shipping, but I was beyond pissed off when the package arrived and it became clear that the seller had simply bought up all the stock at his local Wal-Mart so he could jack the prices up on eBay and sell it to desperate parents for twice its retail value (pretty sure this was the case for many of those sellers who had 5 or 10 available). \n\nI was nice about it and gave him a positive rating on eBay because he had the most reasonable price out of all of them, but I'm not going to sit here and act like someone hoarding kids Christmas toys on Black Friday so they can resale it for 200% its value on the Internet isn't at least somewhat morally reprehensible. \n\nThat being said, trying to \"do business\" in a rude manner is equally as despicable.

It REALLY doesn't take much for a permanent ban from ebay which is surprisingly difficult to get around.\n\n\n&gt;I dont know how its not worth the effort...how hard is it to simply type in a different address on paypal before you buy it?\n\nIt's all about $-per-hour.  If you invest the time to dig a legit little niche or several that generates happy buyers with profits, it's not worth it to deal in stuff like this that risks our livelihoods (again, it's difficult to get around a ban) for LESS money than we normally make.  Show me ONE Amazon listing where you can turn even just $100 by selling on ebay.  I'm sure they exist, but they take hours and hours to find.  Most people who sell do so for profit, and those with profit in mind generally take into account where to sell.  If it's a matter of $5 they may not, but for $5 I can spend a lot less time making the same $ elsewhere.

There are numerous sites for books besides Ebay and Amazon.Try abe books, biblio, alibris etc. Where the fiction books are concerned, if they are all modern ones, it is probably best to sort them by author and put together as many sets as possible.

Don't go for stocks with absurd PEs because reality usually catches up with them. Do go for stocks with a decent valuation - a lowish PE, good growth prospects.\n\nA stock like GPRO, NFLX, AMZN, half if not more of the price is for the hype and greed. It's $74 so obviously it'll go to $100 next! If they just have 50% revenue growth for the next 5 years, it'll be fairly valued! No. Just don't. And if you do, it needs to be a much smaller, single-digit percentage of your portfolio.\n\nLastly, if you're not going to spend hours researching stocks and valuations, following news, reading articles about stocks you're considering (at least for a few weeks), don't go with individual stocks.

Thank you for posting this for all to see and share and for taking the time to respond to almost every comment.  I just stumbled on this yesterday (I\u2019m not exactly sure which rabbit hole I was down when I landed on it, I was searching something for bicycles\u2026 haha) and I spent most of the day reading all of the series and most of the comments.  It has inspired me to start up my own case study - I currently have a website with over 3000 posts and 50+ pages focused on a concept that I tried to do for a few years but eventually had to abandon since it wasn\u2019t generating enough money for me to live\/support my family (I let it go dormant 2 years ago knowing that someday I would try and revive it).  It was a totally different model than affiliate marketing but I realized yesterday that I could take the 6K visitors a month that I still get and see if I could grow that and somehow start to make some affiliate income off of it.  Now, with that intro, I will ask a couple questions.  I got really excited about using Amazon\u2019s Affiliate program but I live in one of the banned states and they don\u2019t offer it here.  So I have to nix that idea.  My niche is a subset of the fitness community and product reviews were always a part of what I was doing in the past so Amazon was a good fit.  \n\nDo you have any recommended alternative affiliate programs or networks or would you just suggest reaching out to the manufacturers which relate to the products I could review\/promote?  I know you have kind of answered this already but I searched back through all the comments again this morning and I cannot find what your recommendation was (specifically regarding someone\u2019s comment about being in Colorado and wanting to do something about cycling)  \u2013 trust me, I gave it a valiant effort!  \n\nThe second question I have is whether or not you would recommend some of my own \u201cspring cleaning\u201d to my existing content or should I just refresh it and update some of them with some affiliate links \u2013 if the latter is the recommendation, would I just find the posts with the highest organic content and then try and sandwich in some affiliate links or do I leave the old stuff alone and just write \u201cupdates\u201d on some of my higher view posts?\n\nThanks again for all of this.  I\u2019ll start my own \u201ccase study series\u201d next month so the sub can all follow along as well and learn with me.\n","578":"It's definitely a case of \"your mileage may vary.\" I buy about $300 of stuff for the household through amazon each year, plus most of my gifts and personal goods.\n\nIt's just getting hard to find a lot of stuff anymore without going online. Spare parts especially will be either on Amazon (new) or ebay (used). And online prices for hobby items almost always beat store prices, especially when you factor in time and gas.

On Ebay and Amazon it depends on how many items I have listed on each site but I average around $2,000 each month for both sites.

","581":"&gt;My girlfriend also has no medical history of problems, exercises and is in good shape. She had to have a surgery this year that was completely out of the blue and unexpected. It was 18k, she didn't have to pay that because she had insurance.\n\nThe OP would have to pay $8400 of that meaning ~4-5 years of no health problems and he'd break even with an $18k medical expense. Health insurance, especially under the ACA is about transferring the cost of health care from the old and sick to the young and healthy. In 5 years I've cost my health insurance company &lt;$1000 while they've likely made close to $15-20,000 off my premiums. \n\n&gt;Want to know part of the reason health care costs so much, because people like you don't get insurance, and then when they go to the ER, they can't afford to pay, so hospitals have to charge people with insurance more, to cover those costs.\n\nThat is a part of the cost but the real reason health care costs so much is there is virtually no price transparency and no way for a consumer to shop for the cheapest services. Hospitals can charge whatever they want because our healthcare system is setup to make figuring out the true cost of service impossible. Imagine trying to buy a TV if all the major retailers charged 10-20x the actual cost and allowed some buyers to pay varying fractions of that price. You'd have no idea if it made sense to buy the TV from Amazon or from Best Buy. There would also be zero motivation for Amazon and Best Buy to compete on price.

Most Americans have some form of debt. Credit Cards: 15%-25% Annual Interest, Student Loans: 3%-9% interest, Mortgage: 4%-6% interest, Car Loan: 3%-15% etc...Paying down debt average ret these rates for a guaranteed return are much better than any other return on a risk adjusted basis. If you are getting a \"refund\" aka your money back in amounts of $1500\/year your actually losing out on as much as ~$100 or more per year if you have credit card debt with an APR of 15%. \n\nHere's a rough example:\n\nI have $2000 in CC debt on my Amazon credit card from all the sick gifts I got my family and friend for Christmas in January of last year (2014). Over the course of the year I pay the card down all little each month but still have a balance of $1,500 come new years at the end of 2014. All the while I set my exemptions too low and my W2 employer over-withheld my federal income taxes (never mind state income taxes, I live in Texidakota). I get paid each week but they over withhold $30 a pay period. No big deal, it's like a built in savings plan, right? I got about $1,500 back last year. I'll get that amount back again this year (52 paychecks\u00d7 $30 each time= $1560\/year) and pay for those Xmas gifts when I get my refund for 2014 in 2015.\n\nWhy is this common occurrence wrong? Because each paycheck that I didn't use that $30 towards the $2000 CC balance I got charged interest. I didn't get any interest back on the money the federal treasury was holding over the course of the year. If I had paid the CC each pay period (or monthly) with my withheld tax money I would have saved approximately $100 in credit card interest: $1,500 \u00d7 15% = $225 \/ 2 (average over the whole year) = $112 in charged interest.","609":"If you're looking into doing it online, look into selling products on Amazon.

I have made plenty of mistakes over the last 3 years but I use some tools to limit those mistakes.  Not sure how many of these tools will apply to UK but here goes:\n\n*  Buy Terapeak.  Go on Ebay.  Go to the daily deal page.  Click an an item.  Copy that seller's Ebay name and paste in in Terapeak.  Click to view their top selling items over the last 30 days and check their top 10 items.  Repeat this for all the sellers on the deal page.  They can all move volume and will have hot items.  Better yet, once you look at that sellers top items in Terapeak, pick one of the items like this one on the deals now \"Infant Baby Child Travel Bed Cot Bassinet Play Pen Playpen With Entryway New\" and search for the top product sellers of this item by using Terapeak to search for the top sellers on Ebay UK for \"Bed Cot\" or \"Play Pen\" or \"Travel Bed\" and once you find the top sellers of those items, search all of that seller's other items.  This will create a huge revolving door of never-ending products to source that have a proven history on Ebay.  Stay away from the name brand sellers since you are not going to be importing name brand products.  This is one of the best ways to create product ideas for items to sell on Ebay.  It is impossible to run out of items.  You start with \"Bed Cot\" and someone who sells Bed Cots may also sell sleeping bags and someone that sells sleeping bags may sell flash lights, and someone that sells flashlights may sell knives, and someone that sells knives may sell cutlery, and someone that sells cutlery may sell small kitchen appliances.\n\n*  For Amazon, use camelcamelcamel to check pricing history and sales rank history on Amazon.\n\n*  Go on Amazon and type in a popular term like \"Cell Phone Case\" and see what the suggested results are before pressing enter.  Take a look at those items.\n\n*  Look at the top ranked items on Amazon by category.  When looking at those lists, look for products with low reviews.  Click those low reviews.  See what the complaints are.  Source a similar product that fixes those issues.  For example, maybe someone sells a tent that is ranked really high but the reviews say it is too small - go make a bigger one.  Maybe someone sells a hammock and they say the tree straps are low quality - go source a better one.  Maybe a flashlight that is not bright enough - go source a brighter one.\n\n*  Check out Amzshark.  This tool allows you to type in any ASIN and spy on the sales.  Type in some popular ones and give it a week.  Then check out the total sales on that ASIN to see how many units of a product you should purchase.\n\n*  I just started using the following method and I think some other's do it but it has worked well for me so far.  Go on Amazon and type in \"Generic\".  Click one of the top results.  Once you are on that item's page, click the brand name \"generic\" right under the title.  You will now be viewing popular listings in that category that are generic.  That means you will be able to import most of those items and sell right on the listing without creating a custom listing.\n\nI have used all of the methods above over the last 3 years and they have all worked.  To help you out more, you may want to pick a margin you are looking for and stick to it.  Of course you can only estimate your sale price and need to be realistic but start with something around 15% on cheap products.  Don't be afraid to take low margins at first.  You need to get some stuff moving so you can get some practice in.  Practice printing labels, packing items, handling customer issues and claims.  Anything I source goes in a calculator.  It would be a good idea to track everything in a spreadsheet.  The Amazon fee structure is available and it does not take much skill to put that table in excel and plug items in.  Also use the FBA revenue calculator if you plan to go that way.

Because of this and because the flippers are already buying up all the amazon nearly instantly after the initial post of the trade, the only way to obtain larger amounts has become to constantly return to the sub and get luck and snag a $5 code 100 times, or to deal with a flipper and make one or two trades. I was seriously surprised that it was nearly impossible to buy any Amazon 90% and that I could only trade when offering 95%.

And that's the ball game. \n\n***It ALWAYS happens under the advice you were given, 100% of the time, Period.*** \n\nYou can extend the relationship by making it 1) easy for them to call you, 2) easy for them to work with you and 3) making it easy to pay you consistently. \n\nIn the process of that, you can pick a number of hours you're comfortable devoting to it monthly (*+\/- 5 hours a week is reasonable depending upon the gig, and can be knocked out on your off hours with a minimum of hassle*). \n\nThat's the consulting negotiation in a nutshell. \n\nYou can still look for actual work, or look for new consulting gigs, and it doesn't eat your world. If it DOES eat more than the ~5 hours a week, you just let him know you'll revisit your availability every 90 days to see if the contract still makes sense. \n\nI don't ever work at the consulting end more than 20 hours a week for multiple companies. \"I'm living comfortably\" is a polite way to put it. If I want more I do more, but don't have to. I choose gigs based on what I'm interested in. \n\nAs for this? As long as you don't make it too complicated for the former employer, ***this is a low-hanging fruit.*** Pluck it.\n\nFor others who are interested in rock-solid counsel on how to consult? I'd encourage you to find a copy of Alan Weiss' ***The Consulting Bible*** on Amazon. It's well worth the money. \n\nI've had a chance to correspond and dialogue with Dr. Weiss many times, and it is bar none the best information I've seen on the subject. That book is easily worth 6-figures annually just implementing what's in the book. \n\nGood Luck OP, and Good Hunting. :)","686":"I can see a lot of Amazon affiliates going crazy about this.\r","687":"&gt; would seem the most often found game you can find, that retains value\n\nNot just what sells.

My Sapphire card has a phone number on the back that is immediately answered by a human who immediately helps you with what you need.\n\nChase isn't that terrible but they do tend to strange things and fuck up.\n\n**For instance [before I went with Ally]:**\n\nI had multiple phone calls from Chase \"bank managers\" asking for personal information over the phone for \"Know your customer\" information. Odd. I told them I filled out their forms when I created my account and that it was their responsibility to provide accurate information.\n\nThis was followed by an issue when I applied for a credit card with Chase. Chase claimed I wasn't me. I called them up and basically told them I was cancelling my bank account. They continued to insist I wasn't me and actually attempted to claw-back my money after I transferred it away to Ally.\n\nIt was a nightmare and I never want to deal with it again. Oddly enough, I saw an offer on Amazon.com for a free $50 credit if I signed up for a Chase card. I didn't notice the Chase part and blindly clicked on it :P They approved me o.O\n\nThey are just bizarre and erratic.\n\n","689":"How much money did you make from Amazon?

Competition is fierce. I wouldn't count on being able to secure the last minute deals, negotiate the terms, post them to your site, market them, and sell them in the very very narrow window you're talking about.\n\nI did product management for an adventure tour operator. It took us months to go from the idea stage, through negotiation, to being able to list the tour on our site. Plus, there are insurances to worry about, and a lot of countries (not sure where you are) require you to hold the money until the trip is completed so that you can guarantee the trip (in case of issues that you must reimburse). \n\nNot to mention how fucking particular people are about their vacations. You're mostly dealing with people that have very limited time off from work, and they want their trip to be a fucking 5 star experience (even if they're only willing to pay for a 2 star one). They complain about EVERYTHING. Suddenly the lack of hot water in one hotel on their 3 weeks excursion through the Amazon is your fault. Even though they're 1,000 miles from what can be considered civilization. Or they want to know EXACTLY what will be served beforehand at a hotel that advertises a continental breakfast in Kenya.

A critical thinking human being might ask how can an economy growing at 4% GDP, with a 5.7% unemployment rate (supposedly meaning 94.3% of people who want jobs have them), and extremely confident consumers could see retail sales have the biggest two month drop since the dreadful recession year of 2009. Luckily, there are no critical thinking human beings working in the corporate MSM and very few wandering the streets of America.\n\nThe month over month declines are dreadful as it is, especially in the discretionary spending areas. Auto sales have fallen two months in a row. Maybe they have given a subprime loan to everyone left in the country. Furniture sales plunged in January. That always happen during a housing recovery. Right? Sales at sporting goods, book, &amp; music stores cratered for the 2nd month in a row. Department store sales crashed for the 2nd month in a row. Bye Bye JC Penney and Sears. Even online sales barely budged over the two month period. Amazon surely deserves a $200 stock price. Right?\n\nIt\u2019s actually much worse than even the talking heads on CNBC will admit. Listen closely to see if they discuss the fact last December and January were during the dreaded Polar Vortex. Remember the paralyzing snows and cold weather. That was the excuse for shitty retail sales last year. This December and January, except for New England, have been a walk in the park. Relatively mild temperatures and not too much snow for most of the nation. The comparisons should have been a piece of cake. Instead, retail sales were only up 3.3% over last year. Considering inflation, according to the BLS, has been 1.7%, that means real retail sales only grew by 1.6% versus the dreadful POLAR VORTEX depressed sales from last year. And this is with a plunge in the unemployment rate and the skyrocketing consumer confidence. \n\nLet\u2019s face it. The global economy is plunging into recession and the U.S. is going along for the ride. What do the media boneheads think is going to happen when real median household income is at 1989 levels? The reason retail sales have fallen the most since 2009 is because wages are stagnant, Obamacare costs are skyrocketing, local and state taxes &amp; fees are increasing dramatically, and the cost of food is rising. Welcome to the Greater Depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n","699":"As much as I've used and abused my Costco Amex, there are several other cards out there worth looking at.

Growing food that goes bad is a total waste.  Track your grocery bill and total up those items.  Get a sense for what is going to be a good investment for you.\n\nSecond, there are many gardening methods.  Some are cheaper and some are more expensive.   To pick one you need to answer: How much time and effort are you willing to put into this?  Watering?  Weeding?  How much do you care about aesthetics?   Are you willing to spend time to track down free\/cheap materials?\n\nMy pick?   I'm lazy.  I know I don't want to till, dig, and weed constantly.  I'm really willing to source my materials cheaply. My only sun is in our front yard so it has to look nice.  I know I'm forgetful and I'd miss a critical watering session and everything would die.\n\nMethod:  I went with raised garden beds (no digging!)  It's also less prone to weeds.  Harvesting, planting, and pulling weeds (when needed) are easier without stooping if you build walls about 2 feet high that include a ledge you can sit on.   \n\nBed construction:  I am using [this blogger's](http:\/\/ohdeardrea.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/our-raised-beds-easy-metal-wood-garden.html) design.   I am going to build a LARGE garden.  It will have about 250 linear feet of bed wall and come in about $700 in materials.   (I'm using the plastic panels instead of metal for aesthetics and longevity.)\n\nFilling the beds:   Buying a truckload of soil gets expensive in a hurry.   If you are willing to be patient you can fill your beds with various organic material and let it compost down.  Google is full of articles on what is safe and effective and various free sources.  \n\nSeeds:   Are very, very cheap.\n\nTools:  Are very limited in raised bed gardening.   A simple hand trowel and a pitch fork.\n\nFertilizer:  If you fill your raised beds with enough organic matter you don't NEED anything else.  \n\nWatering:  I splurge here.  I am installing a drip irrigation system to my beds that is hooked to a moisture sensor.  It will water automatically when needed.   Probably $100 to $150 dollars with parts from Home Depot and Amazon.\n\n**Edit**  A system worth looking at if it doesn't have to look neat and tidy is [hugelkultur.](http:\/\/www.permaculture.co.uk\/articles\/many-benefits-hugelkultur)  It's basically big mounds of logs stacked up and covered in a layer of organic matter.

I thought 'why the hell not' and threw mine up there. It sold in a few days. I dont know why anyone was buying an ancient MP3 player but....they did. \n\nSo I kept an eye on the item. Sure enough a couple of weeks ago, someone put 2 new ones up on Amazon for $25 each. I bought them immediately. By the time I got them in to Amazon, all other sellers were sold out, so I popped the price up to $99 just to see what would happen.

Well, let's put it this way, the last time I went in for an emissions harness the confused and underpaid teenager behind the counter brought me a box of random hoses and let me pick out the right one...\n\nRockAuto is *kind* of good, let me elaborate:\n\nThey don't own anything. Everything is drop-shipped. So RockAuto doesn't really have any quality control over what's shipped out, and most of the time it's fine, but when things are bad, things are fucked. They do, however, have an excellent parts catalog so it's a good place to go to shop, but order from Amazon with the P\/N. Especially if you have Prime.\n\nAnd an unrelated gripe on classic car parts, if you ever get into that: Eckler's is a shower of bastards that also drop-ships 90% of their stock, so it never arrives right - much less on time!

You don't go source a book, send it to Amazon, and get the money(obviously).\n\nEven if you consciously know that, you have to figure certain metrics. To make $2,000 a month lets say, you have to have an inventory worth way more than that. Only a percentage of your inventory sells every month. This is especially true with books. \n\nReally, it's payment via trickling through your big inventory. With a tiny inventory and only lets say 20% of it selling every month, you won't see huge results. That trickling becomes noticeable when you basically are producing more inventory than you're getting rid of so you're consistently having more things to be sold every month. \n\nAlso, since literally anyone does this with a phone, you have to be out there longer, traveling farther, scanning more items, getting there earlier to seriously see results.

The real answer, as in sociology, is that it depends.  \n\nLet's take the most common assumption that laserjet is just less expensive in operational costs and over the life of the device by comparing the Brother HL-L2340DW(laserjet $122.99) mentioned in another comment and the HP OfficeJet Pro 8610(inkjet $119.99).  Assuming that we can purchase both of these devices at about the same price, let's just focus on the operational costs.\n\nThe Brother high-yield cartridge on Amazon is 50.99 and yields 2600 pages.  Divide 50.99\/2600 and you get $0.0196 per page printed - so almost 2 cents per page.  \n\nNow lets look at the HP OfficeJet Pro 8610, with many more capabilities than the Brother printer-only device.  The HP 950xl cartridge(black) yields 2300 pages and is $26.99 on Amazon.  This comes out to $0.0117 per black &amp; white page.  That's closer to 1 penny per page, compared to the almost 2 cents per page on the Brother.  \n\nLet's take a look at color printing on the HP  - something the Brother is not capable of.  The 3-pack of colors needed in the HP 951xl cartridge is $89.99 on Amazon and yields 1500 pages per cartridge. We'll assume you're using an equal portion of each color on a color print, which comes out to $0.0599 per color page.  This is actually less expensive than most color laserjets in operational costs.\n\nThere are some other things to consider about a laserjet printer versus officejet as well.  A laserjet printer has a fuser that requires a good deal of energy to heat up and fuse the toner to the paper.  For this reason, a comparable laserjet printer uses more electricity than an inkjet printer.  That fuser also has to be replaced at some point.  Most manufacturers of laserjet printers sell what's called a \"Maintenance Kit\" for their laserjets that includes that fuser and some other rollers and such.  \n\nOn that point, if you think a cheap Brother laserjet printer is going to last you longer than a comparable HP OfficeJet, I would say you're going to be disappointed, but a lot of it just depends on how much you're going to print on it.  I work in this industry and have never been at all impressed with Brother products.  \n\nAs mentioned by others, you'll also want to consider the ink print heads.  If this is a printer that might be placed in storage for a few months (extended travel or going home from college during the summer), a laserjet may be the way to go.  \n\nBottom line, if you need the color print functionality or the scan\/fax functionality of a multifunction printer, there are plenty of good reasons, costs included, to choose something like the HP OfficeJet Pro 8610.  If all that you want are monochrome prints and you want to be able to store the device for long periods of time, you should consider a laserjet.

So if you have refunds coming then you won't have any issues.  But you must file for the refunds within 3 years of the original due date of the returns so do not wait longer.\n\nIf you owe taxes then there will be interest charges (fair since you're paying late) and will likely be penalties.  File the returns and make the payments without including the penalties and interest and the IRS will bill you for these.  When you get the bill send them the interest and write a letter asking them to waive the penalties.  Worst they can do is say no.\n\nTheoretically they can fine you for failure to file even if you have refund coming but from a practical standpoint I don't think they do this unless they detect through other means that you haven't filed and come after you to file.  I've never heard of anyone filing a return voluntarily and getting this penalty, and in fact have never personally heard of anyone getting it accessed other than in a news article about some notorious non-filer.\n\nYou can file the returns on your own, using tax software going to a tax preparer such as block.  Naturally the tax preparer will be the most expensive option.  I'm not sure if any online tax prep sites do prior year returns but it shouldn't be hard to find out.

If you are truly using Amazon all the time, the 3% cash back with the Amazon card would probably be great for you, but I don't know the approval odds for that card.","780":"I never redeem for less than .025.  I'll take as many  .007 as I can get.  It's not that hard to redeem them, but yes it takes a little work.\n\n250,000 UR redeemed is worth $6250 for which you paid $1750.  It's not a small sum.  \n\nAnd of course not all the 5x goes to $200VGC.  Some is natural and some are easier GC like Amazon and Ebay.\n\nBut these are individual decisions one has to make.  Five grand after tax is a lot to me.  It's worth it.  But will I spend hours searching for reloadits for a few hundred dollars a year?  No.  ","781":"Get something with no monthly fee.  You have student loans so you should have some credit history.  Some good cards that are relatively easy to be approved for are the Discover IT, Chase Freedom, or the Capital One Quicksilver.  The Amazon credit card should be fine as well.  \n\nMore importantly than what credit card you get is how to use it.  ALWAYS, WITH NO EXCEPTIONS pay the entire statement balance every month.  If you do this you will never pay interest.\n\nYou should also not consider purchases placed on a credit card as \"borrowed\".  Regardless of when it's due you should consider that money spent as soon as you buy it.  Don't buy things if you don't have the money to pay for them today and you shouldn't have any problems.  ","782":"The anonymity of the Internet combined with the entitled 'customer is always right' culture that we've nurtured over the last several decades. It's really easy to not view the eBay or Amazon sellers as people when you're sending messages through a screen. Hell, back in college I had heard kids casually talking about ordering books on Amazon and then claiming they never arrived, in order to get stuff for free. When it's the 'little people' against 'The Man', to a lot of people, it doesn't come off as such an evil action. The \"person\" behind the eBay or Amazon seller account either never crosses their mind, or they think we're all rich scumbags, so it's okay.","783":"&gt;My problem is that I'm terrified of credit cards. I grew up in a household with two fiscally irresponsible parents, so credit cards have always been a bad, scary thing to me\n\nI have the exact same background. I didn't have any CCs until last year at 25. But I'm glad I finally did. The fact is that, if you're thinking this way, you probably won't have the same problems. Just don't let the abstract nature of credit cards encourage you to overspend. Pay it off with every statement.\n\n&gt;What should I look for when choosing a credit card? What should I be concerned about? What do you recommend for a first-time user like me? I heard something about Amazon credit cards which sounds appealing because I use Amazon prime for my entire life\n\nLook at the Sallie Mae MasterCard. 5% back on gas and groceries, 5% back on Amazon purchases, and 1% back on everything else. The Amazon portion is marketed as \"books\" for some reason (it's a card advertised toward students), but it actually works for EVERYTHING you buy through Amazon. Ironically, it's better than Amazon's own CC. I have it and it's a great card. The online interface is pretty good and it also gives you your FICO score.\n\nYou could also look into Chase Freedom as it has a nice signup bonus + rotating 5% categories. 1% on everything else. ","784":"It's not illegal to resell it, but Amazon has their own rules. Also, some customers might be disappointed to find that they didn't receive a 'real' version of the game. I think the best route is what other people are saying: market it as a collectible and try to get more than the 'regular' version would go for.","785":"I have a $50 Amazon GC code if you are interested.","786":"Oh damn, that is ROUGH. I get it.\n\nSome things that have helped me cut down on gas use:\n\n1. Planning errands in a 'loop' so that I hit the stores in a practical way. This means that I also need to have a list of what I need, where I'm getting it and I have to go one day. If I forget something.... unless it's vital, that's too bad, and I'll get in next week.\n\n2. I run as many errands as I can online -- keep a wishlist of small items that you need on Amazon, once it's eligible for free shipping, or you need something to boost you above the free shipping limit, you add one of those needed items. Stuff like batteries, coffee filters, toilet paper, megaboxes of tea, makeup, face stuff. Any of that works.\n\n3. If you own your home and you have a basement (NOT A GARAGE) consider getting a chest freezer. You can buy meat online, but you need to be prepared to buy a LOT of meat at once. You can also stash frozen fruit, bread or veggies so that you aren't running out of staples as much. OR, you can go ahead and do a mega shopping trip every 3-4 weeks and avoid everything but fresh-food runs.\n\n4. Use the smallest vehicle you can get away with for a given chore. So, I don't know what your small business is, but you could do something like this: plan to do quotes between 3 in the afternoon and 7 pm at night. Don't use the big truck, take the car. Plan to do your normal work that requires the big rig in the mornings. This way you aren't running around in a loaded rig, burning gas for someone that may or may not give you paying work.\n\n5. I don't know if you have a crew, but if you do, don't do the midday junk food run. every night, pack a  cooler with fruit, sammiches, sodas, a thermos of chilli, whatever. The midday fast food run isn't good for you and it blows gas for no good reason. If you are doing a big job for someone (perhaps insulating their whole house over the course of two days) ask if you can borrow the kitchen  to reheat leftovers or make something. (If you work for me, though, I will make the chilli, all you gotta do is eat it. Good luck. It's hot!)\n\n6. Know where you are going when you get in your vehicle. I'm trying right now to break my partner of the habit of having three stores in mind for an item and not calling ahead first to see if they have it in stock. Nope, you need to know that what you need is where you think it is, and then you get in the car. Coming out empty-handed means wasted gas.\n\nGood luck.","787":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

At 75%-85% off it would be almost impossible too lose money.  Some of the sets you might have too sit on until winter, but seriously buy as many as you can afford.   If I was in your city.   I would have done cleaned out all of them.   ","833":"Right now the only safe way to try to buy low and sell high is to do it with Amazon, since you can store the balance on your account where you know it's safe, and trade it away later. There are two problems with this.\n\n1 - This community really isn't meant to be the kind of place where that sort of thing should be systematically happening, because it's really designed to give everyone the chance to trade to get what they really want. It's a bit of a shame knowing that people are buying Amazon gift cards that would have been better used by someone else, only to sell them for a profit - and maybe the flipper is selling it to that someone else that could have used it originally for a profit, but then that's just artificially driving up rates. If that no longer constitutes a free market, people are free to call this subreddit as they like, but I'd rather it be called a safe market more than anything else, which brings up the second part...\n\n2 - Scammers capitalize on being able to trade Amazon balance. Here's what we see *all the time*: scammer successfully scams someone out of their Amazon on one of their scamming accounts. They redeem it on their Amazon account. They message us from a non-scamming, legitimate looking reddit account, asking for approval to trade their Amazon balance that they have racked up and have no use for. They say they got it on GCX (they're not lying), and since we can't always tell who is just flipping legitimately acquired Amazon, or who is trying to sell off Amazon that they stole, sometimes they slip through the cracks, and by the time we catch on, it's too late.\n\nAs long as scammers know they have a chance to get mod approval to trade balance on one of their reputable reddit accounts, they will keep trying to scam. By removing that option, they have way less incentive to scam in the first place.\n\nSo it's twofold: increase the overall safety of the subreddit, but also kind of bring the subreddit back to its main purpose: trade to get what you really want.","834":"I was in your boat a few months ago, absolutely zero credit history, and way way less income.

Interest will be charged to your account from the purchase date if the promotional balance is not paid in full within 12 months. Offer is subject to credit approval. Applies to order totals of $599 or more made between 12\/1\/14 and 3\/31\/15 on an Amazon.com Store Card account. Subscribe and Save orders are not eligible for special financing. Items sold on Amazon.com by third party sellers qualify for this offer. No interest will be assessed on the promotional purchase if you pay the following (the \"promotional balance\") in full within 12 months: (1) the promotional purchase amount, and (2) any optional debt cancellation charges related to the promotional purchase. If you do not, interest will be assessed on the promotional balance from the date of the purchase. Regular account terms apply to non-promotional purchases and, after this promotion ends, to your promotional purchases. For new accounts: Variable purchase APR is 25.99%. Minimum interest charge is $1.50. The APR is accurate as of July 1, 2014 and will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate (as defined in your credit card agreement).

I personally would try Discover before a retailer's card.","838":"Is there any way you can sell the car? Did you get one of those close-the-gap policies to cover depreciation when you bought it? I know this sounds extreme, but I have done it: You could buy a used car, something for $2500, with one of your credit cards and get rid of the new car. Buy a used Toyota because they are so reliable and that will save you a ton of money and you'll still have transportation. Here's the other things you can do to reduce those $800 in other bills: 1. Become a vegetarian, at least temporarily. If you stop buying meats and cheeses and learn to live on plant products it will save you lots in food bills and is actually quite healthy. 2. Shop at the thrift stores and $1 stores FIRST when you need stuff. If they don't have it then go to the other stores. 3. Apply for Food Stamps aka SNAP benefits. If you have $0 income you will certainly qualify. And if things are really bad, go to the Food Banks. That's been one of the lowest points in my life when I had to go to Food Banks, but I really needed the help. 4. Always buy used things when you can on Ebay, Craigslist or other sites. 5. Sell stuff you don't want or need anymore on those sites or similar. 6. Sell your books on Amazon and other book sites. 7. Stop buying prepared foods like ready-made salads and frozen entrees and learn to cook. Since you're unemployed you have time to cook now and it will save you a lot of money. And, of course, don't eat out. 8. Get a cheaper cell phone. Before there were so many prepaid plans I was \"married\" to AT&amp;T or Verizon for something like $149 a month several years ago. Contract. Ridiculous. I've been in prepaid for several years now and it's saved me a lot of money. Now many good companies are in \"prepaid wars\" and many plans accommodate Smart phones. You can get unlimited w\/1 GB of data for $45 or $50 a month now.

Amazon is a real threat but I dont think they will eat more into ebays share. Alibaba on the other hand has such huge order quantity requirements that they cater to a different type of customers. Every other website at the moment is serving to a really niche set of users.\n\nApart from all this, ebay is growing well, they had a tough year (password leak, Google SEO) but they were still able to get good return in Q4. I also see a lot of great site level product improvements.","884":"Citi AA was my thought too. It looks like United could be very useful for a world trip due to stopovers \/ openjaws, with AA filling in the gaps where necessary. I plan to keep building UR points, probably apply for CSP in a year or so, and your tip on the United card makes sense. Also later down the line the SPG could help with adding to my AA points.\n\nThe interesting thing with this plan is since it's 4+ years from now, a lot could change, so I'm going to have to keep my ear to the ground!\n\nAgree with the Amazon card, I'm just keeping it open for now since it is my second highest limit and second longest account. As I start to bump against the Chase limit I will close it. Capitol One was purely because I was buying a Sony phone anyway, so the $200 bonus was perfect. It also is a no fee card to get my foot in the door with Capitol One.","885":"To be perfectly honest, even if the supplements you are buying from alibaba are 100% legitimate very few people people will buy them as soon as they find out they are made in China.\n\nI once got a glimpse into the warehouse of a Chinese shipping company that was established in the USA....They basically let people in mainland China buy things on Amazon and would ship it back to them\/take care of customs.  Supplements were probably the thing they shipped most frequently. The warehouse was absolutely full of them.....So, even people in mainland China don't trust supplements from their own country.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and find a better product to
