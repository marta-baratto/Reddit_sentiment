I have been buying\/selling websites for 6 years now. I am a 24-year old full-time PhD student residing in the US and I have a business of buying\/selling sites.\n\nBy profession, I am an electrical engineering. Using my skillset, I learned how to develop websites in PHP, HTML, CSS, and more. I am most familiar with the WordPress platform.\n\nI want to finish my education and obtain an engineering career only because I love the work I do, not because I must do it to sustain a living.\n\nMy successes in the online arena:\n\n* Started my first website when I was 18 years old in 2008. This website financed my university degree! The website was acquired by a large player in the area in 2011.\n\n* In 2010, I started my own full-pledged business with over 5,000 recurring customers. This website was later acquired in 2012 by a company in Sydney, Australia.\n\n* Since then, I have been acquiring websites, growing them, and eventually selling them. Just to give you an example, I purchased a website in January 2014 for $400. The website generated $4500 over the course of 2014. I sold the websites for $8000 in January 2015.

This is my first time posting here so I'm not really sure if this is even the correct sub. \n\nI am looking to move out of my parents house for the first time very soon, but I've never lived on my own before so I'm not sure exactly of everything I need to account for. \n\nI am 25 y\/o with a full time job @ $24,000\/year + benefits in Dallas, Tx. Currently, financially, I'm sitting at about $700 in savings and $2,000 in checking. The reason I mention this is because my plan was to save up to a certain degree, so that when rent time comes around, I'll be down $X and then get paid putting me back up again - 1 step back 2 steps forward kind of thing, to prevent myself from relying directly and immediately on paycheck to paycheck. Hope that makes sense.\n\nI have no idea what internet\/utilities would be and that's my biggest problem. I wouldn't get cable and would pretty much rely on Netflix\/Amazon\/HBO Go for that. \n\nI'm currently looking at 1 room apts. for anywhere between $500-$700 and have found a couple I like (have not yet been there in person) and these places list having a washer\/dryer in unit, which was a big deal for me, since I didn't want to spend the money to rent\/buy my own. \n\nAnyway, I hope I'm making sense. Does any of this seem reasonable? Am I being too optimistic? Should I get a room-mate?\nBut the biggest question, really, is what is the smartest way to getting an apartment and living on my own?\n\nIf this belongs in another sub please let me know and I'll repost it accordingly.

There was a pretty big indication a couple weeks ago that the front page was \"full of eBay\/Amazon tech support\", and that \"this subreddit had gone downhill\", and that \"most of the front page posts could be answered with Google\". Those accusations rang pretty true, so I took it upon myself to make a daily Newbie thread and to delete newbie posts mercilessly.\n\nSome people have taken offense to this. I wanted to gauge the community's feelings on this, and alter my behavior if it's warranted. Right now I'm deleting all posts that:\n\n* Ask how to make money\n\n* Ask what the easiest way to make money is\n\n* Ask where to find all the good stuff\n\n* Ask where\/what items have the best profit\n\n* Ask what something is worth (unless it is a more advanced question)\n\n* Ask what something is (unless it looks like it could spur an actual discussion)\n\n* Show a haul without having any valid discussion points (just a brag post)\n\n* Mention Guitar Hero or Rock Band\n\n* Ask how shipping works (unless it is truly an odd or crazy oversized item)\n\n* Ask what to do about getting negative feedback on eBay or Amazon\n\n* Ask really basic questions about the terms and conditions of a selling platform (easily google-able)\n\n* Ask tech support or any other non-flipping related question about a selling platform\n\n* Ask what an acronym means (BOLO, FBA, WTF, etc)\n\n* Ask what selling platform is best for XYZ (unless it is something truly odd and worthy of discussion)\n\n\n\nI'm sure I'm missing some categories here, but that's the gist of it. I also delete (or at least review) any threads that have been reported. Very few people are reporting things... so please please please report stuff that you don't want to see. If enough people agree with you, rules may change and we may start deleting those things.\n\nDo any of these categories seem unreasonable? Are there any other types of posts that need to be deleted? Am I just being a huge jerk and should let newbie's post things wherever they want? Is there anything further (besides the obvious notifications I've added) that I can do to encourage newbies to post in the newbie thread?

I occasionally check my credit on creditkarma; it's showing about 750 on TransUnion and EquiFax.\n\nI'm thinking about getting a credit card with a better deal. I read \/r\/churning and decided I don't want to go all-out like that, but it looks like I could get a bit better deal using a different no-annual-fee card, so that's what I'm eyeing.\n\nI have a CapitalOne360 savings and checking account, and I like them, so I'm tempted by the [QuickSilver](http:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/credit-cards\/quicksilver) credit card. \n\n* 1.5% cash back\n* no annual fee\n* I would get the $100 promotional cash bonus (spend $500 on the card in the first 3 months)\n* \"cash back\" actually gets automatically deposited in my account\n* convenient and familiar bank\n\nAnother one that jumps out at me is [Sallie Mae MasterCard](https:\/\/www.salliemae.com\/credit-cards\/sallie-mae-card).\n\n* 5% cash back on groceries (up to $250 spent per month)\n* 5% cash back on gas (up to $250 spent per month)\n* 5% cash back on books (up to $750 spent per month, but apparently it just works for all Amazon purchases?)\n* 1% cash back otherwise\n* no annual fee\n* $25 promotional cash bonus\n* apply the \"cash back\" as a statement credit\n\nAlso the [Citi Double Cash](https:\/\/www.citi.com\/credit-cards\/credit-card-details\/detail.do?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card).\n\n* 2% cash back on everything (1% when spent and 1% with paid off, but I'll always pay it off immediately...)\n* no annual fee\n* apply the \"cash back\" only every $25, manually, as a statement credit\n\nAs far as my credit-card-able spending goes, something like $200\/mo on groceries and gas, and like $200-400\/mo on other things (don't worry, I do have a detailed budget). Some of that will be air travel, too, maybe 3-4 $300-$400 trips each year, so there may be some travel benefits I'm overlooking on other options! I also end up buying-and-being-reimbursed-for roughly $1000 each year for conferences and things (mostly airfare and hotel).\n\nWith my spending level, these aren't making a huge difference. Assume $200 groceries\/gas and $400 other (and not Amazon). Then 1% flat gives $6, 1.5% flat gives $9, 2% flat gives $12, and 5%\/1% gives $14. Over 3 years (my foreseeable future; my financial life will surely change when I graduate), that's roughly $216, $324, $432, $504, or with the bonuses, $216, $424, $432, $529. So this isn't actually too consequential, but I'm thinking I can make a change now and autopilot it and benefit myself a couple hundred bucks.\n\nWould this be a waste of time and a credit inquiry? Am I overlooking some other cons, or other options?\n\nTL;DR: I'm a grad student in good financial shape.

No foreign transaction fees\n - Sallie Mae Master Card: 5% on groceries and gas on up to $250 per month each. 5% on \"bookstores\", which include Amazon, up to $750 per month. 1% everything else\n\nThe thing is that I want to add a card that I can get good rewards in dining out and traveling. I would probably like one to have no fee in the long run, but would be open to carrying one with an AF long term. The ones I have heard about are Chase Sapphire Preferred, Barclays Arrival (AF and no AF), Capital Venture (AF and no AF). Part of me has considered getting one of the ones with a annual fee and then making sure to downgrade to the no fee version. The Chase Sapphire Preferred card looks amazing, in regards to looks and the point system. The problem I had is that the No Annual Fee version of it was apparently cancelled.\n\nWith that being said I just have a few questions. Which dining\/travel card that I listed or that others have listed would you suggest? Also, do all of the cards consider things like Uber\/Lyft or taxis travel? I just want to know because even though I don't fly often, I do use taxis on the weekend when going out.

I can opt for up to 9x salary coverage for &lt;$10\/paycheck.  So I need advice on whether or not I should cancel this policy.  My biggest beef is they have me as a smokers' policy which reduced my coverage from $500,000 to $325,000, and then I further reduced it to $155,000 to decrease my premiums.

I currently don't offer any sort of packing services, but want to, as I've probably packed\/shipped about 5,000 - 6,000 packages in the past year. \n* 2. My area has no FedEx\/UPS dropoff that is indoor.\n* 3. No business offers reasonably priced shipping products in the county.

You can also do surveys or watch videos. Both IOS and Android friendly, they offer Amazon, ITunes, Google Play GCs and PayPal (on Android only). Having used FeaturePoints, I really like this app because there seems to be more app offers whereas FeaturePoints only offers one or two apps daily. Gift Wallet also sends notifications when an app has credited, which is one aspect that I think makes this mobile app stands out from others. One con though is when you download a bunch of apps at the same time, sometimes it's hard to keep track which app is credited because it doesn't tell you the name of the app, only the pt value.\n\nAs you gain more points, you essentially get a discount on other rewards. For example, a $3 Amazon GC is 1500 pts, a $5 Amazon GC is 2500 pts, and a $25 Amazon GC is 9000 pts, so the $25 is the better deal.\n\nStarted yesterday, I've gotten 5000 pts so far, with other apps still waiting to be credited. The customer service is pretty nice as well; if an app doesn't credit, you can submit a report and usually they'll credit.\n\nIf you'll like my referral code (which will give you 20 pts) it's **bea039a**. You put the code in when you download the app and it asks for a referral code.\n\nI hope it helps, happy earning :)\n\n[nonref](http:\/\/wallet.gift)","119":"[H] Amazon.com 25$ gift card [W]Steam 20$ Wallet Code Thingy","120":"Looking to buy about $100 worth Amazon GCs for a purchase with BTC at 80% of GC value. \n\nPrevious Trade Reps: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2o6iwh\/uxalias_gcx_rep_profile\n\nEdit: Still Looking.

I have a small hairstyle blog for both men and women which has a decent number of visitors and email subscribers. \n\nInformation about different hairstyles is available for free on the website and I was planning to write an e-book talking about hair care in detail since it is not talked much on the website and charging a small sum for it. (Hairstyling and hair care are two different things)\n\nBut now that I'm preparing the content for the book, I feel I would be doing an injustice to my audience because firstly, I'm not an expert about hair care. I'm just gathering advice from different forums and putting them together. And also because hair care varies to a great deal from person to person. So I wouldnt want my advice to damage someone's hair. Plus I don't really feel like writing an entire book because I feel burnt out from too much writing.\n\nAnd due to such reasons I'm contemplating if there are better alternatives in the hair niche which I can use to monetize my blog besides writing an e-book.\n\nSome of the alternatives I have considered are:\n\n1. Amazon affiliates: The problem with amazon affliates is the really low commission rate and waiting for two months before payment is issued. Hair care products are really low priced so there is not much I can make. Sure there is a 24 hour cookie on the site but I doubt that will make a big difference.\n(The reason I wanted to write an ebook in the first place was due to the high margin. While amazon gives me a 5-10% commission, I get about 90% commission on an e-book)\n\n2. Dropshipping: The second idea that comes to my mind is dropshipping products through alibaba and advertising them on my website. I am not sure if I am ready for this yet because I am not really experienced with simple online business yet, let alone something big a dropshipping. But I am willing to consider this if its possible.\n\n3. Ads\/sponsors: Adsense is not lucrative enough and I don't get enough views to get sponsorship yet. \n\n\nBesides these, I cannot really think of any other alternatives really. So I come here to ask you guys to help me out a bit. \n\nCan you guys think of any other possible ways I can possibly monetize my hairstyle blog which is high margin? or some topic besides hair care that I can write about that a person searching for hairstyles can benefit by?\n\nThank you.","123":"[My GCX Profile](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GCXRep\/comments\/2yrdj0\/uentroduction_gcx_rep_profile\/)\n\nPrevious Threads:\n\n[1](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/giftcardexchange\/comments\/2ypumi\/h50_off_under_armour_code_w25_paypal\/)\n\nI have a 50% off Under Armour code for www.underarmour.com\n\nCode is a one time use, works for up to a $500 order.\n\nChildren's products not allowed.\n\nLooking for $25 Paypal or $30 Amazon GC.","124":"[H] Amazon Balance [W] BTC","125":"Here is a quick money App no one has mentioned. It is called Freemyapps. This is something I used to do a lot in the past. All you do is download apps (let it run 30 secs or more), earn points, and claim gift cards. I probably earned up to $50 from now and you can do it on multiple devices. I don't commit too much, but if I have time to kill I download apps while maybe queuing in a game or something. Reason I stopped was because I did not see as many offers put up, so I usually check in once a month and massively download the apps to get $5. Give it a try, like right now there is good amount of points and you can even cash out at small amounts like $1-2 Amazon. I would also appreciate it if you use my referral link https:\/\/m.freemyapps.com\/share\/email\/cd2c8b78 Make sure to use it through your mobile device please.\n\nNOTE 1: Something everyone should remember is the points do expire in 60 days IF you are inactive. So let's say it is day 55 then you download an app (and earned the points), then the time resets again.\n\nNOTE 2: It is rare for some apps to not reward you, but can it can happen. If it does, take a screen shot of the offer and the app downloaded in your mobile device and email FreemyApps, then they'll reward you.

If you are outside the US\/Canada or other highly rich in apps countries consider using [this](http:\/\/wiki.hidemyass.com\/IPad_IPhone_ITouch)\n\nWith this you will be able to change the IP location on your phone to trick the app\/site into thinking you're from a different country (i.e United States) so you are offered all of the high paying apps!\n\n- All sites have a referral program in one way or another - if you have multiple devices simply refer yourself to your second device so you can earn the referral credit for everything downloaded from the second device (or third, fourth...) DO NOT PAY OUT TO SAME PAYPAL ACCOUNT ON DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS!\n\n- On some sites (such as FusionCash) there is no limit to how many times you can download an app and receive credit. In this case you can simply remove the app from a device, create a new iOS or Android account and download again for credit. (And rinse and repeat infinite amount of times!)\n\n- If you do not have access to multiple devices, consider using emulators. A simple to use iOS one can be found [here](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/IDEs\/Conceptual\/iOS_Simulator_Guide\/GettingStartedwithiOSStimulator\/GettingStartedwithiOSStimulator.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40012848-CH5-SW1) (MAC)\n\n**NOTE** BLUESTACKS DOES NOT WORK!\n\nBy combining emulators with a site like FusionCash with unlimited downloads or FeaturePoints\/Appsdown with infinite accounts your rewards are virtually endless. The amount that you make is entirely up to how much time you want to invest into doing it.\n\nAs an example when I started out I had 4 devices and in a single day using 4 Apple accounts (they were all iOS devices) and the three sites listed below I earned $82.00. The only downside is that I had to cash some of it out as Amazon cards or other to avoid suspicion.\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n**HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET CREDIT!**\nA lot of times I noticed I was not getting credit because I did not realize what was being done to actual credit me so here are some tips:\n\n- You must download and OPEN the app on ALL sites in order to get credit\n- Some sites require the users to keep the app open for ~30 seconds or finish the tutorials so read the requirements of each app!\n- Do not switch networks! Be sure that if you DOWNLOAD the app through Wi-Fi you stay on that Wi-Fi to open\/play the app.\n- Do not delete the app until you are credited! Some apps can take up to a day to credit as the confirmation needs to come from the game developer. Do not remove the app from your phone until you receive credit or else you run the risk of not getting credit for the game ever.\n- If downloading on multiple devices to gain double credit or use multiple sites: use a separate Apple or Android account (as well as gamecenter) so it can not link your two devices together.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n**AND NOW FOR THE ACTUAL SITES\/APPS :)**\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n1. **FusionCash** - **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/fca.sh\/1n9ix)** or [non-ref](http:\/\/www.fusioncash.net\/) \n\n\n**Details:**\n\n- $5.00 signup bonus for new users\n- Get paid $0.50 per download and there is no limit to how much you can earn\n- There are approximately 10-20 apps each day and new ones are offered each day for you \n- Available for both iPhone and Android\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Only open to US and Canadian residents\n- Must be over 18 or have parental permission\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Payment is only made via Verified Paypal\n- Minimum of $25.00 per payout request ($15.00 of which is earned and not bonuses from referrals and such)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n2. **Appsdown**- **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/apd.me\/YrTfg) unique code is YrTfg during signup** or [non-ref](https:\/\/appdown.me\/) \n\n**Details:**\n\n- Available on both iPhone and Android\n- Approximately 30 apps to download when you first register\n- New\/different apps each day so be sure to check back every day for new apps\n- Pays from $0.05 - $1.00 per app downloaded\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Must be over 13 years old\n- Open worldwide!\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Payments are made as little as $2.00\n- Huge variety of payout options: Paypal, eBay, Amazon, restaurants, electronics, microsoft points, paid app downloads...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n3. **Featurepoints** - **[REFERRAL :)](http:\/\/featu.re\/5YASEH) unique code is 5YASEH during signup** or [non-ref](http:\/\/featurepoints.com\/web\/) \n\n**Details:**\n\n- 50 point bonus when signing up with a referral code (mine is 5YASEH) :D\n- Available on both iPhone and Android\n- Downloads and nice and simple app on your phone which shows all the available apps, rewards, info...\n- New\/different apps each day so be sure to check back every day for new apps\n- Pays from $0.05 - $1.50 per app downloaded\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n- Must be over 13 years old\n- Open worldwide!\n\n**Payment:**\n\n- Tons of different reward options starting at only 200 points (one download) which is a paid app download!\n- Never have to pay for apps again\n- Also offers Paypal, Xbox, PSN, Amazon, restaurant cards, electronics, Steam and so on\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nI hope this information has helped out - please feel free to ask me any questions you might have!","138":"[H]75$ iTunes (25x3) [W] Amazon\/Paypal","139":"[H] Paypal [W] Amazon Gift Cards @ 90%","140":"One $40 Amazon GC looking to trade for Paypal.

If you don't own a website or don't want to buy one then Twitter is a pretty decent alternative. I've only been doing this for just over a week and I've already earned [\u00a33.20](http:\/\/gyazo.com\/1fdc990b8ee6b0c1ad891a68d9e0b4b1). [My Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/dealwithitgames) if you're interested.\n\n**So this is how I do it:**\n\nYou will need to start by doing the obvious - gaining a large-ish following to promote the products to. My primary method for doing this is by using a website called [Tweepi](http:\/\/tweepi.com\/). This website has a feature that allows you to follow another account's followers. So as I promote gaming related products (not a very good niche I know, but it's the one I'm most familiar with) I will go ahead and follow let's say... A bunch of people who follow IGN as they are most likely to be interested in the products I'm promoting. Now if you're are familiar with Twitter you will know that most people on Twitter tend to follow each other back quite frequently so you can rely on this method for gaining a following. If you're observant you will notice that there is a '[Last Tweet](http:\/\/gyazo.com\/b2e7feb269e13205bbf33cbbd5bb65c9)' button on 'Follow user's page' which you can click on to place the users who have recently tweeted at the top of the list, this means that these users are active and are more likely to follow you back.\n\nOnce you have gained are large enough following you can start posting affiliate links related to your chosen niche. A site I typically use is [G2A.com](https:\/\/www.g2a.com\/gr\/royalcinemasubmissions@gmail.com)\/[Non-ref](https:\/\/www.g2a.com) this site has a feature (which I'm sure other affiliate sites have as well) where if someone clicks on a your ref link but doesn't buy anything at that particular moment, it will remember their cookies so then if they decide to buy something in the future on that site and haven't deleted their cookies, you will still get a cut. You can also use sites like [Amazon](https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk\/) as they have a pretty good affiliate program that allows you to promote pretty much any product on their site.\n\nYou can also use a website called [unfollowers.com](https:\/\/www.unfollowers.com\/) which allows you to send automated messages to your new followers. So you can use this send people referral links.\n\n*An important couple of tips for setting up your account*\n\n* Keep it looking professional as this will make you seem more reliable and people will be more likely to click on your ref links. Also make sure you pick a name that's easy to remember, nothing like 'XxJohn2342xX'. \n\nI hope some of you find this method helpful. Please ask me any questions and I will try my best to answer them.\n\n:)\n\nEDIT: If you begin to get tired of all the spontaneous tweets put up by the large amount of people you're following then you can add specific accounts to a Twitter [List](https:\/\/support.twitter.com\/articles\/76460-using-twitter-lists#).","154":"Follow me as I go through the process of private labeling an item from China and selling it on Amazon - From start to finish","155":"So due to my wife's sales job and 10,000 receipts we use an accountant to do our taxes instead of turbotax.

The options should be worth $.73 and $.58, respectively. Now, let's assume the underlying has consistent IV increases approximately a week before earnings (think BBBY, NFLX, AMZN, INTC, etc). Let's also assume that the volatility for the underlying increases from 30 to 60 the day before earnings (8 days to expiry), which leaves the options' values at $1.72 for the call and $1.51 for the put. At this point I would sell to avoid the IV crush the following day and enjoy my profit of 147%.\n\nThe purpose of the strangle in this case would be to hedge in case of price movements in the underlying before the earnings announcement. For example, if the aforementioned underlying increased to $103 with the same conditions, the calls would be worth $2.84 while the puts would be worth $.86, which would increase my profit to 182%.\n\nAre there any factors, other than commissions, that I should consider? Will the theta eat into the options prices significantly? (this is something I tried to reduce by setting the expiry to at least a week after earnings) Should I buy closer to the money or go crazy and buy way OTM? (within liquidity's reason) I'm trying to find any flaws in the strategy that way I can modify accordingly. \n\n**EDIT**: I found faults in the strategy. It turns out the site I was using for IV data has extremely inflated data which really messed up my research (looking at data on two different trading platforms corroborated that IV is indeed much lower at most times). Good thing is most, but not all, stocks experience a deflation in IV shortly after earnings, so I'll just take up some short-term credit spreads or iron condors and let the options I sell expire worthless. In the case of the latter, I don't have to wait for a week or more at a time to test out strategies.\n\n","169":"How can I get $1.00 Amazon quick?","170":"**Rewards:** Amazon gift cards, PayPal, and e-vouchers.\n\n**Member Opportunities:** Online surveys, daily surveys, daily poll, etc.\n\n**Withdrawal Info:**  1000 points ($10) minimum balance necessary to request payment.\n\n**Referral Program:** 15% from each referral's future earnings, plus .50 cent bonus when they complete their first survey.\n\nI haven't seen MintVine pop up in a while, and it's been a pretty successful part of my daily routine.

I'm disputing a charge by a ticket agency for a non-refundable ticket. On Tuesday, I bought a ticket off of airtickets.com. On Wednesday (within 24 hours of my booking), I called airtickets.com to cancel my ticket and get a refund, but they said that the ticket is non-refundable and cannot be refunded if the day has changed since initial booking, *according to fare terms of US Airways*. They state that each supplier has its *own terms and conditions* that govern its products and services. I thoroughly read through the fare terms and airtickets.com terms &amp; conditions online and there is no rule or policy that states that airtickets.com \u201ccannot proceed to void and full refund a ticket, after the change of calendar day of initial booking\u201d.

Throw away because I am pretty sure my ex knows my reddit username. \n\nI have been letting myself fall deeper into debt and recently decided enough was enough. The last few years have been extremely difficult for me and I made a lot of VERY poor financial (and personal) choices that put me in a really bad position. Hopefully it will all make sense. \n\nI am 26. I live at home (no rent), and have an almost 2 year old daughter. Her biological father is not in her life, though we do speak occasionally. He does not pay child support, I will NOT be seeking child support (so pleeeeease do not bring it up, it won't be happening, or considered, he doesn't even have a job). I have a boyfriend, he is who my daughter sees as Daddy, and my ex will likely agree to a step parent adoption down the road which is why child support is not pursued. \n\nI recently graduated with my Bachelors degree in Psychology, and have just under $24,000 in student loans, through some company called Great Lakes. They just sent a bill saying it's time to start paying and want $285\/month.\n\nI have a job however it is a contract job. It ends in June at the latest but could potentially end at any time. I make $581\/week after taxes.  I am currently job hunting. I want a job where I will be happy but those jobs just don't seem to pay enough. I make 18\/hour and even though I claim 1 on my taxes, SO much gets taken out.\n\nI bought a car in Oct 2012 and the 5 year payment plan has me paying 185\/month. I always pay 200\/month to make it even. \n\nI have a cell phone bill with an iPad on the plan and it costs 160\/month. I can't lower it at this time as I am paying off the full purchase price of my exs phone and am under contract with my phone and my iPad until October of this year. I like the company (VZW), used to work for them, and get a pretty good discount (22%\/month and $20 unlimited data, I am not able to change companies at this time. \n\nI got back $5,600 in taxes and I put nearly all of it towards my Bank of America credit card. I have two cards through Boa, one has an 11k limit and the other a 2k limit. I have a 0 balance on the 2k limit one, and currently 4900.00 balance on the 11k one. It was over 10k prior to my putting my taxes towards it. My minimum payment is 132.00 now (it used to be 300.00 a month or two ago, so I am very pleased).\n\nI have a Paypal credit card and an Amazon credit card. I owe about 2300.00 to PayPal and 500.00 to Amazon. \n\nI have 1k in savings in case my contract at work abruptly ends. \n\nI owe 50.00\/month to pay my dentist for a prior bill. \n\nMy living situation is changing and I am really hoping to be able to move out in a few months (obviously after I get a new PERMANENT job). I just don't know how people manage... My debt adds up to almost 1k\/month.  How do people get by and afford to live when they are in debt?\n\nMy boyfriend works freelance as a programmer. So money for him isn't a guarantee until he gets a full time job. It is a really competitive market here for what he does. He also lives with family. I want to be able to afford to live on my own, by myself. If he is able to help that would be considered a bonus. Once he has a full time job, things will be a lot easier.\n\nI feel like I do not know what my options are. I don't know what to do with my paychecks so I just pay what I can towards my BOA credit card (since it is the highest), and the minimum for the others. \n\nI bought my car used in 2012, it's a newer car- 2011 Toyota Yaris. The only problem with it is the passenger doors on the right side have some cosmetic damage where my ex kicked the door. It caused the metal to crack (there's like a line where it's cut basically) and the paint around there bubbled up a bit. The door itself is fine it is just the metal but I know it will be costly to fix. I don't like the car and would be happy to trade it in but I am worried I would be screwed. Not sure if it's better to 1.) keep the car, 2.) trade it in as is for something with no payments, or 3.) fix the doors, sell it, then buy a car for less (or trade it in).\n\nI have food stamps and WIC. I just feel lost. I mean I make 2300\/month but about 1k goes to bills\/gas. 1.3k I have been using for every day things and paying extra on my credit card bills. \n\nI don't know if I can put off the student loans because I can't afford them. I went to the website and logged in and put my income in and it seemed like it said I would have a 0.00 balance, but it\ndidn't say there was a drawback. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I feel really overwhelmed and with my living situation changing (my daughter, my cat, and I will all be in 1 very small room... including the cats litter box. He can't leave the room) I want to be in a position to move out as soon as possible. \n\nEven if I made 2k\/month, I wouldn't find an apartment for\nless than 1k after utilities etc unless I lived in an unsafe area or 30-45 min away from my job and childcare. \n\nI just feel like it is hopeless and I truly do not understand how anyone does it. How does anyone make it? I don't want to live paycheck to paycheck anymore. \n\nAny advice?  Please be nice :\/ I am really in a low spot. Some days I don't have the energy for anything, even my daughter, because I am so worried about my finances. I avoid my bank account at all costs. I feel like I am failing as a parent even though my child wants for nothing and is happy and well adjusted. I should be grateful for that. But I need my own place with her. My living situation adds to my stress and I feel incapable of even doing laundry at the end of my work day because I am so mentally exhausted and stressed.  I need to set a good example for her so she is smart with her money when she gets older. \n\nTo Recap:\n\n160\/month cell phone\n\n50\/month dentist\n\n200\/month car payment (5.5 or something left on loan, was originally 13k)\n\n50\/month Amazon cc bill\n\n130\/month Boa cc bill\n\n70\/month PayPal cc bill\n\n280\/month student loan bill \n\n\n4900 debt left on BOA credit card (I have not used it since January 2nd)\n\n2300\/PayPal (no longer use this much, maybe 10 bucks here or there)\n\n500\/Amazon\n\n23,000\/student loans  \n\n\n1k\/savings\n\n581\/week after taxes\n\nIs there any hope?\n\n","208":"H: $100 Digital Itunes Code W: $90 Amazon Gift Card !!!!!!!!","209":"As usual my apologies for the re\/x\/post.\n\nWhat's the best strategy to make some beermoney and convert it into silver coins?

I have been lurking for months, and learning a lot, thanks to everyone who put and organize so much useful information. \n\nAfter reading a thread about the new Amazon Store Card yesterday I decided to apply for a Sallie Mae Rewards Mastercard, as it would give me the 5% cashback in Amazon but also 5% in groceries (which I would use all the time) and 5% in gas (which I would use occasionally, as I don't own a car, only rent one from time to time). These are the details for the card:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/credit-cards\/cash-back\/sallie-mae-mastercard-from-barclaycard-review\/\n\nMy question is simple: can anyone confirm that Instacart is considered a grocery store for this card?

Many times this is just a simple mistake on a sellers part. The amazon ASIN is:*\n\n*If this was not an error, this is one of our brand name Toner Refill Kits, Toner Cartridges, or Ink Cartridge ads, so your listing needs to be removed. You are misrepresenting our company and our XXXXX  products on Amazon. All our listings have a specific UPC and offer service or support by US,  Wholesale. Wholesale is the only authorized reseller of XXXXXX brand products.*\n\n*Your Activity violates a variety of laws, including but not limited to, trademark and copyright laws.  Also, your actions are in violation of Amazon\u2019s policies and procedures governing the Marketplace. We understand Amazon is a free market place and have no issue with you creating your own ad and using your own sku, UPC, or images etc, but not the intellectual property of Wholesale*\n\n*We can give 1 business day to remove your item before reporting you to our Amazon Rep, and\/or Amazon Copyright team for copyright violation of our ad. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter so further legal action is not needed.*\n\n*G. N.*\n\n\nAmazon policy CLEARLY states that listings are owned by Amazon Catalog so I believe I am being lied to here.\nI am also protected by first sale doctrine. why would I Not be allowed to resell on a listing if the product details match exactly? I did so. It's a single, extra toner I ended up not using.\nThird, they are telling me I am violating trademark and copyright law, and there is no such law that I violated. I'm not creating fake items or stealing their stuff. Im reselling a spare toner cartridge. That's it.\n'That letter is what was sent to my mailbox.\nFurther, if their products weren't allowed to be sold or resold by third party people then wouldn't Amazon tell me and not even let me list it?\nThen they tell me to make a NEW listing for an identical item in the amazon catalog which is a violation too.\n\n\nAdrian:Yes, you are absolutely right. There is no action you need to take on your end. If this person is in deed the copyright owner of these products, then they need to contact our Legal Department and prove with certified documentation that they are the copyright owners. At that point Amazon will let you know if you cannot list against a specific ASIN.\n\n\nMe:Okay. Thanks a lot. Can I report them for harassment and trying to get me to violate amazon policy? If I wasn't an informed seller on Amazon, they would have risked my account and I could have been suspended or banned for following their directions disguised as a legal letter.\n\n\nAdrian:Yes of course, what you can do is report a violation using the Contact Seller Support link.\n\n\nMe:It's a good thing I spent a lot of time reading all of the rules on Amazon!\n\n\nAdrian:That's right, when you are familiar with our policies then you will know how things are handled here at Amazon and that way you are protected against these kind of things.\n\n\nMe:Thanks a lot Adrian, I appreciate your verification. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding the rules correctly.\n\n\n\n**The end response email**\n\nThe last paragraph is unprofessional and not needed, but I am not always the bigger person and wanted to be a little snarkyi. \n\nYou do not own any ads, you do not control any ads, and you do not own or control the listing you created.   As per Amazons policy that YOU and YOUR COMPANY agreed to follow, all such listings are the property of Amazon.  That's a neat concept though.  I would encourage you to thoroughly read Amazons policy regarding your misinformation located here where it clearly states that all pages become the property of the Amazon Catalog.  \nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=200202130\n\nI understand how frustrating it might be to put time and effort into creating a new listing.  Please know that sellers like me truly appreciate that effort when we list against you when we have extra that we don't need to use anymore.  It makes it a lot more convenient to list our items when we don't have to take the extra step of creating a new listing, since creating an identical listing for an identical ltem is also against Amazon policy.  \n\nSecond, I want to talk about how you said you \"understand\" that Amazon is a free market and have no issue with me creating my OWN ad, for the same exact item.  What you do not seem to \"understand\" is that I am simply NOT allowed to create an identical listing for an item that is already in Amazon's catalog.  You would be encouraged to read the rules regarding that located here.  \nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=200414320\n\nLastly, it is a violation of Amazon policy to send threatening letters to people and to flat out TELL me to violate Amazon policy by telling me to make a new listing which would be duplicating your listing.  This would be covered here, under the harassment policy under the inappropriate communications policy.\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html\/ref=hp_left_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200414320  (you'll note it's the same as above)\n\nYou actually have violated Amazon policy today, and I confirmed with them five minutes ago that I was clearly understanding things properly. As such,  I have taken the additional step of reporting you to amazon for a violation of the communication policy by lying to me and threatening me.  Ive also let them know you tried to get me to take a course of action that would have gotten my account banned or suspended by telling me to break Amazons rules.   \n\nIt's a good thing I have taken the time to thoroughly review Amazons rules or I might have gotten in trouble.   I would highly recommend you do the same to prevent any further issues.  \n\nI would also like to thank you for the time you spent creating that well crafted listing on Amazons Marketplace.  It made listing the item much faster since it was already there and I did not have to spend any of that time creating a loving, detail filled, ad listing.  You truly have a way with words.  \n\n\n\n","220":"$100 AMAZON e-gift card, $10 GOOGLE play store , 60 minutes International SKYPE card available FOR SALE @503-662-8414","221":"[H] $150 Orbitz Bucks (Good for Most Hotels) [W] Offers of Amazon, Paypal, BTC over $100","222":"[H] $9 PayPal [W] $9 Amazon","223":"[H] $20 Amazon [W] NOTHING (again)","224":"**UPDATE: THIS IS NOW CLOSED!**\n\nHey guys!

Im new to Reddit.\n\nI graduated highschool May 2014 , and I took about a year off. I've been pretty lost on my goals, but Im figuring out what I want to do.\n\nIn highschool I took a personal finance class. Essentially, it was Dave Ramsey's seminars but for students, and it was free. I learned a ton and I was really motivated. I took this class, because I never wanted to be like my parents. Years ago they took on tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt. They arent serious about paying it off, and its been 10 years. They are finally getting around to it. They are really bad with money, even after Reading Dave Ramseys book.\n\nI vow to never be like them financially and some other things, haha. That is the reason I took that course. Now, at graduation I got 1k from my grandparents and out into my bank as an emergency fund. One of the Baby steps Dave outlines.\n\nFor me... I had a part time job, but the income was really bad. I have 1200 in savings, and I plan on joining the military in the next few months. I have no debt ( which I never ever want to besides a mortgage maybe), or credit ( unfortunately). So, I have no financial issues really. I still live with my parents and I am grateful they pay for my food and housing still. Thats all I need to survive and figure things out.\n\nThe problem for me is that Dave is only one guy. He is very smart, and I learned alot, but he never really go into the specifics besides broad overviews of investing. I dont know if I should be listening to only one person. \n\nJoining the military, I would like to save as much as possible. I could eat at the DFAC or whatever they call it. The meals are free for me there essentially. Now, I know pay is not the best, but its actually pretty freaking good compared to a kid in college or fresh out if his degree is not the best. The pay I get would be only used for internet or phone bills. The rest would be saved mostly with some play money. Is there anyone in the military who is financially successful? Being a super rich guy really isn't my thing. One who is debt free, ind pendant, and has a comfortable life financially is more important to me right now. \n\nI think the overall question is this... Where do I start with the FAQs? I plan on reading the whole recommended reading list along with these few books. \n\n1) A Beginners guide to Investing by Alex H Frey\n\n2) The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham\n\nBoth of those are highly rated on Amazon with most of the reading list on here as well. Can anyone vouch for these books?\n\nI am wanting to learn on my own. Apparently alot of millionaires are first generational ones, and that surprises me. That would be a goal of mine, not to be rich, but to have a good stable life I can live comfortably on. \n\nThanks for your time.\n\nEDIT: I would like to add, that my hobbies are European Sports cars such as Porsche and BMW, firearms, pc technology, and reading. Guns and Cars are really expensive , but Having a purposeful life and a financially well off life is what is important to me. Plus, being in the military is really busy. So some of these hobbies will not have any time and will be gone once I'm in really.","240":"I have an Amazon gift card for \u00a310, though I'd already redeemed it before discovering that they won't ship outside the UK (I'm in the US.) Not exactly sure how we can do this since Amazon doesn't allow GC transfers once redeemed but I figure it's better to try than let it go to waste. Any offers welcome!","241":"As many of you know, I am a bit aggressive when it comes to Amazon and Ebay.  I am a rules lawyer, I fight every case unless I have even an ounce of fault, and I am not at all against reporting violators to secure and improve my selling position in areas I am selling.  \n\nThis is not going to be popular with everyone, but I want to remind everyone to please not use a downvote on anyone who is contributing to the conversation, no matter how popular or unpopular you think it is.  I don't want people to be afraid to voice their opinion because they are going to get beat up over it.  A downvote is for someone who is simply not contributing to the conversation for whatever reason.  Something often forgotten here.  \n\nI hereby dub this, Amazon PvP\n\nThat said, I wanted to come back to this.  This was a very controversial topic before, and the comments and even split on up and downvotes showed there was a pretty big split in the subreddit.\n\nSo last time I talked about eliminating competition.  There are really two ways to do this.  Buy them out, or rules them out.  Buying them is obviously easier, but is no real benefit unless they mispriced or it allows you to corner the market.\n\nIn the last 4 days I have reported 13 different accounts on ONE listing for violating the rules.   The item is a console game that comes with an addition. Think tony hawk pro skater + skateboard or sing star + microphones as my example.\n\nEvery single one of the people I reported were selling either the game, or the skateboard, but not both.  I want to make this perfectly clear to everyone in this subreddit who is looking at going into Amazon that THIS IS NOT FUCKING EBAY.\n\nYou cannot list items that do not match product descriptions EXACTLY.  There are people who prey on sellers, it reduces trust in Amazon, and you're eventually gonna have a bad day.\n\nThat said, I wanted to report on the results of what I have found by doing this enthusiastically.  Over the last two weeks I have seem two buyers listings be taken down, and reposted.  One of which was still in violation.  \n\nIve seen several disappear and not come back.  I have no clue what happened to them or if the sellers are banned.  \n\nI have eliminated the low hanging fruit and the cost of the item I am selling has increased by 25% and I am the lowest cost for my shipping speed and condition.  Those of you who criticized me last time for caring about something that \"didnt' affect me\" apparently weren't following my strategy.  I have 43 items in this category, and I am now making 9 more profit per item by spending the minute per person to report violators.  43 * 9 = at least 387 more profit if I dont increase the price more.  \n\n\nIm just saying, business is business.   I used to send nice letters to people who had mistakes.  Now I dont unless their account says \"new\".  No one gets removed for fucking up once for nearly any possible violation.  There are a few, but overall.  Anyone who says otherwise is a liar or ignorant of how things work.  Either way, they are wrong.   We are all given an opportunity to fix, and not make the same mistake again.  This is also why I don't feel sympathy for anyone I report.  \n\nIt reduces trust in Amazon when people get bad experiences, and getting an item with missing parts is a bad experience.  Sellers providing experiences like this, have got to go.  It helps keep the price higher because shitty sellers no longer have their lower priced damaged goods on the listing so no one has to compete with that.  Further, I'll be damned if I am going to follow the rules and lose money to some fucking twat who can't be bothered to take the time to read things.  Again, new sellers I do not do this to and send them a letter telling them I am not amazon, what violation they made, and then link the pertinent Amazon policy.  Ive only gotten nice replies from new sellers about this.\n\nLastly, I discussed buying known violators items and reporting them.  This was pretty much unanimously classified as terrible by everyone who responded.  This is going to be controversial as hell.\n\nI bought 3 items from people who likely made mistakes.  One guy had a 60$ item set for 6 dollars, however it is a game + accessory item so likely it's just the game.  The other I think is the same thing, but it was priced at 19 including shipping, the last I think he's trying to sell the game only at about half the price of the bundle.\n\nWhen those items arrive, if I did not get my game + item I will be sending a letter linking my order where it says I ordered a game + accessory, and let them know I only received half of it and would appreciate getting the rest of the order.  If I get my complete order that I listed, then I will leave appropriate feedback.  If they send me the other half of my order and fix their mistake, I will only give A 4 star though because they fucked up my order (but did fix it).  If anyone gives me a hard time though, I will A to Z them on the spot, keep what I did get if told to, and get a full refund.  \n\nThis also means I will either get up to 3x full sets of a 65 sale for 45, or I will keep half of a set for no cost.  It's a win either way.  The sellers I bought from will also have been given the opportunity to fix a mistake with NO DOWNSIDES except to their pocketbook (which sucks, but is a valuable lesson) and the asshole sellers will have a lovely A to Z claim.  :P\n\n\nThis also will have removed 3 competitors from my listing I am trying to corner, and give me their inventory which helps solidify my position more as I secure a higher percentage of available for sale items.  When I first started selling this product it had about 15 pages, it is now over a third lower.  Will it go lower?  I honestly have no idea.  Is it because Im removing people?  Honestly, no effing clue.  I'll be testing it on other items and I'll be observing how things change in the listing to see if what I am doing has any big impact.  I do know, that I am making several dollars more profit per item as that's already been confirmed.  \n\nAnyway, thoughts, feelings, would you do this, would you not?  What do you guys do in terms of controlling your market?  Do you have a proverbial line in the sand you won't cross?  I am of the opinion I will not be unethical, illegal, but I will definitely consider anything else and weigh risk, reward, profit, and time to do.  \n\nI did not list immoral because that changes person to person.   Unethical and illegal are pretty well defined.

We're a family of four, so that's pretty daunting, but here's my situation:\n\n- I live downtown, and work is only a mile away so I walk or bike most days and there is plenty of food\/entertainment in walking distance\n- The kids are homeschooled so we aren't transporting them back and forth\n- About the only place we do drive is Judo twice a week, but that's only about a mile away as well\n- We have just about everything delivered already (groceries, Amazon Prime and the occasional dinner)\n- I already use Uber fairly often when I'm late for work or just already away from home\n\nIn fact, we drive so little that the car battery died (a week ago!) and hasn't been an emergency. The difficult part is that it's a lease and I would have to find someone to take it over. I can afford the payments, but I don't like the idea of wasting the money.\n\n\nThe lease + insurance is almost $600\/month. Even if I took an Uber twice a week to Judo and back, plus a couple of other trips AND rented a Zipcar for 4 hours every weekend for errands (which is already more driving than I do now), it would run about $250\/month at the absolute most. There are several Zipcar locations within a few blocks, and Ubers usually take about 5 mintues to arrive, so it wouldn't be that much trouble.\n\n\nIs getting rid of the car a stupid idea? Is transferring a lease harder than it seems?

Looking forward to your case study.\n\nI have been doing affiliate websites for around four years, and everything I have read from you rings true. I remember following Pat and Spencer (and warriorforum and blackhatworld) when I first got into it, but now it seems like there is nothing to learn from what they post.

You can't do that unless you have used it and have first hand experience with it. Copying Amazon reviews onto your own site (or rewording them) will never work, and if you think it will you deserve to fail. Personally, I think there are better ways to do affiliate marketing than making review sites.\n\nIt is all about building a brand with good design and providing actual value to customers through the content you create, as Humblesalesman has stated over and over again. And that process is tedious, boring, and time-intensive.\n\nIt seems my strategy is a little different from yours, but it relies on the same principles: help the customer find the information they are looking for, and don't let your website simply be a shill for products.\n\nThose who think affiliate websites are all about promoting other people's products are wrong. The information you create IS your \"product\". If it is a shitty \"product\", no one will want it, no doubt. But if it is good, you will have many options for monetization and will have a lasting presence online.\n\nThanks for making these posts Humblesalesman!

It was the only card I could get at the time, as I had no credit whatsoever. I started with a pretty low credit line but since then, they've increased it every so often (with no additional deposit by me). Now it's at $750. A year after getting the secured card, I got a Discover It card. It also has a credit line of $750. I pay off my balances in full almost every month. There have only been about 3 months in the past 2 years that I've carried a balance. Right now, both are paid off.\n\nMy first question is in relation to the secured card. I know you aren't supposed to close your oldest account, but the secured card has an annual fee of about $30. That's obviously not a lot, but the card has no rewards and basically gives me no benefits other than the fact that it helped me build credit when I had none. I've heard that Capital One doesn't upgrade secured cards to unsecured, but has anyone ever heard of them removing the annual fee? I don't mind keeping the card and only putting some small recurring payment for Netflix or something on it, but I hate to pay an annual fee when it's only giving me 1 more year of credit history.\n\nSecondly, are there any other cards you can recommend I get? The Discover It card has 1% cashback on everything and 5% cashback rotating quarterly. It's alright, but I'm looking for something that would give me more cash back for things like groceries and gas. I also spend a lot on Amazon, but I'm not sure if the Amazon card is exactly what I'm looking for. I mostly just don't know what I can qualify for right now. I get a credit score with both of my cards, and right now its 739 from Discover, and 708 from Capital One.\n\nThanks for any advice! :)\n\n(edit: I should mention that I'm looking for something with cashback, not miles or other rewards. I work for an airline, so airfare is not an issue for me.) ;)","331":"So I just got my my first ever complaint  on Amazon. The buyer claims that there is highlighting and writing on the pages even though I said it was it in like new condition. She doesn't say anything about returning it but I told her to go ahead and initiate a return request and she could get a refund. I did this because I have read about how Amazon tends to screw you anyway and I would rather just have the book back (which I'm about 95% positive doesn't have anything inside it) rather than that deal with any more hassle. I suppose it's possible that I missed something, but I'm sure I checked the pages thoroughly because I always do for this very reason. I'm super paranoid about stuff like this so I really don't see how it's possible that I missed what sounds like, according to her, copious amounts of highlighting\/writing.

If not, there is no purpose to cash back.  I personally put all of my monthly expenses that I can on my cc, then pay it off.  If you have a good sense of your budget, you should know how much your expenses add up to each month (ex: $1000 on food, gas, entertainment, travel, haircuts, etc etc - not fixed expenses since these you cannot put onto a cc).  I do this b\/c when I approach my budgeted number, I know I cannot go out as much toward the end of the month - helps me keep on track in a looser way than a spreadsheet, which I used to use for years.  \n\nAnyways, look into what you have put on your credit card in teh last few months, and categorize it.  If most of your money spent was on gas, groceries etc, then picking one of those cards with the higher cash back like the Capital One you mentioned would work well - HOWEVER please look at the fine print, a lot of times they exclude stores like Wal-Mart and Target for groceries, which is where I shop so it becomes pointless.  I have a fuel efficient car too, so gas is so little for me, these cards have little value.  I prefer to get points on Amazon instead (3% there for purchases made as I do a lot of shopping on Amazon) using the Amazon Visa.  \n\nThere are excellent deals on the Chase Freedom card as well, like $200 back on the first $500 spent in 3 months, see slickdeals for this one or just google it.  This event comes up often.  \n\nThe next thought is ensuring you get a decent credit limit setup, if its only $1000, and you'll be charging $500 on it each month, that is bad news.  You don't want to be using up 50% or even 35% of your available credit each month.  It hurts your credit.  You can call and ask what amount you would be approved for w\/o having to have them pull your credit - obviously this is just an estimate, but they should be able to answer your questions.","348":"It actually does use indicators, and those indicators predict trends. \n\nMathematical models: I have only studied indicators.

He opened up after working at a different comic book store for 10+ years and got fed up with working for an asshole. His store gets a lot of foot traffic as it's located near a college campus in a large city. He doesn't do much advertising, but he's quite active on social media. He carries comics, graphic novels, some board games, some clothing, glassware, small trinkets, and MtG cards. Refuses to sell posters because they take up too much space, they're too easily damaged, and people constantly try to bargain the price. This brings up the question, do you want an open comic book store or do you want a cave? This is going to determine what kind of customers you get. There ARE people who will not go into stores that cater to everyone, they much prefer their caves. That's okay. Open stores are much more welcoming and less intimidating for first time customers. He hosts FNM every week and frequently has groups in there playing DnD (he obviously takes a fee from each person). When it comes to actually ordering comics it's tricky to gauge what the demand is going to be like. When Saga first came out, almost no comic book stores ordered more than a couple issues. Turned out to be one of the quickest selling series. Every comic you carry in the shop is yours. Your property. If you order too much of one issue, you're shit out of luck and you burned a hole in your pocket with it. No refunds unless they've been damaged in the shipping process. However, you can always opt to carry less and, if requested, order an issue and put it in someone's pull for the next week. Speaking of pull, there are going to be people that fuck you over. There will be the people that will come in every week for their new issues. You're going to be grateful that you have a solid cash flow that day. Then there will be the people who come in once a month or once every 6 weeks who pick up small chunks of their pull at a time. You're going to pray that they pick up all 50 issues they have at one time so that you are way in the positive for the day, but they probably won't. You can implement rules against this if you want, but some people are incredibly deterred from that sort of thing. Usually you'll give 10% off to the people who have pulls. You're going to have other things to figure out too. How knowledgeable are you about comics? Your customers are going to ask for recommendations and are going to want to talk about the latest issue that came out of their favorite comic. You don't have to know about every single thing, but it helps when you can carry a conversation with your customers. If someone wants to sell you their collection, how are you going to decide to buy or pass? Will you buy the whole collection or just certain issues? Will you know what issues are worth money? Do you know about the different grades of comics? Usually if you opt to buy the whole collection just for a few of the issues, you're going to throw the rest of the comics in a 50-cent bin. There's a lot of things that go into the comic book business that aren't typically considered. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm very familiar with a gaming shop located in a small town that just started selling comics. They have two parts to their store: where the merchandise is sold and a separate room filled with tables for things like DnD and FNM. They carry the more popular series like TWD and have a few bins of 50 cent\/$1 comics. They also have small things like action figures and character pieces (along with paint) for tabletop games. They make most of their money from hosting things like MtG tournaments because they're the only store of its kind for a few towns. It's pretty filled every Friday with around 30-45 people. However, they're much more expensive than stores like Amazon. Sometimes their board games will have a $10 markup. \n\nI could go on for days about this. Let me know if you have any questions.

It shouldn't be too hard to find a roommate - there are a lot of new Amazon folks.\n\nDrinks are expensive unless you find a great dive bar - $10-$15.  Beer is also expensive but a ton of great selection.  Groceries CAN BE expensive in downtown - your choices are Whole Foods, Ralph's, Yuwajamia or Target.  In fact, it takes a bit of driving to the outer edges for it to get less expensive (I'm thinking Safeway on 85th Ave NW)\n\nTo be frank, living in the downtown core is going to be pretty pricey but as long as you're cool with driving outside to get lower priced supplies, you should be good.  Oh, and there's a Costco at the Southern edge of downtown.\n\nWhen I moved here I made $45k and lived in a tiny-ass studio apartment in Queen Anne.

I do have a car already, and will need to use that car to move to Seattle, but if it ends up that rent and groceries and whatnot takes up enough of my salary, I'm realistic enough to sell the car and put off my riding for a few years. If I can sell a Massachusetts car in Washington (no idea if I can, definitely something I realize I'll now have to look into), then hopefully there's enough general parking near wherever I find and someone buys it soon enough that I wouldn't have to spend too much on parking. I bought the car for $4k and have had it for almost three years (added on ~20k miles, actually) so I'd sell it for much less, and hopefully that would mean more people would be interested. Basically, I wouldn't be concerned with making a profit considering how long the car has lasted me.\n\nAlso I had no idea about the 25% tax rate! So thank you so much for that - I might have totally forgotten to look that up, and that's a big deal.

If you don't feel comfortable with your buyers or seller, just call Paypal and tell them.

An opportunity has come upon me, I can get pallets of toys\/a few other things for about $250. I was able to look completely through one of these pallets that someone bought at their house, and I was surprised. I found 4-5 of one item, which is about $65 new or $40 used. Another item was around $60 new as well. I didn't get to search every item on Amazon\/ebay, but I could tell from looking at them they were worth at least $20 or so, RC cars\/helicopters and the like. The only thing is, the boxes are pretty messed up. Dents, occasional tears, writing, etc. Not all of them are. So, would it be worth it to try to sell this stuff? Am I missing something big here? I could just buy a bunch of batteries, test it all, sell it and come out on top right? I have never done any of this stuff but I am good with computers and want to get out of my job.","436":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I still personally use it for all my backend stuff.\n\nBut then again, I'm not Google\/Facebook\/Amazon\/etc.","460":"This happened to me a year or so ago. It's a terrible experience. The thing is, I found the most frugal option was to do it right the first time instead of buying ten cheap methods that don't work. I have a dog, so some of the medicine I used may not be effective for you. As you've probably read, you can't just kill the fleas, you have to stop the life cycle, so it's not an overnight thing.  I assume you've already washed everything and and are keeping clothes off the floor.\nFirst, don't use Hartz or any off brand medication b\/c it can kill the pet. Pet Armor is the cheapest and most effective fipronil that I'd trust. Get that on him ASAP. If it is really bad you can get Capstar which will kill the fleas for 24 hours on your animal. It's a little pricy, but you can literally see the fleas falling off dead. It's definitely worth it if you hate seeing the animal in discomfort all the time. \nSecond, throw salt and baking soda everywhere. I've seen mixed reviews with this, but I think it definitely helped me. I threw salt EVERYWHERE in the morning, under furniture, closets, nooks and crannies. When I got home I'd vacuum it all up, open up my bagless vacuum outside, and immediately got rid of it far away. The salt should kill most of the fleas in the vacuum. \nThird, the only spray I found that really worked was JT Eaton flea and tick spray. I got it from Ace Hardware for cheaper than I found it at Amazon. It's still a little expensive, but none of the \"natural herbal\" remedies worked, and this did. I sprayed every inch of floor with this every couple of days and it really helped. I even sprayed inside the vacuum to kill anything that may have stayed in there. \nIf you have any questions let me know. Good luck","461":"Thanks. I haven't ventured into Amazon yet.

It takes time.\n\nFew things I did to help the process:\n\n- Save any 'unexpected' money into your emergency fund. Tax return went right to my emergency account. I am an avid reader of websites like SlickDeals, etc. and hit a few good checking account bonus offers I found with no hard credit pulls and no banking fees. Got $200 from my current bank, $100 from another. Bonus offers from utilities you use like Internet and TV (I used a cheap AT&amp;T TV deal and I'm pretty sure I got around $600-700 total in gift cards from them for churning). Lot of things around my house that I was able to sell on websites like eBay and Amazon that I no longer used (old books, games, movies, etc.) There's a lot you can do to hustle up some small cash that can add up over the long term.\n- Shop your expenses for EVERYTHING and do it routinely. You'd be surprised how much car insurance rates can vary when you look at different companies. Shop your internet, shop your TV (if you have it), shop your cell phone plan. When you have a budget lined up, and you reduce one expense slightly over the course of 1-2 years, you'll be shocked at how much it saves you (should be common sense but hard to rationalize when you only see a $10 savings each month for internet, for example).\n- Can you save on your monthly rent when your lease is up? That was one of the biggest ways I saved - by realizing I could spend $100 less per month on rent, find a place that may not have EVERYTHING I wanted in an apartment but was safe and good enough, and set aside $1200\/year.\n\nBest of luck.

Well my idea is a website designed toward \"geeky\" or \"nerdy\" things that I would sale.  Like a one stop shop for video games, comics, or toys and shirts.  I have also thought about blogging there as well about those subjects, but I don't know the first thing about web design or how to generate traffic.  Also with places like Amazon out there where you can pretty much buy anything I am not sure something like that would fly. ","548":"You can get by with a niche eCommerce site, it just has to be a good one.  You also need to validate the market before you waste time on anything else.\n\nAny person would go to a site and purchase from said site if it had a great way of demonstrating things the buyer wanted...and ONLY those things.  Amazon and eBay don't really do that.  Plus, I can learn about new things.  Lots of things like what you are talking about exist, so look at them for guidance.\n\nOnce you see a path you can somewhat follow then you need to decide what will be different about you and your site.  Why would a consumer choose you over another store which does a very similar thing...indeed, why visit your site over Amazon or eBay to begin with?\n\nThose are the questions you need to start to answer, and you need to get those answers from other people...not yourself.  This is market validation.  \n\nA) do people even want what I'm going to build and B) can I get it in front of them somehow.\n\nWeb Design and Generating traffic are pretty accessible fields...you can learn 'enough' to get going simply by googling.  Codecademy, TeamTreehouse, etc... can teach you coding.  SEO you can figure out.  You won't be an expert in either thing, but you can get started and learn as you go along.\n\nBuilding a business is tough, if it wasn't then most people would likely choose to work for themselves.  At least, more than currently do.  Its all about hard work and learning from mistakes.  Do something, learn, do something better, learn, do something better, etc...  It really isn't more complicated than that....it is just hard to gauge where to start.\n\nAlso, you need to have laser focus.  You're talking about building a 'geeky' site, but you also mention a few other things you might do.  I'll caution you to do ONE thing super fucking well and not to try to do everything.  That will cause you to fail.\n\nLike...in the USA we have two companies we'll look at here.  Wal-Mart and Sears.\n\nNo matter where you are in the world you probably know what Wal-Mart is and what it does.  Simply put, you can buy things there the cheapest... they may even use the word cheap to describe themselves.  They are able to offer you something this cheap because their operations are second to none, they don't miss a fucking beat and the constantly improve.  Having said that, Wal-Mart doesn't promise you short checkout lines, they don't promise you top tier service, they don't promise their employees excellent pay, etc... they promise consumers cheap goods, and they deliver.  They know who they are. \n\nHowever, you aren't going to go to Wal-Mart for high-end goods.  That's fine, that's not who Wal-Mart IS.  It is not who Wal-Mart wants to BE.  But you see, they have an image and (politics aside) they stick to it.  They have very, very undiluted branding.\n\nNow look at Sears...what does Sears do?  What do they sell?  Who are they trying to sell to?  Why would I go to Sears?  I really don't know, and since their Branding is so poor, I'll never visit the store...even if it would somehow benefit me.

CACH LLC aggressively pursues debtors in small claims courts all over the U.S., which can eventually result in wage garnishment. They buy your debt from the bank for less than the amount owed, and go after you for the full amount plus interest. Using credit should never be taken lightly.","555":"Not really.

In other words, those with a bachelor's diploma were better off before the digital revolution.\n\n&gt;What can be done? How can we fight this slide back toward the Middle Ages? \n\nI'll leave that as it is.\n\n&gt;If this comes as a surprise, that's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude.\n\nNo, it's because they didn't actually get a degree in a field that is hiring.  \n\n&gt;But exactly the opposite is happening. The digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs: minimum wage jobs (think Amazon warehouse employees) and so-called \"sharing-economy jobs\" (think Uber drivers).\n\nAmazon pays much more than minimum wage.  Uber drivers get paid much more than cab drivers.  \n\n&gt;Meanwhile, conservative columnist Ross Douthat fears a dystopian future in which \"a rich, technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents.\"\n\nSo someone didn't do anything with their life but get a bachelor's degree in English or political science, stopped there, and this is the world's fault how?  \n\n&gt;Sure, Silicon Valley doesn't owe America jobs. But something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages, decreased worker protection and zero job security.\n\nThis has been the norm since like the 1970s, when wages peaked in nominal dollars.  \n\n\n&gt;And if you think your own job is safe, think again. New research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades. This is a giant leap backward, but it's deceptively described as technological \"progress.\" As anyone who's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest, \"automated\" usually means \"worse.\"\n\n&gt;What can be done? \n\nI don't know, maybe young people need to attempt to be useful to the future by quit bitching that math is hard,  brush up on their engineering skills, work hard in school, and get a six-figure job because none of their peers have done the same. ","559":"Well, it's 5% on Amazon.com purchases as well and people are comparing it to the Amazon store card which is only 5% cash back on Amazon purchases so the Sallie Mae card is a better alternative because the gas + grocery categories are a bonus. ","560":"What Capital One card do you have? Based on the age and the fact that it's a Mastercard, it sounds like you have something out of date or subprime. You can probably get a card upgrade if you call in and ask about it (and a credit line increase while you're at it).\n\nThe Sallie Mae card is good. Amazon counts as a bookstore regardless of what you buy (credit card companies can see where you shop, but not what you buy, so Amazon counts only as an online bookstore).\n\nToo much credit line isn't a bad thing if you don't spend more than you can afford. Higher credit lines help your credit score, since overall line is a part of it (with higher = better), as is utilization (what % of your credit you're using. So long as you have the self control to keep your spend the same, your utilization will go down with a higher line).\n","561":"The Prestige is a card to hold and spend on, not really to churn. It's good for heavy travelers. You're conflating onetime signup bonuses with annual travel credits in comparing it to the Prestige to the Arrival+\/Venture and in any event, if you're a heavy traveler an airfare credit is just as good as a travel credit.\n\nPrestige's points can be redeemed at 1.6 cents\/point on AA\/US Airways flights. That effectively makes it a 4.8% cashback card on airfare and hotel purchases, 3.2% on entertainment. If you're a Citigold customer, that goes to 5.52% on airfare and hotel purchases- that's insane. That arguably blows the spending rewards of every other travel card, even airline and hotel specific ones, out of the water when you consider flights booked with TYP will still earn elite and redeemable miles and that purchases booked on travel discount sites still qualify for rewards. It also supercharges any other cards earning TYPs to be redeemed at 1.6 cents\/point. That turns my Citi Forward into 8% back at restaurants and Amazon.com machine.\n\nThe Platinum is more expensive, with a net AF of $250 after incidental credit (more narrow than Prestige's more generous air credit) vs. a net AF of either $200 or $100. The Platinum also has crappy rewards. Citi has Admiral's club access as well as Priority Pass with included guest access. In any event, heavy travelers don't need much incentive beyond the rewards and travel credit to make this card is worthwhile. ","562":"Tons of DIS, MMM, PG, JNJ, but no TSLA? No AMZN???

I have to agree almost completely with \/u\/vuhv on his post.  \n\nThe site, at first glance, appears half done.  I'm not recommending piling unnecessary content but there is a ton of empty space.  Empty space, when used in the proper aesthetic context can work well.  In this case it looks like you sort of stopped working on it half way through.  For example top banner.  Aside from the logo hard left, there are two small link stuck in the corner on the opposite side.  Aside from this, the top 1\/3rd of the site is a black box.  \n\nLooking further down, I see a giant white page, small paragraph, and text fields.  The first thing that grabs my eye is that you want me e-mail.  I don't think I've ever seen a site in which the main page was centered around a small, vague paragraph and an email entry field.  It's not a cell phone number but people are still hesitant on tossing out their email address indiscriminately.  I haven't even figured out what this site offers and all I see is it wants my email... seems a little sketchy.  \n\nIdea gun is loaded up, commence firing:  Starting from what I see from the top down.\n\nCordcut.me is a great domain and logo is ok, but has room for improvement.  The white outline on black looks rough and somewhat ill defined.  It doesn't pop.  It doesn't stick in your head.  With cursive text such as this the lines need to be perfectly defined clean.  I'm on a brand new Samsung LED 1080p monitor and for whatever reason (this is where we ask the nerds) it's still just bit pixelated or \"hazy.\"  It just doesn't quite look 100% clean and professional.  The cable graphic is also slightly hard to make out.  \n\nCould you put a different color circle, box, ect. behind the logo making it stand out from the top banner.  Maybe a white outlined circle or something around the logo.  It looks to be too much a part of the top banner.  I don't see, \"here's my logo\/company name, and here is the top banner of my site.\"  I see a top banner with a logo sort of inside of the banner.  They don't look like two separate items.\n\nIf you can't find useful content for the top banner would you consider simply enlarging, cleaning up, and centering the logo.  Just the whole 80% empty black box thing does come off as half-assed and unfinished. \n\nThe more I look at this the more I dislike the scheme.  The color differences, while may have been intended to define the areas of the site, make it look choppy and less refined.  You can use dark outlines, text fields, link boxes, ect. but the way it is currently leave much to be desired.  The colors are way too contrasting.  Consider a white and maybe light grey.  Take Amazon for example.  Almost entirely clean white.  Top banner is a light grey.  Enough to distinguish the different areas of the site but no completely break them up.  Your site looks like 3 different sections.  I understand the idea of defining areas of the site but the best sites do it subtly.  With similar or complementing colors of differing shades.  You went way too far and used the two most opposite colors.  Furthermore you don't have enough content on that top banner to justify that large of a distinction.  If all it is going to be is a logo and two links it should flow subtly into the page.  You've broken up the site, and forced a huge chunk of it to sit empty.  See if there is a way to have that top banner go from a moderate grey and fade down into white.  Right now you're drawing a ton of attention to... nothing.  \n\nSwitch your email field and the left side bar.  You're taking up your prime, key site space with something that can fit on a small side link.  Get that shit outta there.  It screams \"were more interested in getting your info than providing content.\" \n\nAlright, so I said fuck it and dicked around in paint for 20 minutes or so.  http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Vbz8GKF.jpg\n\nI figured it would be easier visualize what I was mentioning.  You can use blue and different shades, green and different shades and so on.  Look at Reddit here.  Whites, light greys, very light blues.  Boom simple and clean.  \n\nThe paragraph I jotted down is obviously just an idea.  The viewers need to be somewhat engaged.  I don't want to drag it on and it may be a little long as is.  Currently there isn't a single thing on the site that actually tells me what you're doing.  5 years of cord cutting. So is this a website for industrial cable cutting scissors?  With my paragraph I wanted to explain 1. Reassurance.  Great tip in sales.  Everyone wants to feel they're making smart choices and a little explanation on why this choice is smart.  2. A short bit for those who may be unsure or on the fence.  Kind of real em in sort of deal.  3.  the most important and what you're lacking.  Explain exactly what this site will do for them.\n\nUnder the three tabs.  Again, it's MS paint, I'm high shit, it's late, so just go with it :)  Each would then take you to it's corresponding page.  I think the getting started is very important.  Many people may have heard of or even use Netflix.  This may be their only knowledge of streaming and acquiring digital media.  We want to explain exactly what streaming media is and why they benefit the consumer.  We especially want to explain the need for equipment.  Possible veiwer, \"oh what, what happened to all the affordable media now you're telling me I need a $50 roku?  What the fuck is a Roku?\" aaaand they're turned off.  Letting them know up front not only explains what it is, but why it's worth it.  That visitor may be thinking, sure cable sucks but $50-$100 to Watch Netflix... I can do it on my laptop.  This is where you get to explain that these devices are sooooo much more than a Netflix or Hulu plastic box.  Explain how these devices offer hundreds of content choices, usb, bluetooth, wifi connectivity, ect.  Show them that this device doesn't just allow them to watch netflix on there living room TV,  IT LETS YOU TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OF ALL YOUR ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS!  \n\nNext box.  Now on your site you have netflix.... just netflix? Really.  Are you kidding.  That should have every single Goddamn obscure content service available.  YOU ARE CLAIMING TO BE THE EXPERT, now fuckin do it.  You can keep the current link to your content page.  I would use the second box I made, well, all the boxes, as your information outlet.  The second box can take you to another page about what Content is out there, how they work, what you pay for, what your options are, ect.  (again, dude, I don't feel reassured you're 5 years experienced and have only found 2 services)  I like what this site is.  I really do.  As I've mentioned it is a relatively new field for many consumers and most can be overwhelmed with the options.  They're coming to you to learn everything top to bottom front and back hold-there-hand-like-they're-five about getting digital media content.  When they leave the second box they should know what streaming content is and the nut and bolts of it all.  \n\nThen onto the third box is where you can define feature available in general.  Again, you can keep the current links and pages, but there needs to be more info for the consumer which is why I added the boxes.  Here we can talk about full entertainment control.  This will educate the visitor of 1. What types of devices exist 2.  Why you need these devices 3.  How they go far and beyond just streaming netflix.  Explain that they're getting a comprehensive media entertainment device.  Not listing feature by feature of this product, feature by feature of that product but  what, in general these devices do and the added benefits.\n\nHoly fuck bud.... what am I doing with my life.  I've wrapped up an hour+ acting like I know what I'm talking about ;)  I'll check back in the morning and see what you think.  Good luck.  Also, I just started goin off and didn't look back, I'm sure the grammatical and spelling errors are atrocious.  Deal with it.     Edit:  Just noticed the paragraph and typed up has a goofy redundant sentence I most likely forgot to delete or was just too damn high to notice. \n","569":"Anecdotal obviously, but I'd say Craigslist is probably your best bet. Just be patient. \n\nAmazon and other online retailers will all be in roughly the same range depending on sales, but Craigslist you'll get people just trying to get rid of stuff quickly. I've bought a few underpriced consoles this way and flipped them on eBay for extra cash. ","570":"I didn't.  Sold it through FBA.  So the buyer actually complemented me on Amazon's superfast shipping!  I'll take it.","571":"&gt; you can essentially get free movies, TV shows, sports.\n\nSuch as Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime? Or from somewhere else? I've never heard of this. ","572":"Not all purchases. I always buy Amazon gift cards with the exact amount needed beforehand for whatever Amazon purchase. This counts toward the discount.","573":"Just dont forget to make a payment before the official due date. The bank who runs the 'Amazon Store Card' is extremely combative; very similar to a proper collections agency. Several phone calls per day from different numbers, demanding personal info from you before they even introduce who they are. Even continues several days after you pay off the full balance. Otherwise, its a fine deal.","574":"Holy Smokes! Thanks!! I will try to segment some replies to what your saying below.\n\n&gt;Empty space\n\nThat is definitely related to the default theme, I would prefer the text stretched all the way over as shown in your example as well but it didnt seem possible in the settings. I am looking into themes now to see a best fit for the direction I want to go which is a Blog\/Review Emphasis with Amazon Affiliate for different articles to encourage users to buy the product in the review if they are interested. Im thinking a new theme may solve alot of your points of blank space and utilization of the front page.\n\n\n&gt;pixelated or \"hazy.\"\n\nThis is interesting, I did some zooming in and noticed this as well. I just did the logo in Photoshop so its not a true logo but I can work on making it that to hopefully fix some of the blurriness.\n\n&gt;I need a $50 roku\n\nI do have a small youtube channel (~250 subs) and I have some review content already so I think per some other suggestions I will be working on video content for different devices that will tie into each review page and answer some of those questions.\n\n&gt;CLAIMING TO BE THE EXPERT\n\nYes I slacked here, I will definitely be adding additional content as well.\n\nThanks for all the pointers.","575":"Honestly I wouldn't start with FBA, especially on a limited budget. I'm sure some people here would disagree with me though. I might be biased since I do very little Amazon and mostly sell on eBay but you'll be able to sell a wider variety of stuff through eBay, FBA fees are higher, and you'll get your money quicker with eBay (immediately once your Paypal account is established, vs 14 days + 3-5 day bank transfer for Amazon).\n\nSome good items to look for that you can pick up for $.50-$2 and make a decent profit on would be snap-back hats (sports teams, vintage, etc) and shot glasses. Just look up sold prices for every item to make sure you don't buy a dud, don't forget to check when the last time one sold was, how often it sells, and how many are currently listed and at what price. Start small and get a feel for it, don't run out and buy up a ton of inventory that is never going to sell or is going to lose you money. Also be patient, things take time to sell unless they're way in demand, so I would recommend not using any money you might think you'll need in the near future to purchase inventory.","576":"Hmm, do you recon that's how every customer feels when they come across my website? You gave me something to think about actually, the target market is way too broad and yeah, i'd rather purchase random stuff from Amazon.\n\nThis is what i think i may do, please let me know your thoughts:\nI will remove every product and category and start again. There will be only electronics (e.g. dash cams, security cameras),electronic accessories (e.g. phone cases, screen protectors) and \"other\" product pages (sd cards etc..) . This will ensure that the market is targeted towards technology.\n\nWhat can i give you that Amazon can't? I'll provide you with free postage Australia wide for any order. \n\nAbout the design-wise, i think it's standard. It's not complete rubbish but it's not amazing either. I will probably leave it how it is then.","577":"When it comes to extended warranties, Mastercard seems to be the worst, American Express the best, while Visa seems to be almost as good as Amex.   I don't know about Discover, which started its warranty protection only 2 years ago.\n\nSome card issuers are better than others about obeying the federal Fair Credit Billing Act, with USAA probably being the best, but Discover and American Express rated well in this respect in Consumer Reports' survey.  One of the worst was Capital One.  Also when it comes to backing you up against the card issuer, Mastercard never wanted to help me, while Visa did.\n\nCheck for sign-up bonuses of $100 - $500 for spending at least a certain amount within a specified period.  American Express, Chase, and Discover have offered them in the past 6 months.   Amex also offers free Amazon Prime for a year and ShopRunner.\n\n","578":"Student loans typically don't need to be repaid until after you leave college (after all, if you could afford to pay them in college, you wouldn't need a loan).  Even better, if you get federally subsidized student loans, interest won't even start accruing until 6 months after you leave.\n\nAs far as typical expenses for a college student that aren't included in your aid package, it really depends on if and how much parental support you have.  I was completely on my own, but it's been nearly a decade since I was in undergrad.  Here's what I remember as big or annoying expenses, in no particular order:\n\n1)  Cell phone.  I went without for a year, but this is just one of those necessities of modern life now, especially if you live hundreds of miles away from home.\n\n2)  Food.  If you have a dining plan, this isn't as bad as you imagine, until you get towards the end of the semester and start subsisting on meals of crackers and jam packets because your balance is low (this happened to me a few times).  Also, if your friends decide they want to go off campus to a restaurant, it can get pricey quick unless you learn when to say no.\n\n3)  Cars are expensive, to the point where I don't recommend them unless you're certain you need one, especially if your parents aren't contributing anything.  There's insurance, maintenance, registration, inspections (depending on state), gas, parking permits (typically a few hundred dollars per year at many colleges).  If you're going to a residential college with on-campus housing, seriously re-evaluate this \"need.\"  This is what rich friends are for.\n\n4)  Laundry.  Seems small, but college dorms are typically pay per wash\/dry, and it adds up quick compared to doing your laundry back home.\n\n5)  Textbooks and school supplies.  Supposedly aid packages include this, but my aid package was never enough to completely cover tuition, so this was all out of pocket for me.  Depends on major and classes, but can easily be $300-$500 per semester.  Pro-tip - Avoid the school bookstore and use Amazon.  Get International Editions.  If you're really desperate, the library will usually have a few extra copies you can use until you can get your own.","579":"When sourcing I've learned to now start checking eBay and Amazon FBA.

TiVo plus HD antenna means that you can record all those shows and keep up with current TV easily.  The TiVo can be used to watch shows from Amazon as well since it has storage to actually download a show instead of just streaming.  Also Chromecast + ESPN streaming + someone's password will let you watch most sports.  You don't necessarily need a borrowed password as ESPN does have a lot of free streaming stuff but the password can be helpful. ","586":"You can't as far as I know. You could take it to UPS to get it weighed, but if you buy the shipping label from them you lose Amazon's extremely low discounted shipping through UPS.

You might look into scripts to update if you have lots of links but the frequency shouldn't be that great. \n\nAs for continued availability I struggle with this all the time. Stuff comes and goes and you just have to expect it. If the niche demand will remain you can expect that it or some competitor will eventually offer the same or a similar product. If not then it's stock them yourself if it's worthwhile. I've done that one several times.\n\nAs for 2) that is basically a math question and it depends on how long your site will remain relevant without needing more investment. Investing $200 (total including my time) and making $250 a year makes sense to me but it is much more attractive if it lasts five years than if it lasts 1. Investing $200 a year for $250?

Also, while being a web designer will help, I honestly just use WordPress. It's a quick and simple setup, I have software that lets me get a fresh install up with the template and all the plugins \/ settings that I use already installed and ready to go. I just have to change some of the basic info around and change the unique settings for the plugins to get it going.\n\nSnowshoe cats. A dude had made a tiny and honestly pretty shitty little website about the Snowshoe cat. At the time I think it was snowshoecat.com. This exact term is searched ~15,000 times a month on Google.

Snowshoe-cat.com is available and should work just as well.\n\nSo you get up the site, maybe start a Facebook page, twitter page, pinterest page, hell maybe a YouTube account and maybe even Instagram, though getting people from Instagram to your site is a bitch. Add some written content about the cats and the breed. Their personality and traits and some history about them. Maybe a picture gallery and where to find them. You could even affiliate link to cat products on Amazon. Maybe posters of the cat or calendars.\n\nYour audience is old ladies and younger girls. They probably don't have AdBlock and probably will click random shit on the page.\n\nExpand on your targeted keywords. Snowshoe cat rescue, breed, for sale, price, etc. Talk about all those different topics so that you have a wider audience and a broader range of keywords.\n\nAt this point it's all about rank. If you get within the top 3 spots on Google you should start generating some money. Probably some decent money too. If you're a G at the social stuff you can really start to drive traffic to the site.\n\nI have a site that's semi similar. About a breed of animal. HuffPo linked to it one day. Randomly out of the blue. I made $200-$300 over the next week from that one link from HuffPo. Sites like that eat this shit up. Buzzfeed. A link from those places are golden.

That UPC is listed in Amazon, but it is the wrong color. The actual product I am selling is listed in Amazon under UPC 789. I'm not allowed to add this product to a shipment because when Amazon gets it, they're going to notice the UPC difference and stick me in with UPC 123.\n\nI've tried disputing with Amazon with no luck, included photos, etc.\n\nIs it allowable to print new UPCs and stick those onto the products instead? Essentially covering up the 789 UPC with the correct, and best-listed, 123 UPC? \n\n####2. Co-mingled inventory error\n\nTried listing a bluetooth speaker. Added it to shipping plan. It throws up an error about comingled inventory. \n\n    Cannot be stickerless, commingled\n        The error condition cannot be corrected from here. \n        This product must be removed from this shipment plan. You can send in new inventory by creating a new \n        listing for this product that requires product labels.\n\nMy internet research shows that you have to create a new MSKU. Does this mean --&gt; Add a Product --&gt; Find product --&gt; New Listing, and I upload the photos, description, everything? Obviously then it wouldn't be listed under the high rated listing, likely would take longer to sell, etc. I'd probably rather eBay than do that.","622":"I guess I would liken it to Best Buy's current issue. People come into their store to talk to the sales reps, try the product on the floor and then they go home and buy it on Amazon.","623":"I guess you could say I'm blase about breaking tax laws in this specific example, but really who isn't? I'd guess 99.9% of people that purchase from Amazon do not claim sales tax. That's pretty much the number 1 incentive for buying on Amazon.","624":"&gt;  That's pretty much the number 1 incentive for buying on Amazon.\n\nThe #1 incentive for buying things from amazon is that sometimes you don't have to pay sales tax?\n\nReally?","625":"I was being facetious with the #1 status - but let's not get off topic. Online convenience aside, yes - for many people that's a huge reason.  That $3,000 4k TV from Amazon means an instant $277 savings in my state by not paying sales tax at Best Buy.","626":"&gt; That's pretty much the number 1 incentive for buying on Amazon.\n\nAlthough I agree with you, it doesn't mean it's the correct way of doing things. \n\nThe correct answer is... keep record of all online purchases and pay the tax you owe.\n\nThe *other* answer is... do what you want, we all do.","627":"Yup, just AdSense. I have an Amazon Affiliate account too and use it on a site I think will do very well in the future, but I'm still working on getting the traffic and ranking up. I've not had TOO much luck with Amazon Affiliate products yet, but I've never really gotten a great deal of traffic to the sites using it. Though I might add it to my two main sites now that I think about it. The thing with Amazon is that so many people use it that if you have decent traffic, you can get conversions. I've had people click the links for the niche products and they end up buying shit completely unrelated to my niche within the 24 hour window and get paid because of it. As long as they click your link and buy something on Amazon.com within 24 hours you get credit. Other sites and platforms will offer a larger % of the sale and a bigger window. I know some of the professional sports sites have like 30 day windows with 15% commissions which is pretty damn good, but those sites can also have higher prices than places like Amazon. \n\nGenerating the content is always different. Depends how many pages you have and what the content will be. One of my sites is basically just pictures and that took some time because I had to search the internet for pictures and then upload them with good names for SEO purposes.\n\nWriting the content itself can take some time too. You can honestly outsource this if you wanted to. Plenty of places online where you can pay someone to write 500 words or so worth of content. The quality usually varies in price, but places like oDesk.com are legit and you can use the reviews to figure out who is good at what they do.\n\nOne site I have is an episode guide for a TV show. I can either rewatch all the episodes and write the summaries as I watch them or pay someone to do it. I've tried both methods. I paid one girl $10 for each ~500 words summary. She hadn't watch the show yet and wanted too so it sort of worked out perfectly.\n\nBut I've found doing it myself is easier. I just get bored easily and hate watching the same thing twice. On new episodes I'm going to just write as I watch the episode for the first time. I notice more details about the shows this way too. So for those sites, it's about an hour for each episode of content I create, but I'm also watching the show which I would do anyways.\n\nI also see people talking about how making sites like this is 'dead' and that's just not true. There are so many niches out there that aren't being tackled yet.\n","628":"It's like 30 or 20 cents for labeling. Not sure about prep. There's an entire section on it in the Amazon help section. ","629":"Yes it's 29 on Amazon with prime. I priced it at $29.99 and someone submitted an offer at $22, countered at $25. I'm going to add $5 for shipping to the ebay listing, see if it still sells.

I can switch now, then products I send in in the future will need to be labeled... the \"sell through product... without having to replace existing inventory in fulfillment centers\" part. Super cautious because I don't want my 200+ items in inventory to all disappear.","635":"I suppose another way of looking at it is what value does this provide over me just entering the product name into Reddit's search or even searching Reddit directly through Google?\n\n\"Directory\" style websites can be a tough nut to crack because they've got to add some value beyond Google and\/or wherever they are pulling the data from. \n\nFor example, I just opened your site again and the first product I saw was the book \"Prince of Thorns.\" I click the link and there's 4 comments.\n\nNow on the other hand, I enter \"Prince of Thorns (The Broken Empire Book 1)\" into Reddit's search and get an author AMA, giveaway thread, and several other posts with multiple comments. I'm sure there's some good stuff in there. On top of that, I plug the same search into Google and the front page is littered with reviews and star ratings... and ways to purchase the product. Both Reddit and Google provide great resources to your stated benefit, \"you're about to buy something and just want to get a quick overview of what people say about it.\"\n\nFinally consider this, I can't think of a single popular website that exists solely for product reviews. And I don't think it's because nobody has thought about it. It's likely because reviews naturally integrate with the storefronts where products are purchased. It just makes more sense for UX and user conversion to land&gt;research(read reviews)&gt;add-to-cart&gt;purchase. By and large users will purchase less if they have to visit different domains to handle research. That's why the big players in ecommerce go all out on their review systems. \n\nAmazon, eBay, mom and pop web shops, etc. all have valuable review systems in place that are already the \"go-to\" for people wanting to get a quick overview of what people say about a product.\n\nSo the question for your directory-style website: how can you provide value over what Google and Reddit provide?  \n","636":"Maybe in terms of performance metrics, but Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have a decided lack of scantily clad women on their website and Superbowl Commercials.","637":"Yep, can also buy Amazon gift cards in the store.

But it's within walking distance of my work. I could have gotten one for as little as $600 a month in a depressed part of town 10 to 15 miles away from work.\n\nI started factoring in the differences.\n* Included washer\/dryer\n* Didn't have to pay for parking in town.\n* Could walk to work instead of drive or take the train.\n* Included cable internet and cable TV.\n* All concrete construction.\n* Elevators so I didn't have to haul furniture up stairs.\n\nMoney wise about $100 would have been internet and TV, I would have had to pay about $250 a month either for parking and gas\/maintenance or for a monthly transit pass. I would spend about 1\/2 as much in electricity because the concrete construction of the building means that it's warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, plus the insulation is better in the exterior walls. In addition to all the other differences that would save me a few dollars here and there. (Like the fitness room and pool. Included washer and dryer. Etc...)\n\nSo, I estimated that the above things added up to about $400 a month. So the difference would end up being about $300 a month. (Seriously my last apartment cost me on average $200 a month for electricity in the summer, the new one I spend about $75 during the summer. I was spending $80 just for internet, no TV included.)\n\nHere's something to think about when it comes to \"Luxury\" apartments. If the building is all concrete construction you won't hear your neighbors upstairs walking. You won't hear your neighbors next door watching TV or even just having a normal conversation like you will in cheaply constructed buildings. (This was a problem in other apartments I've lived in. Now I can run my TV at a fair volume with my sub-woofer and I've gotten exactly 0 complaints from my neighbors.) The property managers and staff will treat you like a valued customer instead of a hassle that they have to deal with. Your neighbors will not be crackheads or gang bangers. Your car won't be broken into in the parking lot. You won't have to buy a new TV and computer because someone broke in during the night and held a gun to your head demanding your drugs and cash. (Yeah, I don't have either of those things...) The staff will sign for packages for you when things are delivered while you're at work.\n\nSo, I thought to myself, I can walk home in 15 minutes or ride a bike home in 5. I won't have to worry about someone breaking into my house or stealing my car. I won't have to worry about getting mugged when I come home late. I can relax in a nice environment without being bothered by assholes. If something's broken the manager will get it fixed within 1 business day instead of having to wait and wait for my fridge to be fixed or replaced. I don't have to worry about my neighbors stealing my Amazon packages while I'm at work...\n\nSure, that $300 a month could be used for other things, but really isn't that kind of peace of mind worth another $300 a month?\n\nI decided it was, and that's a huge change for me because I used to be the biggest cheapskate you ever met.

It's passive BUT if you don't do the 5 or 6 question survey that pops up about once a week it's SLOW AS THE HILLS redeeming rewards unless you only do sweepstakes which I almost never recommend spending points on when there's an actual reward.\n\nSome people also like mimedia, personally I'm not a fan and their new app needs administrator permission on your phone as well as access to your internet history and crap. No thanks.\n\nNow, let's talk about active because if you *don't* have a phone all of the above is pretty pointless.\n\nmturk is absolutely awesome because it credits far more than any other survey site I've used. You can bag $15 a day if you're really dedicated and constantly checking it (most I've gotten was about $11 in a day, I've heard as high as $50 but that would mostly be for people that have over 100 credited offers).\n\nGo to \/r\/HITsWorthTurkingFor and sort by new and start hacking away. \n\n[Mturk](https:\/\/www.mturk.com\/mturk\/welcome) deposits directly to your Amazon account which you can link to your bank account but you need to get that all verified. It can take a week to transfer money so make sure you don't wait until the last minute to do it.\n\nIf I'm remembering right it also takes a long time to get verified for just a MTurk account in the first place (on top of the bank account linking verification) and even when you've got it chances are you can exhaust every survey available to you. Rare, but it happens and probably will happen with your hefty goal. So in the meantime you can try these other active sites too:\n\n[InstaGC](http:\/\/www.instagc.com) (great because like they advertise their giftcards are given as soon as you redeem)\n\n[Swagbucks](http:\/\/www.swagbucks.com)\n\nPrizerebel [ref](http:\/\/mypr.link\/85164)|[non-ref](http:\/\/www.prizerebel.com)\n\nI'm lazy as shit, enjoy my leisure time a lot, and work so I only make around $10 a week off of these active ones (and only put in about 3 or so hours in that week). If you were really going at it you could easily make what you need to in 2 months though.","645":"Actually, people in states where Amazon has a significant physical presence have to pay sales tax on Amazon purchases.

I asked for a full refund, got one, and still have the thing. It's super sell-able, because really only the outside plastic was smashed in. Anything I make from here is profit!","648":"Amazon FBA - Do you need to be able to source large qty. of a given item to: \n\n* generate a decent profit?\n* be allowed to sell on gated categories?","649":"Not that I've been able to discover. Amazon says they've got some algorithm that ships an item to the warehouse nearest where its likely to be sold, and also based on secondary characteristics like existing inventory, space, blah blah blah. Basically, Amazon, in their infinite wisdom, does their own thing. \n\nThe only way I've been able to get shipments to smarten up is to basically add new inventory and hope that Amazon adds them to the biggest shipment. \n\nSo lets say you have Item D in shipment 4. Go into your inventory, find the listing, click \"Send\/Replenish Inventory.\" Go through the shipping plan, the stickering (don't print the stickers, obviously) and finally, when it tries to add it to a shipment, hope that Shipment 1 comes up. If it doesn't, just cancel out of there. If it does, then you can delete shipment 4. Repeat with your other items. \n\nThis is super tedious, and I wouldn't take the trouble for more than a few items. Also, sometimes it just won't work, and you've wasted all that time for nothing. Sometimes, I've just deleted the shipments, held onto the stock, and shipped it later. Sometimes it seems like Amazon is really anal about this, and other times I'll send hundreds of items to the same warehouse.\n\nFYI, I read on Peter Valley's blog that deleting shipments can cause demerits on your account, but I've never seen it happen on mine, and I monitor it really closely. I'm not even sure how they'd classify that as a defect, because the shipment doesn't even exist until the shipping labels are printed. ","650":"You can't add new items to pre-existing shipments, only change the quantity. Amazon UPS shipping is so discounted you're better off biting the bullet, sorry.","651":"It depends on how long you're prepared to wait for a sale, and how in-demand the item. Here's what I've seen, as a book and media seller:\n\n* people like the 2-day shipping, not because it's two-day shipping, but because the MF people can take up to 3 weeks to ship, and you can't tell if they'll be slow as fuck before you buy.\n\n* FBA items means you get to deal with Amazon customer service, not some random dude with a chip on his shoulder.\n\n* Okay, yeah, two-day shipping is nice. I work hard, I deserve that book this weekend, and I'll pay a premium for it. Also, school books. A lot of people leave buying their schoolbooks until the last minute. Mwahahahahah. Guess whose book is available at MF+$20?\n\n* Overseas people love FBA because Amazon knows the ropes when shipping internationally. It's a huge hassle to have some know-nothing ship to Romania and get the paperwork all wrong so it gets hung up in customs.\n\nBasically, I'll compete with MF once the listing is old enough, but I usually give it 6 months to a year to sell at a premium. The size of the premium depends on the type and desireability of the book, and how aggressive my competition is. Yes, please start charging a premium, because it's annoying when FBA is the lowest offer. Let the MF dregs try to compete on price. Let us compete on convenience.\n\nOne of Peter Valley's books talks about this, but I forget which one. FBAMastery.com is his site.","652":"Your best bet is probably a grocery\/gas rewards card. You can use it to buy gift cards at grocery stores and get the cash back, so you could increase your cash back by going to the grocery store to buy a gift card for Amazon, game stop, AMC, gas stations, etc. then use the money you would have spent on the purchase to pay your credit card. It took me years to finally realize this and I kick myself for all the lost years of cash back. Never use a debit card that gives you nothing when there's always a credit card that will give you *something* for your purchase. \n\nI would suggest the AMEX Blue Cash Everyday card with a credit score of 700 and responsible use. You should be able to get approved and it gives you 3% back on grocery store purchases (up to $6k\/yr), 2% back on gas, and 1% back on everything else (unlimited cash back on the 2% and 1% categories). It also comes with the benefits of having an AMEX and starts building a relationship with them for better card offers in the future. \n\nSend me a PM with your email address if you'd like me to send you a referral for the AMEX card :)","653":"I have both cards.

Which is fine overall, but I don't see how they can compete with the big boys when their hardware is so basic and low grade, even with raid tricks and virtualization.","656":"FWIW [I found this thread in the Amazon Seller Forums](https:\/\/sellercentral.amazon.com\/forums\/thread.jspa?messageID=3083604&amp;#3083604)\n\nPretty good discussion and there is proper citing also.","657":"Regarding the free shipping, i meant to say that that is what we 'can' do to separate ourselves from Amazon.\nHmm, i agree with your idea on more elements but i think the simple design is trending. For example, if you take a look at www.kogan.com they have badges and stuff every ware.\n\nI will have a better think about this any way and your idea on a business moto is quite nice, i tried to think of one myself, it was originally \"Australia's everything store\" but it only had 20 products haha so i removed it.\n\nThanks for your input by the way.","658":"The authors I know haven't done much AdSense or Facebook advertising because their books are on Amazon and the profit per sale is too low to justify given likely conversion rates.

While it does not take in to account all possible factors, I have found it to be pretty entertaining to test out ideas\nFor example, I have done something very similar to what you have described (bought slightly ITM, slightly OTM, one ITM and one OTM etc). \nWhat I have found is that the only way to generate profits in doing this type of strategy is for the underlying to have a huge swing (i.e. Amazon and Priceline the past few months). Most of the time, what happens (in my case at least) the stock does not move enough and my profit at most (if any) is on the order of 25% and more likely I am taking small loses as any profit in one order is cancelled out by profits on the other.\n\nLooking at your example, two things that strike me are\n1) for the companies you indicate, the options prices I have seen tend to be considerably more (2-4x or more at a minimum) Priceline was $30. Unless you plan on going way out of the money, which you may end up shooting yourself in the foot\n2) I don't believe you are going to find the situation such that both of your orders are going to turn a profit at the same time. I've not come across this (though, admittedly, new to this game as well). If there is a swing, what I have found happen is that one side of the straddle will profitable (up to 4x profit or more) and the other will get crushed basically be worthless. \n\nI do think that this strategy could be profitable if you have a good system or knack for selecting big moving stocks and have a large enough starting capital to get in the game big enough to profit (at least 3 - 5 contracts). For example, I have been doing something similar (like I said above) since about mid Feb (whenever Amazon did their earnings). With the 200K starting capital in the paper trading account I was able to turn that around in to 320K with various trades (though in the past three weeks I have whittled it down to 290K).\n\nSomethings I have noticed are:\n1) The big swings mostly seem to happen after-hours and when you are able to put in actionable orders your profits and losses are pretty much set (wins and losses).\n2) I've had the best luck when picking stocks based on name recognition in the information technology sector (IT\/Computers\/Software is more my forte).\n3) I've had the best luck letting the orders ride until the earnings are announced (not setting stop loss orders) and once the orders are announced putting in my stoploss orders with a wide enough give to leave a profit if the bottom falls out, but also account for variability and to ride the wave up. I've toyed with the idea of \"keep profit\" order, a high end target that once it gets it I am happy to exit the order\n4) I've had the most profitability buying slightly in the money contracts. OTM contracts, while cheaper, seem to take bigger swings to turn a profit","660":"We do.

It takes a lot of work, but once you 'learn' Etsy, you can be a superstar more easily compared to eBay or Amazon. This is because on Etsy you're more of a 'brand'. \n\nEtsy is more of a social shopping experience than on eBay. On eBay, buyers will search for \"iPhone 5c\" and just look for the cheapest possible price for an iPhone 5c. They don't care if it came from MrCoolDude420, Tweaker69, or Apple_Refurbishers_INC. On Etsy, there is a lot more of just searching vague terms \"Vintage Toe Socks\" or something, finding a wardrobe style you like, and following a store. That store is a 'brand' now. It's not imperative to sell a bunch of things that are all the same genre or style... but it's extremely helpful. You need to distinguish yourself in someway. Just like IRL, Taco Bell sells pretend Mexican food... so if I want to get pretend Mexican food, I'd go to Taco Bell. If Taco Bell started selling blankets and spaghetti, I'd get confused, the brand wouldn't mean anything anymore. Wal-mart, on the other hand, does not specialize in anything. They sell everything. They distinguish themselves by price. You probably don't want to be the Wal-Mart of Etsy unless you're sourcing from China and listing tons of listings. \n\nNow with that out of the way, you have the context to which I will be answering your questions.\n\n1. It is not a mystery how to get views. You just have to get into the heads of your shoppers. Warning: I'm about to get sexist here. But remember, in advertising it's just called targeting demographics, not sexism. A tremendous amount of your traffic on twitter will come from one group:  young fashion-conscious females with money. Have you ever been shopping with a young fashion-conscious female? There's a lot of 'browsing' (i.e. using lots of vague search terms to find a style), lots of 'OMG I LOVE THIS', without actually purchasing ('favoriting' your items or your shop for later browsing), and it's very social. Like i said earlier, you take advantage of this by having a fair amount of things that are the same style, weekly or at least frequent updates to inventory that is similar in style (to encourage people to come back to their favorite stores to see what's new), and market the shit out of yourself. Get that shit on twitter, get that shit on pinterest, get it out to the young, fashion-conscious females so that your brand actually exists in their minds.\n\n2. Just like how men like to see suits on on classy, attractive men... women like to see their vintage cutesie bullshit on skinny white girls, or attractive racially ambiguous women. Take a look at the top stores on Etsy, and tell me I'm wrong. If you're selling non-clothing items, take a picture of the item outdoors. It's pretty popular on Etsy. It makes you seem creative without actually having to be creative. It also looks less business-y.\n\n3. Have you ever been shopping with a young fashion conscious female? Take what you think is a reasonable price, and add $100. More seriously, look at the bigger, more successful Etsy stores. How much are they selling their stuff for? Even if it's not a 1-1 comparison (Etsy is less about model numbers and versions, and more about style), it gives you an idea of the perceived value. To a point, making things more expensive adds perceived value. \n\n4. I've slowed down a bunch on Etsy. I've helped a few of my young, fashion conscious female friends build stores for their jewelry and art and whatnot... but I don't have the energy to market stuff all day. It changes where the work goes in your business. Finding product is easier, but the actual marketing is where you put all of your time. It's definitely worth it, but I'd rather stick with eBay.","700":"Personally I would say that there is a lot of hope!  I remember getting married and with both incomes combined being so happy the first time we had $300 at the end of the month to put into savings!\n\nWhat helped me was to make a list of all my expenses, groceries, utilities, eating out, everything.  And then I put everything into what was due the first half of the month and what was due the second half to make sure I never missed payments.\n\nAlso, some articles I read suggested paying off the small loans\/credit cards first as it helps give you that feeling of accomplishment and is a positive thing that can be done quickly.  With that I would pay off Amazon first, and then PayPal.  That now gives you an extra 120\/mo.  \nStudent loans are not fun, I'm not sure on the best way to handle those, I always just did the payments.\nGet rid of the cell phone.

You can use the extra 240 from paying off bills to pay this down or balance transfer it and dedicate $400 to have it gone in a year.  \nThese are all options that don't mess with what you have left every week.

You can do something which will destroy you and literally make yourself go further in debt if you're not careful, or you can destroy the debt with some swift thinking, negotiations and work\/dedication.\n\n**A possible solution may to be consolidating your credit cards to one. I would advise this unless you have someone that can plan everything out in detail and can plan out everything into a solid payment.**\n\nBeing in debt sucks, but being out of it is even more amazing. Here is a few things to consider before you do anything:\n\n-Are you spending\/doing anything that's a habit that you could be saving money on.\n\n-Do you buy coffee every morning on the way to work?\n\n-Do you Smoke or Dip tobacco?\n\n-Do you buy name brand va offshoot for things that really don't matter?\n\n- Are you frugal about the gas you buy?\n\n- Do you buy gas using Cash vs using a card?\n\nDuring the week, are you eating out or preparing food. Preparing food for the week in a batch can help you save a ton, by using a meal plan you can precook chicken for 3-4 days and do leftover or prepare to build small portions to reheat or preplan. This helps destroy the need to constantly go to the grocery store and buy out of budget or without a budget. Don't forget, do your research on which companies provide your local store with value brands. Example:  Great Value at Walmart vs Kraft is nearly 1-2$ cheaper. (.98 vs 2.73 at our local store). To compensate with your value, change the ingredients by including the missing items. To compensate for example the GV Mac N Cheese dryness, use Butter and Milk, (mind you this is playing on that you have WIC).\n\nYou need to also look at your budget for your bills and find a healthy snowball effect to knock them out. How you ask? Well let's build a list of your actual bills % rating and how much is actually going to pay them off. While its great you have a low payment towards X, and its only X amount, of your 100$ your paying, you may be dragging that payment out for YEARS and that's what they want. I would look into your PAYPAL, since PAYPAL has been known to have outrageous spikes in money owed and interest hikes. PAYPAL and AMAZON (Assuming it's through Chase) can be killers so make sure to handle them quickly. But as I said, you need to tear into your budget and find which is bleeding you dry.\n\nFor the Dentist, call and see if there are any negotiations you can make. As for an itemized list, just as you would for a hospital bill. You would be surprised at some of the things they throw on bills and just are things that shouldn't. Mouthwash -50$, when you never used the mouthwash *Example*.\n\n*I know you said you cannot swap companies* However, just as a throwing it out there, I would hate to lock you into another cell phone plan, but look into Sprint. Right now they are offering lower payments, and cutting your bill in half. If this is an option that works, you could save by just swapping carriers, especially since they will buy out your contract. *If possible*\n\nLet's talk about your Cat for a moment. As much as I love pets, and pets are the most amazing thing in the world, a pet can be a burden on finances. While I am not saying, ditch the cat, I can't tell you how your cat and you bond, but if its just a cat and doesn't hold sentimental value consider selling or having a friend take the cat. Pets can cost money and be a suckpit of cash for things. Litter, food, shots, medicine, medical, toys, treats.etc.\nYou need to really stop and reflect and start killing out your debt and build a smart \u00bd \u00bd rule. If you are carrying over excess this week from your budget, use it to your advantage, save half for a payoff and half for a card killer. The best bet looking at your situation is to kill off your Amazon card, to prevent you from spending; I would close it if you can't control (no judging). From there that's 50$ extra you can due towards Paypal.  This makes 120$ payment towards Paypal (plus any kicker if you have it), which means in 19 months you can murder it out. With that makes you have 120$ in excess savings. From there, I would play it smart and use 20$ of that as a savings buffer. While 20$ seems stupid, 20$ extra is 20$ you never had. The extra 100$ can be used to finish off that dentist bill, which would make you sit at 150$.\n\nAlternatively you could try the Amazon -&gt; Dentist burn, which would net you 100$ on top of the 70$ towards paypal, making it 150$ towards Paypal at once and 20$ in that savings. It really depends on timelines, but it's a very obtainable goal.\n\n\nWork hard, spend smart and learn this position. We all hit it at some point, it's recoverable :D.\n\n","706":"Using some of this towards the debt would help chip it away a lot faster.  Cause this is a lot of money left over in a month.\n\nEdit: Hell, pay off the Amazon card and cancel it.

Start off by finding a product that you can buy low and sell for a higher price. I am not sure where you are located but look for items either at garage sales or at clearance sales. \n\nSell these items on ebay or amazon. Spend time doing research as to what the items are selling for, also calculate the expenses to ship and the marketplace fees. You lose money on the buy, not on the sale. You can make a significant amount of money by just finding items on clearance sale in your neighborhood and listing them at full price on amazon.\n\nRinse and repeat. \n\nShopify is a great platform, but you are responsible for creating traffic to the site and getting buyers for your products. When you are first starting why not have someone else do all of the selling for you. Amazon and ebay are great places to start. \n\nTake action!","709":"I was just thinking if these go for $50 on FBA, after Amazon fees, self-employment tax, and shipping, how much are you really going to make off 8 of them?

Also, does that BofA travel card have tiered redemption values for the points like many of their WorldPoints cards do? If so, you need to save up $250 worth of points in order to redeem one point for 1 cent worth of value. Their rewards structure sucks with the WorldPoints tiered value cards.","712":"In another comment, with regard to getting your own place, you said:\n\n&gt; That's why I am wondering how people with debt afford to live AND pay their debt off.\n\nThe short answer is that they don't. They either stay at home and aggressively pay down their debt and save up to move into an apartment, or they go rent an apartment anyway and spiral further into debt. That decision is up to you.\n\n&gt; But I need my own place with her.\n\nUnless your parents are about to kick you out you do not need your own place - you *want* your own place. Based on the information you've shared, IMHO **there is absolutely no way you can move into your own place at this time.** Rent+utilities aside, you also need to worry about deposits (which can be anywhere from 1-3mo worth of rent), moving expenses, and stocking an apartment with the necessities. You need a steady job, which you are aware of. How's your credit? If you don't have steady income and good credit, people may not even rent to you in the first place. And of course, you don't want to do all this and then have literally 0 money leftover; you want a small buffer for emergencies, etc.\n\n&gt; I make 18\/hour and even though I claim 1 on my taxes, SO much gets taken out.\n\nUse [this calculator from the IRS](http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Individuals\/IRS-Withholding-Calculator) to adjust your withholding and minimize the amount that is taken out of your checks.\n\n&gt; 200\/month car payment\n\nDo you need a car? Regardless, I would lose the car payment ASAP. Sell it, and either walk\/bike\/etc. or buy something cheaper. I assume you also pay car insurance, in which case that expense would also go away\/be reduced by selling\/downgrading your car.\n\n&gt; 280\/month student loan bill\n\nYou can contact your loan servicer and request (it's not guaranteed) that your loans be put in forbearance for a short time, while you pay down your other debts. They will continue to accrue interest, but your monthly payment can be waived for up to a year. Again, not guaranteed, but you can ask.\n\n&gt; 1.3k I have been using for every day things and paying extra on my credit card bills.\n\nIn my experience, *this is the most dangerous category of spending.* If you have $1.3k that just goes \"somewhere\" every month, it's quite literally a black hole. If you ever hope to get out of this mess, you need to know exactly where that money goes. Groceries? Fast food? Gas? Clothes? Impulse purchases? Insurance? Toys for your kid? How much of it actually goes to extra debt payments, and how much goes to other things? **You will never be able to figure out where to cut back if you don't know where you're already spending.**\n\nThere's no shortcut to getting out of debt. It takes planning and discipline, but you can do it. Use a service like Mint.com to track your spending if most of it happens electronically, or save receipts, etc. and track it manually if you use cash. Use this information to make a budget and cut back on expenses; post here if you need help doing so. Begin by saving up $1-2k so you have a small buffer for emergencies and for paying your bills. Then, put any extra money towards the debt with either the highest interest rate (costs less in interest in the long run) OR the lowest balance (psychological benefit to eliminating smaller debts early in the process). That $1.3k\/mo could pay off your BOA credit card, Amazon, and Paypal debts in less than 6 months.","713":"I paid $50 for the shaver, and when it didn't work I returned it and got my $50 back from Amazon.

I know only because I did a little research when planning my card strategy for 2015 and decided not to go with the SallieMae because there are better options for my HPs.

You're paying $900\/month for BoA and will pay it off in 10-12 months (depending on your interest rate).  That $900 would pay off your Amazon card this month, with $400 extra to PayPal.  Then two months later the PayPal card gets paid off.  So basically in three months you can be down to only one card with only one minimum payment.  That frees up additional cash that you can use to build your emergency fund, or you can put the entire amount that you were paying for all three cards towards paying off your BoA.  In either case, paying off those two smaller cards will make you feel much better about your situation.

Everything. I jot it down on my phone and look up the keyword searches a month and what the competition is like. These are smaller sized topics that some of the bigger players don't really feel are worth while, but for someone like me who can benefit greatly with the additional $500 they collectively make, it's worth it.\n\nI mean *everything* dude. A celebrity bought an item from my full time job two years ago and I randomly looked her up in Google. Noticed there wasn't like a solid dot com site with her name. Bought the domain for her because she gets 50,000 searches a month. And she's a high fashion, fancy type of girl to where if I was so inclined to do so, I could build up tons of content about her and start marketing beauty products and clothes on there and probably do really well.\n\nBut that shit is boring to me and actually sitting down to write what amounts to essays about her life and recent gossip is something I can't realistically see myself doing, but I couldn't pass up on the domain in case I did decided to go for it. And who knows I still might.\n\nThe lesson is though that every topic, every idea, every thought, write it down and when you get a chance, research it. See how many searches a month the term and related terms get. \n\nAmazon and other sites have TONS of products on their sites, but there is still room to find one product and build a page around that. One example I had read about early one was some Deer Antler spray that I think is used in fitness or body building. Sure, anyone could log on to Amazon and find it, but a dude made a great one page website marketing it and was able to generate some sales off of that page.","742":"Sadly there is no Amazon or eBay.

Seeing if you spent $500 on coffee over 60 days is rough. And puts things into perspective of, \"omg I could have a cooler car if I didn't have coffee from Starbucks everyday.

Set a goal 2-3 months out, like wanting to reach a certain savings amount. Or a simple step of limiting recurring purchases. One goal is to save 6 months to 1 year for your emergency fund. Emergencies are if one of you lost your job. One good practice is to live off of 1 salary, if you're married of course. Live off one. Save the other via emergency funds, 401k, and something else.

I then went through to see if I could report the seller for a harassment violation and looked at the wording for improper communications, which he\/she certainly fell into that category.  \n\nAmazons rule's change a lot, but reviewing some of them everyday you do something on Amazon will help get those sealed into your head. I never sat down and took it all in at once, I did it piecemeal as needed and made sure I clearly understood things that could get me in trouble.  Nearly everyone here who has issues or in the Amazon forums is because of DUMB shit.  Just incredibly dumb shit.  Selling shoes as new without a box (when the condition guidelines for shoes clearly says you can't), listing games with missing pieces detailed in the condition notes (this ain't fucking Ebay, customers are not only NOT required to review condition notes, but they aren't even easily visible to people who use the app), people not wanting to refund on Amazon...when Amazon requires you refund for any or no reason at all for 30 days.  It literally doesn't matter if they tell you the black guitar they ordered from you was too fucking black.   You're going to return and refund that item or youre just gonna have a bad day.\n\nIve seen you on this sub for a while, I think even longer than me.  I honestly do not feel that someone who does a few hours of homework on the subject should have any major issues.  I think you would do well because you understand proper planning prevents piss poor performance and are someone who asks questions.  I would definitely keep those condition guidelines handy and make sure ANY notices you get form Amazon never occur again.  \n\nTLDR:  A combination of a few hours to get your mouth wet and understand everything, and then a review as needed. (When you list, review listing rules, when you ship review shipping rules, when you go on vacation, review vacation rules)  KEep doing this until you can practically recite it verbatim and only then do you consider NOT reviewing those rules.  \n\nLast, if youre dealing with a customer, no matter how right you think you remember, go back and read it anyway.  You can't afford a mistake on that end of things, and it really pays to be a rules lawyer.   This trait I blame on Magic the Gathering haha =) \n\n","769":"I know someone who did Amazon customer support from home.

The UI they use is a complete clusterfuck.  Can I say that here?  They have parts and widgets everywhere that no longer work but were never removed and overall it is just a half-assed job but my opinion doesn't matter much since they are the publicly traded company and I am just a guy selling stuff on the internet.  There are similar options out there but none seem to have down the process yet.  In case you were wondering, the main point of this software is to push live inventory to multiple channels.  What is happening is companies will sell on 20-50 online  marketplaces like Ebay, Amazon, Wal Mart, NewEgg, ect and when they list 1 new item, they will need to do it for every single site.  Channel Management software is suppose to make it so you can fill in some fields and it pushes that information to all of those sites.  Seems very simple so I am not sure why it has been made so complicated.","783":"Not sure why you are presuming lowest price always wins out with games.  Having a complete system makes a difference.  People notice the low priced listings are missing pieces and will skip those.  \n\nSame reason why bundling commands a higher price on Amazon in the first place.  If you are going to open a case and report anything, do it over the listing pics and description and put in the effort to correct them.  To many listings with horrible pics or someone taking a pic of the item on their bed or the ground with a bunch a random crap thrown in. ","784":"Not immediately.  What should happen is that the buyer notifies the seller of an issue.  Which then gives the opportunity for the seller to fix the issue.  If they do, no A to Z should be opened. At the point in which the seller does not provide service as expected by Amazon an A to Z claim is appropriate.\n\nWhy LET them shoot themselves in the foot?  Amazon asks people to report violators.  The system (Amazon) only works as well as the actors within it.  If I'm doing something wrong, I'd like to know. Part of that great system you described is using that report a violation button.  \n\nGames with no manuals are fine under used.\n\nIf the product details say this listing is for two microphones and a PS3 game, you can't sell just the microphones or just the PS3 game on there and write it in the condition notes.  \n\nThese people are posting on the listing itself saying \"game only no microphone\" or \"'microphone no game\".  You can't sell a monopoly game on Amazon with even one missing hut or hotel.   Your item doesn't exactly match the product in the product details.   You could make a new listing for a monopoly board with one missing piece and sell it that way as long as the product is still able to function as intended.  I.e.  You can't sell a broken item because it's not functional.   ","785":"I base my business plan off the average seller.   Your average seller will pick the condition or shipping speed they are ok with, and then buy the cheapest item.   Is it a blanket rule, of course not.  But you're running statistical averages and short of owning the buy box, it's unlikely you'll get the first sale If you're price isn't the best.   \n\nBuyers are not even required to look at condition notes, nor does it always show if you buy from the buy box or have one click purchasing set up.  This isn't eBay, a thrift shop, or Craigslist.   This is Amazon and there is an expectation that whatever product they buy will be fully functional and don't have to scour some fine print to verify.   That's the Amazon difference.   \n\nI report incorrect listings or people editing a listing to match their missing stuff.   ","786":"I think not only are you doing the right thing but everyone else should know this. If anything you are saving sellers from having bad experiences.

No one has to read them on Amazon.   \n\nBasically just print off those conditions, tape that shit to the sides of the monitor or wall where you work.   Refer to it until you're a wizard.\n\nAlso helps a lot with managing expectations.  Quite a few posts on this sub are from people who got dinged or an A to Z and you find out its condition related or listing and I just want to cry and say God dammit man, didn't ha read the bloody instructions!  (Spoken in scotties voice from Star Trek)","788":"Will you marry me?\n\nKidding.  In all seriousness, I agree with you.  I will also say people who blur the lines like that and list partial sets at a reduced price or fudge on the condition also have the potential to screw over another seller.  I had two cases in one week where I had two returns of something, and when I had Amazon send the items to me, they were not mine.  I could prove it with pictures comparing my labels to theirs, and Amazon, at first, just paid me off.  I told them I was not looking for reimbursement necessarily, but I did want the defects removed for those two orders (even though it didn't really affect my rating), and encouraged them to dig a bit deeper because they had, at best, a lazy warehouse worker, and further, because some other seller was overstating their conditions, it was affecting Amazon's reputation over all as well as mine.\n\nTo answer your question, I don't generally go out of my way to crush my competition, but I am known to be a ruthless bitch when it comes to my biz, so if an opportunity presents itself, I'm gonna rip your guts out, stomp on them, and set them on fire.  I'll report things when I come across them in research, but I won't go specifically looking.  This bitch doesn't have time for that, but cross me, and I'll make time.","789":"No ones going to report you for including MORE, but technically yes, this is an Amazon violation.\n\nOn the example you gave you should review the product details, and fix what's incorrect.   Or at least let Amazon know.   \n\nIt's definitely not okay what's going on your link.   That will also contribute to lower sales due to confusing and contradictory information.   ","790":"That's on Amazon right?\n\nI have no problem with people who do this.  Perhaps I'm just jaded because I report some of the bigger sellers on ebay and nothing comes of it.","791":"How much Amazon do you have and what denominations? ","792":"My biggest thought\/question is are you doing the reporting for everyone or just those people priced lower than you? I don't have a problem if you're reporting everyone, as that's fair (and if you want to be *extremely* fair you could also go through things you aren't selling once in a while), but if you're only spending time reporting those priced lower then that's no longer fair.\n\nThe things I'd keep an eye on would be, try and figure out the ratio of reports to actual actions taken by Amazon. If I was Amazon and I get hundreds of reports for items that seller actually sells, I'm not too sure I'd take the reports that seriously. You could add in items you don't sell to make yourself more neutral to Amazon, as I'd imagine it's like Craigslist where the flagging system is automatic.\n\nAutomated brings me to the point of A-Z claims, I'm not sure about the validity as I haven't personally experienced it, but some people claim too many A-Z claims as a buyer has gotten them banned from Amazon. So be a bit careful there as I can certainly see the possibility of Amazon banning buyers that require more man hours from Amazon staff.\n\nBut at the end of the day at least you're not going the far more unethical routes. There are easier ways to get competitors removed basically on demand and guaranteed but I'm sure there would be absolutely zero debate that it's unethical then.","793":"Yes, Amazon.

It may take longer because of how big Amazon is but I do believe that it will somehow come back to bite you in the ass. ","796":"I did it through the entire list, but when I started, I only did lower priced.  I decided if I was going to do the lower ones I would clean up the entire listing on a matter of principle.  Do my part to help improve amazon and all that.  If every seller spent 5 minutes a day doing that and every buyer too....I digress.\n\n\n\nWhy should fairness come into it at all though?  Is there a valid argument to be made about someone who \"doesn't do enough\" or is it more about making them have to say it's all about the money (most of it is about the money) lol.  \n\nThe primary motivation is DEFINITELY my profit, and I am not pretending otherwise.  \n\nI don't do an A to Z unless the person warrants it.  That's for when the seller is no longer doing what they are required by Amazon.  Meaning if I do get the wrong item, I want them to simply fix it at no cost to myself.  If not, then I have grounds for an A to Z claim and may exercise it.  I would never ever open an A to Z on anyone without first going through them as per Amazon policy regarding A to Z claims.  \n\nI dont consider this unethical at all.  Its no different then going into Wal-Mart and expecting the 6$ item you buy to have all of the items because that's the expectation you have.  It's identical with Amazon.  I don't see this as much of an unethical quandary as a mental one unto each person.\n\nIm definitely curious about whether Amazon tracks people who file A to Z claims and punishes them, or punishes them for INVALID A to Z claims as that would be a big difference.  This is an obvious, and potentially business ending thing.  However, would they ban a seller account for doing this, the buyer account, both, or just the one you report it on?  Interesting.\n\nThere's really no easier way on a platform like Amazon to remove competition than rules lawyer initially. You can beat their price but buy box might go to them.  If they are gone, they are gone :P What if THEY had buy box? :P\n\nThanks for the response, I liked this one a lot.  INteresting things to think about. \n\n","797":"Sourcing aside because that's an equal time spent no matter what you do after sourcing.  Here's the math.  \n\nYou can scan (with your eyeball) a page of 5 listings for these errors in about 5 seconds (one per) , so 10 pages takes a minute or two at most.  I have the report a violation section bookmarked so in two clicks I have the violation part open.  I have to copy the asin, and the user name which takes about 10-20 seconds.\n\nThen I have to type a short post explaining what the issue is.  This can be copied and pasted as the only editing will be whether they ignored the game, the accessory, or something else.  The rest stays the same, so future ones are faster.\n\n13 people reported at a total cost of under 1 minute as described above is 13 minutes and I said under half an hour.   Even if we double the time it takes to report and review a listing its' still under 30 minutes.   I'm not typically prone to exaggeration for effect when the truth works.  If someone can't type fast, this may suck for them.  If someone has an incredibly terrible internet or computer, this might not work for them.  I live in chicago, I type over 100 wpm, and I have a gaming computer and 110mb data.  It works fine for me, but everyone elses mileage may vary.   \n\nIve spent more time responding to posts in this thread than I took cleaning up this entire listing with 10 pages currently on it.  as random trivia.  \n\nIf it comes  in the ass, I will absolutely make a post about it haha =)  Im simply not afraid to fight for things that I should be able to expect.  I don't back down, unless I am at fault even a little.  Then I will bend over backwards and go above and beyond.  \n\nIve never heard of anyone being banned for winning too many cases on Amazon or reporting someone for legitimate violations but I suppose it could happen in extreme cases.  (I assume extreme, because there's not much proven evidence on this subject at all.)  I hope that you are wrong mostly because it would be unprofitable.  I'm just not a guy who runs risks on potential outliers :P\n\nThanks a ton for the response and thoughts on the subject.","798":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

That does get on an entirely different topic than Amazon though. All things aside, fairness, unethical, etc. It's really all opinion that can be argued back and forth until the end of time. I dunno but on one hand I like these type of discussions but on the other hand I go \"what's the point exactly?\" The chance of either one of us, or anyone in this thread, changing the mind of another person is slim.\n\nAs far as I've researched Amazon bases the A-Z numbers on claims made, valid or not, but things may have changed in the last year. If they ban just the seller\/buyer\/both I think depends if the information matches, if they can't link your seller and buyer accounts then the chance of both getting banned is pretty slim. I have heard they do ban the buyer shipping address though, which could be a pretty large problem if you still want to buy from Amazon and your home address got banned; you also couldn't use your home as a return address for selling anymore. There's also been talk that Amazon goes as far as checking and banning MAC addresses which is probably the reason why an Amazon ghost or stealth account is a lot harder to make.\n\nThen this part I've been debating posting as it's available information on internet forums but I'm not exactly proud to be in the group of people that have used this tactic. If you want to remove competitors on demand all you got to do is make another Amazon account (use a different IP, user account [for flash cookies and such], address, etc.), set up the account with a debit\/credit card that has about $5 on it and won't allow overdrafts, at that point all you do is order the available qty of your competitors. Amazon will pull their listings as they've been \"sold\" and retry the payment a few times, it's going to fail, but the competitor stock is pulled from Amazon for at least a day and up to a week or so. When it comes back, repeat the process. Once in a great while you'll get a seller that notices what you're doing and posts an available qty of like 1,000 units (you can only add 99 to your cart at a time and then have to go back and click again) to slow you down. But basically if you know Amazon sells 5-10 units a day of that item, you can be the exclusive seller for at least a day. Now is this unethical? Well, some people would say it's just business... I sure as hell used that excuse when I did it, these days I would say that yes it's an unethical way to do business.","800":"Amazon","801":"Have you tried shipstation? http:\/\/www.shipstation.com They list Amazon and etsy on their website.","802":"My Forward is one of my staples.

I use this size bubble mailer because it's big enough for even slightly larger books and because I bubblewrap the books inside the bubble mailer for added protection if they cost over $15 (which most of them do). As far as labels go you don't actually need a label printer (unless you're doing FBA on items without a visible barcode) but you do need a printer. You're going to be buying your postage online and printing it out (it's cheaper than the post office online especially because you 100% positively need to buy tracking on any order over like $5 to protect yourself and it costs .30c online or $1 at the post office). You can do this right on plain white paper and tape it to the mailer\/box but I've found it easier to buy label sticker paper (same seller as the bubble mailers sells it) and just print on that.\n\nIf you do buy off eBay I would definitely recommend using the seller from the mailers I linked. I just ordered them this week and despite offering free shipping they still sent them priority mail 2-day which probably cost half as much as the mailers.

[Lodge](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lodge-Color-EC6D33-Enameled-6-Quart\/dp\/B000N4WN08) has a good one for $70 on Amazon, but I've seen them at Fred Meyers for $50.

It's worth looking at the earlier books of popular authors because first editions can be valuable in some instances. In lots you're talking like .50c-$1 per paperback or a $1-2 for hardbacks maximum for most popular fiction. And generally that includes free shipping which isn't too bad with media mail but can get up there with a giant lot of heavy books.\n\nThe only way to make actual money selling popular fiction is to bulk sell on Amazon massive amounts of books at .01 each and take your profit in the difference between the shipping cost and the shipping imbursement they give you (I make like 40c-1 on every book I ship with Amazon outside of the cost but I'm not a bulk seller and I don't get a bulk shipping discount and I use bubble mailers so I could be making another .30 a book just by using cheap poly mailers).","818":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Those fees are just a cost you need to factor in before you think of buying an item to flip and  just get over it. What you get for those fees is pretty substantial; a worldwide audience that can go from wanting your item to purchasing it in very little time. Think of some obscure item that you may want to sell , you could post it on Craigslist, but that shrinks the amount of potential buyers significantly. The other thing with Craigslist is that from the buyers perspective, most of the time they are just browsing and when something catches their eye, they then begin the purchasing decision process. With ebay or Amazon, most buyers already know what they want to buy and those sites make it easy for them to get that item delivered to their front door. To me, the fees are totally worth it, because I would never of made the amount of money I have made from selling on eBay if instead I had to sell these items on my own through Craigslist or on the street corner. \n\nAlso, the selling process on ebay is so streamlined and convenient. Some days when I have to send out 20 orders to different people, I can't imagine the time and effort it would take to do that by meeting 20 different people on the same day.
