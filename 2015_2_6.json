As always, please comment here before PMing. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: closed","6":"In November I decided to launch a business attempting to do everything differently than my first business venture.\n\nNumber 1 on my list was to build an e-commerce website that did not compete on price. My primary business and (almost) sole source income is from a business called [Le Creme](http:\/\/lecreme.com.au). It specialises in the provision of Pro Audio equipment &amp; services for events and the sale of new pro audio equipment. I've found it to be a stupidly competitive industry with people advertising and selling new equipment for as little as 5-10% margin -some of these relying purely on a settlement discount for their margin. \n\nThe live production side isn't a whole lot different in Australia. Most events have a reasonable amount of money however there's a lot of newcomers using inherited money or property equity to take out a $250k bank loan for a new PA system simply to rent it out for 1% of the purchase cost meaning it would need to take a minimum of 100 hires to pay off. No way am I spending my life with coked up promoters, the odd ego driven performers and drunk\/drugged up patrons for such a small amount of money. Yes I love my job but I also need to retire some day. I've started from a small family loan and build from the ground up.\n\nNumber 2 is to offer something to a broader market, and hopefully more normal people. Customers buying audio gear can have unrealistic expectations on delivery times, service for such a low margin item and expect that everything listed online is in stock (not possible, just look at the site and see a few of the big ticket items there, there's not a lot on that website for under $200). \n\nNumber 3 was to build a brand, something a little like Virgin that's a slightly controversial name with a personality behind it. I also wanted to build a brand similar to Apple where people will pay stupid amounts of money simply so they can have that badge. Yes I understand this means selling a quality product &amp; offering great support. If the margin is there you can offer great support.\n\n\nMy result: [Fat Boy Food](http:\/\/fatboyfood.com.au)\n\nI sell junk food, with most products being well ABOVE the RRP because I offer something slightly different but marketed in a way that is unlike anyone else.\n\nBeing Unique:\nI've tried to make it an openly unhealthy food related website as I've found the majority of places around focus on healthy foods. I do not believe that if people were honestly concerned about their health they would still eat from fast food chains or purchase the vast amounts of shit available at supermarkets. All you need to do is look in an overweight family's shopping trolley. (yes some try to lose weight &amp; increase fitness and do an amazing job, but for the most part people just don't try).\n\nNot competing on price:\nI do not compete on price at all, in fact most of these items you could buy larger amounts of smaller volumes for a cheaper price. You can easily buy 3kg of Nutella from the supermarket (in 500g jars) for under $49 and not have to pay for delivery on top. However they won't give it to you in a large 3kg jar, with a pretty tax invoice, pretty emails, amuse you on twitface, slutsof in stagram, pintrest or really give a shit if you call them up and tell them you smashed a jar on the way home. Instead they'll barrage you with the worst TV commercials, half dead 'fresh' produce, high petrol prices that you need to bring in their supermarket receipt to receive it at the same price as a normal servo, stupid rewards programs that clutter up your wallet\/phone with useless cards and then make you serve yourself at the checkout or wait in a line 6+ people long! \/rantover\n\nBuilding a brand name:\nFat Boy food is a unique brand name, it's offensive to some and I'm ok with that -You should be secure in yourself, you are who you are and shouldn't find your self confidence in other people's opinions.\nI want my name to be associated with being unique, having a personality but showing care &amp; service where it matters. I've already had a few customers state they've received broken goods (mainly cracked nutella jars). I ask them for a photo, once received I send them out a new one and tell them to eat the old one before it spoils.\n\nI once supplied audio for a conference where John Borghetti spoke (CEO of Virgin Australia). One of the key things he made clear is how vital customer satisfaction is. Now you get stupidly painful customers on a regular basis in retail and I get that, but as I've learnt from Le Creme they're the ones that will scream the loudest. 99.99% of people that have a pleasant interaction with your brand\/company won't say a good word at all, but 100% of people that have a bad experience will kick and scream like a 5 year old girl when she doesn't get her own damn pony.\n\nJohn told the story of several experiences with customers, one I only vaguely recall now. In short he ended up telling the staff to do whatever it takes to make the customer happy 'give them a bottle of xyz for all I care, just don't let them leave the airport upset with us'. That was a big thing for me, you can expect to make a loss off some customers because they're so incredibly difficult but they can turn around to 10 friends and tell of their bad experience turned amazing. At Le Creme I've had a few customers where I've been in a position  that I've been forced to refund their money (happy to refund) due to supply issues and still have to send them promo stuff just so they will stop stop leaving bad reviews everywhere.\n\nHis main point was that if the situation is not the customers fault and it's turned bad you can win a customer for life if you handle it right and satisfy their needs. \n\nAmazon also have this right, you need only complain and they'll sort out a resolution as quickly as possible. With the last problem they've had with me I'm not convinced I'm even a profitable customer but at least they don't have mean slamming their reputation.\n\nBuilding a brand name comes down to a few easy things: Post purchase service, Brand personality and being unique. I'm not even convinced you need a quality product to build a reputable brand, simply offer the support required.\n\nYour staff (if you have them yet) are the face of your company, they also represent your brand and make your name. You need to make sure they are happy and take pride in what they do. Borghetti addressed this with a lot of his Pilots and as a result they work with pride. I like to keep my guys the same way.\n\n\nAnyway have a look at [Fat Boy Food](http:\/\/fatboyfood.com.au) and tell me if there's anything else I've missed or if I can do better. The results of the business are better than I had expected as a side project but I'm convinced it can do better. Bring on the feedback!\n\n*edit, yes i know the mobile website isn't too crash hot, please visit the desktop one. It's on the to do list.","7":"iTunes Giftcard valued at $10 per card, looking to trade for Amazon giftcards valued at $10 per card. No limit to quantities.

In february I expect to take home at least 1 200\u20ac. I work a couple nights a week in a pub and teach some school children Maths on the side for some extra cash. This is the situation since October 2014, before that I basically lived paycheck to paycheck and had to pay overdraft fees a number of times.\n\nI have **1200 \u20ac in my savings** account (opened in oct 2014) and about **600 \u20ac in my checking** account. I don't own a car or any other valuable earthly possessions, I don't get money from my family or Baf\u00f6g (from the state), I have no debt.\n\n**On average**, this is where my money goes:\n\nRoof over head..................270 (including electricity, internet, etc)\n\nHealth insurance..................80\n\nGroceries..........................200\n\nEating and drinking out........100\n\nHygiene &amp; Cosmetics...........100 (includes haircuts etc)\n\nHousehold...........................50\n\nOther costs........................100  (the occasional pair of jeans, gifts for other people, semester taxes every 6 months, Hobby expenses)\n\n**TOTAL**.............................**900**\n\nI am doing a Frugal February (little to no eating out, no unnecessary purchases, no huge cosmetic hauls) so I will be able to have more money than usual at the end of the month.\n\n**The reason I'm here:**\n\nI haven't been to the dentist in a long time, so as soon as I got the job in october it was one of my top priorities to get my teeth fixed, in order to prevent more costs (and pain) in the future. There are some things that absolutely need to be done, some are covered completely by the insurance (wisdom teeth removal), for others (Wurzelbehandlung) I have to pay as well. The treatment has already started.\n\nThere will be two bills, one for **400\u20ac** and another one for **1100\u20ac**. The 400\u20ac I will most likely have to pay in February, the 1100\u20ac probably in March. But it doesn't end there, on top of that I will need two crowns (500-600\u20ac each) and I would like to get a professional cleaning and maybe even go to an Orthodontist to see if I can get a retainer. This will be stretched out over months and months but overall 2015 is the year of the tooth for me.\n\nI have an Amazon VISA card that I use for every day shopping (to get reward points) and so far I pay the monthly bill in full. I would be able to get a credit with it up to 2000\u20ac, but the tax is 14,98% p.a. (effective). I got it because it required practically no proof of income and because my bank account only comes with an ec-card so I can't pay everywhere with it. My checking account doesn't allow a credit and I have no other accounts or credit cards. I don't know if I am able to get a \"real\" VISA card from a bank, I've never tried but I'm guessing they aren't that open to throwing money at student pub waitresses. I have friends that would lend me money if I needed it, but I really don't want to go there.\n\nSo my question is, what should my strategy be? If you need any other details, I'm happy to answer. \n\nEDIT: I can't spell.

I know this is terrible and I wanted to know how it could go up. I've never missed a single payment - ever. I have a plan to pay off all my smaller balance cards by May and have all cards paid off by August. Once my cards are all paid off I'll either pay almost 4x my minimum car payment (220\/month) and have it paid off by October 2016 (3 years early) or pay my minimum and throw all my extra money into a savings account. With school getting slightly more rigorous I don't go out hardly anymore, all my income goes to debt for the most part. I recently made the mistake of jumping the gun and going to a few car dealerships and seeing what they could do for me, resulting in 17 inquiries on my credit report including credit card apps, I'd assume. I only went to 3 dealerships. Luckily my tuition is paid for a little bit past my Master's so I don't have to pay for anything once I get my debt paid off. \n\nI want to know what my credit score may look like once I get everything paid off, granted I don't apply for anymore loans. I've already locked up all credit cards except for one I have on me only for emergencies (which only has the annual fee's balance on it so far - and I've had it for a month which makes me insanely proud). My goal is to graduate with my master's and attend medical school which I will without a doubt need to pull out loans for.\n\nTldr; 3.3k credit card debt, once paid off in August what should my credit score look like (670 now)? Regarding car payments, will it help to pay off early or is showing a steady payment of interest a better sign to credit bureaus? Will any of this affect possible school loans in the future?","60":"I just want to convert the last of my PayPal into Amazon.","61":"[H] $15 iTunes.

I felt so foolish when I calculated that I had spent over $240.00 for a modem that cost $30.00. Look up your modem on the internet and buy it from a reputable website. When it arrives call your ISP and tell them that you would like to activate the new modem. They will walk you through the process. After your new modem is set up return the old one, and save that equipment fee each month.\n\nInternet Speed\n\n \n\nCut the Cord.\n\n$9.94\/week, $39.77\/month, or $477.24\/year\n\nCut the cable cord and don\u2019t look back. According to the FCC the average family spends over $64.00\/month for expanded basic cable (See DA 14-672 for more details). That totals $776.00 on TV each year. You could be radical and throw out the TV, but who are we kidding we love our TVs. Instead of sending insane amounts of money to a cable provider go with on-demand streaming services like Netflix (7.99\/month), Hulu Plus (7.99\/month), or Amazon Prime ($99.00\/year or $8.25\/month). Each streaming service has their strengths. Netflix is the go to for older TV series and movies. Though in the last 18-24 months Netflix has added a lot newer content and some really good original shows. Hulu Plus is the king of day old content. If you like what\u2019s on TV today and don\u2019t want to miss out then you need to include Hulu Plus. Amazon Prime is the mid ground between the two. It has a good selection of movies and an up to date cross section of TV shows including many from cable networks. The drawback to prime viewing is not all the content is free. You pay for prime and get the privilege of paying again for some streaming content. It does have it\u2019s upside if you like shopping online, though. Amazon Prime members get discounts and access to free shipping where non prime accounts have to pay. Six of one a half dozen of the other. If you dumped cable and got all three of these services you would save over $470\/year. It\u2019s amazing what a pair of scissors can do. For more about how to cut the cord and save see our article [\u201cCut the Cord: How we Saved Over $1,300.00\u201d](http:\/\/www.ourdebt.net\/cut-cord-saved-1300-00\/)\n\n\n \n\nMake your own coffee.\n\n12.50\/week, $50.00\/month, or $600.00\/year\n\nThis one is a simple change, but you can save big time. If you are an avid coffee drinker you know that the cost can add up. Starbucks recently raised its prices on coffee, and you\u2019re probably feeling it in your wallet. The actual savings depend on what you drink, but if you replaced your habit of stopping at Starbucks on the way to work you would save an average of 2.50\/12oz. cup or $12.50 a week. It\u2019s time to pull out that coffee pot manual and learn how to set that brew timer.\n\nMake your coffee at home and save big\n\n \n\nTake your lunch to work.\n\n$18.75\/week, $75\/month, or $900\/year\n\nFast food kills more than just your arteries, it is a wealth assassin. According to the dailyfinance.com article \u201cDo Fast Food Retailers Really Offer Value Meals?\u201d , the average fast food meal cost between $5.00 and $7.00 dollars whereas the average home made meal cost between $1.50 and $3.00. If you eat out daily during the workweek you are spending around $30.00 a week on food or $1,560.00 a year. If you were to take your food to work every day you would save $18.75\/week or around $900\/year. The easiest way to do this is to make a little extra at dinner time. Once dinner is over you put the leftovers in a Tupperware container (glass is awesome) and stick it in the fridge. Then when you get up in the morning you have your lunch. Bam! $900.00 savings in your pocket each year.\n\nTake your lunch to work\n\n \n\nLine dry your clothes vs. Laundromat.\n\n$10.50\/week, $42.00\/month, or $504.00\/year\n\nNot everyone has a washer and dryer in their home. If you are members of the apartment dwelling community then this one is for you. In some areas the average cost of washing and drying at a laundromat is $1.50 for each cycle. If you are a small family epa.gov estimates you wash 400 loads of laundry each year. at $3.00 a load. That is $1,200.00 in laundry each year or 120 rolls of quarters. If you have a balcony or a bathroom you can save some money by setting up a clothesline. Yes, it might be a return to the old days, but if you were able to cut just the dryer out of the equation you would save $1.50 each load. in a weeks time that would total $10.50 a week. Over the course of the year you would net over $500 in savings. Maybe Grandma was onto something?\n\nLine dry your cloths\n\n \n\nDrink Water instead of Soda.\n\n$8.61\/week $34.44\/month or $413.28\/year\n\nCoca Cola, Pepsi, Sprite, Dr. Pepper; whatever your habit, this one is killing your wallet slowly. If you are the person that has a soda everyday the numbers are adding up. If you average all the numbers in the weightloss.about.com article titled, \u201cThe Anual Cost of Your Daily Soda Habit\u201d, the average soda cost is around $1.25. If you drink one a day you rack up over $8.00 in soda each week. The damage to your wallet is over $400.00 per year. Health concerns aside, soda is killing our bank accounts. So switch to water and save big time.\n\nStay away from soda\n\n \n\nWhat do you do with all the extra cash?\n\nYou probably have a reason for cutting all the fat out of your budget, but consider the following: if you add up all of the savings we have talked about here they total about $58.05\/week, $232.20\/month, or  $2,786.40\/year.  Say you were to take the monthly amount and invest it in a good growth stock mutual fund averaging 12% annually from its inception every month for 5 years, then stopped and didn\u2019t touch the fund for 35 years (assuming you are 30 today and retiring at 65).   In the end you would have saved $606,238.07 when you went to cash it in. Do the math for yourself at DaveRamsey.com. If you were to extend the amount that you paid into the fund from 5 years to 12 years you would have over $1 million dollars in savings by retirement. Not to bad for giving up Soda, Coffee, Fast Food, Cable, and needless internet speed.\n\nFor more ideas check out our site [OurDebt.net](http:\/\/www.ourdebt.net\/debt-talk-blog\/)","78":"Looking to amass some Amazon credit.

I've found that 40% of my views have come from countries outside of the US so it seems like a necessary thing to do.

Amazon ruled in their favor last night and issued a refund.\n\nThe status still shows DELIVERED at the point of acceptance, so I called my local post office this morning, and they were able to give me the full tracking over the phone.  They advised me that the package was delivered at 1:58 yesterday afternoon at the customer's address.  They advised they can either email me a copy of the report or I can come in and get a physical copy.\n\nAmazon Seller Support advised me that I just need to send the information in to have the ruling reversed.\n\nMy guess is the buyer received their package yesterday, saw the tracking information was not updated, saw an opportunity to get a refund and a free item.\n\nTL,DR: If USPS scans your item as Delivered instead of Accepted, the status is NEVER updated.  It will show as DELIVERED at point of origin and not update.

I\u2019ve used it to add almost 200 games to my Steam account. After celebrating by cashing some in for a copy of Shovel Knight, I decided I should write a guide so other people could benefit like I have. \n\nIn the six months I\u2019ve been using Tremor Games to earn Steam games, I\u2019ve learned quite a bit about what earning methods work well, so what follows is the sum total of my experience.

Like a lot of sites out there, Tremor hosts flash games that you can play in your browser. The big draw to Tremor is that you can earn coins from playing, which can be cashed in for a lot of different things: \n\n* Steam games (lots of them very cheap)\n\n* Items for TF2, Dota 2, CSGO, League of Legends, and Steam Trading Cards\n\n* Bitcoins\n\n* Gift cards for Steam, Amazon, World of Warcraft, PSN, Xbox, and more (even Reddit Gold)\n\nThere\u2019s more, but those are the most interesting. They seem to do pretty well at listening to what the user base wants. If there\u2019s a game you want, post in the proper forum thread and you will most likely see it show up when it goes on sale. Listening to the community is also how CSGO, Dota 2, and Steam Trading Cards got added to the site. They also buy large quantities of bundles from various sources, so that\u2019s a good way to get some cheap games as well. The conversion rate is $1 : 900 Tremor coins. If the game is in a bundle, the price gets divided by the number of games, so many times you will see games in the very affordable 195-395 coin range. So in essense, you're getting Steam games for $.20-.50 each.\n\n*EARNING COINS*\n\n\n* Daily Login\n\nEvery day you visit the site, you earn. When you start out, it\u2019s 1 coin, but I\u2019m currently at 4 per day. Not much, but over time, it accumulates. We\u2019re on \/r\/BeerMoney because we play the patient game.\n\n* Game Achievements\n\nI started out on Tremor the same way most people do: playing flash games to earn coins. If you like playing flash games, why not get a little bonus as well? If your primary goal is to cash in coins though, this is not a very efficient way to do it. Games that offer achievements can earn you something like 50 coins for full completion. While games load, you can choose to watch ads for 1-8 coins each. I usually load these when I\u2019m doing something else and then check back later. I\u2019ve made maybe 500 coins from game achievements and probably around the same from videos.\n\n* Trade In Items\n\nAny of the Steam game items you can buy from Tremor are also available to trade in for coins. I sometimes do this with unwanted TF2 weapons that I get from drops. Tremor has bots that you trade with and will credit your account with coins. It\u2019s pretty easy to do, but they only accept a limited stock. You also have a daily limit to how many coins you can earn this way. It\u2019s based on how old your Tremor account is and how much you've traded in the past. My current TF2 limit is 8000, which I've never come close to. For Steam Trading Cards, they limit the number of cards you can trade rather than the number of coins you can earn. I\u2019ve made maybe 2000 coins through trading.\n\n* High Paying Offers\n\nIf you understand how Sandboxie or similar programs work, you can download and run various programs through a number of affiliates. Warning though, if you don\u2019t use a sandbox program when running these, you are basically installing adware and other crap on your system. These pay 200-500 coins each, but I estimate that I only have a 30% payout rate at best. The possible earnings are high, but you\u2019re messing with installing and running garbage programs and might not get paid for it. The ones I\u2019ve received coins for doing are OfferToro, Matomy, and AdworkMedia. New affiliates get added from time to time, so I still check these out every few weeks. This method has earned me maybe 5000 coins.\n\n* Tasks: The Big Earner\n\nUnder the menu option \"Complete Micro Online Tasks\" (also found under High Paying Offers as \u201cTasks\u201d) you can do various search engine tasks through an affiliate called CrowdFlower. You have to create an account with them, but it is well worth it. It is basically a similar service to mTurk through Amazon.\n\nThe Tasks I\u2019ve done the most earn you 48 coins each (57 if you do them on a cell phone) and take less than 1 minute . After doing a bunch, you\u2019ll get the hang of it and can really cut down the time it takes you. You basically search a specific phrase on Google (and sometimes Bing, where you can earn a bit for your Bing Rewards), click on the correct result, and let the timer run down while you answer a few questions about the site. Some require you to have a CrowdFlower extension installed in Chrome to automate some of the process, but I\u2019ve used it for months with no issues.\n\nSome Tasks require you to do samples to prove that you know what you\u2019re doing and if your percentage of correctly performed samples is high enough, you can do the real work. If your overall quiz accuracy is at least 70%, other CrowdFlower tasks become available. So the quizzes are worth doing. Some of them can earn you 150 coins per Task and allow you to do 10 or more Tasks, so that\u2019s 1500 coins for some easy work. External surveys are also available sometimes. They typically pay 90-160 coins, but I recently did one for 960 that took just as little time as the others. \n\nTasks are the big earner on Tremor Games. Of my 90000 earned coins, 80000 probably came from Tasks. The first task you complete each day also earns you a 5 coin bonus.\n\n*CASHING OUT*\n\n\nHere\u2019s where the above pays off. Tremor Rewards on the menu bar will take you where you want to go. It\u2019s a little tricky to navigate since there\u2019s so much available, but you can narrow it down by category and there are some sort options. When you find what you want, it\u2019s basically 3 clicks to reserve a copy. Make sure it says Steam Game after the title if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wanting, as they do sell Desura and Origin games as well. If it\u2019s a game, they will PM you a key or send a gift copy to your Steam account. Approval can take up to 48 hours, but I\u2019ve only ever waited more than a day if it\u2019s over the weekend. If you are buying a game item, they have various bots which will trade you. Instructions for these are found under the \u201cPurchase\u201d button for the item. It\u2019s all pretty straight forward and smooth. Then you just enjoy your earnings!\n\n\n*CONCLUSION*\n\n\n\nWith a bit of daily downtime or while watching TV, doing a handful of Tasks will earn you a great deal of coins; far more than playing flash games. It will be feast and famine. Some days, you might do a few simple tasks and earn 150 and some days you might do one survey for 1000. You have to decide if the time commitment is worth it for you, but Tremor Games has added $1800 value to my Steam account. A great number of the games I\u2019ve earned also came with Steam Trading Cards, which I sell on the Steam Market. I haven\u2019t really tracked this too closely, but let\u2019s say I earn $.30 per game and 150 of the games I\u2019ve bought from Tremor (my best guess) come with cards, that\u2019s another $45 in my Steam wallet on top of the Tremor coins.\n\nThis was a lot to cover, so if anything is unclear or if you have questions about anything, please comment and I\u2019ll try to get to everyone. Once again, I would really appreciate it if you use my [referral link](http:\/\/www.tremorgames.com\/?ref=740783), but no hard feelings if you don\u2019t. Either way, add me as a friend on Tremor. You can earn coins for that too! Good luck everyone and happy earning!","127":"As it says people.  I need some Amazon credit and I'm actively looking to purchase.

He has access to a few drop shippers through his day job, so it was kind of a no brainer. \n\nSales have been decent, but we feel it's time to move on to doing some FBA. My question is as follows: When looking for items to send to FBA, should I look for items where no one else is already sending to FBA so that I can be the only one, or is that somehow an indication that this might not be a good item for FBA, and I should rather be looking for items where other sellers are already doing FBA? I know this question is a bit vague, but we're dealing with over 10,000 skus (mostly in the Tools and Hardware categories), most of which we're not intimately familiar with. I plan on scraping all of the items we sell on Amazon to generate a report of all items where we're either cheapest, or close enough to the cheapest, and then decide based on that. Problem is, unlike when drop shipping where you just purchase as you sell, here we need to front the money to send to FBA, so I'm just looking for some guidance.

This can hurt you so much in the long run. There are often products that cost half the price of their expensive counterparts but last less than half as long.  \nHere are some things I've purchased and why:  \nArmytek Wizard headlamp w\/ 18650 Lithium-Ion Batteries - ~$115 total, for someone who works outside non-stop in an area of the country that isn't know for too many hours of sunlight, this has been my best investment so far. Armytek flashlights are 10-year warrantied lights and waterproof and drop-proof. Yes, I can drop it, break it, and send it back within 10 years of purchases. This saves me from buying a $10 flashlight with batteries per year because I lose them. Also, as you'd expect it can outperform almost any light on the market. It's a headlamp and detachable to be used standalone. I can work on a car at night and never know it.  \nDouble Edge Razor - \/r\/wicked_edge Double Edge Razor on Amazon is about $30 and a Maggards razor is even cheaper. It may seem like a lot for just the handle of a razor, but you can buy 100 blades for anywhere from $13-16 on the cheap. I use them twice each, I bet a 100 pack could last me almost a year. Compare that to about $25 for 3 cartridges. That money adds up FAST. It's a great durable product to invest in that will last a lifetime.  \n1970s Cerwin Vega Stereo Speakers - I use them in my living room. I bought them used for $60 on craigslist. They DO NOT make speakers like they used to. I'd stack these next to any $3-400 pair of stereo speakers any day of the week. They'll blow anything away (I like loud music), they do sound awesome also. I'll never buy another pair in my lifetime and they were only $60.  \nMy wife and I also use Amazon all the time. Don't overlook how valuable it is to have feedback on an item. If it costs an extra $1-2 but you can be assured it will perform as you want it to, it can save you the cost of buying a lesser quality item from a big-box store. I swear we don't go to Walmart or Lowes anymore. We buy food, that's it.  \nSometimes though, it's best to buy the cheaper products. I just bought a leather money-clip wallet for $8 on Amazon, it's a wallet, it won't last that long anyway and upon inspection it's great quality (I was assured of this by the reviews also).  \nSome mistakes I've made? Workboots...I'm still figuring it out. I wear them almost all the time and happen to be extremely hard on them for some reason. I usually buy in the $125-150 range. I've spent about $600 in the last 4 years. Yes, it is part of my living, but I buy these work boots made overseas with less than average quality materials and they don't stand the test of time. Would it be that crazy to spend $3-400 on a pair of boots that will be more comfortable and last 2-3x that of the $150 pair? Maybe, maybe-not I do not know the answer to that.  \nAlso, to go along with this, cloths and footwear in general, sometimes it pays to buy the more expensive, but more durable items. This holds true for many daily use items. You can throw a lot of money out the window before you know it, like I did for workboots without noticing until after.  \nKitchen Knives? I have 2 Victorinox knives, chef and straight, and I have a sharpening stone. I got them for a gift and they can be a little price, but I should never need another set of knives for cooking in my life, and I can guarantee they're sharper than any run of the mill kitchen knife.  \nI've made quite a few purchases that should last years and years but costed me more up-front.  \nHopefully someone can use this advice and benefit from it and gain some experience with purchasing products more efficiently.

This is *YOUR* chance to let your voice be heard. Got a great idea? Let us know. Hate our rules? Let us know. We're looking for feedback and suggestions on everything from the sidebar, to automod, to rules etc. To start here are some talking points we specifically want feedback on:\n\n\n#1\\. GCX Rep proposal\n\nUsers must post an actual dollar amount on their confirmed trades. Instead of just saying \"Amazon vs Paypal\", we will require \"$50 Amazon for paypal\" or \"Amazon for $25 paypal\". The idea behind this is to make it easier to spot users who are doing a large number of small trades, then 'cashing in' that rep to scam someone of a large amount.\n\n---\n\n#2\\. FAQ\n\nWe think that the FAQ is a bit lacking. We want to improve it some in hopes that we can help serve our community, especially our new users even better.\n\n---\n\n#3\\. Amazon Balance Trading and \"Flipping\"\n\nWe know that GCX's free market is one of its best features, and we want to preserve that as much as possible. Over the past few months, we've gotten quite a few complaints about people buying Amazon on GCX just to sell it at a higher rate as balance. This makes good business sense, but if some people (\"power traders\") are systematically buying lots of Amazon gift cards just to redeem them to their accounts and sell for a profit (flipping), this actually hurts the free market, and gives non-power traders less of a chance to use this subreddit as it was meant for. \"Flipping\" is a pattern. If someone does it once, no big deal. Just like most things here, we're looking for the obvious intentions. \n\nSo, we're proposing that ALL Amazon balance trading needs mod approval, regardless of flair level, and if people are acquiring Amazon gift cards from GCX with no intentions of actually using them on Amazon, they won't be allowed to trade their balance.\n\nHere's our thought process:\n\n* Want to trade your Amazon balance for another gift card because something you want went on sale elsewhere? Fine. Show us the item that you want to buy at another store, and you'll be allowed to trade a certain amount of your balance. We will specify that amount in our comment on your post.\n\n* Want to trade your balance back for cash? We're probably not going to let you, especially if you bought it on GCX or got it as a gift or something (like everything we do, this will be evaluated on a case-by-case, but that's the general plan). If you got it from Amazon Mechanical Turk or something, that's another story, and we'll probably let you.\n\nThe original intention with requiring mod approval for trading Amazon balance was to make sure it was acquired legitimately and not through scams. That still stands, but we also want to preserve the free market element for the community as a whole.\n\nThis would be something we phase in as a rule, since we don't want to screw over anyone who was previously buying a lot of Amazon just to get rid of it when it wasn't a rule (even though having a ton of money on your Amazon account isn't exactly the worst thing ever). This is just a proposal, so give feedback please!\n\n---\n\n#4\\. Requiring Mod Verification for Trades Involving $100+ in gift cards\n\nScammers target high value trades. Sometimes, people who had not previously scammed even \"go rogue\" and cash in their rep for high value trades. So, we would require people to go through a verification process with us before posting for that high of a value in gift cards. We would only be verifying gift cards, not cash (mostly), and the process would be very similar to getting approval to trade Amazon balance. There are very few high value trades like that, but a very high percentage of scams happen in this high value range. We just want to cut back on scamming.\n\nThis is just a proposal, so give feedback please!\n\n#5\\. No more prepaid credit cards in cash\/crypto only trades\n\nSimply put, as discussed in **[this previous mod post](http:\/\/redd.it\/2opxee)** and made official in **[this post shortly thereafter](http:\/\/redd.it\/2ox0d8)**, prepaid credit cards, PayPal MyCash cards, etc. will be considered as cash, and cannot be traded in exchange for other cash items. You need a gift card involved in a trade. We just don't want any form of money laundering to be able to happen here.\n\n---\n\n\n----\n\nThese are some secondary things that we're *always* looking for feedback on:\n\n\n#6\\. Security\n\nWe're always looking for ways to provide a safer environment for our users. We'd like to hear your suggestions, but keep in mind that the scammers are almost certainly reading this too. If it's something that needs to be shared privately, simply message the modmail. \n\n#7\\. Sidebar\/Safe trading guides\n\nWe want feedback on those. Do you think the rules and safe trading guides are visible enough? What could we do better?\n\n-----\n\nSo let us know in the comments below, things you'd like to see, things you like, things we could be doing better. We look forward to your feedback and as always, *trade safely!*\n\n\n---\n\n[Link to previous PSA: Free Background Checks](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/giftcardexchange\/comments\/2qlik8\/psa_free_background_checks\/)\n\nWant to keep your feedback private?

Some may work for you, some may not. Take away what you will.\n\nIt was the summer of 2012. I had a summer internship in New York though I lived in Virginia at the time. I had a MacBook Pro that was 6 years old and really showing its age, so it was time to look for a replacement. Apple had recently released the retina MacBook Pros, the first generation of the product, and I decided this was the machine I wanted. Problem was they started at $2199, and for that you only got 8 GB RAM-- since it was non-upgradeable, I wanted 16 GB, which was another $200. I later decided to bump the processor from 2.3 GHz to 2.6 for another $100. I don't recall what sales tax in NYC was at the time, but it was higher than Virginia's which was 5%, so it would only make sense to buy back in VA after the internship ended. After all was said and done, a typical Virginia consumer would have gone to Apple.com and paid ($2199+200+100)*1.05 = $2623.95 for the configuration I wanted. Except I didn't want to spend that kind of money.\n\nSince this was the first generation of the product, there were none available used (at reasonable prices), so that was out of the question. Since I wanted a custom configuration, waiting for a sale on Amazon was also out of the question-- I would need to buy directly from Apple. So I hatched a plan.\n\nAs a student, I was eligible for a student discount. This amounted to $200 off the computer itself, $20 off the RAM upgrade, and $10 off the processor upgrade. This would get the price down to $2382.45 after tax. Woohoo!\n\nBut wait a minute: why pay tax? Apple does business in all 50 states, so I would be charged wherever I bought it. But not all states charge sales tax. Delaware is one such exception, and I would be passing through on my route back to VA. I looked it up and sure enough, there was exactly one Apple Store in Delaware, right off I-95 too! How convenient. Price is now $2269.\n\nBut there is one more thing. One thing the NYC Craigslist has an abundance of is gift cards. For some reason, they're harder to come across on the Washington DC Craigslist, so I took full advantage. I bought three Apple Store gift cards with the following balances\/prices paid\/percentages saved:\n\n* $342.38 for $300 (12.38%)\n\n* $1727 for $1450 (16.04%)\n\n* $500 for $400 (20%)\n\nBy buying these cards I saved $419.38, but the more important number is the percentage amount saved. If I can get a $1000 card for $900, that's great, but it's not as good as getting a $100 card for $85 (10% vs 15%). Most people try to sell their cards for 5-10% off, so you have to work to find deals like I did, but it's very, very worth it. I now had $2569.38 worth of cards, but I only needed $2269 and I only spent $2150! Even if I threw away the remaining balance after buying the computer I would still come out ahead. But obviously I wouldn't do that. The computer was now $1849.62.\n\nIt was at this point I hit a snag. Apple had only recently introduced the option to have a custom configuration shipped to a store, and since they were still dealing with a large volume of rMBP orders, they hadn't yet brought that option to the product line. Late August I went home, and the option still hadn't arrived, so I went home empty handed. The option finally appeared a few weeks later... about two weeks before the September 21 launch of the iPhone 5. Perfect! I was going to buy an iPhone 5 anyways, so driving to Delaware to save $113.45 laptop tax + $32.45 iPhone tax wasn't so bad. I placed my order, then on midnight of Sep 21 I drove to Delaware, waited in line, and got my prizes. I went with a friend who was also buying an iPhone, so not only was the line waiting more fun, but we split the gas.\n\nAnd that is how I saved $774.33 on a MacBook Pro.","266":"I'm short $5 to complete a purchase on Amazon.

(I am 20 years old and in college, with zero debt due to college fund)\n\nAnyway, I was browsing Craigslist and found a car that really piqued my interest. It seems to be in tip-top shape and is very cheap. I mean VERY cheap for what he is asking. Here are the specs of the car I gathered that are listed in the CL posting and email the person a couple times:\n\n1. 2005 Toyota Camry XLE\n2. 53,500 miles\n3. clean title\n4. automatic transmission\n5. never been in an accident\n6. always garage kept\n7.

The car is registered on Illinois, but don\u2019t worry the title is clear and we won\u2019t have any problems registering the car in your name.\n\n&gt;  The price on it is $2,000.

The car was sent to him, but when it reached the destination, the buyer was unable to pay for it, because he didn't got a loan. The car was sent back to me and remained at the shipping company until I was able to find another buyer.\n  \n&gt;I asked Amazon Payments to help me solve this issue. I will have it shipped with DAS Auto and I think I can have it delivered in 2-3 working days max. Don\u2019t worry about the shipping price, I will pay it, because I am seeding it to same area and I will only pay a quartet of the price. And this is not all, after you receive my car you will get a 5 days testing period, before you decide buy it.\n  \n&gt;To make this deal happen I must ask Amazon Payments to send you the terms and conditions of the Amazon Payments Program, but before I can do that I need your approval. So if you agree please give me your full name, address and contact number(s) so that Amazon Payments can register you as a potential buyer and sent you the terms and conditions.\n\n&gt;Please remember that at this moment you have no obligations what so ever, just read the Transaction Term and after that let me know if you are interested in doing this sort of transaction.\n  \n&gt;You can find pictures at this web address: [REDACTED]\nIf you\u2019re interested let me know, [REDACTED]\n\nI replied to him telling him I was still interested, but I will not submit any type of payment without seeing, test driving, checking out, etc.. the car in person. \n\nThanks for the help PF'ers!

Stay away from this seller. \"\n\nSo as you can see, I was a victim of \"rocks in a box\" scam and subsequently passed that stress onto about 15 customers. my FIRST customers, mind you. \n\nI'm completely devastated. I've already issued refunds for everyone and requested that Amazon dispose of the ones that are left in the warehouse. I don't know what to do from this point on.

The price is about $10 higher than what I sell it for.\n\n\n\nFurther research into this I find this Ebay account has 46,000+ active listings. I am guessing it's a bot\/multiple people finding items on amazon\/ebay for cheaper, and then reselling for a profit. \n\n\nMy question is should I be worried? My business name is the same as my product, but I did not trademark the name in any means.

People who will work hours a day on Mturk and Swagbucks  to get $20ish a day.  And props off to you, because I lack that kind of dedication.\n\nHowever, if you step back and think about it... There is so much dedication here... Why don't we think outside the box when it comes to making money?  We rely on these apps that fluctuate with earnings and such. There is no room to grow.  Think about all the reputable skills you may have, and the clear dedication and determination you possess.\n\nIf you go on Fiverr, there are people making thousands of dollars a year just posting fliers around their town, or doing stupid stuff.  They thought of a unique idea, and it worked well for them.  \n\nHow about trying your hand at a niche Amazon affiliate website?  You will learn so much through the process, and you may surprise yourself and make some money.  For this, I am not talking about they guy who spends 10 minutes a day on Swagbucks or something.  I mean the people who spend hours a day as their full time job.\n\nYou have potential, because you clearly want to, and love working online.  There is so much opportunity online, and I feel like we close ourselves off in these little rewards apps.  \n\nI am saying this because a little determination and research goes a long way now a days.  I am also saying this from experience.  My friends and I started a [company](http:\/\/www.tinlidco.com) in September, and since then we have made over $4,000 in revenue, and $2,000 in profit.  This is while we are students, working on it maybe 4-10 hours a week.  In the past 4 months, I have learned more about business and the ins and outs of it, than I have in my entire 19 years of schooling.  I have also had more fun.  It is something you can take pride in, and you have the potential to make ALOT of money!  \n\nSo what does it cost?  Well, the internet is free.  Do alot of research on your idea.  Domain names and hosting costs a few bucks a month.  And there you go.  That is all you need to start making money.\n\nSorry for the rant-ish post, but I just wanted to try and spread a little inspiration!

They bought us everything we asked for that they possibly could, even if it meant going without something themselves.

Low cost items are hit really hard on that fixed cost, so you might be able to sell the bundles at a lower unit cost, and still make more money if they are bundled in larger lots.

Someone literally has to stay up into weee hours to Skype over business issues. But really, Chinese labour cost is not as low as it used to be, so the price advantage is not of a key winning point for doing business with Chinese. Many Taiwanese manufacturers migrated over to China to do business, and mainland Chinese in turn copied the process and start to improve their product qualities, which in term means they want to sell their products with higher price and are very reluctant to negotiate pricing deals. That's the reality today for import export business.\n\nNow if you are talking about retail businesses, and why companies like eBay or Amazon can't take off as fast as companies like Alibaba. Well, I think it really has to do with culture\/gov politics as well as the fact that Chinese high officials are far more invested in their own domestic companies than foreign ones, thus, giving their own domestic companies an edge over foreign entities. Age ago, the issue would be because Chinese had no concept of credit card system. Now a day, with AliPay and alternative payment system, this is not an issue anymore, but remains a headwind to companies like MasterCard and Visa.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, the biggest issue doing business with Chinese, especially doing business in China, is the lack of laws. The laws in China is not well rounded or robust like here in US. People in the legal system can be bribed one way or another to lean one direction without exactly following out the laws. If your business is situated in a small village, and issue is even worse, as the village is literally a giant web of family-related members, and many of them are in the position of following the law one direction or another. Until the law is truly the land of the law, doing business in China is just as dangerous and risky as early days of wild wild west. In the wild west, we had gun duel to settle issues.. in China, it is you against the imprisonment and false accusations that can keep you locked away in China with key thrown away. Don't think that just because you are an US citizen, things would all work out. It doesn't.","390":"I went to go look at laptops at radioshack, and they had a bunch of boxes with pictures of the laptops on them.

The cafe side of Borderlands, for example, should have no difficulty at all.  Viability is simply a matter of increasing prices.  And, since all the other cafes in the city will be under the same pressure, all the prices will float upwards.  But books are a special case because the price is set by the publisher and printed on the book.  Furthermore, for years part of the challenge for brick-and-mortar bookstores is that companies like Amazon.com have made it difficult to get people to pay retail prices.  So it is inconceivable to adjust our prices upwards to cover increased wages.\n\n&gt; The change in minimum wage will mean our payroll will increase roughly 39%.  That increase will in turn bring up our total operating expenses by 18%.  To make up for that expense, we would need to increase our sales by a minimum of 20%.

After a year or two, that's a really nice family vacation that costs you not much more than the tax.\n\nWhat people who criticize credit cards often forget is that, even with paying off the balance in full every month, credit cards are very profitable based on merchant fees.  In fact, pay in full accounts (non-revolving) are probably more profitable, because their is very little risk.  If I charge $4k a month through my AMEX, and pay it in full every month, they still make a lot of money for little risk.  They charge merchants in the ball park of 4% to accept AMEX.  That's a $160 a month for greasing the process.  Over the course of a year, that's almost $2k in revenue with just a little bit of risk.  Add in an annual fee in the ballpark of $100, and you have a nice business model.  They can give you back some of that to keep you happy and to build loyalty (which is valuable), and to increase your overall profitability.\n\nSince you are a profitable customer, you can start getting treated really well.  AMEX for example (and not exclusively - lots of prime cards have great service) does a really nice job if you have a charge dispute, plus they offer some extra protection on some purchases.  Additionally, there are really nice reporting (AMEX has a really nice end of year report, and if you basically exclusively use them for your purchases, it will give you a great handle on your spending) tools.\n\nSo basically, if you can handle it, and you have the right type of spending profile, you can be given incentives for doing stuff that you might do anyways.  For the first year I traveled for work, I paid the same amount of money, but charged my travel to a debit card.   After the next two years, I earned enough rewards to book some free round trip tickets, and offset the cost of a nice hotel.   There are reward programs for hundreds of different spending and demographic profiles.  You know you want to buy a new truck in a few years?  Switch all your spending to a GM branded credit card, and apply your rewards towards the price of a new GM vehicle.  Fly a lot?  Get a US Air VISA.  Spend lots of money at Amazon?  Get a card that offers free Prime.  ","436":"I wouldn't sell it on Amazon. I have sold them on ebay.","437":"Well, I earned this first code by doing offers and I got it as Amazon.ES in an accident.

You could also pick up a Blue Cash Everyday or a Sallie Mae MasterCard to supplement that if you expect to go over the $6k annual cap. Sallie Mae will also give you better cash back on gas.\n\nIf you're willing to juggle cards to avoid the BCP annual fee, you could get 2 Sallie Maes. That would net you $10-15 assuming you spend $6-6.5k a year on groceries.\n\nEDIT: Also be aware that BCP will not give you the grocery rate at stores like Walmart, Target, Costco, Sam's, etc. The other benefit to Sallie Mae is that you get 5% at bookstores, including Amazon.\n\nEDIT 2: I forgot about the signup bonus on BCP, which makes it a more attractive choice.","444":"Amazon charges through the nose, no way netflix pays that much. \nIt's probably less than 1$ per TB which would work out to 24 mil$ and probably much less.","445":"I can do $40 for a one year membership (currently that price on Amazon)","446":"My guess: \n\n* Revenues up HUGE around $500MM, 40% vs. 3Q14, 100% QoQ\n* No profit\n* Lots of great engagement\n* New products upcoming look great\n* 0% US MAU growth\n* 7% Intl MAU growth\n* Huge drop ~10% in US MAU timeline views\n* **Up 5% tomorrow and runs to the 50 dollar level again**\n\nPersonally, I think Twitter is dying and is monetizing in many of the wrong places.

Play money is currently always $40\/paycheck, and splurge is whatever will take the leftover down to the nearest hundred: after expenses, I usually have something like $356.62 leftover, so $56.62 goes towards splurge. The leftover hundreds amount goes toward something big: emergency fund, extra payment on the student loans, or saving up for a car or furniture for a bigger apartment.\n\nAnd then I'm down to $0, but not really. I have a couple thousand in my checking account, going toward rent payments or groceries. I know exactly how much of that I can play with, because I gave myself permission to play with it.

So, inevitably, we get an earful about \"Jobs creating\/destroying trade deals!\" in the run-up to any negotiation.  \n\nStrangely, we don't see nearly as much \"Price reduction!\" rhetoric, which is where the real appeal of trade deals lays.  Outsourcing manufacturing to Mexico or China doesn't benefit American factory workers in the slightest.  But it does allow retail shoppers to buy a widget for a tenth of it's historical retail price.  Walmart's \"Low low prices!\" are, at their root, the result of manufacturer outsourcing.\n\nIt's strange, because with all the rhetoric about economy-destroying unions and job-killing minimum wages, no one seems ready to recognize that one man's cost-savings equals another man's income reduction.  Trade deals are, at the end of the day, a method for side-stepping domestic labor contracts and labor laws.  You'd think \"imports cost less money!\" would be the rallying cry of the trade deal advocates.

Anybody can knit scarves, meaning that even though scarves have a massive market, you're also competing with a lot of people, especially when selling at a low barrier-to-entry marketplace such as Etsy. And that includes people from third world countries who are happy to work for $1 per hour, which I'm assuming you won't be.\n\nBut come up with something original (note that original doesn't have to be difficult) and you'll laugh.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 for instance concentrates on \"upcycled\" things and knits\/sells things like planters with a knitted outside and the inside being a re-used plastic bottle, but she also does things like coasters, etc.\n\n2) Make sure to establish a brand outside of Etsy. Even a simple site, coupled with a Twitter account, Pinterest account and Facebook account will go a long way. People mistakenly assume that getting your products up on Etsy (or a similar platform) will lead to quick sales, whereas in reality it doesn't. You still have to gather your own audience and market your brand.\n\n3) Make sure to exceed your customers' expectations by providing quality products, delivering early, using nice packaging (even if it means you'll have to order it beforehand in bulk), and perhaps even add a small gift or a hand-written card to each order. Customer feedback goes a LONG way on Etsy so it's incredibly important to make everything about your customer experience absolutely top notch!\n\nAnd as always - Google's your friend! Etsy is so immensely popular that there's a lot of good information about it out there. There are also some good books on Amazon on running a handicraft business, which I'd recommend you to take a look at.\n\nGood luck with your business!","528":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

I also bring in sugar and cream I keep in my fridge. YMMV on that one but I need sugar\/cream in my tea or coffee.\n\nI have my coffee pot set to auto, which is filled before I leave for work, so whenever I wake up weekdays it's hot n' ready for me. I even have a mug station set up next to my coffee pot so no brain power is required. I usually get about 2 cups in me before I'm even dressed because I lounge before work but I know a lot of people get up, hit the shower and march off to the office like a robot. Me?

Thrift stores are your friend or Amazon. Whatever you decide.\n\nFINALLY: I have munchies at work. I restock after weekends. Cans of soup, granola bars in boxes, fruit snacks, actual fruit like apples (just had 1), trail mix (I make my own), chips and so on. They all keep well. Usually I grab my apple on the way out the door with my full travel mug of coffee. My trail mix is in a glass jar. I keep things that will stay in my drawer without attracting bugs\/mice. I also have a plastic storage sandwich keeper that I'll bring in a PBJ in when I need to use up a loaf of bread or when soup gets dull.\n\nVery few people in my office go to lunch but I've found keeping to my desk during lunch helps me avoid catty office drama\/gossip.","545":"Sallie Mae Rewards credit card pays 5% on up to first $750 of Amazon purchase monthly because Amazon is considered a \"Bookstore\" still by the card.

At the merchant (e.g., Target), this info is passed through their processing system (e.g., Verifone) to the system's clearance negotiation system, usually referred to as an 'acquirer'. From there, the acquirer contacts your card issuer (e.g., MasterCard), who thereafter contacts your bank (e.g., UI Community Credit Union) to approve or deny the charge. Then the approval\/denial is propagated back in the opposite direction to the merchant. \n\nThis can happen in a batch at the end of the day, or immediately. Guess how all these data transactions occur? Over the internet and\/or PSTN. Not some special bankers internet. Not some special Iowa Credit Union direct link.

I'm the Director of Ops at GR, so if you have any questions about the below (or anything else) please don't hesitate to let me know. \n\n&gt;It was suggested that I use GeoRiot, which I signed up for but it looks like they charge a 15% commission.\n\nWe don't actually take 15% of commissions. In fact, we take zero percent of your commissions. The way our service works is that we affiliate 15% of clicks from your international countries with our own parameter instead of yours, and get paid through the affiliate program just like you. We never touch the clicks from users in your local country, and we don't take any clicks if you get less than 100 per day. Our mantra is we only make money if we help you make more than you were without using us. \n\nIt's sort of a confusing model, but if you want more details [here's](www.georiot.com\/our-solution\/pay-with-clicks) our page that explains how \"Click Share\" works. \n\n&gt;if you want to route say a French visitor to Amazon France, don't you need a separate affiliate account with Amazon France to get the proper link?\n\nActually, you do need to sign up for the different country's affiliate programs because [Amazon's affiliate program is country specific](https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\/gp\/associates\/help\/t22\/a13). However, once you've signed up (it's free for all countries), you add all of your affiliate parameters to our dashboard and we will automatically add the correct country's ID for each click to ensure you get credit for every sale (except the 15% of international clicks we take to keep our business running). \n\n&gt;But I don't think it's just a question of changing the amazon.com link to amazon.fr\n\nIt's not. A large majority of products have different ASINs (unique identifiers) per storefront, so a lot of times just switching out the ASIN will give your users error messages instead of the product you're wanting to show them. (Don't worry - we do a hell of a lot more than just switch out the Amazon country's storefront). \n\n&gt;Also, how does GeoRiot deal with items that are available on one amazon site but not another?\n\nWithout getting too sales-speaky, we have an algorithm that has five steps to ensure people get to the right item in the right storefront. The first step is checking the ASIN in the clicker's local storefront. If the ASIN doesn't bring back the exact item, we run some API queries based on the metadata of the original product to see if we can find the new ASIN. If the metadata doesn't bring back any results, we then fall to an \"Amazon Search\" for the product name.

We also factor in things like is that product in stock, or is it an \"import\" (I.E. An item \"imported\" from the US actually costs a ton more because it had to be imported.

We make meals in a jar - dry ingredients and spices to which we add canned mea and very hot water for a meal.  See the book:  Meals in a Jar availalble on Amazon.    There are about 30 recipes and techniuques for making in a jar or a mylar bag.   These jar meals last over a year in the pantry using your own food you dehydrarte and combine.      Much cheaper to make at home than to buy in a box at the grocery store.   The main cash outlay is in the bags or the jars.   I had to buy a jar sealer kit for the food vacuum machine.\nDidn't cost much and my fmily is happy to just grab a jar and make hot water for hte meal - each jar makes up a soup to feed three people very well.   I even processed my own 'bisquit\" mix and each bag of 'bisquit\" makes a dozen bisquits.   One can even make pancakes out of this mix.   Nothing like prepping to teach one how to save money.  There are a hell of a lot of prepping, canning and food storage videos on YouTube.   If you have a year long pantry you save so much at he grocery store.      I've even learned how o make yogurt out of dried milk and my sons both love my homemade  fruit roll ups made in the dehydrator.

Eat cheap lunches while at work.  This can be at small restaurants\/cafeterias near your work.\n\n2. Eat Korean food.  Any \"foreign\" food, even if it is a simple meal, will be 2-3 times more expensive.  This goes for buying food at the supermarket also.\n\n3. If you go out to the different fun\/drinking areas, try to make it home on the subway before it closes.  It isn't just saving money on the taxi fare, but also the 2-3 more places you will go that night to spend money.  That being said, don't short change yourself on fun!\n\n4. When you do travel, find cheap accommodations.  Cheap places to stay are everywhere- just figure out how to find them or have a Korean co-worker make a reservation for you and have them write down the address for you.  No need to stay at a fancy hotel.  You can also just travel to a new place and find accommodations once you are there- but I would recommend doing this by dinner time, as checking in later in the night can get unpleasant.\n\nYou can tell that I spend most of my money on food.\n\nA tip about buying electronics (as you mentioned above):\nIf you are moving to\/around Seoul, most people will recommend going to the \"Yongsan Electronics Market\".  If you are looking for highly specialized computer parts, this is the place to go.  You will not find a deal there, however, if you plan on buying a normal laptop\/computer\/Ipod\/etc.  Perhaps this was true in the past- perhaps it is just a myth- but lots of people will tell you to go there.  The way to get a deal is to have a Korean friend\/co-worker surf an online only store in [\"Gmarket\"](http:\/\/gmarket.co.kr\/).  You have to search in Korean, because there will not be the same deals if you search in English.  It is kinda like the Korean equivalent of \"Amazon.com\"  Search any of the independent sellers there;  I used different ones based on what I was buying.  These are definitely the cheapest places to shop.\n\nWhen I was there, I bought 3 computers.  One from Yongsan crapped out on me pretty quickly, one was stolen (boo), and one was awesome for cheap!  I got the great one off a seller in Gmarket.  The sellers my friend found for me refurbished gaming computers that PC Cafes (PC Bang in Korean) get rid of so they can buy newer models for their customers.  Highly recommended.\n\n\n","659":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.

Because in the customers mind (assuming its a product that doesn't have many technical parts) I don't think they are going to really care how its made  (unless its one of those people who will boast about having the 'first' 3D made coffee mug or something) but rather if its going to solve their problem and whether your price compares to the same product on eBay or Amazon. \n\nAlso as 3D printers become more advanced and cheaper, the market will be flooded with them (and there will be a lot of websites making useful things for home etc.).  So I would try and think more about how you will be different to competitors as a long term strategy. Maybe the designers submitting unique and cool ideas is the key? \n\nAlso assuming you do start this venture and are successful initially, keep in mind as technology progresses you will need to constantly upgrade your 3D printers to keep ahead.  \n\n","675":"Interesting read. \n\nTitle is a little overblown.

They spend every penny they earn right back into the company, instead of saving. The Rockefellers did this in the late 1800s, famously telling their business partners and wives not to live lavishly. This helped them buy out many Oil wells that failed during the depression of the 1880s, and even removed their reliance from the banking system of getting loans for expansion (of course they had to be broken up by the government later, as they practically had a monopoly, but that is of other issue). Amazon wants to be big, and Amazon wants to be the leader of online purchases. They already lead, however the internet markets have been fickle in the past, and is still not a guarantee.  They want to be the Wal-Mart of online shopping.","741":"&gt;Format your post title like this: [H] (what you're offering) [W] (what you're looking for).

Everyone preaches to wait it out and your items will then start to sell, but it's hard to wait when so many people keep coming in and dropping the prices on everything. Then they panic and drop them so low no one makes money. I've seen a *bunch* of books in FBA priced under 4.00 and they stay there because these noobs think they have to have a lower price than the MF people. They don't take into consideration that the MF price is +shipping, they just see 3.98 and think, damn, gotta lower my price. Then the next newbie comes along and the cycle repeats.

First off organic doesn't really mean what most people think it means. You are paying money for a label that is not very well controlled.  If you really want farm fresh natural ingredients consider finding a local coop or farmer's market. You'll find produce and sometimes meat at reasonable prices (especially if you go towards the end of the day. sellers will do steep discounts to not have to take all the product back home).\nNext it seems like you two need to sit down and consider what is important for your dietary needs. I know he has special requirements for food and those can be met, but that means holding back in other places. Instead of getting feta try making a block of cheese (a gallon of milk on a stove until it is simmering and add in a cup of lemon juice or white vinegar. Let it sit for about 30 minutes and then strain through a cheesecloth. I like to add a pinch of salt but it isn't really needed. You can do all kinds of things with such a basic cheese. It crumbles well and tastes pretty awesome whether cooked in a sauce or dipped in olive oil and herbs with some bread. \n\nNext you say you eat out once or twice a week, change that to once or twice a month. That will give you more leeway in your budget for those things he wants to add to the list. I know it can be hard to do, but really what is more important to you eating out or being achieve a little more leeway for your groceries. I've found that we can eat better and healthier meals at home that we enjoy more than when we go out for far less money.  The other night we made gorgeous rib eyes with mushrooms, onions and a sweet potato for what we spent for one of us to eat a smaller steak at outback last year. We both LOVe to cook though so it's never a chore for us. We split it about half and half and are always experimenting and trying new things together.\n\nBuy things in bulk when possible. I don't know where you live but Walmart will do free shipping on orders over $50. Find the dry foods (rice and grains) and get them delivered to you. Amazon also has decent prices on grains\n\nDo you have a Costco near you? Go you can explore without a card to see if the things you buy regularly would be a better deal for you. Also if you have a store like Aldi's it's worth stopping in. The selection isn't always the same but you can get some good stuff and their store brand is every bit as good as name brand.\n\nThat's another thing, make sure you are buying what is better value. Sometimes that means store brand sometimes that means name brand. Usually store brand is the same as the name brand just repackaged take advantage of that. \n\nIt's fine to make a menu and decide one that that what was planned isn't what you are in the mood for. Jump ahead to the next day. Keep your pantry stocked of staples like pasta and have a day of making your own sauces to freeze. That way on those days you can throw together a good, cheap and healthy meal without another trip to the store. \n\nSet a separate budget for snacks and tell him how much he has to spend on those extras. If it isn't on your needed list it comes out of that snack budget. If he wants to spend it all on juice let him but he only gets what is budgeted for. That way he is being held accountable without you having to nag him about it. If that means having a second cart or basket to divide it, that's fine. When we go to the store we plan on $20 for \"extras\" if we wants chips and soda that's fine if we want extra cheeses that we wouldn't normally account for fine, if we want some special new pastry or dessert that's fine, but it has to be $20 or under total for those extras. It also helps us to use the calculator on our phones while shopping. That way we know exactly how much we are spending and don't go over budget. \n\n\nThat being said we both have what we call our allowance money. We have a combined account but we each set aside a specific amount of money for each month. We get the same amount and what we chose to do with it is our own business. If we spend it all that's fine, if we save it month to month it can be used for something big and the other person can't argue with how that money is being spent. \n\nI know this is long, but I hope even a little bit of it helped give you some ideas on how to conquer this issue.

The other consumers out there recognize that shipping is just a part of life and will accept the charges so long as they are reasonable.","786":"I agree with you completely. But if you'll allow me to play devil's advocate, here are the problems with that:\n\n1\\. People can lie. It's in both parties' best interest to say that a $25 trade was worth $40, $75, or $100. Makes them both look good. Now, we could verify trade values, and ban anyone who can't prove the amount of the trade, but that would be a crapload of work for little payoff. To be fair, they could lie right now anyway, but most people don't, and if we think they are lying, we already ask for proof. The frequency would just go way up.\n\n2\\. People want privacy, and admittedly with good reason. We do say that rates are a matter for buyers and sellers, so if they don't want to share that, that's their prerogative. To this, I would say that rates don't need to be included, just the value of the higher item in the trade. For example, confirm it as \"ITEMS TRADED: Google Wallet vs. Amazon ($50).\"\n\n3\\. People simply might not follow this rule and leave amounts out of it, and it will be a pain in the butt to catch haha.\n\nI'm not at all trying to shoot down the idea, and like I said, I'm really just playing devil's advocate here. I'd love to make it a requirement, but those are the three biggest obstacles we came up with to making this happen.","787":"Yeah, and that's a fair concern. As a moderator, I'd much rather require people post the amount of the trade value. Not necessarily showing the rate (ex. $25 Amazon for $30 Target) but maybe just the value of the higher card (ex. Amazon for Target ($30)), without even specifying which one was worth $30.","788":"If you've been reading my other comments, you'll notice that I tend to play devil's advocate quite a bit. Now, I agree with you that that's a great idea, but if you'll allow me to play devil's advocate here, here's the problem with that requirement.\n\n&gt;Format your post title like this: [H] (what you're offering) [W] (what you're looking for). **More detail (card value, country, rates, etc.) is better, but not required.** Any other information (trading rep, general comments) in a post title is not allowed and belongs in the post text. If offering Amazon, you must post specifically Gift Card\/GC or Balance.\n\nThat's the current rule as it stands. We could rephrase it a bit and say something like \"if you **can** specify the country, card value, rates, etc. you **must**.\" But, there is incentive to not specifying your rate. If you have an Amazon gift card worth $25 and you were hoping to get $21 for it, you might get an offer for $22 if you don't tell people you only want $21. Now, you might also get an offer for $20, so it is a double-edged sword, but I can see the reasoning in being intentionally vague on rates. I just prefer to specify, personally.","789":"for personal consumption? i highly doubt it. but if you're a business who buys lots of expensive equipment\/machinery from out of state, then you really should report this stuff, or you will not be happy if you're ever audited. 6% on $2k is $120. 6% on say, $500k, is $30k. huge difference.\n\ni'm pretty sure thats why states place the onus on merchants to begin with, rather than collecting sales tax directly from consumers. if you remember a few years ago, states started cracking down on internet merchants-- prior to that, sellers like Amazon were able to sell to most US citizens without charging sales tax.","790":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/resellprofits\/comments\/16wddj\/thoughts_on_using_amazon_fba\/\n\n&gt; Amazon FBA should be used primarily for high priced or rare items.

So the middleman would not be able to do anything to make the trade safer.\n\nEven if you are the one with the card and you know that it is valid, using a middleman is not a smart move here on GCX.

","841":"Are these non-reloadable debit cards like the ones that you receive from mail-in-rebates?\n\nYou can buy Amazon gift cards in any amount.","842":"Just finished looking in one that is closing. Scanned everything that wasn't radioshack brand and found two things worth selling. Most stuff is 30% off and not even close to Amazon prices. ","843":"Right now you can get a $100 Amazon gift card for signing up for Discover It through their site, which is the highest I've seen - so if you don't have It yet, I'd go for that one now and wait for the Freedom to be $200.","844":"Agreed, Amazon marketplace buyers can be the worst of the worst with buyer's remorse and bullshit return claims","845":"Do some volunteering. And, whether in business or job hunting, find your niche. Find a job that you think you might enjoy, talk with people doing that job and then invest time in working for free and learning a bit more about it. There are plenty of resources online...and they are free. \n\nAmazon affiliates? It's just my opinion, but if you want to start a business, think of something with some meanings...hit the library and read, read, read and act on what you learn. One of the best way you can invest spare time!\n\nOh, last but not least: check out Ryan Holiday and Charlie Hoehn, they've got plenty of useful advice on how to get a job you like.","846":"Is there a reason you don't buy Amazon Balance? Unless you sell the codes you buy from here? ","847":"I have $10 Amazon if you want to trade.","848":"My advice?\n\nCall Amazon and beg them to let you purchase new EL-2169BL calculators and ship next-day air to the 15 buyers. \n\n","849":"Would be risky since you can't verify the balance on an Amazon Gift Card until you redeem it.","850":"It's worse on FBA. At least on eBay there are certain rules and ways around returns. Not Amazon. The customer doesn't want it. That's fine just return it beat up and dirty and used for 3 months and we will refund your money ","851":"I noticed this on the woocommerce plugin page and was wondering how you managed to mitigate this risk?\n\n&gt; IMPORTANT \u2013 THIS PLUGIN IS JUST A TOOL TO HELP YOU DEVELOP A WORDPRESS \/ WOOCOMMERCE WEBSITE. DO NOT MAKE MINI AMAZON WEBSITES, BECAUSE AMAZON WILL CLOSE YOUR AFFILIATE ACCOUNT IF YOU ONLY IMPORT AMAZON PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING OTHER CONTENT ON YOUR WEBSITE (OTHER PRODUCTS, POSTS, REVIEWS AND SO ON)\n\nDid you find products from other sites? or did your personal blog and site only reviews cover it? Great looking site btw!","852":"The Fed is expected to raise interest rates sometime later this year, which would push USD even higher.\n\nIf you want to avoid international transaction fees, then get one of the chase.ca credit cards (eg Amazon.ca, etc.) ","853":"I'm missing an Amazon GC from Softcard.  They laid off most of their staff recently, so trying to get it resolved is hard.","854":"Well you guys probably know my stance on the Reddit account age.\n\nOld accounts can be easily acquired. Not to mention many scammers can just keep a running list of accounts going \u2014 meaning they make 5 new accounts everyday and a few months later they will have hundreds of accounts of relatively decent age.\n\n\nI think the actual trades are what matters most.\n\nSo here is a thought \u2014\u00a0a sort of compromise \u2014 though it does increase the requirement for the other flairs too. But I think the Confirmed Flair is the one that most scammers try to acquire. So making that harder is kind of the need of the hour.\n\nTo get a Confirmed Trader Flair:\n\n1) Must have 25 trades with Confirmed or above.\n\n2) These 25 Trades must have the dollar value of one part of the trade listed. Meaning you can write something like $50 Amazon Vs PayPal.\n\n___________\nThe Experienced Flair requirement can just be bumped up to 60 trades to adjust for the change in the confirmed one.\n\n","855":"\nYour submission has been automatically removed because the **title does not follow the posting format for trading Amazon.**\n\n * If offering Amazon gift cards, you must state it in your title as \"Amazon GC(s)\", \"Amazon Gift Card(s)\", or \"Amazon Code(s)\".\n\n * Trying to circumvent the bot using \"Amazon GC Balance\" in the title is a bannable offence.
